This week, the House Ways and Means Committee released and marked up its portion of the budget reconciliation bill. This is the committee we’ve been watching — and lobbying — most closely this spring to protect clean energy tax credits from repeal.

The worst outcome from this committee would have been outright repeal of all the clean energy tax credits from the Inflation Reduction Act. We’re glad to say that the committee’s text does NOT outright repeal the clean energy tax credits.

But, unfortunately, that’s pretty much all we’re glad about. The Ways and Means Committee proposed significant changes to the clean energy tax credits that would be dismal for climate and clean energy.

These changes include things like:

Phasing out tax credits for production and investments in clean electricity and existing nuclear power from 2029 to 2032. The new clean power plants, which take years to permit and build, would have to be operational by those dates to qualify for the tax credits.

Ending tax credits for home energy efficiency and heat pumps by the end of this year

Ending the 30% tax credit for rooftop solar and batteries by the end of this year

…and much more, including many tax credits related to electric vehicles

See more details about all the changes from CCL Research Manager Dana Nuccitelli in CCL Community’s forums here.

According to an early Rhodium analysis, the committee’s proposed changes would “raise energy costs for American households by as much as 7% in 2035, stifle energy technology innovation, increase pollution, and could put a meaningful portion of half a trillion dollars of new manufacturing, industrial, and clean electricity investments across the country at risk.”

So, to be clear, CCL doesn’t endorse this legislation, and we won’t encourage members of Congress to vote for it.

But we’ve seen that our dedicated, defensive advocacy helped dodge the bullet of outright repeal. We’ve seen new allies speak up during this fight. Some Senate Republicans have already said that the Ways and Means Committee went too far in slashing the clean energy tax credits — and these are Senators who we lobbied on the tax credits earlier this year.

We can continue to build on that support. Our continued advocacy could further blunt the potential damage from this legislation. So we will double down on our defense as the budget reconciliation process moves forward from here.

Let’s take a stand before the full House vote

After an “hours-long, overnight meeting that featured heated debate,” according to The Hill, the Ways and Means Committee passed their portion of the budget with the above changes.

But it’s important to understand that the budget reconciliation process is far from over.

Other House committees have been releasing their own portions of the budget reconciliation bill and holding votes. Some have passed already, like the portions from the House Natural Resources Committee and the House Energy and Commerce Committee.

(Note that several of these other committees will affect other portions of the Inflation Reduction Act, too. We’ve focused primarily on defending the clean energy tax credits because we felt our grassroots volunteers could make the most impact and because those tax credits delivered the most significant emissions reductions of any climate measures in the IRA.)

All together, the portions passed by the committees will combine to form one big budget reconciliation bill that will head to the House floor for a vote. A House vote is not yet scheduled for the full reconciliation bill, but Republican Party leadership has suggested they are aiming to hold this vote by Memorial Day.

So, with potentially less than two weeks between now and the full House vote — this is our next moment in the process to make a stand for the clean energy tax credits.

How this could all play out

As we continue our push to preserve the clean energy tax credits, there are two main ways this could play out. Let’s take a look at each one.

Scenario 1: More support leads to lighter cuts

As negotiations progress, we could see a growing group of Republicans treat the IRA clean energy tax credits as one of their top priorities and be willing to go to bat for them. This is the scenario we’re working to make happen.

We’ve already seen many Republican voices speak up in letters in support of the tax credits — 21 House Republicans in one letter, 4 Senate Republicans, another group of 26 House Republicans, and so on. Our advocacy can continue to build on this support, potentially leading to amendments in the full House bill or to a Senate version that does not cut the tax credits so drastically.

Another possibility, is that if enough lawmakers are feeling pressure not to support this legislation (whether because of the clean energy tax credits, or Medicaid cuts, etc.), there may not be enough votes to pass the reconciliation bill at all or this process may drag on for months as they work to find a package that has enough support to pass.

If the reconciliation effort falls apart and we get to the end of the year with no deal, there would likely be a push for a bipartisan tax extenders package. It is almost guaranteed that any bipartisan package on the clean energy tax credits would be better than the current reconciliation proposals but we would remain engaged and advocating for their preservation.

Scenario 2: The cuts to the clean energy tax credits don’t change, or Republicans seek even deeper cuts.

It’s possible that lawmakers will continue to stick by these deep cuts to the clean energy tax credits. They could pass the full House bill with these deep cuts as is, and the Senate could also pass similarly deep cuts. That’s not what we want to see.

The clean energy tax credits could be vulnerable to even further cuts as the process continues to unfold.

That’s because the Republican Party has extremely slim majorities in both the House and the Senate. To pass a budget reconciliation bill, they need essentially every Republican to vote for it. So, Republicans will be looking hard to find enough spending cuts they can all agree on, and they could come back to the clean energy tax credits to find those cuts.

That’s why our advocacy remains vital. We need to make sure that lawmakers can’t ignore the nationwide support for the clean energy tax credits, so at the very least, they don’t try to cut them even more than they are trying to right now.

Make your voice heard now

We’ve set up a new action tool for you to contact Republicans in both the House and the Senate in this key period before the House vote and as the Senate begins to discuss changes they want to see to the House bill.

For Republicans in the House, we are suggesting amendments that we would like to see before the full House votes on the complete budget reconciliation package. These amendments would prevent the worst cuts proposed to the clean energy tax credits, leading to a better outcome than the current version.

Specifically, we’re asking for things like striking the repeals of tax credit transferability for clean energy tax credits, since transferability makes tax credits more efficient, and preserving the home efficiency tax credits that so many homeowners have benefitted from.

For Republicans in the Senate, we are starting with a more general message, encouraging them to work with the Senate Finance Committee to protect all of the clean energy tax credits in their version of the bill.

Don’t forget: for something to actually become law, everything needs to happen on the Senate side, too — committee votes and then passage by the full Senate. Ultimately, the House and Senate would have to agree on and pass the same version of the bill for it to go to the president to be signed into law.

Bloomberg News

(TNS)

House Republicans released their first stab at a bill to extend President Donald Trump’s tax cuts, which would help pay for them by overhauling much of President Joe Biden’s landmark climate law.

The draft framework put out Monday by the Ways and Means Committee takes aim at billions of dollars of incentives in the Inflation Reduction Act, including tax credits for electric vehicles and solar and wind projects—subsidies Trump has derided as part of a “green new scam.”

Several segments of clean energy stand to lose out under the framework, which is an early blueprint and will likely see revisions during the legislative process. Electric vehicle credits would end after next year. A home clean energy credit would terminate after this year, making rooftop-solar systems more expensive for consumers who want to buy them.

But segments would fare far better than had been feared in the weeks leading up to the release of the proposal. Tax credits for making solar panels or batteries in the U.S. would, for example, be phased out just a year earlier than scheduled. The draft bill takes more of a “scalpel than a sledgehammer” to Biden’s law, said analysts with Jefferies.

Still, it’s mostly bad news for the U.S. clean energy sector and for efforts to reduce the nation’s climate emissions, which the IRA was estimated to cut by 43% to 48% below 2005 levels over the next decade, according to one analysis.

The overhaul would raise energy costs for U.S. households by as much as 7% in 2035, according to a preliminary analysis by the Rhodium Group. The plan would save the government more than $560 billion on energy tax credits over 10 years, according to an official nonpartisan congressional estimate.

The House proposal, of course, is far from final—and is already facing pushback from some Republicans in the Senate.

The plan “needs refinement,” said Thom Tillis of North Carolina. He serves on the Senate’s tax writing committee and was one of four Republicans to sign a letter last month vowing to defend the IRA’s energy tax credits. “It needs more transitions. It’s not quite what we would author out here.”

Here’s who loses big, and not quite so big, under the House proposal.

Big losers

EV makers and buyers

Tesla Inc., General Motors Co. and other electric vehicle makers and their customers stand to be among the biggest losers. Biden’s climate law extended a lucrative tax credit of up to $7,500 for the purchase of an EV and also expanded the credit to allow used and commercial electric vehicles to qualify. The Republican tax plan would eliminate the consumer vehicle credit by the end of next year. Only carmakers that have sold fewer than 200,000 EVs by the end of this year would would be eligible to receive it in 2026. The GOP proposal also would end credits for used and commercial electric vehicles. The repeal of all three credits would result in more than $190 billion in savings for the government over 10 years, according to the congressional estimate.

Solar-shopping homeowners

Homeowners who want to buy solar panels and other clean energy systems for their homes would lose a popular 30% tax credit at year’s end under the proposal. The move, if it becomes law, would be a blow for those who want to invest in producing their own clean energy as a hedge against rising utility bills and power outages. The tax change would also hurt solar-equipment makers such as Enphase Energy Inc. and SolarEdge Technologies Inc. The move would save the government $77 billion over 10 years, according to the estimate.

Nuclear power sector

The plan would phase out a tax credit for the production of nuclear power and completely end it starting in 2032. Proponents of nuclear say that since no new projects are expected to come online by then, operators of future plants and developers of small modular reactors likely won’t get access to the credit. A number of technology giants are counting on new nuclear plants to offer carbon-free power for their data centers to run energy-intensive artificial intelligence applications.

Hydrogen producers

A tax credit for hydrogen production, which provides as much as $3 per kilogram, is set to be eliminated starting in 2026. The credit was designed to spur a domestic industry for the clean-burning fuel, which is seen as a critical for decarbonizing steel, cement and heavy transportation. Its repeal would represent a blow to producers such as Plug Power Inc., as well as for companies including Exxon Mobil Corp. and others that had been lobbying to have the credit tweaked so hydrogen made using natural gas could take full advantage of it.

Not-so-big losers

Utility-scale renewables

The Republican plan phases out and and puts new restrictions on a pair of investment and production tax credits for wind, solar and other clean electricity production. Both credits would start to phase down for projects placed in service starting in 2029, and would completely end for any projects after 2031. In addition, the Republican bill wouldn’t allow projects that use materials from foreign adversaries such as China and Russia. And the transferability of tax credits would also be pinched, which utilities developing renewables say would result in higher customer bills.

But the news for solar and wind was better than expected, since many investors had anticipated a swifter phase-out. JPMorgan analysts said the GOP plan “aligns with, or exceeds, the more bullish end of investor expectations.” Shares of First Solar Inc., the biggest U.S. solar manufacturer, climbed on Monday.

All in all, the changes are estimated to prevent more than $182 billion in government spending over 10 years, with nearly $155 billion of that coming from the investment tax credit alone.

Carbon capture and storage

A tax credit that provides as much as $85 a ton for the storage of carbon dioxide survives in the GOP plan. But the Republican proposal places new restrictions on it, disallowing the credit for projects that are owned or “influenced” by certain foreign countries, such as China. The tweak would save the government an estimated $18 billion.

Trump was reportedly anti-incentive prior to returning to office in January, and he got rid of his predecessor's EV targets as part of a flurry of early-term executive order decrees. The next step, if his party has its way, is to kill federal tax incentives for electrified vehicles.

Credits Got More Americans into EVs

These clean-vehicle credits date back to President Obama and were in place during Trump's first term. Under the Biden administration, they were expanded as part of the Inflation Reduction Act, which removed per-manufacturer caps on the number of credits that could be applied to new vehicles. It also added requirements about final-assembly location and battery material sources.

Currently, buyers can still get up to $7500 off qualified new vehicles. A $7500 commercial credit applies to leases, going to the leasing company but generally being passed on to consumers in the form of a discount. As proposed, the budget would completely kill the tax credit after 2026. However, models from automakers such as GM and Tesla, which have sold more than 200,000 EVs, won't be eligible for the credit after December 31, 2025. Meanwhile, the proposed bill would also do away with tax credits for the purchase of used EVs, which are currently as much as $4000, limited to a portion of the vehicle's purchase price.

These efforts spurred more purchases of EVs (your author's included) and plug-in hybrids, while also encouraging automakers to move final assembly to North America so that their products would qualify for the full credits. Some have already done so, with others' plans in progress. Those massive on-shoring investments may prove to have been for nought.

What Happens If Incentives Disappear?

A lot has to happen before this or any budget is passed. Removing these credits obviously removes much of the financial incentive of purchasing a vehicle with a plug. This, combined with on-again, off-again tariffs on new vehicles and parts, would throw much of the auto industry further into policy-related confusion. While politicians can change the game with the stroke of a pen, it takes automakers a long time—months or years—to adjust which products they make, where, and in what volumes. Development for vehicles planned for years from now is already underway, some of which might have to be scrapped if they're no longer financially viable.

In the short term, if approved, this budget change would likely lead to a run on EV inventories through the end of next year. After that, automakers would have the choice of selling and leasing fewer cars at full price without the incentive or lowering prices (and thus profits) to keep buyers interested. As for the used market, residual values of pre-owned EVs and plug-ins are likely to take a hit without available credits. A lack of investment in EVs could also lead to a larger development gap between Chinese manufacturers and those in the rest of the world.

There's also the possibility that some or all of the credits are retained as part of congressional budget negotiations. But, given Trump's general stance towards non-Tesla EVs, it seems we may soon see EV sales boom before they go bust.","https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/2024-chevrolet-equinox-ev-lt-awd-109-66d9ea71e9c02.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.753xh;0,0.171xh&resize=1200:*",N,,2025-05-14 23:00:32.261810

If it can deliver on its promise, the Slate EV could be a game-changer – not just for budget-conscious drivers, but for the entire electric vehicle movement.","Electric vehicles are often seen as sleek, high-tech machines with price tags to match. But what if you stripped away the luxury – and kept the electric? A new startup called Slate is doing exactly that, introducing a back-to-basics electric vehicle that’s not only affordable but fully customizable, starting at a potentially groundbreaking price of just $20,000 with federal tax credits.

The company’s name, Slate, plays on the idea of a “blank slate” – a vehicle that’s as bare-bones as it gets, but designed to be tailored to your lifestyle. Built on a single modular EV platform, Slate offers three distinct body styles: a compact truck, a no-frills SUV, and a practical hatchback. Each version is minimalist by design, aimed at urban drivers and first-time EV owners who prioritize function and affordability over premium features.

At its core, the Slate EV is about choice. Buyers can start by selecting the body style that best suits their needs, and then move on to customizing exterior elements. The base model ships in a neutral matte gray, but users can opt for custom vinyl wraps or partial graphic kits for a personal touch. The interior continues this modular philosophy – buyers can add only what they need and skip what they don’t.

And yes, that includes audio. The standard model doesn’t come with built-in speakers. Instead, buyers can either purchase Slate’s own speaker system or choose a simple mount for a portable Bluetooth speaker they already own. It’s one of many examples of how Slate is redefining the essentials in favor of cost savings and flexibility.

Inside the cabin, drivers will find a digital instrument display that doubles as a backup camera monitor. There’s no infotainment system – no navigation, no Netflix, no oversized touchscreen. Instead, drivers are encouraged to mount their phones and use their own apps for navigation and entertainment. Slate includes physical climate controls, a design choice that keeps costs down while appealing to drivers who appreciate tactile feedback.

The focus is on practicality. Everything included in the base model is there because it serves a clear purpose, not because it looks futuristic or checks a box on a spec sheet.

Slate’s most disruptive feature isn’t its modularity – it’s the price. The vehicle is expected to launch with a starting MSRP of $27,000. But with available federal EV tax credits, that price could drop as low as $20,000, making it one of the most affordable electric vehicles in the U.S. market. For context, many EVs still hover in the $35,000–$50,000 range or higher, even after incentives.

This affordability is crucial in the broader push toward widespread EV adoption. While many automakers have focused on luxury or performance EVs, Slate is targeting an underserved segment: drivers who want an electric car that gets them from point A to B without the frills or financial burden.

Slate isn’t trying to impress with horsepower or luxury interiors. It’s trying to change the conversation around EVs entirely – making them approachable, adaptable, and most importantly, affordable. In an industry where the average EV price continues to rise, Slate’s back-to-basics approach might just be what the market needs.

As Slate moves closer to production, the EV world will be watching closely. If it can deliver on its promise, the Slate EV could be a game-changer – not just for budget-conscious drivers, but for the entire electric vehicle movement.

The worst impacts of Tuesday’s storm were far up the Potomac River. Any concerns about how the United States would grapple with the increasingly intense weather of a warming world receded to background noise, less audible than the rain pelting the Capitol dome.

Republicans on the House Ways and Means Committee voted to repeal clean energy incentives early Wednesday after an all-night session marking up legislation they titled “One Big, Beautiful Bill.” The $4.9 trillion package would extend the tax cuts passed in President Donald Trump’s first term and add a few more, such as eliminating taxes on tips, while ramping up border security spending.

A portion of the funds to pay for the bill—about 11 percent, according to the Joint Committee on Taxation’s tally—would come from eradicating tax credits passed in the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 that were meant to spur a U.S. transition to cleaner energy.

Billions of dollars of private investment have poured into hundreds of new electric vehicle and battery plants and other clean energy projects in the wake of the IRA’s passage, with much of the boom occurring in Republican-led states. As President Joe Biden’s climate team left the White House, they expressed faith that this bipartisan impact would give the IRA durability, even though it had passed Congress with solely Democratic votes. The House Ways and Means Committee decisively put this notion to rest with its 389-page draft.

“Make no mistake, this bill takes a sledgehammer approach,” a coalition of environmental groups wrote in a letter to committee leaders. The legislation “guts America’s clean energy production, raises costs for families, worsens air pollution, and eliminates hundreds of thousands of good-paying manufacturing jobs – all to fund massive tax breaks for billionaires.”

The outnumbered Democrats on the committee focused their fight on the legislation’s other impacts—like its massive cuts to Medicaid and food assistance—with little or no mention of the energy tax credits. Republicans maintained that lowered taxes benefited the vast majority of ordinary Americans.

“The One Big Beautiful Bill is the key to making America great again,” said Rep. Jason Smith, R-Mo., chairman of the Ways and Means Committee. “This bill wasn’t drafted by special interests or K Street lobbyists. It was drafted by the American people in communities across the country.” Smith talked about mothers, farmers and owners of small businesses who lauded the tax cuts during field hearings committee Republicans held last year. But certainly big business lobbyists also liked the package, including the American Petroleum Institute, which called it a plan “that supports American energy leadership.”

This committee vote is just the first step in a long, byzantine process known as “budget reconciliation,” special legislation that has an easier path to passage because it only requires a simple majority in the Senate. In the past decade, nearly all major policy, including the IRA, has been enacted through this route.

The bill will be changed before it hits the president’s desk because of bitter disputes among Republicans over the so-called SALT deduction cap in states with high state and local taxes and over public lands in the West. But whether any of the clean energy incentives can be saved in this process will depend largely on the clout of a few Republicans who have dared to voice support for them amid Trump’s vocal campaign to end what he calls the “new green scam.”

Here are the main points to know about the politics, the people to watch and the huge potential consequences for climate change.

“The Most Complicated Venn Diagram”

Clean energy advocates were heartened two months ago when 21 House Republicans sent Smith a letter urging his committee to maintain support for the energy tax credits that were spurring economic development in their districts. Given the Republicans’ narrow majority, their no votes could sink any attempt at repeal.

But fissures began to emerge, with some of the would-be Republican clean energy champions concerned primarily with the biofuels incentives that are popular in farm country. Biofuel tax credits were the only climate policy that got a boost from the House Ways and Means committee; it extended them to 2031, four years beyond their original expiration date.

Faring worst in the legislation were consumer credits, like those for the purchase of electric vehicles, home efficiency upgrades or solar installations; all would expire by year’s end.

“Basically the suite of consumer-focused credits is just being torn out root and branch, everything from stuff that’ll help people better insulate their homes, to get solar on the roofs, to find more cost effective transportation,” said Harry Godfrey, managing director of Advanced Energy United, which lobbies for the clean energy industry. “These are all the tools that people are using to help manage rising energy and transportation costs. We’re taking those tools away from people at a time of rising costs—that is dangerous and problematic in and of itself.”

“I will emphasize this is a starting point and it’s very unlikely this version will become law. However, a lot of this could become law, and that’s the concerning thing.”

— Chris Moyer, Echo Communications

But the Republican leadership framed clean energy incentives as something solely of interest to the upper classes, naming this section of the legislation, “Working Families Over Elites.” (In fact, Democrats had designed the IRA to extend the benefits of clean energy to working class communities, offering tax credits for used EVs for the first time and providing bonus tax credits for projects located near old fossil fuel industry sites or in low-income communities.)

The tax credits that go to businesses and investors are eliminated more slowly, with phase-out of most beginning in 2029. But since the consumer credits would help generate the market demand that developers and producers are relying on, the extra time may not help.

“This is the first concrete act of this Congress to attempt to dismantle these tax credits, and a lot of folks in the industry were hoping for a better starting point,” said Chris Moyer, a former Democratic staffer on Capitol Hill and the founder of Echo Communications, who now advises clean energy companies. “I will emphasize this is a starting point and it’s very unlikely this version will become law. However, a lot of this could become law, and that’s the concerning thing.”

He and other clean energy advocates will argue that withdrawing support for new energy projects is at odds with Trump’s energy abundance and dominance themes. The vulnerable tax credits are especially important for forms of energy that Republicans say they support, like nuclear and advanced geothermal developments, that need a long lead time.

So far, Republicans have put the big Trump tax cuts first. Rep. Claudia Tenney (R-NY), who called in March for preservation of the energy tax credits, voted with her fellow GOP members on Ways and Means to repeal them, even while noting that she would have liked government support maintained for the four nuclear power stations in her upstate district. “Individual priorities do not take precedence over ensuring American families, workers and businesses do not face tax hikes in 2026,” she said.

Godfrey said that if repeal of the clean energy tax credits were a standalone bill, he did not see how it could get out of the House or Senate. But the dynamic is more difficult when Republican supporters of clean energy would have to stand in the way of Trump’s promised tax cuts.

“The politics are incredibly complicated, and [it] creates an incredible amount of pressure on a member to really hone in on their particular priorities,” Godfrey said. He said advocacy on the measure involves putting together “the most complicated Venn diagram in the world” to figure out how to build a coalition of votes that can make a difference.

“The question really does become, are enough members going to say, ‘This is the hill I’m going to die on?’” Godfrey said. “That is hard to discern.”

In the coming weeks, much attention will be on the four Republican senators who last month signed a letter to Senate Majority Leader John Thune of South Dakota voicing support for the energy tax credits: Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, Thom Tillis of North Carolina, John Curtis of Utah and Jerry Moran of Kansas. It is seen as a critical mass of support, since Republicans can afford to lose no more than three votes in the Senate, given their 53-47 majority.

Although they emphasized only one set of clean energy incentives in their letter—the investment tax credits—advocates hope they also will support the entire suite of consumer incentives as well, since they help generate the market demand that the producers rely on.

“As constituents share their practical economic benefits of going solar, we are confident that their senators will fix the House’s extreme and reckless budget,” said Glen Brand, vice president for policy and advocacy for Solar United Neighbors.

Pressure Points

Moyer, however, wrote in a recent note that he is concerned that only four Republican Senators have stepped forward in favor of clean energy policy, and he said it is clear from their letter that they want to work behind the scenes instead of forcing a showdown on the Senate floor. He is urging clients to ramp up public pressure and hold in-district press events until the days that votes are taken.

“The message has to be that you can’t let up,” Moyer told Inside Climate News. “And the folks who I think are the most influential at this moment are the CEOs of companies in various districts that have projects that are underway or about to be underway, and the workers in these districts. Whether it’s in Georgia or Arizona or New York or anywhere else, it’s trying to make clear to their members of Congress that there’s a lot on the line here.”

The automotive sector, in particular, has much to lose after investing billions of dollars in a transition to EVs. “The politics change very quickly, and automakers change very slowly,” said Sean Tucker, lead editor for Kelley Blue Book. “It’s really difficult for them to make adjustments when they’re working on a seven- to 10-year design cycle.”

But the automakers’ main lobbying group, the Alliance for Automotive Innovation, has been silent so far on the budget reconciliation bill, even after speaking out on other big policy changes in recent weeks, voicing support for rollback of California’s greenhouse gas emissions regulations and opposition to Trump’s tariffs.

General Motors, Ford, Stellantis and other big carmakers are members of one of the nation’s biggest business lobbying groups, the National Association of Manufacturers, which praised the House Ways and Means bill as “a vital step forward in securing a competitive tax environment that empowers manufacturers to create jobs, invest, grow and compete.” NAM said Trump’s 2017 tax cut bill, which lowered the top corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent, was “rocket fuel for manufacturers” and the new provisions get the sector closer to an effective 15 percent tax rate.

The advocacy group Americans for Prosperity, heavily financed by the petrochemical monolith Koch Industries, is running advertisements on TV in Washington declaring the decision on the budget reconciliation bill boils down to a “simple” equation.

“Lowering tax bills for hardworking families? Good. Reckless spending on green energy fantasies? Not good,” the ad says. “Eliminating Joe Biden’s Green New Deal helps pay for Trump’s tax cuts.”

The word “helps” is doing heavy lifting in the ad, given that the Joint Committee on Taxation’s calculation is that eliminating the energy tax credits saves about $559 billion, a small fraction of the $4.9 trillion cost of the tax cut package. (The JCT’s estimate is nearly double the original estimated cost of the IRA’s clean energy tax credits, the value of which always depended on how much interest they generated among developers.)

And if the only motivation for repeal of the energy tax credits were to pay for Trump’s tax cuts, it doesn’t explain why the House Ways and Means Republicans took other steps that have no revenue impact, like eliminating a provision in the IRA that allowed for “transferability” of tax credits, which widened the potential pool of investors for clean energy projects.

It will be challenging to make the case for renewable energy in a GOP-led Congress when the oil and gas industry, one of the biggest contributors to political campaigns, favored Republicans with 87 percent of its $75 million in donations in the 2025 election cycle. To combat that advantage, clean energy advocates on Capitol Hill are trying to make the business case for the clean energy incentives instead of focusing on their most profound potential—cutting greenhouse gas emissions from the nation’s economy to buffer Americans from the worst impacts of global warming.

Eliminating Incentives Could Have Stark Emissions Consequences

Repeal of all of the IRA tax credits, when combined with Trump’s planned rollback of regulations like power plant and vehicle emissions standards, would bring progress on cutting U.S. carbon emissions to a near standstill, according to recent modeling by the Rhodium Group.

Rhodium had not immediately calculated the impact of the House Ways and Means draft voted on in committee this week. But an analysis it completed late last year showed that U.S. greenhouse gas emissions could be as much as 35 percent higher in 2030 than the current trajectory under a complete elimination of the Biden-era climate policy. By 2035, emissions would be as much as 71 percent higher than the path under current tax incentives and regulations. Emissions would be flat or slightly lowered due to increased efficiency, a continued retreat from coal and some uptake in electric vehicles. But they would be nowhere near the goals set under the Paris climate accord for a 50 percent cut in emissions from 2005 levels by 2030 and 61 percent by 2035.

The impact of the tax repeals are sure to be felt in the marketplace, clean energy advocates say. The current version of the budget reconciliation bill “is going to chill investment, particularly in manufacturing and critical minerals processing, advanced nuclear, in a bunch of sort of cutting- edge stuff,” Godfrey said. “And it’s going to do it at a time when we really want to ramp that sort of work up.”

Like Rhodium’s analysts, Tucker, of Kelley Blue Book, sees the repeal of the tax credits as slowing rather than halting the transition to EVs in the United States. But he notes that it is happening at a time when other countries will be moving to EVs more rapidly. “I think in the long run, the industry is shifting toward EVs no matter what politicians do,” Tucker said. “This just slows the American companies down and potentially makes them less competitive.”

House Republicans say without their budget reconciliation bill, taxpayers on average would face a 22 percent tax increase next year once the original Trump tax cuts expire. They calculate their bill will deliver a $1,300 tax cut for the average American family.

But climate action advocates note that there will be new costs associated with repeal of the clean energy policy.

Jason Grumet, CEO of the American Clean Power Association, said the bill will significantly raise taxes on the fastest-growing energy sector. “It imposes a sudden policy shift that would raise energy costs, take paychecks away from tens of thousands of American workers, and harm the economies of small towns across the nation,” he said.

Rhodium estimates that household energy bills will be at least 7 to 12 percent higher in 2035 than they would have been under the Biden climate policies, although that doesn’t capture all of the latest research showing upward pressure on prices due to artificial intelligence and data centers.

And then there are the costs of unabated climate change itself, which have always been difficult to calculate. They will be more difficult still to assess in the years ahead, as the Trump administration is ending government tracking of the costs of severe weather events at the same time Congress is retreating from the only steps it has taken to fend off the worst impacts of global warming.

These energy burdens have persisted for decades despite billions of dollars from federal and state governments subsidizing electricity bills in low-income communities.
Floodlight spoke to 18 organizations attempting to deploy renewable energy in low-income communities across the country.
California has 13 solar projects built on the community solar model, but only one — the Anza community solar project in Santa Rosa — is dedicated to low- and medium income customers.
“We think low-income solar is the best way to create long-term affordable housing,” said Emily Shapira, CEO of Philadelphia’s Energy Authority.","As an ice storm slicked roads across eastern Michigan on Feb. 6, representatives from four houses of worship arrived at the offices of Democratic U.S. Sen. Gary Peters.

They wanted Peters to pressure the Trump administration to lift the funding freeze on $20 million in “community change grants” promised by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to houses of worship across Detroit to create community resilience hubs powered by renewable energy — offering shelter during weather emergencies and utility outages.

More than three months later, spring has come to Michigan — and yet the expected $2 million in funding for the St. Suzanne Cody Rouge Community Resource Center in Detroit remains on ice.

St. Suzanne Executive Director Steve Wasko says his organization — which provides meals, clothing, day care and other programs for residents of this predominantly Black neighborhood — has “received conflicting and sometimes contradictory communication about the grant.”

Wasko had been promised funding to install heat pumps, solar panels and a generator, among other upgrades. The retrofit would allow St. Suzanne to help more people while cutting an energy bill that can run up to $15,000 a month in the winter.

The funding freeze is just the latest setback for poor communities of color across the United States — including in Detroit, Los Angeles and Philadelphia — that are being left behind in the transition to cleaner, cheaper power.

Neighborhoods like Cody Rouge suffer from underpowered electrical service, more frequent power outages and high energy bills — a legacy of the once-legal practice of redlining that robbed communities of color of financial and public services, Floodlight found.

In formerly redlined neighborhoods like Cody Rouge, shutoffs for non-payment are more likely. And poverty limits access to renewable energy: Aging roofs can’t support solar panels, outdated wiring can’t handle new heaters, and old electrical infrastructure struggles to accommodate electric vehicle charging and solar arrays.

“It’s now very clear that energy services, ranging from quality of service to price of service, are disproportionately poor if you are a minority, a woman or of low income,” said Daniel Kammen, professor of energy at the University of California-Berkeley.

Little money, high bills

High energy costs are a burden across Detroit. A quarter of the metro area’s poorest households spend at least 15% of their income to power and heat their homes, according to a Floodlight analysis of data from the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy (ACEEE).

Across the United States, a quarter of all low-income households — roughly 23 million people — struggle to pay their energy bills. In most major U.S. cities including Detroit and Philadelphia, these one out-of-four low-income households pay 15% or more of their incomes on average on electricity, cooling and heat. In Los Angeles, this group pays just over 14% of their household income on utility bills.

These energy burdens have persisted for decades despite billions of dollars from federal and state governments subsidizing electricity bills in low-income communities. And now, Trump has gutted the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program, which provides heating and cooling subsidies for 6 million U.S. households.

Other policy solutions face significant challenges. Energy subsidy programs suffer from low enrollment. Collective “community solar” efforts capable of bringing cheap renewable power to renters and the urban poor are stymied by utilities or not made available to folks with lower incomes.

During the Biden administration, tens of billions of dollars were allocated by Congress to help socially vulnerable groups participate in the energy transition. Trump froze much of that funding. Repeated court orders to resume the funding have been ignored or only partially honored.

The chaos has only deepened advocates’ concern that the disparities in America’s electric grid will persist — and perhaps even deepen.

“The current energy system has this imbalance, but if we don’t fix that, we’ll continue down that path, even as we transition to a cleaner, greener energy system,” said Tony Reames, professor of environmental justice at the University of Michigan.

Energy inequality across America

The inequalities in America’s energy system go beyond the cost of energy. In some states, minority communities are more likely to lose power. And in others, Black and brown residents are more likely to have their power shut off for nonpayment. Because of gaps in data collection, a clear national picture of energy inequality is difficult to see.

Across the United States, counties with high minority populations in Arkansas, Louisiana and Michigan are disproportionately prone to having long blackouts, according to a 2023 study in Nature Communications.

At least 3 million Americans face disconnection each year because they can’t afford utility bills, with Hispanic and Black households being four and three times more likely to be disconnected, respectively, according to the Energy Justice Lab, which tracks disconnections.

That number could be much higher, though, since only 28 states require their utilities to disclose disconnections, meaning no data is available for 44% of the country, according to Selah Goodson Bell, an energy justice campaigner with the Center for Biological Diversity.

The redlined grid

And in certain cities, the inequality extends to the very structure of the grid itself.

In Detroit and California, advocates and scientists have found that outdated utility infrastructure is concentrated in predominantly minority areas. This barrier may limit those neighborhoods’ ability to access renewable energy technologies such as rooftop solar, battery storage and electric-vehicle charging, which can lower energy costs.

When the lights flicker or go out in Detroit’s poorest neighborhoods, it’s often because of the electrical distribution grid.

Today in the Motor City, many low-income residents get their power through DTE Energy’s 4.8-kilovolt (kV) electric system, which struggles to keep up with the changing climate. Whiter, wealthier suburbs of Detroit are serviced by a more modern 13.8-kV grid. In rate cases, activists have accused DTE of prioritizing infrastructure upgrades in wealthier, whiter communities while leaving Black and brown neighborhoods with outdated and unreliable service.

Across the city, power lines and transformers are decades past their intended lifespan, leading to frequent outages and prolonged blackouts. Aging infrastructure, beset by summer heat waves and winter storms, led to almost 45% of customers suffering eight or more hours of service disruptions in 2023. A company spokesperson notes it improved reliability by 70% between 2023 and 2024.

“I know after three days without power, the strands of civilization get tested,” said Jeff Jones, Detroit resident and executive director of Hope Village Revitalization, a nonprofit community development corporation. “It can get really frightening.”

DTE says it has committed to improving the grid, citing a $1.2 billion investment in downtown Detroit’s infrastructure and a push to prioritize grid upgrades in vulnerable communities.

Lauren Sarnacki, a senior communications strategist at DTE, said the company also helped connect customers to nearly $144 million in energy assistance last year. And the utility runs a pilot program for households earning up to 200% of the federal poverty level, capping their energy costs at 6% of their income.

One Black church in Metro Detroit did not wait for the grid to improve. Last fall, New Mount Hermon Missionary Baptist Church weatherized, upgraded its heating system and installed solar panels and a battery with the assistance of the nonprofit Michigan Interfaith Power & Light and a state grant.

The solar array and battery give community members a chance to warm up or cool down in the building when the power is out in the neighborhood, said the church’s deacon, Wilson Moore.

“For the church itself, we’ve cut costs as far as energy consumption almost 40, 45% — and that’s without even solar panels up,” he said.

The Los Angeles Department of Water and Power also operates a 4.8-kV distribution grid in certain neighborhoods, including in Boyle Heights, a predominantly hispanic East LA enclave that was once redlined and has now begun to gentrify.

There, aging transformers and outdated service lines mean that businesses installing EV fast-charging stations or anyone trying to plug in a large solar array may have to pay for grid upgrades, according to an NREL study.

“Grid limitations could limit the success of other clean energy equity programs,” the study concluded.

The shadow of redlining remains

Old roofs also are a major barrier to rooftop solar adoption across Los Angeles, according to Alex Turek, deputy director at GRID Alternatives Greater Los Angeles, a nonprofit that deploys renewable energy in low-income neighborhoods.

“I think 70% or more of our folks who we build trust with, who are ready to move forward, can’t then adopt solar because their roofs are old and can’t support the weight,” Turek said.

Floodlight spoke to 18 organizations attempting to deploy renewable energy in low-income communities across the country. All of them said that poor housing stock, which is often concentrated in formerly redlined neighborhoods, was a major barrier to their work.

For renters and apartment dwellers, community solar may be a solution by allowing low-income residents “a way of dividing up an array and sharing it among multiple people,” said Alan Drew, a regional organizer with the Climate Witness project, a faith-based climate nonprofit.

Programs in 24 states and Washington, D.C., support this form of collective solar energy, which generates enough energy to power more than a million homes, according to a yearly survey from the NREL. Most of the locations also offer financial assistance for low-income households to access this form of energy, according to the NREL study.

However, in Michigan and Pennsylvania, investor-owned utilities have stymied the adoption of community solar. California has 13 solar projects built on the community solar model, but only one — the Anza community solar project in Santa Rosa — is dedicated to low- and medium income customers.

The state does have the Solar on Multifamily Housing (SOMAH) program that has subsidized over 700 solar arrays on multifamily affordable housing units, bringing costs down for some 50,000 apartments. The program makes sure that the cost savings don’t just go to the landlord.

“The smart policy design feature of the SOMAH program is that at least 50% of the system has to benefit the tenants,” said Turek, of GRID Alternatives.

Solar helps cool city

On sweltering afternoons in Hunting Park, the heat rises in waves from the asphalt, baking the brick rowhouses. The Philadelphia neighborhood’s sparse tree cover offers little relief — only 9% of it is shaded, compared to 20% of the city overall.

The effect is brutal. With much of its land covered in concrete, brick and blacktop, temperatures in Hunting Park can soar as much as 22 degrees higher than in other parts of Philadelphia. That difference translates directly into higher electricity bills as residents struggle to cool aging homes that were never built for such extreme heat.

Charles Lanier, executive director of the Hunting Park Community Revitalization Corp., said some residents pay as much as 40% of their incomes to heat and cool their homes.

“I’ve seen bills as high as $5,000,” Lanier said. “It’s a problem across the board in marginalized communities here in the city of Philadelphia.”

In Hunting Park and in low-income neighborhoods across the City of Brotherly Love, the Philadelphia Energy Authority has braided together several grant and funding streams to repair, weatherize, electrify and add solar power to some 200 low-income homes across the city in a state where community solar is not allowed.

The agency also runs Solarize Philly, a program that has helped install solar panels on some 3,300 homes, including low—to moderate-income households.

“We think low-income solar is the best way to create long-term affordable housing,” said Emily Shapira, CEO of Philadelphia’s Energy Authority.

Lanier has seen the value of solar firsthand.

“Here at our office, we have installed rooftop solar panels. Our electric bill has gone from $100,” he added, “to almost zero.”

Moukawsher, Matt Robison, Kevin Sabet, Ross Rosenfeld",,,,,https://www.newsweek.com/clean-tech-investments-slow-republicans-look-cut-crucial-tax-credits-2072360,"A report released Wednesday by the American Clean Power Association (ACP) shows that clean energy investments totaled $80 billion in 2024 to deploy nearly 49 gigawatts of new clean power infrastructure.
Another report released this week by Rhodium shows that the uncertainty that's been hovering over the clean energy tax credits since the election is already slowing down clean tech growth.
The monitor tracks the clean energy and transportation investment in three categories: the manufacturing, deployment and purchases of clean energy technologies.
Among the three types of clean investments, clean electricity such as solar and battery storage stayed mostly steady, as did clean tech manufacturing.
Energy Secretary Chris Wright, a former gas fracking company executive, called clean energy tax credits ""a big mistake"" in an appearance last month on the Fox Business channel.","A Republican budget bill that advanced through the powerful Ways and Means Committee of the House of Representatives this week would sharply cut many of the tax incentives for clean energy that have triggered hundreds of billions of dollars of investments—much of it in Republican districts.

Republican House leaders opted to end many clean energy tax credits despite months of pleas from hundreds of business leaders and letters from more than two dozen Congressional Republicans asking that the credits be preserved.

The tax credits included in the Inflation Reduction Act support renewable energy installations, battery making, electric vehicles (EVs) and clean manufacturing. The bulk of the resulting investments landed in places represented by Republicans, including major new EV and battery facilities in Kentucky, Ohio, South Carolina and Tennessee, and solar manufacturing in Georgia and Texas.

The House bill is a major setback for clean tech business leaders who had hoped that the flow of investment dollars to red states would win more Republican support.

As Congress debated a budget proposal seeking deep spending cuts, clean energy advocates had hoped Republicans would follow House Speaker Mike Johnson's early advice to use ""a scalpel rather than a sledgehammer"" when paring back tax credits. But the bill that emerged this week brought down the hammer.

""Businesses need a stable policy environment and economic certainty in order to restore U.S. manufacturing and invest in cost-effective electricity generation,"" Zach Friedman, senior director of federal policy for the nonprofit climate group Ceres, said in a statement Monday. ""Unfortunately, the legislation under discussion does just the opposite, injecting uncertainty and confusion at a pivotal economic moment.""

Trade groups representing clean energy businesses also reacted with alarm to the bill's proposed cuts.

""At a time when billions of dollars are being invested in states that overwhelmingly voted for President Trump, this proposed legislation will effectively dismantle the most successful industrial onshoring effort in U.S. history,"" Abigail Ross Hopper, president and CEO of the Solar Energy Industries Association said in a statement. ""Our nation's energy security and national security are on the line.""

Hopper's group and other renewable energy leaders have argued that the U.S. will need all forms of energy to meet surging demand for power driven by AI, data centers and the electrification of transportation, home heating and manufacturing.

More than 80 percent of new electricity generation capacity added to the U.S. grid last year was in the form of renewable energy and large-scale battery storage, according to the federal Energy Information Administration. A report released Wednesday by the American Clean Power Association (ACP) shows that clean energy investments totaled $80 billion in 2024 to deploy nearly 49 gigawatts of new clean power infrastructure.

""The Ways and Means bill is at odds with American energy dominance,"" ACP CEO Jason Grumet said in a statement that adopted language President Donald Trump used in his executive orders on energy. ""If adopted, the proposed language will raise energy costs for American consumers, force American factories to shut their doors, and threaten American jobs.""

The independent research provider Rhodium Group released a preliminary analysis of the bill's impact on Tuesday showing the stark effects on energy costs and emissions.

""This will raise energy costs for American households by as much as 7 percent in 2035, stifle energy technology innovation, increase pollution, and could put a meaningful portion of half a trillion dollars of new manufacturing, industrial, and clean electricity investments across the country at risk,"" Rhodium's analysis concluded.

Rhodium estimated that the elimination of credits would reduce the amount of new clean capacity installed on the grid over the coming decade by anywhere from 57 to 72 percent and reduce EV sales between 16 and 38 percent. Greenhouse gas emissions could rise by 500 to 730 million metric tons by 2035.

Another report released this week by Rhodium shows that the uncertainty that's been hovering over the clean energy tax credits since the election is already slowing down clean tech growth.

Each quarter, Rhodium produces the Clean Investment Monitor in partnership with MIT's Center for Energy and Environmental Policy Research. The monitor tracks the clean energy and transportation investment in three categories: the manufacturing, deployment and purchases of clean energy technologies.

The latest report released Tuesday showed investment across those three categories has declined for two consecutive quarters, covering the period from just before the November election.

Clean energy and transportation investment in the first three months of this year totaled $67.3 billion. That's about 7 percent higher than the same period in 2024, but it's about a 4 percent decrease from the previous quarter.

""It's kind of a mixed bag,"" Hannah Hess, an associate director for Rhodium Group's energy and climate practice, told Newsweek. ""Overall, it's a trend where these clean investments are growing over time, but that momentum seems to have slowed.""

Among the three types of clean investments, clean electricity such as solar and battery storage stayed mostly steady, as did clean tech manufacturing. But investments in industrial decarbonization technologies such as hydrogen, carbon capture and sustainable aviation fuels plummeted from $7.8 billion in the last quarter of 2024 to just $79 million in the first quarter of this year.

""There is a huge plunge, like a really staggering decline,"" Hess said. ""Companies are reading the uncertainty on Capitol Hill around tax credits and the posture of the new administration towards these types of clean energy technologies and, as a result, not planning new projects as aggressively as they had been.""

The Trump administration is deeply critical of what President Trump calls the ""green new scam."" Energy Secretary Chris Wright, a former gas fracking company executive, called clean energy tax credits ""a big mistake"" in an appearance last month on the Fox Business channel.

Fossil fuel interests donated heavily to the Trump election campaign and conservative political groups in the 2024 election, according to data compiled by the nonprofit campaign finance research group OpenSecrets. New data out this week from the group shows the oil, gas and other fossil fuel industries are heavily outspending the renewable energy sector in lobbying dollars on Capitol Hill.

In the first quarter of 2025, OpenSecrets reported, the mining and oil and gas industries together spent a little more than $46 million lobbying Congress while the renewable energy sector spent about $18 million.

However, the fight over tax credits isn't over yet. Clean energy advocates now pin their hopes on modifying the bill as it makes its way through the full House and on to the Senate. Four high-ranking Republican Senators sent a letter last month to Majority Leader John Thune in support of the tax credits.

""We write to emphasize the importance of maintaining a stable and predictable tax framework to promote domestic energy development,"" Senators Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, Jerry Moran of Kansas, Thom Tillis of North Carolina and John Curtis of Utah wrote. ""We caution against the full-scale repeal of current credits, which could lead to significant disruptions for the American people and weaken our position as a global energy leader.""",https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2644668/blue-oval-kentucky-battery-plant.jpg,N,,2025-05-14 23:01:41.129434

Under the calls, the Commission will allocate up to €3.4 billion in funding from the revenues of the EU Emissions Trading System (EU ETS) to facilitate the deployment of pioneering clean technologies.

Both launching on 3 December 2024, the Net-zero technologies call concluded with 359 applications. These projects collectively sought €21.7 billion in support, highlighting a demand that surpasses the available budget of €2.4 billion by more than nine times.

The call for electric vehicle battery manufacturing received 14 proposals, requesting €1.6 billion in EU funding, also exceeding the €1 billion budget. These figures underscore European industries’ commitment to accelerate clean technology deployment, decarbonise and strengthen industrial leadership in strategic sectors.

Net-zero Technologies call

The Net-zero Technologies call (IF24 Call) builds on the success of the 2023 edition. The 359 project proposals are located in 28 European Economic Area (EEA) countries and collectively would avoid emitting an equivalent of 1.8 million tonnes of CO2 into the atmosphere over their first 10 years of operation.

In compliance with the Clean Industrial Deal, Wind Package, Industrial Carbon Management Strategy and the Net-Zero Industry Act, this call supports a stronger business case for European industry and climate neutral investments in decarbonisation and clean tech.

The IF24 Call featured five topics under which projects could submit proposals:

Large-scale projects received around 39% of the total proposals;

Medium-scale projects received circa 15% of the proposals;

Small-scale projects received close to 13% of the proposals;

Cleantech manufacturing received approximately 14% of the proposals;

Pilots topic received nearly 19% of the proposals

Key decarbonisation areas covered by the call relates to the following categories: Energy-intensive Industries which attracted 169 proposals, Industrial Carbon Management with 24 proposals, Renewable Energy with 67 proposals, and Energy Storage received 43 proposals. Introduced last year, the Mobility, including Maritime, Aviation and Road Transport categories received 50 proposals, and Buildings received 6 proposals. Notably, proposals for sectors such as chemicals, cement and lime, refineries, and hydrogen were high.

Electric Vehicle Battery Cell Manufacturing call

For the first time, a dedicated call was launched to support the manufacturing of electric vehicle battery cells in Europe (IF24 Battery). This highly specialised call is a response to the initiative to support the EU battery manufacturing industry by allocating up to 3 billion in EU funding via the Innovation Fund. The objective is to incentivise investment, boost demand and make the European battery manufacturing industry more competitive and resilient by reducing the risk of dependency on foreign suppliers for this strategic technology.

The IF24 Battery call received a total of 14 proposals. Considering the specialised and narrow scope of this call, this very good response showcases the readiness of industry to produce electric vehicle battery cells in Europe. The submitted project proposals are located in eight EU countries, with the highest number of proposals coming from Germany, followed by France, Bulgaria, and Poland.

This call aims to address supply chain vulnerabilities and boost competitiveness within the green mobility and electricity storage sectors. In terms of battery technology, proposals cover Lithium-ion nickel magnesium and cobalt technologies (Li-Ion-NMC), Solid State and Lithium-Ion-Iron Phosphate (Li-ion-Iron). Altogether, the proposals aim to avoid an equivalent of 138 million tonnes of CO2 emissions over a 10-year operational period.

Wopke Hoekstra, European Commissioner for Climate Action said

I am very happy to see industry responding strongly to the Innovation Fund call for proposals year after year. This demonstrates our collective dedication to meeting our climate neutrality objectives. Thanks to the EU Emissions Trading System, we can ensure that carbon costs paid by industry are transformed into tangible investments in our decarbonised future. It is so encouraging to see such a diverse range of innovative projects spanning over many sectors, driving competitiveness and propelling our continent towards a cleaner future.

Next Steps:

Now that the calls are closed, the evaluation process is underway. Following the eligibility and admissibility checks, the proposals will be evaluated by external experts against the call award criteria, which includes degree of innovation, greenhouse gas emission avoidance potential, manufacturing carbon footprint, project maturity, replicability and cost efficiency. The results are expected to be communicated in the second half of 2025, with grant agreements prepared and signed thereafter.

All projects that meet the evaluation criteria will receive a STEP Seal awarded the Commission, regardless of whether they are selected for funding. STEP Seal projects are promoted by the Commission to possibly attract funding from other public or private sources. Projects will be notified automatically if they have been awarded a STEP Seal following the evaluation process. There is no separate application required to obtain the STEP Seal. The list and map of current STEP Seal projects can be found here.

In addition, the Commission is encouraging Member States to consider using ‘Grants-as-a-Service', which allows them to support projects located in their territory based on the Innovation Fund's evaluation and with streamlined State aid approval. The objective is to maximise support for excellent and innovative projects across the EU to foster the clean transition.

In partnership with the European Commission, the European Investment Bank will provide Project Development Assistance (PDA) to support both promising projects that were not selected for grant funding under the Innovation Fund calls or new projects aspiring to apply. Selected projects will receive tailored technical and financial advisory support to improve their maturity and increase their chances of success in future Innovation Fund calls.

Background:

Using revenues from the auctioning of emission allowances from the EU ETS, the Innovation Fund seeks to drive investment in cutting-edge, low-carbon and net-zero technologies, supporting Europe’s transition to climate neutrality.

With a total budget of around €12 billion already committed since 2021, the Innovation Fund supports over 200 innovative projects across the European Economic Area (EEA).

LG Energy Solution is a South Korean-based battery company that's also partnering with Stellantis at the massive NextStar Energy EV battery factory in Windsor, Ont.
The LMR cells for the GM facility will be made at one of the two LG-GM joint-venture Ultium Cells battery plants the companies have in Ohio and Tennessee.
With the LMR prismatic cells, GM expects to offer more than 640 kilometres of range in a single charge on an electric truck, ""while significantly reducing our battery costs,"" Kelty said.
GM is also planning to offer vehicles with lithium-iron phosphate-based cells that are also lower cost than the nickel cells.","General Motors (GM) and battery partner LG Energy Solution are planning to start commercial production of lower-cost cells for future electric vehicles at a U.S. facility starting in 2028, the companies said on Tuesday.

The cells will have a lithium manganese-rich (LMR) chemistry, which GM says is lower cost than the nickel-rich cells used today, but will still give customers the range they want in future electric trucks and full-size SUVs.

The cells will also be prismatic versus the current pouch structure, reducing the number of parts in the battery pack by more than 50 per cent, according to GM.

The Detroit automaker, which now has 12 electric vehicles in its lineup, is trying to lower its battery costs to enable cost parity with its gas-powered products by adding new types of cells and chemistries in those cells.

""We're adopting flexible chemistries for the best balance of range, performance and affordability,"" said Kurt Kelty, GM's vice-president of battery, propulsion and sustainability, during a media briefing on the announcement.

""My mission here is to get as many EVs on the road as possible. We need to get price parity with (internal combustion engine vehicles) and then this thing's just going to take off.""

LG Energy Solution is a South Korean-based battery company that's also partnering with Stellantis at the massive NextStar Energy EV battery factory in Windsor, Ont. Some production is already underway with workers assembling batteries into groups known as modules last year. It's expected to eventually employ 2,500 people.

Despite word on Tuesday that Honda was postponing plans for its Ontario EV plant by at least two years, the NextStar plant still remains on track. However, a firm full production opening date has yet to be set.

The LMR cells for the GM facility will be made at one of the two LG-GM joint-venture Ultium Cells battery plants the companies have in Ohio and Tennessee. With the LMR prismatic cells, GM expects to offer more than 640 kilometres of range in a single charge on an electric truck, ""while significantly reducing our battery costs,"" Kelty said.

GM is expecting to reduce its battery pack costs by $30 USD per kilowatt-hour in 2025, but it hasn't said how much its per-kilowatt-hour costs are.

GM is also planning to offer vehicles with lithium-iron phosphate-based cells that are also lower cost than the nickel cells. Kelty said GM will release more information soon.

While GM aims to be the first automaker to commercially deploy LMR batteries in its electric vehicles, crosstown rival Ford Motor is also working on deploying the technology, according to a recent blog its director of electrified propulsion engineering wrote on LinkedIn.",https://i.cbc.ca/1.7534497.1747223045!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_1180/12838554a.jpg?im=Resize%3D620,N,,2025-05-14 21:04:30.007833

""We're not holding off investment,"" Paul Thomas, president of Bosch in North America and of Bosch Mobility America, said during a virtual briefing.
Bosch has more than 15 U.S. manufacturing sites employing about 20,000 people.
Bosch plans to launch production of second-generation silicon carbide microchips next year at a Roseville, California, facility it acquired in 2023.
Globally, Bosch sales revenues fell 1.4% to $101.4 billion (90.3 billion euro) last year, though after adjusting for exchange rates, the decline was 0.5% less.","North America had the largest sales increase globally for Robert Bosch GmbH in 2024, growing 5% year-over-year, the German auto supplier said Wednesday.

The privately owned manufacturer posted in North America consolidated sales of $17.3 billion (16 billion euros) and net sales of $18.6 billion, which included sales of non-consolidated companies and internal deliveries to affiliated companies. The growth moves toward Bosch's goal of having the region represent 20% of global sales by 2030 — just as President Donald Trump has increased tariffs on imported vehicles and certain auto parts.

""We're not holding off investment,"" Paul Thomas, president of Bosch in North America and of Bosch Mobility America, said during a virtual briefing. ""We're looking for some stability.""

That growth comes as Bosch and its competitors face 25% U.S. tariffs on more than 100 categories of imported auto parts, from engines and steering wheels to hinges and more. Thomas said Bosch tries to meet U.S.-Mexico-Canada trade agreement requirements to avoid the tariff on its products and is working with customers to find the place that makes the most sense for manufacturing of its parts.

“Global trade under fair competitive conditions is very important to us and for us here in the region,"" Thomas said. ""As we invest to grow, we recognize the need for favorable trade opportunities and, more importantly, a stable trade environment to help achieve our goals. Across our portfolio, we prioritize local manufacturing to support local customers. So focus on strengthening domestic manufacturing is a good thing.""

Bosch, which marks 120 years in the United States next year, highlighted $2 billion in capital expenditures over the past five years in the United States, more than 75% of its investments in the region. Since 2023, it's also announced plans to invest roughly $6 billion in U.S.-based acquisitions.

""It's good to see that this has created a little bit of a discussion to bring manufacturing here into the U.S.,"" Thomas said, ""but it's something that we've been talking about already for the last multiple years.""

Meanwhile, Bosch has been laying off thousands of workers in Europe, especially in its native Germany, to counter slumping demand as underperforming electric vehicle sales, increased competition particularly from China, and economic pressures rattle the auto sector there.

Bosch has more than 15 U.S. manufacturing sites employing about 20,000 people. It's also expected to close this year its $8.1 billion acquisition of Johnson Controls International plc's residential and light commercial heating, ventilation and air-conditioning business that includes brands like Coleman and York. Bosch plans to launch production of second-generation silicon carbide microchips next year at a Roseville, California, facility it acquired in 2023.

The supplier also has a new venture capital fund called Bosch Ventures, which will have $270 million to support innovation in electromobility, hydrogen, software-defined vehicles, factory automation and other areas.

In 2024 in North America, Bosch's mobility business increased sales to third parties to $10.7 billion, consumer goods increased to $3.4 billion, energy and building technology rose to $1.9 billion, and the industrial technology sector fell to $1.3 billion.

Globally, Bosch sales revenues fell 1.4% to $101.4 billion (90.3 billion euro) last year, though after adjusting for exchange rates, the decline was 0.5% less. Operating earnings margin was 3.5%, and the group is targeting 7% for 2026. Bosch is aiming for between 6% and 8% annual growth until 2030. In the first quarter of 2025, sales revenue rose by 4%, but it's going to be a challenging year, especially given the tariff situation, the company said.

Bosch also says it continues its commitment to multiple kinds of powertrains, including gas- and diesel-powered, hybrid, all-electric and hydrogen fuel cell, as the road to increasing electric vehicle adoption has been bumpier than expected because of affordability issues, range anxiety, limited access to charging stations, and other factors. It also continues development of advanced driver-assistance systems and sensors.

""We want to provide manufacturers, and ultimately the U.S. consumer,"" Thomas said, ""with affordable options in the market, while continuing our enduring goal of increasing efficiency and reducing emissions.""

""Weakening health protections in drinking water does not hold polluters accountable and is not a holistic approach.
This bill, known as Amara’s Law, bans some products containing PFAS in 2025 and all non-essential uses of PFAS chemicals by 2032.","Washington DC - Today, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) announced its intention to reconsider the April 2024 health-based drinking water limits for four PFAS “forever” chemicals and to delay protections for two more.

“This retreat by the Trump administration flies in the face of overwhelming evidence that PFAS chemicals in drinking water pose numerous health risks,” said Clean Water Action President and CEO Jeff Carter. “With over 100 million people currently exposed to PFAS chemicals in their drinking water, EPA should be focused on getting these chemicals out of the environment and out of use rather than on reversing Safe Drinking Water Act limits.""

PFAS (per-and poly-fluoroalkyl substances) are a class of human-made chemicals that are toxic even in very low concentrations. Because they are stain and oil resistant and repel water, PFAS have been widely used since the 1950s in many common consumer products, including carpets, clothing, cookware, cosmetics, and food packaging. These “forever chemicals” are highly persistent and mobile in the environment, which means they bioaccumulate and travel unchanged through streams, rivers, and other water bodies, including drinking water sources. PFAS are linked to serious health problems including damage to liver, thyroid, and pancreatic function, immune system harm, hormone disruption, high cholesterol, and cancer.

EPA announced that it will extend the Maximum Contaminant Level (MCL) compliance deadlines for PFOA and PFOS from 2029 to 2031. The agency will also rescind and reconsider the Hazardous Index-based regulatory approach currently in place for PFHxS, PFNA, HFPO-DA (GenX), and PFBS.

EPA also announced its intention to address PFAS chemicals holistically and to hold polluters accountable through a suite of actions announced by Administrator Lee Zeldin in April. ""Weakening health protections in drinking water does not hold polluters accountable and is not a holistic approach. EPA should leave Safe Drinking Water Act limits in place and act with unprecedented speed using all its authority to keep PFAS chemicals out of our water and the environment and to eliminate their use wherever possible,” said Clean Water Action’s National Campaigns Director, Lynn Thorp.

Clean Water Action’s state offices are working to reduce PFAS use in California, Connecticut, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Rhode Island. Clean Water Action in Minnesota helped deliver a win in May 2023, when Governor Tim Walz signed the strongest PFAS reduction provisions in the country. This bill, known as Amara’s Law, bans some products containing PFAS in 2025 and all non-essential uses of PFAS chemicals by 2032. It also requires manufacturers selling products in Minnesota to disclose if PFAS chemicals are present. At the federal level, the organization will continue to push for aggressive federal action to keep PFAS chemicals out of the environment and curb their use.

Powertrain: 338-horsepower dual electric motors; 74.7-kilowatt-hour battery; all-wheel drive

Release date: Sometime in 2026

Toyota’s subcompact C-HR SUV disappeared from the U.S. market after the 2022 model year, but the model is picking up right where it left off for 2026 — at least stylistically. The proportions and attitude-drenched body work make the little Toyota immediately recognizable, but everything under the skin is a revolution.

Related: No More 4 (or X): 2026 Toyota bZ Gets Over 50% More Power, Up to 314 Miles of Range

The 2026 C-HR is more than 5 inches longer, nearly 3 inches wider and over 2 inches taller than its predecessor. Its wheelbase has grown nearly 4.5 inches, too, which will likely mean a windfall for backseat passengers. Despite the fashionably angled roofline, the new vehicle also boasts up to 25.4 cubic feet of cargo room behind the rear seats, according to Toyota’s measurements.

Powertrain Specs and Range

Whereas the old C-HR was powered by a wheezy four-banger with just 144 horsepower, the new 2026 model is only available as an electric vehicle in a single configuration. Front and rear electric motors provide all-wheel drive and endow the tidy SUV with a total of 338 hp. That’s the same output as the recently announced 2026 Toyota bZ (nee bZ4X) in its AWD form, but in the C-HR, there is no option for front-wheel drive. The automaker says the littler EV will accelerate from 0-60 mph in about five seconds — less than half the time its sluggish forebear needed — but that seems extremely conservative. The claim for the larger and likely heavier bZ with this same powertrain is 4.9 seconds.

There’s also no smaller battery available in the new C-HR. It is fitted exclusively with the bZ’s larger optional pack, which can store 74.7 kilowatt-hours of juice. Toyota claims it will have a range of “up to 290 miles,” or 2 miles farther than the AWD bZ. Like its larger sibling, the C-HR will have a North American Charging Standard port, allowing it to refresh its battery at Tesla’s vast nationwide DC fast-charging network. On an appropriate DC plug, Toyota says the C-HR will be able to replenish its battery from 10% to 80% in about 30 minutes. Again, like in the bZ, steering-wheel-mounted paddles to adjust regenerative braking through four levels of aggressiveness will be standard, as will battery preconditioning that adjusts the battery to the proper temperature before arriving at a DC fast charger to ensure the quickest possible stop.

What Are the 2026 C-HR’s Trim Levels?

If the 338-hp AWD C-HR is sounding a bit like a performance model, it seems even more likely to be positioned that way based on the trim levels that Toyota will offer. The 2026 C-HR will only be available in SE and XSE specs, which the brand typically reserves for its sportier models.

The SE will ride on 18-inch wheels and feature a power liftgate, rain-sensing windshield wipers, heated front seats and a heated steering wheel. Its seats will be upholstered in cloth with synthetic leather trim, and a 14-inch touchscreen with integrated climate control knobs, two wireless charging pads and six speakers will also be standard.

Toyota Safety Sense 3.0 will be standard on every 2026 C-HR. The suite of advanced safety tech includes forward collision warning with pedestrian and bicyclist detection, automatic emergency braking, adaptive cruise control, lane-centering steering, road-sign recognition and automatic high beams. Blind spot monitors, rear cross-traffic alert, and front and rear parking sensors with automatic braking are also standard.

The XSE will upgrade to 20-inch wheels and feature memory settings for the driver’s seat and fake leather seating surfaces with synthetic suede trim. It will be available in a number of two-tone exterior color schemes, all of which will feature a black roof. The XSE also features traffic-jam assist, lane-change assist and a 360-degree parking camera. A nine-speaker JBL sound system and a panoramic moonroof will be available.

The 2026 Toyota C-HR will arrive at dealerships sometime in 2026. Toyota isn’t talking pricing just yet, but the AWD 2025 bZ4X currently starts around $41,000. Considering that the C-HR will have the equivalent 2026 model’s powertrain and much of the same cabin and safety tech, it’s hard to imagine the smaller EV starting any lower than the mid-$30,000s.

The committee voted along party lines to advance its portion of the budget framework on Wednesday afternoon, which includes measures seeking to secure Trump’s campaign promises to make the country energy dominant. Most of the proposals sought to rescind funds from going toward programs passed under former President Joe Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) and invest some of that money instead in oil and gas drilling.

“The 2024 election sent a clear signal that Americans are tired of an extreme left-wing agenda that favors wokeness over sensible policy and spurs price increases,” Committee Chairman Brett Guthrie, R-Ky., wrote in an op-ed on Monday. “This bill would claw back money headed for green boondoggles through ‘environmental and climate justice block grants’ and other spending mechanisms through the Environmental Protection Agency and Energy Department.”

The Energy and Commerce Committee has a wide jurisdiction over domestic policy, particularly relating to energy and public health. The energy and environment section of the budget framework encompassed much of the proposal passed on Wednesday, which will dictate much of how the Energy Department and Environmental Protection Agency operates.

The committee was tasked with finding at least $880 billion in spending cuts to help pay for the $4.5 trillion in tax cut extensions that Republicans hope to approve before the end of the year. With the repeal of IRA subsidies, the committee would secure $6.5 billion in savings, according to Guthrie.

Cuts to clean energy tax credits

The framework would claw back funds from key green energy programs such as the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund, a $27 billion investment that incentivizes the use of clean energy technologies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, as well as the Methane Emissions Reduction Program, aimed at reducing methane emissions from the oil and gas industry.

The framework seeks to repeal portions of the Clean Air Act, which authorizes the EPA to establish national air quality standards and develop programs for states to maintain those levels.

Notably, the bill would aim to phase out several renewable energy tax credits over the next six years — a proposal that could be a sticking point for both clean energy friendly Republicans as well as conservatives who want the IRA to be repealed in full immediately upon passage.

A handful of Republicans have warned against repealing those green energy credits in full, warning it could cause a spike in utility costs nationwide. The proposed repeals would specifically target wind, solar, geothermal, hydropower, and biomass energy sources.

Included in those clawbacks is a measure to rescind electric vehicle tax credits, particularly credits tucked into the IRA that offered rewards to those who bought electric vehicles. The House Ways and Means Committee is also set to consider tax credit repeals of electric vehicles to accompany that proposal.

The clean energy rollbacks are part of Trump’s larger reconciliation package that encompasses policies on energy, border and national defense, among other things. After the Energy and Commerce Committee portion advances the committee, it will then be compiled with other House committees to craft the final package.

GOP leaders hope to get the package finalized and passed through the House by the end of next week — an ambitious timeline as there are still some remaining disagreements Republicans must iron out.

Once the reconciliation package is through the House, it will then move to the Senate for consideration — where some Republicans are already wary about the green energy credits being repealed.

Cuts to Medicaid

Also tucked into the budget portion passed on Wednesday were substantial cuts to Medicaid and other healthcare programs.

One of the most significant changes proposed in the framework is to implement new work requirements for Medicaid beneficiaries. The bill would require able-bodied adults without dependents to work at least 80 hours a month or complete some other activity such as community service.

The proposal to increase work requirements carves out some exceptions, such as for pregnant women, and would only apply to those who are between 19 and 64 years old. Individual states would be responsible for enforcing work hours.

If the proposed cuts are signed into law, preliminary estimates predict at least 8.6 million people would lose Medicaid coverage over the next decade, with savings reaching at least $715 billion by 2034, according to the Congressional Budget Office.

The legislation would also include new restrictions on how Medicaid funds can be used, including bans on gender transition procedures for children under 18 as well as prohibitions on coverage “for individuals whose citizenship, nationality, or immigration status has not been verified.”",https://www.deseret.com/resizer/v2/R2QEUKJN6AGRKLG23JAU5NDQ6Y.jpg?focal=0%2C0&auth=f147374d99767fd2b033bb5300e535027558ff9bc0ac8aa9f38ca8c5d362c7df&width=1200&height=630,N,,2025-05-14 23:01:55.271630

Well, the joke would've been on them, as the Kia EV6 GT has established itself as a genuinely great driver. It even won the sub-$100,000 category of our 2024 Performance EV of the Year test. And now, according to a new report, Kia is offering customers an incredible lease deal on leftover model year 2024 machines, with up to $20,000 in savings.

The EV6 GT is based on the same E-GMP platform as the Hyundai Ioniq 5, and features a dual-motor powertrain delivering 576 hp and 545 lb-ft. That sort of power lets the all-wheel drive Kia rip through the 0-60 mph sprint in just 3.2 seconds. It’s not just a straight-line monster either, thanks to its electronic limited-slip differential, reworked chassis, adaptive suspension, and improved brakes. All of that extra performance hardware does come at a cost, however, with the GT starting nearly $20,000 higher than the entry-level models.

But a recent dealer initiative from Kia might help with that. According to CarsDirect, the automaker is offering a $20,000 lease cash rebate on existing 2024 EV6 GTs. The deal is specifically tied to a 24-month lease, with a slightly smaller $18,500 rebate attached to 36-month terms. There is currently no rebate for customers looking to finance the purchase of an EV6 GT, making the lease deals all the more appealing.

Kia reworked the EV6 GT for the 2025 model year, which may play a part in the discounts. The updated machines arrive with 601 hp, updated lighting, a new front bumper, and a suite of interior improvements. And while the automaker isn’t letting those machines go at a $20,000 discount, there is still a $12,500 lease cash rebate for 24-month leases, which drops slightly to $10,000 if you opt for a 36-month term.

As with any incentive program, you will need to contact your local Kia dealer for details, and the actual cash value might look different depending on your specific region. That said, the offers are set to run through June 2, which means you have a little bit of time to find the right EV6 GT.","https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/front3-4-img-5883-675767775c34b.jpg?crop=0.655xw:0.442xh;0.147xw,0.327xh&resize=1200:*",N,,2025-05-14 21:04:40.319360

OTTAWA--Canadian Finance Minister François-Philippe Champagne remains confident in the government's growth strategy of luring electric-vehicle production through tens of billions in incentives despite a setback delivered this week by Honda Motor.

""The North Star is towards electrification,"" Champagne told reporters Wednesday when asked about concerns over Honda's decision this week to postpone by about two years an estimated $11 billion EV manufacturing project northwest of Toronto. Honda cited weaker-than-expected EV sales for its decision, and that the company would divulge more about its EV strategy next week.

Champagne said Honda remains committed to the project, which envisages production of about 240,000 EVs annually, and 36 gigagwatt hours of EV batteries.

""What you're seeing now is not unique to Canada,"" he said, adding that EV production capacity outstrips demand at this stage. The cost of EV batteries would need to decline further before demand for electric cars picks up, he said.

Late Wednesday, Industry Minister Melanie Joly said she spoke with Honda Canada President Dave Jamieson and he assured officials there would be no job losses at the automaker's Canadian unit. Besides delaying the EV project, Honda also said it was shifting some production of its CRV and CR-V hybrid models at its Alliston, Ontario, plant to a factory in East Liberty, Ohio.

Joly, in a statement posted on the social-media platform X, added Jamieson ""confirmed that Honda is still fully committed to major EV investments right here in Canada.""

Canadian officials have boasted that the country has the critical minerals needed to build EV and EV batteries at scale.

Sales of zero-emission new vehicles in Canada plunged 46% in March from a year ago, following a 41% decline in the previous month, according to data from Statistics Canada. In the first quarter, sales fell 27%.

Erik Johnson, an economist at BMO Capital Markets, attributed the sizable drops to decisions by the federal and some regional governments to either scale back or pause their EV rebate program.

EV sales rose in the U.S. in March, Johnson said, but the tide is likely to turn as tariffs are expected to push prices upward. He added that a budget proposal from Republicans in the House of Representatives would, if passed, phase out most EV tax credits as soon as the end of this year.

Research from Canada's parliamentary budget watchdog indicates that manufacturers, between 2020 and 2024, unveiled plans to invest roughly $33 billion in EV and related supply-chain production. The Canadian government pledged $22 billion in financing and tax breaks to lure those companies.

Honda isn't the first setback for Canadian officials in their push to attract EV investment.

Quebec-based Lion Electric, a maker of electric trucks and buses, has filed for bankruptcy protection roughly four years after obtaining government support for a battery-pack assembly plant. Swedish battery maker Northvolt has also filed for bankruptcy, and its planned factory in Quebec is facing a sizable delay.

The Republican package would repeal transferability for a range of clean energy credits – including the 45Y, 48E, and 45U credits – after two years, thereby preventing them from being sold or transferred to third parties.
In 2024, 38 House Republicans signed letters urging Republican leadership to preserve IRA tax credits that have spurred development in their districts.
Cramer's own public proposal would merely phase out wind and solar tax credits, older technologies he believes no longer need subsidies to come online.
""There has been job creation around these tax credits.""","The US House Ways and Means Committee advanced a Republican tax package that would raise an estimated $515 billion in revenue for a broader budget reconciliation bill by accelerating the phaseout of the Inflation Reduction Act's clean energy and electric vehicle tax credits.

The tax-writing panel passed the draft bill along party lines early May 14 following a marathon committee markup where members debated an amendment that would have entirely struck the measure's energy-related section.

""This bill makes the 2017 tax cuts permanent, locking in lower tax rates for workers, small businesses and farmers,"" said Representative Jason Smith, Republican-Missouri and the committee's chair. ""These provisions offer the certainty and support small businesses and manufacturers need to invest in America and bring back the economic prosperity of President Trump's first term.""

Representative Don Beyer, Democrat-Virginia, called the energy-related amendment to the tax package, offered by fellow Democrat Mike Thompson of California, ""perhaps the most important amendment of the markup.""

""The energy provisions of this bill are catastrophic,"" Beyer said. ""You can't reasonably look at the changes made to these tax credits and think they support energy markets in the US.""

Democrats decry early credit phaseouts

The Ways and Means proposal would phase down technology-neutral 45Y production and investment tax credits, as well as a nuclear production credit, from 2029 through 2032.

Under Democrats' 2022 energy climate law, the 45Y production credit and 48E investment credit are subject to a four-year phasedown period that starts in 2032 or when the US power sector's emissions fall to 25% below 2022 levels – whichever comes later. The full value of the 45U nuclear credit is also available until 2033.

Notably, the Ways and Means proposal would narrow eligibility for the 45Y and 48E credits by tying the phasedowns to when a project is placed in service, as opposed to the IRA's commencement-of-construction standard.

One of the few surviving credits in the reconciliation package, the clean fuel production credit (45Z), was also subject to new two-year transferability rules, but was otherwise extended and made slightly easier for biofuels and sustainable aviation fuels producers to qualify for. It would also require feedstocks to originate from the US, Mexico and Canada, preventing the use of used Chinese cooking oil in blending.

The Republican package would repeal transferability for a range of clean energy credits – including the 45Y, 48E, and 45U credits – after two years, thereby preventing them from being sold or transferred to third parties. The bill would also add new restrictions for projects receiving ""material assistance"" from foreign entities of concern.

""Between the [foreign entity of concern] provisions being unworkable and functionally killing credits, creating placed-in-service deadlines – which means no project underway can guarantee it will be done in time – and eliminating transferability, you've killed financing in the energy market,"" Beyer said during the markup. ""That's the opposite of an all-of-the-above or an energy dominance agenda.""

Representative Rudy Yakym, Republican-Indiana, however, contended that loopholes in the IRA allowed foreign actors such as the Chinese government to take advantage of the law's tax credits for electric vehicles and battery storage.

""We shouldn't allow that,"" he said.

Thompson responded by arguing that ""by not passing this amendment, you're doing exactly what you've warned against. We are acquiescing to the Chinese.

In addition to the early phaseouts for clean energy credits, the Ways and Means bill would largely end the IRA's $7,500 tax credit for new electric vehicles after 2025, along with credits for used EVs and clean commercial vehicles.

Thompson's amendment ultimately failed on a 19-25 vote.

Senate expected to soften approach

The Ways and Means bill's advance to the House floor hardly guarantees the committee's framework will survive.

In 2024, 38 House Republicans signed letters urging Republican leadership to preserve IRA tax credits that have spurred development in their districts. None of those members sit on the Ways and Means committee, however, and their objections to phase-outs could require revisions before full passage on the House floor.

Even if those objections could be overcome, several key Republican Senators have said the credits will likely receive different treatment in the Senate Republicans' own reconciliation proposals.

On May 13, Senator Kevin Cramer, Republican-North Dakota, an influential Senate energy policy voice, expressed public disagreement with the Ways and Means committee's aggressive phaseouts of clean electricity and nuclear credits, telling Politico that Republicans should favor incentives for advanced nuclear reactors and geothermal projects in earlier stages of market development.

""They definitely need more time than that,"" Cramer said. ""It's too short for truly new technologies. We'll have to change that. I don't think it's fair to treat an emerging technology the same as a 30-year-old technology.""

Cramer's own public proposal would merely phase out wind and solar tax credits, older technologies he believes no longer need subsidies to come online.

Senator Shelley Moore Capito, Republican-West Virginia, also said the Senate would likely take a more targeted approach.

""I would expect that to change,"" Capito told Politico. ""There has been job creation around these tax credits.""",https://www.spglobal.com/content/dam/spglobal/ci/en/images/platts/general/favicon.ico,N,,2025-05-14 23:02:05.108520

Barcelona-based Cupra has already had talks with the Penske Automotive Group, the United States’ third largest dealer group with about 200 outlets.
“Cupra aims to inspire the United States from its hometown of Barcelona, bringing its design led and performance driven cars to American roads,” the company said in a statement to the Free Press.
The United States' huge size and population make it expensive to establish a new brand, both geographically and in shoppers' minds.
Cupra plans to build the vehicles at VW group facilities in North America.","Cupra plans US sales 'before the end of the decade.'

The brand has sold more than 800,000 vehicles since VW created it.

A little known Spanish car brand focused on electric vehicles is preparing to sell its vehicles in the United States — turmoil regarding tariffs, trade and environmental policy notwithstanding.

Barcelona-based Cupra has already had talks with the Penske Automotive Group, the United States’ third largest dealer group with about 200 outlets. Penske also operates dealerships for dozens of brands ― including Cupra ― in Australia, Germany, Italy, New Zealand and the United Kingdom.

“Cupra aims to inspire the United States from its hometown of Barcelona, bringing its design led and performance driven cars to American roads,” the company said in a statement to the Free Press.

Easier said than done, but Cupra has made an impression in the crowded European market since Volkswagen’s Seat brand launched it in 2018. Seat, known largely for practical, affordable cars, created Cupra as a sporty sub brand. The result impressed VW brass in Germany so much that there’s talk Seat may wither away, replaced by the more stylish, profitable and technically advanced Cupra.

Hybrids and EVs with a Latin flair

Cupra sells a mix of electric, hybrid and gasoline vehicles in more than 40 countries, including Mexico, where prices start at just under $37,000 for a gasoline-powered Leon compact SUV. The brand hopes an emphasis on performance ― Cupra originated as the name of Seat's racing team ― and style rooted in Barcelona's history as a center of art, architecture and design will set it apart.

“Cupra has a respectable following, but the challenges of the U.S. market are very difficult to overcome,” said S&P Global principal automotive analyst Stephanie Brinley. The United States' huge size and population make it expensive to establish a new brand, both geographically and in shoppers' minds.

Cupra has sold more than 800,000 vehicles so far.

The company’s U.S. focus will be on sporty, upscale EVs and hybrids, but Cupra may also offer some internal combustion models to generate sales and service volume.

“As the first new brand created within the Volkswagen Group, we offer an alternative to the next generation of U.S. car buyers,” the statement continued. “Positioned between the mass and premium segments, we are not based on legacy or tradition. We are an unconventional challenger brand.”

The brand plans to begin with sales in 20 states “strategically aligned with the Cupra brand.”

That presumably means states that encourage EV sales with incentives and emissions limits.

“Cupra is totally unknown to the U.S. population,” said Adam Bernard, principal of consultant AutoPerspectives. “It’s a blank slate. The brand doesn’t overlap with VW or Audi. Does VW want to spend a pile of money to establish an image for it?”

Cupra executives toured the Los Angeles auto show last November to size up the competition. After initial expectations sales would begin in 2027, the official target is now by the end of the decade.

The model line will include gasoline power, hybrids, plug-in hybrids, electric vehicles and extended range EVs with onboard gasoline-powered generators.

Cupra plans to build the vehicles at VW group facilities in North America. Current options for that include assembly plants in Chattanooga, Tennessee; Puebla, Mexico, and the Scout Motors plant under construction in South Carolina.

Constantly changing U.S. tariff policy will be considered, but won’t stop the brand.

“Cupra is monitoring developments closely and will comprehensively address the potential impact on supply chains and our production network,” the statement said.

Who will sell them?

VW infuriated many of its American dealers with plans to sell rugged Scout SUVs and pickups directly to consumers.

There’s no word on Cupra’s sales plan yet, but the overture to Penske is “obviously an attempt to shortcut” building a sales network, according to Brian Gordon, president of Dave Cantin Group, which advises dealerships. “A partnership with a large dealer network would be a strategic beachhead.”","https://www.usatoday.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/05/07/PDTF/83503520007-cupra-tavascan-ev.jpg?crop=4999,2812,x0,y260&width=3200&height=1801&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-05-14 21:04:54.559527

There’s the new Nightshade trim package (everyone needs a black edition, right?) for the popular Toyota Camry, as well as information about the all-new Toyota C-HR electric crossover and refreshed Corolla Cross.

Just yesterday, we learned that the (awfully named) bZ4X all-electric crossover is thankfully getting a new name, simply bZ, perhaps because Volkswagen beat Toyota to the copyright office for the name “Buzz.” And there’s a chance we’ll see an all-new Toyota RAV4, according to our colleagues at Car and Driver.

The Toyota C-HR started out in 2017 as a quirky subcompact crossover, and it left the US market after merely six years and meager sales.

For 2026, the C-HR will be recast for battery-electric duty, while retaining its coupe-like profile and subcompact crossover position, below the larger crossover formerly known as bZ4X.

Expect 338 hp and Toyota-estimated range of 290 miles. All-wheel drive will be standard, as will a North American Charging System (NACS) port, giving it access to thousands of DC fast charging stations nationwide.

Toyota says the new C-HR, derived from the e-TNGA platform, will arrive next year at US showrooms from a Toyota plant in Japan. Another plant in Turkey will assemble the C-HR as well.

Toyota says the new C-HR is the brand’s 20th electrified model in the lineup.

So long bZ4X—we won’t miss the clunky name because we could barely remember it.

Beyond the streamlined name, the 2026 bZ will deliver some worthwhile battery-electric upgrades, especially on the range front. The ’25 bZ4X offered two battery packs (71.4 kWh and 72.8 kWh), capable of range between 222 and 252 miles.

Four versions of the ’26 bZ will use a 74.7-kWh battery and achieve range of between 278 miles (with AWD) and 314 miles (with front-wheel drive). Even better, a front-drive XLE trim will be offered with a smaller 57.7-kWh battery, rated at 236 miles of range and potentially coming in at a lower price point.

Look for 338 hp combined with AWD for ’26, up from 214 hp combined on the prior AWD bZ4X. The instrument panel will also be all-new, with a larger 14-inch multimedia touchscreen. A North American Charging System (NACS) port will give the bZ access to thousands of DC fast charging stations nationwide.

Starting price for the 2025 bZ4X was $38,205, and we’ll have to wait for the new pricing until later this summer when the ’26 bZ starts arriving at Toyota showrooms, in XLE and Limited trims. Toyota builds the bZ4X in Japan and China.

2026 Toyota Corolla Cross.

2026 Toyota Corolla Cross

The Corolla Cross arrived in 2021, slotted as a compact crossover smaller than the popular RAV4 but capitalizing on the well known Corolla nameplate.

For ’26, the refreshed Corolla Cross gets new front facia treatments and grilles and newly available 10.5-inch touchscreen with a new console, along with a new exterior color (Cavalry Blue with optional Jet Black roof).

The powertrain configurations are plentiful—three hybrid grades with standard AWD and three gasoline grades with AWD or FWD—but no plug-in hybrid.

The hybrids will use Toyota’s fifth-generation technology and will be rated at 196 hp combined and estimated to achieve 42 mpg. The gas-only models will get a Toyota-estimated 32 mpg.

Two new wheel designs are also available, including 18-inch dark-gray metallic alloys on XLE trim and 18-inch gloss-black sport rims on hybrid XSE grade.

All will be assembled in Huntsville, Alabama, which will help mitigate tariffs when the ’26 Corolla Cross goes on sale later this year. Pricing for the current ’25 Corolla Cross starts at $25,270 with destination charges.

2026 Toyota Camry Nightshade.

2026 Toyota Camry Nightshade Edition

The Camry was all-new for its ninth generation when it launched for the ’25 model year, so understandably the upgrades for 2026 are cosmetic.

For the goth shoppers who like their mainstream sedans dark and foreboding, the Nightshade Edition will offer Midnight Black Metallic exterior features, such as the grille, air curtains, side canards, door handles, mirror caps, shark fin antenna, rear lower sport diffuser, and rear spoiler.

Of course, there’s unique 19-inch wheels and gloss black badging to complete the look. If black-on-black is just too much, then you can opt for the Nightshade Edition with Ice Cap (white) and Supersonic Red (pictured above). The ‘26 Camry also comes in a new exterior color, Dark Cosmos, a smoky blue.

Every new Camry is a hybrid (2.5-liter four-cylinder with at least 225 hp combined), so even Nightshade Editions should get a Toyota-estimated 51 mpg, depending on your driving style. Toyota builds the Camry in Georgetown, Kentucky.

So far, sampling has found nearly 12% of U.S. water utilities are above the Biden administration’s limits.
The Safe Water Drinking Act gives the EPA authority to limit water contaminants, and it includes a provision meant to prevent new rules from being looser than previous ones.
“The law is very clear that the EPA can’t repeal or weaken the drinking water standard,” said Erik Olson, a senior strategist at the nonprofit Natural Resources Defense Council.
Some utilities wanted a higher limit on PFOA and PFOS, according to Mark White, drinking water leader at the engineering firm CDM Smith.","On Wednesday, the Environmental Protection Agency announced plans to weaken limits on some harmful “forever chemicals” in drinking water roughly a year after the Biden administration finalized the first-ever national standards.

The Biden administration said last year the rules could reduce PFAS exposure for millions of people. It was part of a broader push by officials then to address drinking water quality by writing rules to require the removal of toxic lead pipes and, after years of activist concern, address the threat of forever chemicals.

President Donald Trump has sought fewer environmental rules and more oil and gas development. EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin has carried out that agenda by announcing massive regulatory rollbacks.

Now, we know the EPA plans to rescind limits for certain PFAS and lengthen deadlines for two of the most common types. Here are some of the essential things to know about PFAS chemicals and what the EPA decided to do:

PFAS, or perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances, are a group of chemicals that have been around for decades and have now spread into the nation’s air, water and soil.

They were manufactured by companies such as 3M, Chemours and others because they were incredibly useful. They helped eggs slide across nonstick frying pans, ensured that firefighting foam suffocates flames and helped clothes withstand the rain and keep people dry.

The chemicals resist breaking down, however, which means they stay around in the environment.

Environmental activists say that PFAS manufacturers knew about the health harms of PFAS long before they were made public. The same attributes that make the chemicals so valuable – resistance to breakdown – make them hazardous to people.

PFAS accumulates in the body, which is why the Biden administration set limits for two common types, often called PFOA and PFOS, at 4 parts per trillion that are phased out of manufacturing but still present in the environment.

There is a wide range of health harms now associated with exposure to certain PFAS. Cases of kidney disease, low-birth weight and high cholesterol in addition to certain cancers can be prevented by removing PFAS from water, according to the EPA.

The guidance on PFOA and PFOS has changed dramatically in recent years as scientific understanding has advanced. The EPA in 2016, for example, said the combined amount of the two substances should not exceed 70 parts per trillion. The Biden administration later said no amount is safe.

The EPA plans to scrap limits on three types of PFAS, some of which are less well known. They include GenX substances commonly found in North Carolina as well as substances called PFHxS and PFNA. There is also a limit on a mixture of PFAS, which the agency is also planning to rescind.

It appears few utilities will be impacted by the withdrawal of limits for these types of PFAS. So far, sampling has found nearly 12% of U.S. water utilities are above the Biden administration’s limits. But most utilities face problems with PFOA or PFOS.

For the two commonly found types, PFOA and PFOS, the EPA will keep the current limits in place but give utilities two more years — until 2031 — to meet them.

Some environmental groups argue that the EPA can’t legally weaken the regulations. The Safe Water Drinking Act gives the EPA authority to limit water contaminants, and it includes a provision meant to prevent new rules from being looser than previous ones.

“The law is very clear that the EPA can’t repeal or weaken the drinking water standard,” said Erik Olson, a senior strategist at the nonprofit Natural Resources Defense Council.

Environmental activists have generally slammed the EPA for not keeping the Biden-era rules in place, saying it will worsen public health.

Industry had mixed reactions. The American Chemistry Council questioned the Biden administration’s underlying science that supported the tight rules and said the Trump administration had considered the concerns about cost and the underlying science.

“However, EPA’s actions only partially address this issue, and more is needed to prevent significant impacts on local communities and other unintended consequences,” the industry group said.

Leaders of two major utility industry groups, the American Water Works Association and Association of Metropolitan Water Agencies, said they supported the EPA’s decision to rescind a novel approach to limit a mix of chemicals. But they also said the changes do not substantially reduce the cost of the PFAS rule.

Some utilities wanted a higher limit on PFOA and PFOS, according to Mark White, drinking water leader at the engineering firm CDM Smith.

They did, however, get an extension.

“This gives water pros more time to deal with the ones we know are bad, and we are going to need more time. Some utilities are just finding out now where they stand,” said Mike McGill, president of WaterPIO, a water industry communications firm.

It also provides drivers and passengers alike with plenty of comfort and convenience, such as two wireless smartphone chargers and rear cabin USB ports to ensure everyone on board can be connected when on the move; rear cabin air conditioning controls; and an available panoramic roof that brings natural light to all parts of the interior.

Electrifying Performance

The 2026 Toyota C-HR BEV comes equipped with standard AWD with electric motors housed in the front and rear eAxles. Altogether, the model is expected to be capable of going from 0 to 60 miles per hour in around 5 seconds. Its coupe-like lines are complemented by a low center of gravity, thanks to the underfloor-mounted battery pack that is surrounded by a cross-framing structure for overall vehicle rigidity. In addition to the fundamental strength, rigidity and agility of the dedicated BEV platform, suspension parts have been precisely tuned for the new C-HR, including spring and damper performance and the stiffness of the anti-roll bars.

It will have a lithium-ion battery with a total capacity of 74.7-kWh and an 11-kW on-board AC charger. It will have a NACS charging port that is compatible with Level Three DC fast-charging, giving it access thousands of high-speed charging stations nationwide. When using fast charging the C-HR will be capable of recharging from 10% to 80% battery capacity in around 30 minutes under ideal conditions*. The 2026 C-HR will also be capable of charging on Level One and Level Two AC power sources.

A battery pre-conditioning function is also included on C-HR. This system brings the battery to an optimal temperature for DC fast charging, enabling faster charging in colder climates. This function can be activated manually or automatically by setting the navigation system destination to a fast-charging station.

The 2026 C-HR also features steering wheel-mounted paddle shifters to activate and adjust regenerative braking. Regenerative braking is the process of converting energy created by the movement of the vehicle, also known as kinetic energy, into electrical energy. The driver can adjust the amount of regenerative braking power from four levels using the paddle shifters.

Two Style and Value-Packed Grades

The all-electric 2026 C-HR will be available in an SE and XSE grade.

Active Safety & Driver Assist Technology

The C-HR features Toyota Safety Sense 3.0™, Toyota’s suite of active safety and driver assistance features designed to support driver awareness, decision-making, and vehicle operation. Please note that Toyota Safety Sense 3.0 systems and driver assist features are not a substitute for safe and attentive driving. The safety suite includes:

Pre-Collision System with Pedestrian Detection (PCS w/PD): Designed to help detect a vehicle, pedestrian, bicyclist, or motorcyclist and provide an audible/visual forward-collision warning under certain circumstances. If you don’t react, the system is designed to provide automatic emergency braking.

Full-Speed Range Dynamic Radar Cruise Control (DCRR): An adaptive cruise control system that is designed to be set at speeds above 20 mph. DRCC uses vehicle-to-vehicle distance control to help maintain a preset distance from the vehicle ahead of you.

Lane Departure Alert with Steering Assist (LDA w/SA): Detects lane markings or the road’s edge at speeds above 30 mph. LDA w/SA is designed to provide an audible/visual warning if an inadvertent lane departure is detected. If no corrective action is taken, Steering Assist is designed to provide gentle corrective steering for lane-keeping assistance.

Lane Tracing Assist (LTA): Designed to help keep the vehicle in the center of a lane. LTA assists the driver with steering control while DRCC is in use.

Road Sign Assist (RSA): Uses the forward-facing camera to recognize specific road signs, such as speed limit, stop, and yield signs. RSA provides sign information to the driver via the Multi-Information Display.

Automatic High Beams (AHB): Designed to detect headlights of oncoming vehicles and taillights of preceding vehicles. AHB automatically toggles between high and low beams as appropriate.

Proactive Driving Assist (PDA): Uses the vehicle’s camera and radar, when system operating conditions are met, to provide gentle braking and/or steering to support driving tasks such as distance control between your vehicle and a preceding vehicle, pedestrian, or bicyclist. PDA can also provide gentle braking into curves.

For complete details on TSS 3.0, please visit Toyota.com/safety-sense.

Blind Spot Monitor with Rear Cross-Traffic Alert is also standard. The BSM system uses rear side radar sensors installed on the inner side of the rear bumper, on both the left and right sides, to assist the driver in confirming safety when changing lanes. The RCTA function uses the same sensors installed behind the rear bumper. This function is intended to assist the driver in checking areas that are not easily visible when backing up.

Safe Exit Alert is also standard on the C-HR. This system is designed to detect vehicles or cyclists approaching from the rear and judge if there is a possibility of a collision with an open door or passengers who are exiting. Safe Exit Alert will illuminate an indicator in the outer mirror and provide an audible alert to notify vehicle occupants.

The Toyota C-HR is also equipped with Toyota’s Star Safety System, standard. This system includes Vehicle Stability Control (VSC), Traction Control (TRAC), Anti-lock Brake System (ABS), Electronic Brake-force Distribution (EBD), Brake Assist (BA) and Smart Stop Technology® (SST).

Driver assistance features include Traffic Jam Assist, Lane Change Assist, and Front Cross-Traffic Alert, standard**.

In terms of battery safety, Toyota uses many measures to help protect cell integrity, thanks to the design and a multiple monitoring system intended to protect the vehicle’s battery system. This includes:

Redundant monitoring of battery voltage, current and temperature designed to detect signs of abnormal heating to maintain optimal battery temperature and help prevent cell damage

Utilization of a high-resistance coolant circulation system is designed to help prevent a thermal event from short circuits even in high battery load conditions due to repeatedly switching between high-speed driving and rapid charging

Boudette, www.nytimes.com, neal-e-boudette",,,,,https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/14/business/republican-budget-electric-vehicle-tax-credit.html,"But a budget bill that House Republicans released on Monday would end that tax credit.
If Congress makes no changes to the tax credits, that number should climb to almost a third by 2030, the firm estimates.
Both have invested heavily in factories and supply chains with the hope of eventually producing millions of electric vehicles a year.
The elimination of the tax credits would make it much harder for the U.S. auto industry to catch up.
About 595,000 electric vehicles were leased in 2024, Ms. Valdez Streaty said, up from about 96,000 in 2022 before the leasing incentive was available.","Sales of electric vehicles have been rising in recent years, partly because of a $7,500 tax credit from the federal government that helps lower the cost of buying one.

But a budget bill that House Republicans released on Monday would end that tax credit. Their proposal would also put new restrictions on other tax breaks that have encouraged automakers to invest tens of billions of dollars in new battery plants in the United States.

By next year, the bill would do away with the $7,500 tax credit for buyers of new electric vehicles and a $4,000 credit that can be applied to the purchase of used electric cars and trucks.

If signed into law, the change is likely to increase electric vehicle sales in the coming months as consumers race to take advantage of the tax credit before it goes away. But sales are likely to slow or fall once the credits end, analysts said.

“It’s definitely going to impact adoption and slow it down significantly,” said Stephanie Valdez Streaty, director of industry insights at Cox Automotive, a research firm.

Cox expects electric vehicles to make up 10 percent of all new vehicle purchases this year. If Congress makes no changes to the tax credits, that number should climb to almost a third by 2030, the firm estimates.

But if Congress repeals the credits, Ms. Valdez Streaty said, she expects electric vehicle sales to make up 20 to 24 percent of new car sales by 2030.

Losing the credits would deal another financial blow to automakers facing higher costs because of President Trump’s 25 percent tariffs on imported cars and auto parts.

The Republican tax proposal would hurt many automakers that have been racing to introduce new models. General Motors and Ford Motor may be hit particularly hard. Both have invested heavily in factories and supply chains with the hope of eventually producing millions of electric vehicles a year.

G.M. has opened two battery plants, in Ohio and in Tennessee. The company built them through a joint venture with LG Energy Solution. Ford has three battery plants under construction — a wholly owned factory in Michigan and two in partnership with a South Korean company, SK On, in Kentucky and in Tennessee.

Both Detroit automakers have also invested in mining operations to secure domestic supplies of lithium, a key material for batteries.

Tesla, the largest seller of electric vehicles in the United States, will also be hurt. The company’s sales have been sliding in recent months because it hasn’t introduced new, more affordable models and because of a consumer backlash to its chief executive, Elon Musk, who has taken a prominent role in the Trump administration.

But Tesla has some advantages. While most automakers are still losing money on electric cars, Tesla has been making money on them for years. As a result, it might have more financial leeway to lower prices to prop up demand if the credits end. The company also relies less on imported parts than other U.S. automakers.

Other large automakers have been racing to catch up to Tesla in electric vehicles, including by building many new factories, mostly in states that have elected many Republican lawmakers.

Toyota has built a battery plant in North Carolina. Hyundai has started making electric vehicles at a plant in Georgia and plans to produce batteries there. Stellantis and a partner have two battery plants under construction in Indiana. The states hosting these plants have been counting on them to create thousands of well-paying jobs.

If the tax rules change significantly, automakers could scrap, scale back or delay their plans.

“If the government wants the U.S. to compete with China and the rest of the world in the inevitably large E.V. market, and wants G.M. and Ford to make large, long-term investments in E.V. development and U.S.-based production, it needs to extend the tax credit and wall it off from doctrinaire whiplash,” said Erik Gordon, a business professor at the University of Michigan who follows the auto industry.

China is the world’s largest producer of electric vehicles and is the most important source of critical materials for batteries and electric motors, such as processed lithium and rare earth minerals. The elimination of the tax credits would make it much harder for the U.S. auto industry to catch up.

“What this does globally to the U.S. auto industry and its ability to compete — I think it’s going to hurt us,” Ms. Valdez Streaty said. “I think it’s going to slow us down, and we are already behind China.”

Ford and Stellantis declined to comment, as did the Alliance for Automotive Innovation, a policy group.

The federal government began offering the $7,500 credit under President Barack Obama, and it stayed in place during President Trump’s first term. The credit was renewed and expanded in the Inflation Reduction Act that President Joseph R. Biden Jr. signed into law.

Because electric vehicles are more expensive than internal-combustion vehicles, the credits have been essential in getting more people to buy them.

The credit is available on sport utility vehicles and pickup trucks that sell for $80,000 or less and sedans that cost no more than $55,000. Cars have to be assembled in North America, and their batteries must meet requirements on which countries their battery materials come from. To qualify, individual buyers have to earn no more than $150,000 a year and couples no more than $300,000.

Many of those conditions do not apply to leased vehicles. But the tax credit on those cars and trucks goes to the company that leases the car to individuals, which is typically the finance arms of automakers. Many leasing firms have been passing the savings to their customers, a practice that has led to a sharp rise in leasing of electric vehicles.

The partnership between Leap and ChargeScape will create the nation’s largest EV virtual power plant, the companies announced Wednesday.

A virtual power plant, or VPP, combines the capacity of what’s known as distributed energy resources such as solar farms, EVs and EV chargers, batteries, household appliances, heating and ventilation equipment and others that can be flexibly charged or accessed to provide power back to the grid.

When effectively managed, a VPP can provide some of the same services as a traditional power plant.

Leap specializes in creating and managing VPPs, providing financial reward for its partners.

“What we're enabling our partners to do is monetize what we call their flexibility, their ability to control load behind the meter, control these stationary batteries, or mobile batteries and EVs, and monetize them as capacity and energy for grid operators,” explained Leap CEO Jason Michaels, in an interview.

ChargeScape’s charging platform connects power grids with automotive brands that include BMW, Ford, Honda, Nissan and Tesla, also providing financial rewards to EV owners for their flexibility in charging their vehicles.

Owners sign up through the automaker’s app such as Ford Pass or My BMW, which they already use to manage charging their EVs, then enroll their electric meter with Leap.

“So we deliver all of these electric vehicles from all these automotive brands and all the flexibility that comes with their residential charging, and we plug that into Leap, and we sort of become part of their overall portfolio that they then bid into these energy markets to deliver flexibility,” said ChargeScape CEO Joseph Vellone, in an interview. “Leap will then tell us we need to either reduce demand during these hours on this day or actually the power grid needs more power. How much can we export through vehicle-to-grid charging? ChargeScape handles all of that and Leap makes sure that we get paid in the end.”

EV owners are then paid directly by ChargeScape through Venmo or PayPal.

The results are managing the strain on the power grid, especially during peak load periods such as the heat of summer when air conditioners are in high use and making it financially attractive to own an EV, say both Vellone and Michaels.

“At the end of the day, we are saving Americans money on their EV charging,” said Vellone. “By making EV charging more affordable, we are making EV ownership or leasing more affordable, reducing the total cost of ownership.”

The two systems are connected through Leap’s API and it’s that connectivity and complementary capabilities that has Michaels especially enthusiastic about partnering with ChargeScape.

“ChargeScape is a really exciting partner for us because of both their technical ability to be able to control the charging of all these different customer devices and their EVs, and also their reach and association with their OEM partners,” Michaels said. “That's where I think this gets to be really exciting for everybody, because we can do this, not just for one utility program, but really unlock scale.”

The partnership is rolling out initially in California where automakers on the ChargeScape platform can earn additional revenue through the Emergency Load Reduction Program, a five-year pilot program designed to pay electricity consumers for reducing energy consumption or increasing electricity supply during periods of electrical grid emergencies.

Revenue is also available through California’s Demand Side Grid Support program which offers incentives to electric customers that provide load reduction and backup generation to support the state’s electrical grid during extreme events from May to October to reduce the risk of rotating power outages.

Beyond California, the partners plan to expand to states such as Texas and New York, which Vellone says, have similar power structures to California’s along with a high number of electric vehicles.",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/6822052e019f53834416283c/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,N,,2025-05-14 21:05:11.175194

In April 2024, the EPA under the Biden Administration set limits on certain PFAS chemicals in drinking water, requiring community water systems to find alternative water sources or install filtration systems to remove them.
It was the first time the agency had set enforceable caps on PFAS in drinking water, and water utilities were required to comply by 2029.
The Safe Drinking Water Act also contains a measure commonly known as the ""anti-backsliding provision,"" which deems it illegal to weaken a drinking water rule once it's set, says Reade.
The EPA estimates that 6-10% of water systems serve water with excess PFAS levels, according to the 2024 regulations, affecting some 100 million people in the U.S.","The Environmental Protection Agency announced Wednesday that it is delaying the timeline for water utilities to comply with reducing some per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, or PFAS chemicals, in drinking water — and reconsidering the allowable levels for others.

""The work to protect Americans from PFAS in drinking water started under the first Trump Administration and will continue under my leadership,"" EPA administrator Lee Zeldin said in the announcement.

PFAS are a class of thousands of chemicals that have been used for decades to waterproof and stainproof a variety of products including clothing, cosmetics, upholstery and firefighting foams. They're sometimes called ""forever chemicals"" because they contain strong molecular bonds that persist for decades. Long-term exposure to PFAS has been linked with harms to human health, such as certain cancers or damage to the liver and immune systems.

In April 2024, the EPA under the Biden Administration set limits on certain PFAS chemicals in drinking water, requiring community water systems to find alternative water sources or install filtration systems to remove them. It was the first time the agency had set enforceable caps on PFAS in drinking water, and water utilities were required to comply by 2029.

Now, the EPA is proposing to extend the compliance deadline to 2031 for two of the most common PFAS chemicals – PFOA and PFOS. And it's rescinding and reconsidering the limits for the other four listed in the initial regulation – PFHxS, PFNA, HFPO-DA, and PFBS.

""That doesn't mean that [the limits] gets weaker…when I go through a process and we follow the law, at the end of it, the final [levels] might be a lower number, not a higher number,"" EPA administrator Lee Zeldin said at a Congressional hearing on May 14.

Some environmental advocates expressed skepticism.

""The way the issue is being framed [in the announcement] is not about providing additional protections or making it stricter,"" says Anna Reade, a senior scientist with the Natural Resources Defense Council. ""It's about providing relief in terms of cost to water systems.""

Groups representing water utilities praised the move.

""We strongly support the agency's decision to rescind the regulations…and ensure future rulemakings respect the Safe Drinking Water Act process,"" read a joint email statement from the heads of the American Water Works Association and the Association of Metropolitan Water Agencies, two groups that have sued the EPA over its PFAS regulation.

They said the process requires EPA to construct rules that ""maximize public health benefits in a cost-effective manner. This is critical for water systems and their communities, because the process helps ensure every ratepayer dollar is directed toward the most pressing public health risks.""

The Safe Drinking Water Act also contains a measure commonly known as the ""anti-backsliding provision,"" which deems it illegal to weaken a drinking water rule once it's set, says Reade. While she's concerned that the agency may attempt to weaken the rule regardless, ""The real damage right now is that it's delaying movement towards drinking water protections for PFAS,"" she says.

The EPA estimates that 6-10% of water systems serve water with excess PFAS levels, according to the 2024 regulations, affecting some 100 million people in the U.S.

According to EPA analysis, it would cost $1.5 billion a year for water companies to comply with the regulation. The benefits of reducing PFAS in drinking water would equal or exceed the costs, the agency said, in terms of less cancer and fewer heart attacks, strokes and birth complications in the affected population.

Health advocates worry that the move will delay the removal of these chemicals from drinking water and that more people will be exposed to chemicals that may contribute to chronic health problems.

Dive Brief:

Honda is postponing its planned investments to build an electric vehicle supply chain in Canada by two years amid tariffs and slower than expected EV demand in North America, CEO Toshihiro Mibe said during the company’s earnings call on May 13.

Honda last April announced plans to invest up to $11 billion to establish an EV production hub in Canada, which included a factory with an annual output of 240,000 EVs a year and a 36 GWh battery factory in Alliston, Ontario, with joint venture partner Posco Future M Co.

“We have to observe what is happening and ultimately make the decision,” Mibe said during the company earnings call. “We are consulting with the Canadian government and Ontario Province and as for this postponement, we have already received their consent.”

Dive Insight:

The original plans for Honda’s Canada EV hub included all aspects of manufacturing and the procurement of raw materials for battery production, including a cathode active material and precursor processing and separator plant with the automaker’s other JV partner Asahi Kasei.

The revised plans come as Honda seeks to shift more vehicle production to the U.S. to avoid new U.S. duties on imported vehicles, which are expected to significantly impact its profits in the upcoming fiscal year.

The automaker’s FY 2026 forecast called for its operating profit to fall by nearly 59%, or over 700 billion yen ($4.8 billion), while its margins are expected to decline by over half.

“In the mid-term, if the tariff measures are to be in place for a long time, then we will have to increase our production capacity in [the] United States,” Mibe said. “We've already begun studies on this.”

Mibe added that Honda would reevaluate its Canada investment plans based on market conditions as they unfold.

“If the conditions were to change, at that point in time we have to revisit this,” said Mibe. “As per the specifics, what happens after two years and the starting time of the project, we have to observe what is happening and ultimately make the decision.”

Honda’s planned investment in Canada would have been its largest ever in the country.

Among the automaker’s other tariff mitigation plans shared by Mibe is moving production of the Honda Civic hybrid from Japan to its U.S. plant in Indiana.

In addition, production of the CR-V compact SUV, which was originally planned to continue in Ontario, will be moved to Ohio or Indiana due to tariffs. As of 2023, the Canada factory was the global lead plant for manufacturing the CR-V and North America lead plant for the CR-V hybrid, according to Honda. The automaker did not say which of its U.S. plants will assemble the vehicle, as the plans are still being finalized.

Honda’s postponed investments in Canada have drawn criticism from Ontario Premier Doug Ford, who last month expressed optimism that Honda would maintain production in the country. Ford said a media report that Honda planned to shift more vehicle production to the U.S. were “not accurate at all.”

“We’re going to keep Honda here, and I’ll do everything I can to protect the people and their jobs,"" Ford said last month.

However, in a press conference on May 13 after the plans were made public, Ford said that he would hold Honda and other automakers “accountable” for pulling some vehicle production out of Canada.

On Wednesday, the Environmental Protection Agency announced plans to weaken limits on some harmful “forever chemicals” in drinking water roughly a year after the Biden administration finalized the first-ever national standards.

The Biden administration said last year the rules could reduce PFAS exposure for millions of people. It was part of a broader push by officials then to address drinking water quality by writing rules to require the removal of toxic lead pipes and, after years of activist concern, address the threat of forever chemicals.

President Donald Trump has sought fewer environmental rules and more oil and gas development. EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin has carried out that agenda by announcing massive regulatory rollbacks.

Now, we know the EPA plans to rescind limits for certain PFAS and lengthen deadlines for two of the most common types. Here are some of the essential things to know about PFAS chemicals and what the EPA decided to do:

Please explain what PFAS are to me

PFAS, or perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances, are a group of chemicals that have been around for decades and have now spread into the nation’s air, water and soil.

They were manufactured by companies such as 3M, Chemours and others because they were incredibly useful. They helped eggs slide across nonstick frying pans, ensured that firefighting foam suffocates flames and helped clothes withstand the rain and keep people dry.

The chemicals resist breaking down, however, which means they stay around in the environment.

And why are they bad for humans?

Environmental activists say that PFAS manufacturers knew about the health harms of PFAS long before they were made public. The same attributes that make the chemicals so valuable – resistance to breakdown – make them hazardous to people.

PFAS accumulates in the body, which is why the Biden administration set limits for two common types, often called PFOA and PFOS, at 4 parts per trillion that are phased out of manufacturing but still present in the environment.

There is a wide range of health harms now associated with exposure to certain PFAS. Cases of kidney disease, low-birth weight and high cholesterol in addition to certain cancers can be prevented by removing PFAS from water, according to the EPA.

The guidance on PFOA and PFOS has changed dramatically in recent years as scientific understanding has advanced. The EPA in 2016, for example, said the combined amount of the two substances should not exceed 70 parts per trillion. The Biden administration later said no amount is safe.

There is nuance in what the EPA did

The EPA plans to scrap limits on three types of PFAS, some of which are less well known. They include GenX substances commonly found in North Carolina as well as substances called PFHxS and PFNA. There is also a limit on a mixture of PFAS, which the agency is also planning to rescind.

It appears few utilities will be impacted by the withdrawal of limits for these types of PFAS. So far, sampling has found nearly 12% of U.S. water utilities are above the Biden administration’s limits. But most utilities face problems with PFOA or PFOS.

For the two commonly found types, PFOA and PFOS, the EPA will keep the current limits in place but give utilities two more years — until 2031 — to meet them.

Announcement is met with mixed reaction

Some environmental groups argue that the EPA can’t legally weaken the regulations. The Safe Water Drinking Act gives the EPA authority to limit water contaminants, and it includes a provision meant to prevent new rules from being looser than previous ones.

“The law is very clear that the EPA can’t repeal or weaken the drinking water standard,” said Erik Olson, a senior strategist at the nonprofit Natural Resources Defense Council.

Environmental activists have generally slammed the EPA for not keeping the Biden-era rules in place, saying it will worsen public health.

Industry had mixed reactions. The American Chemistry Council questioned the Biden administration’s underlying science that supported the tight rules and said the Trump administration had considered the concerns about cost and the underlying science.

“However, EPA’s actions only partially address this issue, and more is needed to prevent significant impacts on local communities and other unintended consequences,” the industry group said.

Leaders of two major utility industry groups, the American Water Works Association and Association of Metropolitan Water Agencies, said they supported the EPA’s decision to rescind a novel approach to limit a mix of chemicals. But they also said the changes do not substantially reduce the cost of the PFAS rule.

Some utilities wanted a higher limit on PFOA and PFOS, according to Mark White, drinking water leader at the engineering firm CDM Smith.

They did, however, get an extension.

“This gives water pros more time to deal with the ones we know are bad, and we are going to need more time. Some utilities are just finding out now where they stand,” said Mike McGill, president of WaterPIO, a water industry communications firm.

EPA terminates $15M climate justice grant to Pittsburgh and Philly non-profits

The Allegheny Front

In 2024, the Pittsburgh-based nonprofit Landforce, alongside seven sub-awardees, was awarded a $15 million EPA climate justice grant to train disadvantaged individuals in landscaping and tree care, aiming to create green jobs and address environmental inequities in Pittsburgh and Philadelphia. The initiative planned to expand Landforce’s workforce development model, which combines environmental stewardship with employment opportunities for those facing barriers. However, the EPA recently terminated the grant, citing administrative issues, leaving Landforce and its partners uncertain about the program’s future. This decision has raised concerns about the loss of potential jobs and environmental benefits for underserved communities. Landforce, known for maintaining Pittsburgh’s green spaces, is now exploring alternative funding to sustain its mission. The termination reflects broader challenges in securing consistent federal support for climate justice initiatives, prompting local advocates to question the EPA’s commitment to equitable environmental progress.

Aramco in talks with Woodside for Louisiana LNG stake

Rigzone

Woodside Energy Group Ltd. has signed a non-binding collaboration agreement with Saudi Aramco, which includes potential offtake and ownership in the Louisiana LNG project, alongside exploring lower-carbon ammonia and other global opportunities. The deal, formalized at the Saudi-United States Investment Forum in Riyadh, aligns with Woodside’s strategy to diversify its global portfolio, leveraging Aramco’s expertise as a leading energy and chemicals company. Woodside, which acquired the project (formerly Driftwood LNG) for $1.2 billion, announced a positive final investment decision for phase 1, involving three liquefaction trains with a 16.5 MMtpa capacity, with a total project cost of $17.5 billion. Stonepeak Partners LP will invest $5.7 billion for a 40% stake. Louisiana LNG, permitted to export 27.6 MMtpa, has begun construction with Bechtel Corp. and secured a supply deal with Uniper SE for up to 2 MMtpa through 2039, positioning Woodside as a global LNG leader. [MDN: We know Trump is visiting the Saudis and saying nice things about their thug dictator leader. We don’t like the Saudis and we don’t like them owning key pieces of our energy infrastructure.

New York and New Jersey need natural gas

Wall Street Journal

President Trump’s initiative to revive the 124-mile Constitution Pipeline, connecting Pennsylvania to New York, aims to alleviate high natural gas prices in the Northeast, where New York saw rates near $20 per million Btus last winter compared to Pennsylvania’s $3. New York’s fracking ban and opposition to new pipelines, driven by environmental policies, force reliance on imported gas, inflating costs. New Jersey’s similar resistance, coupled with failed offshore wind projects like Ocean Wind 1 and 2, exacerbates energy shortages amid rising demand from data centers and electrification goals. Both states’ push for heat pumps and renewable energy is faltering due to insufficient battery storage and soaring electricity costs, making natural gas essential. Reviving pipelines and lifting New York’s fracking ban could lower costs, support economic growth, and provide relief to low-income consumers, addressing the region’s energy and economic challenges. [MDN: Politicians can no longer afford to give in to those who oppose every new pipeline proposal. We need new pipelines, NOW.]

Could Trump make it easier for DTE to build natural gas plants?

Planet Detroit

The article from Planet Detroit discusses how DTE Energy, a major Michigan utility, could benefit from the Trump administration’s relaxed environmental regulations, making it easier to build new natural gas plants despite environmental concerns. DTE’s CEO, Jerry Norcia, indicated that rolling back clean energy rules could facilitate natural gas expansion and delay coal plant retirements, aligning with the company’s plans to meet rising energy demands, particularly from data centers. However, a report by the Rocky Mountain Institute highlights that increased natural gas reliance could raise Michigan ratepayers’ bills by $37 billion by 2050 and hinder climate goals. Critics, including environmental advocates, argue this approach contradicts Michigan’s clean energy commitments, such as achieving carbon neutrality by 2050. The article underscores tensions between short-term energy demands, regulatory changes, and long-term climate objectives, with DTE navigating a complex landscape of economic and environmental priorities. [MDN: The Rocky Mountain Institute is a lying propaganda outfit and not to be believed. The lefties want you to believe that unreliable renewables will make electricity cheaper. It’s the opposite.

S&P Global says USA crude oil production now expected to decline in 2026

Rigzone

An S&P Global Commodity Insights analysis predicts a decline in U.S. crude oil production in 2026, the first annual drop in a decade, excluding the 2020 pandemic, due to slowing global oil demand, expected supply surplus, and uncertainties surrounding U.S. trade policies. The report revises global oil demand growth for 2025 to 750,000 barrels per day, down 500,000 from prior estimates, with demand growth expected to average only 420,000 barrels per day for the rest of 2025 after a strong first quarter. U.S. production is forecasted to average 13.46 million barrels per day in 2025, falling to 13.33 million in 2026, driven by low oil prices (mid-to-low $60s for Brent, high $50s to low $60s for WTI) and potential trade barriers. The analysis warns of further risks if trade tensions persist or OPEC+ accelerates production increases, potentially deepening the downturn, though a price-driven decline could set the stage for a future recovery. [MDN: Sorry to say this, but S&P is dead wrong. Watch what will happen when the U.S. economy begins to roar later this year after the tariff deals are in place and more manufacturing and economic activity begins to kick in here at home.]

After more than a decade of little change, U.S. electricity consumption rising again

U.S. Energy Information Administration – Today in Energy

The U.S. Energy Information Administration’s Short-Term Energy Outlook forecasts a rise in U.S. electricity consumption for 2025 and 2026, exceeding the 2024 peak and reversing a nearly two-decade trend of flat demand. This growth, primarily driven by the commercial sector (notably data centers) and the industrial sector (manufacturing), follows a period where efficiency improvements and a shift to less energy-intensive service sectors offset demand increases from population and economic growth. Since 2020, electricity consumption has risen, with an expected average annual growth rate of 1.7% through 2026, led by commercial (2.6%) and industrial (2.1%) sectors, while residential growth remains modest at 0.7%. This surge is prompting expansions in solar and battery storage capacity, particularly in Texas, California, the upper Midwest, and the Northeast, alongside investments in energy efficiency, demand response programs, and high-voltage transmission lines to ensure grid reliability and balance, as reported by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. [MDN: We need more electricity. Unreliable renewables are not up to the task. Only gas-fired power can fill the need.]

US oil output has peaked, but don’t expect a rapid decline

Bloomberg

The American television drama Landman highlights the Texas oil industry’s volatility, with its protagonist noting $78 per barrel as the ideal oil price. In reality, West Texas Intermediate recently fell below $60, hitting a four-year low of $55, prompting shale companies to cut spending, drilling rigs, and fracking crews. The U.S., a major global oil producer, may have reached peak shale output sooner than anticipated, potentially by 2027 or earlier, due to low prices and investor pressure to prioritize shareholder payouts over reinvestment. Despite a slowdown—evidenced by a drop in active rigs to 474 and Permian frac crews to a four-year low of 105—production declines will likely be gradual, supported by efficient drilling and stable Gulf of Mexico output. While U.S. oil production peaked at 20.68 million barrels daily in October, a significant drop is unlikely in 2025 unless prices remain low, with a modest decline more probable in 2026. [MDN: More peak oil nonsense, this time from Bloomberg. They keep wishing and predicting, and they keep being wrong.]

U.S. LNG feedgas demand dropped due to maintenance and outages

RBN Energy

Last week, U.S. LNG feedgas demand dropped by nearly 1 Bcf/d due to maintenance and outages at several terminals. Cameron LNG saw reduced feedgas deliveries, likely due to a train offline for unreported maintenance, with Sempra also conducting pipeline maintenance on the Cameron Interstate Pipeline from May 9 to May 30. Cheniere’s Corpus Christi terminal experienced lower flows from May 5 to May 9 due to pipeline maintenance, with feedgas levels still slightly below normal post-maintenance. Freeport LNG went offline on May 6 after a power supply disruption, causing volatile feedgas levels, but has since resumed operations. Meanwhile, Cove Point, Calcasieu Pass, and Sabine Pass operated at full capacity, and the new Plaquemines LNG terminal increased its feedgas from 1.8 Bcf/d to 2.2 Bcf/d over the weekend. These factors highlight the impact of scheduled and unscheduled disruptions on LNG feedgas demand. [MDN: Feedgas will not be 100% all of the time. Freeport regularly goes offline for one reason or another. Other plants have scheduled maintenance once a year. It happens.]

Navigating the diverging landscape of climate disclosure laws

JDSupra

The article discusses the evolving landscape of climate disclosure regulations as the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has withdrawn from defending its March 2024 Climate Disclosure Rule, creating uncertainty for companies navigating compliance. This retreat follows legal challenges and political shifts, particularly after the 2024 U.S. election, which may lead to further rollbacks of federal mandates. Meanwhile, states like California are advancing stricter disclosure laws, such as the Climate Corporate Data Accountability Act, requiring emissions reporting from large companies. Internationally, frameworks like the EU’s Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive and ISSB standards are gaining traction, adding complexity for multinational firms. Companies face a patchwork of regulations, with some proactively adopting voluntary disclosures to align with investor and consumer expectations, while others await clearer federal guidance. The article emphasizes the need for businesses to stay agile, monitor regulatory developments, and integrate climate considerations into governance to manage risks and opportunities effectively. [MDN: It’s harder than ever for O&G companies (and others) to navigate suffocating regulations and disclosure regulations. Trump is trying to make it better, but the left continues its onslaught.]

Crude rebounds over 11% from lows

Bloomberg/Rigzone

Oil prices surged, with West Texas Intermediate climbing 2.8% to $63.67 a barrel and Brent rising 2.6% to $66.63, driven by US President Donald Trump’s threats to intensify sanctions on Iranian crude exports if no nuclear deal is reached. Speaking in Saudi Arabia, Trump emphasized maximum pressure on Iran’s energy sector, while the US State Department targeted a network facilitating Iranian oil shipments to China. The rebound, which saw an 11% recovery from the year’s lowest close, was bolstered by softer US inflation, easing US-China trade tensions, and a weaker dollar, making commodities more appealing. Equity markets rose, and optimism grew as tariff impacts on demand appeared limited. However, concerns linger about a potential oil glut, as OPEC+, led by Saudi Arabia, plans to boost output on June 1 to discipline non-compliant members, despite mixed market signals like strong gasoline spreads and a bearish North Sea crude trading window. [MDN: All of the moaning about oil being “low” and then it turns around on a dime. As we have been saying for months, oil in the $60s is just dandy with us. We don’t like it any higher—certainly no higher than the $70s.

The Republican budget blueprint allowed Ways and Means to budget $4.5 trillion in lost revenue over the next decade, provided that it also finds $2 trillion in cuts and assume $2.6 trillion in economic growth.

The committee’s bill, which is subject to change, falls well within that fiscal range, with the Joint Committee on Taxation estimating it will result in roughly $3.8 trillion in lost revenue by 2034.

Republicans on the committee defended their legislation Tuesday afternoon in a markup hearing set to continue into Wednesday. They pointed to multiple kinds of tax relief for ordinary Americans that the bill provides, including making permanent the 2017 higher standard deduction, Qualified Business Income (199A) deduction, paid family leave tax credit and increased child tax credit.

The draft bill also includes some temporary tax provisions lasting four years, including boosting the standard deduction for individuals from $15,000 to $16,000 and from $30,000 to $32,000 for joint filers. The maximum child tax credit would also increase by $500 to $2,500 through fiscal year 2028.

Ways and Means Chairman Jason Smith, R-Mo., reminded committee lawmakers that allowing the 2017 tax cuts to sunset would amount to Americans experiencing the largest single tax increase in history.

“If the Trump tax cuts expire, every single American will face an average tax increase of 22%,” Smith said. “My Democrat colleagues will continue to ignore the facts and make false claims about who benefits from this bill. These are the same falsehoods they repeated after the 2017 tax cuts – under which the share of taxes paid by the wealthy increased, while lower-income Americans paid less.”

American manufacturers would also benefit from the existing version of the bill, which would allow them to deduct 100% of facility improvement or construction costs. The bill would deal a blow to large universities by increasing taxes on endowments, as well as hiking taxes on many private foundations.

Trump’s major campaign promises to end taxes on tips and overtime pay are temporarily fulfilled by the bill, which would implement those policies, plus a $4,000 increase in tax deductions for eligible seniors, for the next four years.

But Democratic lawmakers are angry that the bill phases out renewable energy tax credits from the Inflation Reduction Act and is contingent on spending reductions for Medicaid and SNAP. The bill also doesn’t penalize higher earners enough, in Democrats’ opinion, and is predicted to skyrocket the federal debt and deficit.

“This legislation pours gasoline on a fire that’s already burning. Americans are buckling under chaos Republicans helped create. And this bill would make it worse,” Ranking Member Richard Neal, D-Mass., said during the markup. “This isn’t about growth or prosperity. It’s about protecting the ultra-wealthy – again.”

Their fiscal concerns echo those of Maya MacGuineas, president of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, who said the four-year tax credit increases mask the giant deficit impact of a permanent TCJA extension.

“This already cynical gimmick is especially egregious in combination with the plan to use a ‘current policy baseline’ in the Senate to make TCJA extensions look free,” MacGuineas said in a statement. “Lawmakers want to argue that temporary provisions currently in place should be considered permanent while new temporary provisions should be considered temporary. They want to mix and match baselines to avoid ever having to acknowledge how much they are adding to the debt.”

CRFB has estimated that the Ways and Means draft bill could add up to $5.3 trillion to the federal deficit.

As the markup continues through the night, Republican leaders will have to address concerns and demands from their own constituents as well.

In April 2024, the EPA under the Biden Administration set limits on certain PFAS chemicals in drinking water, requiring community water systems to find alternative water sources or install filtration systems to remove them.
It was the first time the agency had set enforceable caps on PFAS in drinking water, and water utilities were required to comply by 2029.
The Safe Drinking Water Act also contains a measure commonly known as the ""anti-backsliding provision,"" which deems it illegal to weaken a drinking water rule once it's set, says Reade.
The EPA estimates that 6-10% of water systems serve water with excess PFAS levels, according to the 2024 regulations, affecting some 100 million people in the U.S.","The Environmental Protection Agency announced Wednesday that it is delaying the timeline for water utilities to comply with reducing some per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, or PFAS chemicals, in drinking water — and reconsidering the allowable levels for others.

""The work to protect Americans from PFAS in drinking water started under the first Trump Administration and will continue under my leadership,"" EPA administrator Lee Zeldin said in the announcement.

PFAS are a class of thousands of chemicals that have been used for decades to waterproof and stainproof a variety of products including clothing, cosmetics, upholstery and firefighting foams. They're sometimes called ""forever chemicals"" because they contain strong molecular bonds that persist for decades. Long-term exposure to PFAS has been linked with harms to human health, such as certain cancers or damage to the liver and immune systems.

In April 2024, the EPA under the Biden Administration set limits on certain PFAS chemicals in drinking water, requiring community water systems to find alternative water sources or install filtration systems to remove them. It was the first time the agency had set enforceable caps on PFAS in drinking water, and water utilities were required to comply by 2029.

Now, the EPA is proposing to extend the compliance deadline to 2031 for two of the most common PFAS chemicals – PFOA and PFOS. And it's rescinding and reconsidering the limits for the other four listed in the initial regulation – PFHxS, PFNA, HFPO-DA, and PFBS.

""That doesn't mean that [the limits] gets weaker…when I go through a process and we follow the law, at the end of it, the final [levels] might be a lower number, not a higher number,"" EPA administrator Lee Zeldin said at a Congressional hearing on May 14.

Some environmental advocates expressed skepticism.

""The way the issue is being framed [in the announcement] is not about providing additional protections or making it stricter,"" says Anna Reade, a senior scientist with the Natural Resources Defense Council. ""It's about providing relief in terms of cost to water systems.""

Groups representing water utilities praised the move.

""We strongly support the agency's decision to rescind the regulations…and ensure future rulemakings respect the Safe Drinking Water Act process,"" read a joint email statement from the heads of the American Water Works Association and the Association of Metropolitan Water Agencies, two groups that have sued the EPA over its PFAS regulation.

They said the process requires EPA to construct rules that ""maximize public health benefits in a cost-effective manner. This is critical for water systems and their communities, because the process helps ensure every ratepayer dollar is directed toward the most pressing public health risks.""

The Safe Drinking Water Act also contains a measure commonly known as the ""anti-backsliding provision,"" which deems it illegal to weaken a drinking water rule once it's set, says Reade. While she's concerned that the agency may attempt to weaken the rule regardless, ""The real damage right now is that it's delaying movement towards drinking water protections for PFAS,"" she says.

The EPA estimates that 6-10% of water systems serve water with excess PFAS levels, according to the 2024 regulations, affecting some 100 million people in the U.S.

According to EPA analysis, it would cost $1.5 billion a year for water companies to comply with the regulation. The benefits of reducing PFAS in drinking water would equal or exceed the costs, the agency said, in terms of less cancer and fewer heart attacks, strokes and birth complications in the affected population.",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/8255x4643+0+150/resize/1400/quality/100/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F0d%2F61%2F4de96af240fea3fa04645e4e0683%2Fgettyimages-1509889349.jpg,N,,2025-05-14 18:09:54.313252

Damera Corp., an Ontario-based electric bus company, plans to invest $31.5 million and create 90 full-time jobs to open its first U.S. assembly plant, backed by state tax incentives.

The leased 55,000-square-foot facility will be used to sell, service and build the Karsan eJest, a 19-passenger electric minibus with a range of 130 miles. Billed as a zero-emissions public transportation solution for suburban areas, the bus has already been deployed in several communities in the U.S. and Canada.

“Over the past six years, Illinois has pushed to solidify our status as a hub of the EV future — and put our shoulder to the wheel to get that vision off the ground and on the road,” Gov. JB Pritzker said in a news release Tuesday. “Through our competitive incentive programs, workforce development, and other business attraction efforts, the state is bringing in companies like Damera that not only create jobs and opportunity for our people, but commit themselves to our communities.”

Pritzker made the announcement with Damera executives Tuesday as part of a business development trip in Washington, D.C. The company first met with Illinois development representatives at a trade summit last summer in Maryland.

Damera was incentivized to build its first U.S. plant in Illinois through the state’s Reimagining Energy and Vehicles In Illinois (REV Illinois). The 2021 legislation offers up to a 75% credit on state income tax for EV manufacturers for meeting agreed upon investment and job creation targets.

“As we continue to expand Damera Bus USA LLC’s presence in the United States, our commitment to fostering long-term growth and job creation in the Peoria area remains unwavering,” Roger D’Hollander, Damera’s chief operating officer, said in the news release. “This investment not only strengthens the local economy but also creates hundreds of new opportunities for the community.”

The company, which has its U.S. headquarters in Florida, is the exclusive North American distributor of the Karsan eJest. The minibus is manufactured in Turkey and the final assembly is currently in Canada.

Launched about two years ago, the eJest has about 80 buses in service in the U.S., including Nantucket, Massachusetts, and Santa Maria, a city of about 110,000 people on California’s central coast, whose public transit system began using 14 of the electric minibuses in 2023.

The Peoria plant will ultimately assemble the entire bus, including a newer and slightly larger 25-foot version due out in about two years, D’Hollander told the Tribune Tuesday. Once production on the new model ramps up, the company expects to employ 300 to 500 people in Peoria, he said.

The buses cost about $250,000 to $300,000 each, D’Hollander said.

Illinois has made significant strides in EV manufacturing, most notably with Rivian, which began building its full-size electric R1T pickup truck, the R1S SUV and its commercial delivery vans in September 2021 in a former Mitsubishi auto plant on the outskirts of Normal.

Rivian, which is gearing up to launch its new midsize R2 electric SUV, is expanding its plant and building an adjacent $120 million supplier park to facilitate increased production.

At the same time, Lion Electric, which announced its electric school bus factory near Joliet with great fanfare four years ago, is facing liquidation after a short manufacturing run.

Opened in 2023, with plans to ramp up production at its 900,000-square-foot plant and create 1,400 jobs, Lion Electric suspended operations in December and temporarily laid off 400 workers in Canada and the U.S.

Last week, a Canadian court-appointed monitor said the company is likely to be liquidated. An auction for the plant’s equipment is set for May 21.

On May 2, President Trump unveiled a budget plan for fiscal year 2026 that proposes sweeping cuts to agencies and programs that ocean and coastal communities rely on. While Congress will come up with its own spending plan, the administration’s wish list calls for significantly less funding in the year to come for many programs across a variety of departments and agencies, including a whopping 55% reduction in funding for the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). The administration's budget aligns with his executive actions so far this year, like those calling to dramatically weaken environmental, climate research, clean energy, and environmental justice programs.

As Congress develops its budget bill for 2026, the time is now for us to urge our representatives to ensure that the federal programs critical to the health of our ocean, waves, and beaches are protected.

Why We Care

The health of our coasts and ocean cannot depend solely on the efforts of volunteers, local organizations, states, and local governments. The federal government plays an enormous role in protecting habitats and clean water, monitoring beach water quality, informing the public of health hazards like sewage spills and industrial discharges, safeguarding marine wildlife, researching climate change, and so much more.

The cuts proposed by the administration will slash spending across programs at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the U.S. agency responsible for managing our ocean and coasts and monitoring weather and climate, and the EPA, which implements and enforces laws that protect human health and our environment.

Without adequate staffing and funding for these agencies, critical programs for our coasts and ocean are at risk. This includes NOAA’s National Marine Sanctuaries, which protect 629,000 square miles of ocean and Great Lakes waters, and the EPA’s Beaches Environmental Assessment and Coastal Health (BEACH) Act grants programs, which supports water quality monitoring and public health protection at more than 4,500 beaches nationwide.

Here are some of the programs to be cut in the administration's 2026 budget:

Elimination of Beach Water Quality Monitoring and Pollution Prevention Programs

$1 billion cut to EPA grant programs, including the elimination of the nation’s premier beach water quality monitoring program (BEACH Act Grant Program) and binational pollution reduction program (the U.S.-Mexico Border Water Infrastructure Grant Program).

$2.46 billion cut to EPA Clean and Drinking Water State Revolving Loan Funds, slashing support to states to invest in their water infrastructure needs.

Elimination of Coastal Management and Ocean Protection Programs

$1.7 billion in cuts to NOAA programs that would end funding for the Coastal Zone Management Grant Program, which supports states in managing coastal resources and planning.

Defunding Research, Science, and Clean Energy Innovation

$1.3 billion cut to NOAA operations, research, and grants, terminating a variety of climate research, data, and grant programs.

$209 million cut to NOAA weather satellites and infrastructure, weakening critical weather monitoring capabilities.

$15.25 billion cut and cancellation of renewable energy funds, undermining significant investments for the transition to a clean energy economy.

$1.16 billion cut to NASA Earth Science, setting back critical climate monitoring and research.

$3.48 billion cut to National Science Foundation research in climate, clean energy, and environmental justice programs.

What’s Next

In a time of unprecedented threats to our coasts, we need more investments, not less. In the weeks ahead, Congress will debate and amend the proposed federal budget, coming up with one of their own to be signed into law. Now is the time to speak up for programs and people that protect our nation’s air, land, and water.

The area along the Detroit River from downtown Detroit to Lake Erie has been in nonattainment since 2013, according to the EPA.

The changes made to the state environmental regulator’s request after public comment was received include a correction to the combustion stack emission limit for the EES Coke Battery facility on Zug Island.

The EPA will review the request and decide whether it meets Clean Air Act requirements, and the federal agency has 18 months to approve or deny the request, according to EGLE.

Sulfur dioxide is one of six criteria pollutants regulated under the Clean Air Act. The nonattainment designation means that polluters in the area have faced stricter regulatory oversight for sulfur dioxide emissions, which can trigger asthma after short-term exposure and cause other respiratory problems, as Planet Detroit has previously reported.

Sulfur dioxide can also react with other compounds to form fine particulate matter or PM 2.5, which is linked to cardiopulmonary problems and premature mortality.

The move to redesignate the area follows the closure of DTE Energy’s River Rouge and Trenton Channel coal power plants and state and federal efforts to reduce sulfur dioxide pollution from other sources in an area that still sees high levels of industrial emissions.

The active sources of sulfur dioxide pollution included in the EPA’s model are U.S. Steel facilities in Ecorse and on Zug Island, EES Coke Battery, Carmeuse Lime in River Rouge, DTE Energy’s Monroe Power Plant, Cleveland-Cliffs Steel Corp. in Dearborn, the Dearborn Industrial Generation power plant in Dearborn, and the Marathon Petroleum Corp. refinery in Detroit.

“More than 100 million people are drinking water contaminated with ‘forever chemicals,’ which can cause cancer, harm fetuses and kids and pose other health hazards.","The Trump administration plans to rescind drinking water standards for several ""forever chemicals"" while extending the deadline for others.

EPA head Lee Zeldin cited ""significant compliance challenges"" as the reason for extending the deadline for PFOA and PFOS standards from 2029 to 2031.

Environmental groups criticize the move, citing potential health risks from the chemicals.

The Trump administration will move to rescind standards put in place last year to restrict allowable levels of several so-called forever chemicals found in drinking water supplies across the United States, while giving water systems an additional two years to meet rules enacted at the same time for other toxins of a similar type.

Lee Zeldin, head of Trump's Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), announced the proposed change regarding per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, known collectively as PFAS, on May 14. The substances, which may be linked to high blood pressure, some cancers and other illnesses, have been used widely in consumer products, including electronics and cookware, as well as in firefighting foam, and are known to build up in the environment over time.

The state of Michigan has determined the presence of thousands of potentially PFAS-contaminated sites in the state over the last decade and has put in place its own restrictions on contaminant levels in drinking water systems, though those were generally not quite as strict as those finalized in April 2024 by former President Joe Biden's administration.

Zeldin said in a news release on May 14 that he would keep in place the Biden administration's enforceable standards on two types of PFAS — perfluorooctanoic acid, or PFOA, and perfluorooctane sulfonic acid, or PFOS, in drinking water at 4 parts per trillion. But in response to what he said were ""significant compliance challenges,"" he said the EPA would move to extend the deadline for meeting those standards from 2029 to 2031.

“The work to protect Americans from PFAS in drinking water started under the first Trump Administration and will continue under my leadership,” Zeldin said. “We are on a path to uphold the agency’s nationwide standards to protect Americans from PFOA and PFOS in their water. At the same time, we will work to provide common-sense flexibility in the form of additional time for compliance.""

Zeldin also announced the EPA would go through the normal rulemaking procedure to rescind enforceable standards for four other related PFAS: perfluorohexane sulfonic acid, or PFHxS; perfluorononanoic acid, or PFNA, and hexafluoropropylene oxide dimer acid, or HFPO-DA or GenX chemicals, or any of those three with perfluorobutane sulfonic acid, or PFBS.

The EPA said those were being rescinded ""to ensure that the determinations and any resulting drinking water regulation follow the legal process"" required by law, though it didn't say whether, or how, the Biden administration rules may have skirted the federal Safe Water Drinking Act.

Environmentalists denounced the move of changing the policy, which had been praised as a regulatory step forward in protecting drinking water when it was finalized last year, though water systems raised concerns about the cost and compliance timetable.

“More than 100 million people are drinking water contaminated with ‘forever chemicals,’ which can cause cancer, harm fetuses and kids and pose other health hazards. But now the administration is going to toss out most of these long-sought protections and allow this contamination to continue unabated all at the behest of the chemical industry and water utilities,"" said Erik Olson, senior strategic director for health at the Natural Resources Defense Council, a nationwide environmental group.

“With a stroke of the pen, EPA is making a mockery of the Trump administration’s promise to deliver clean water for Americans,"" Olson said.

I thank the EPA for opening this dialogue and urge them to stay the course in implementing policy that is lawful, practical, and fair,” Governor Morrisey concluded.","Charleston, W.Va. – Today, Governor Patrick Morrisey praised the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the Department of the Army for their decision to hold a public listening session in Charleston. These hearings, taking place across the country, aim to further clarify the federal government’s jurisdiction over Waters of the United States (WOTUS) in light of the U.S. Supreme Court’s landmark decision in Sackett v. EPA. That ruling limited federal overreach by restricting authority to only those waters with a clear and direct connection to navigable bodies.

“Today’s listening session highlights the Trump Administration’s continued efforts to support West Virginia,” said Governor Morrisey. “The Sackett decision brought long-overdue clarity, and I am grateful that the Trump Administration is seeking broad input from states, stakeholders, and the public as they consider next steps.”

Governor Morrisey, who has long fought against federal regulatory overreach—including leading and joining numerous legal challenges against expansive WOTUS rules—underscored the importance of ensuring that West Virginia voices are heard.

“We must ensure that any future rule aligns with the Constitution, respects private property, and provides the clarity that homeowners and businesses need to thrive,” he said.

The Governor encouraged citizens to participate by attending sessions or submitting written comments to the agencies’ public docket.

“This is your chance to speak up—to protect your land, your livelihood, and your rights. I thank the EPA for opening this dialogue and urge them to stay the course in implementing policy that is lawful, practical, and fair,” Governor Morrisey concluded.",https://governor.wv.gov/sites/g/files/uyhtqs246/files/icon_0.ico,N,,2025-05-14 16:11:38.478663

But water utilities complained, saying treatment systems are expensive and that customers will end up paying more.
The Safe Water Drinking Act gives the EPA authority to limit water contaminants, and it includes a provision meant to prevent new rules from being looser than previous ones.
The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law provided $9 billion for chemicals like PFAS, utilities have won multibillion-dollar settlements against PFAS polluters.
“This current administration promised voters it would ‘Make America Healthy Again’ but rescinding part of the PFAS drinking water standards does no such thing,” she said.","WASHINGTON — The Environmental Protection Agency said Wednesday that it plans to weaken limits on some “forever chemicals” in drinking water that were finalized last year, while maintaining standards for two common ones.

The Biden administration set the first federal drinking water limits for PFAS, or perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances, finding they increased the risk of cardiovascular disease, certain cancers and babies being born with low birth weight. Those limits on PFAS, which are human-made and don’t easily break down in nature, were expected to reduce their levels for millions of people.

Limits on three types of PFAS, including what are known as GenX substances found in North Carolina, will be scrapped and reconsidered by the agency, as will a limit on a mixture of several types of PFAS.

The Biden administration’s rule also set standards for the two common types of PFAS, referred to as PFOA and PFOS, at 4 parts per trillion, effectively the lowest level at which they can be reliably detected. The EPA will keep those standards, but give utilities two extra years — until 2031 — to comply.

""We are on a path to uphold the agency’s nationwide standards to protect Americans from PFOA and PFOS in their water. At the same time, we will work to provide common-sense flexibility in the form of additional time for compliance,” said EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin.

The development was first reported by The Washington Post.

Large scale changes and utility pushback

It appears few utilities will be impacted by the withdrawal of limits for certain, newer types of PFAS. So far, sampling has found nearly 12% of U.S. water utilities are above the Biden administration’s limits. But most utilities face problems with PFOA or PFOS.

Health advocates praised Biden's administration for the limits. But water utilities complained, saying treatment systems are expensive and that customers will end up paying more. The utilities sued the EPA.

The EPA’s actions align with some arguments in the utilities' lawsuit. They argued the EPA lacked authority to regulate a mixture of PFAS and said the agency didn’t properly support limits on several newer types of PFAS that the EPA now plans to rescind. They also sought the two-year extension.

Erik Olson, a senior strategist at the nonprofit Natural Resources Defense Council, said the move is illegal. The Safe Water Drinking Act gives the EPA authority to limit water contaminants, and it includes a provision meant to prevent new rules from being looser than previous ones.

“With a stroke of the pen, EPA is making a mockery of the Trump administration’s promise to deliver clean water for Americans,” Olson said.

President Donald Trump has sought fewer environmental rules and more oil and gas development. EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin has carried out that agenda by announcing massive regulatory rollbacks. The EPA plans to loosen regulations for greenhouse gas emissions, cleanup standards for coal plant waste and car emission limits, among many other clean air and water rules.

Zeldin’s history with PFAS is more nuanced; during his time as a New York congressman, he supported legislation to regulate forever chemicals.

Evidence of harm builds and so does the cost

Manufactured by companies like Chemours and 3M, PFAS were incredibly useful in many applications -– among them, helping clothes to withstand rain and ensuring that firefighting foam snuffed out flames. But the chemicals also accumulate in the body. As science advanced in recent years, evidence of harm at far lower levels became clearer.

The Biden-era EPA estimated the rule will cost about $1.5 billion to implement each year. Water utility associations say the costs, combined with recent mandates to replace lead pipes, will raise residents’ bills and fall hardest on small communities with few resources.

The Biden administration did work to address cost concerns. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law provided $9 billion for chemicals like PFAS, utilities have won multibillion-dollar settlements against PFAS polluters.

Utilities see partial relief, activists see a backslide

Some utilities have been surprised to find out they are over limits. And small water providers might struggle with compliance costs and expertise.

“This gives water pros more time to deal with the ones we know are bad, and we are going to need more time. Some utilities are just finding out now where they stand,” said Mike McGill, president of WaterPIO, a water industry communications firm.

Some utilities wanted a higher limit on PFOA and PFOS, according to Mark White, drinking water leader at the engineering firm CDM Smith. He suspects the utility industry will continue to sue over those limits. Environmental groups will likely file challenges, too.

Melanie Benesh, vice president of government affairs at the nonprofit Environmental Working Group, said utilities may not have to install treatment that's as broadly effective if they just have to focus on two types of older PFAS.

“You really reduce what utilities have to do to make sure that the other, newer generation PFAS are captured” she said.

When the Biden administration announced its rule, the head of the EPA traveled to North Carolina and was introduced by activist Emily Donovan, who said she was grateful for the first federal standards. She had long campaigned for tougher rules for GenX substances that had contaminated a local river.

Now the EPA says it will roll back those GenX limits.

“This current administration promised voters it would ‘Make America Healthy Again’ but rescinding part of the PFAS drinking water standards does no such thing,” she said.",https://media.9news.com/assets/CCT/images/abe76a58-dd08-4600-bc38-8e1178a74edd/20250514T141736/abe76a58-dd08-4600-bc38-8e1178a74edd_1140x641.jpg,N,,2025-05-14 17:08:33.898810

At the heart of the proposal is a move to eliminate the $7,500 tax credit for new EV buyers and the $4,000 credit for used EVs starting December 31.
The House proposal doesn’t completely pull the plug on all EV-related incentives.
It keeps a critical battery production tax credit in place, which is vital for automakers and battery suppliers looking to expand U.S.-based operations.","A major policy shakeup is brewing in Washington as House Republicans push forward with a proposal that could significantly reshape the electric vehicle landscape in the United States. Unveiled Monday, the plan is part of a broader tax reform package that includes scrapping the federal electric vehicle (EV) tax credits and rolling back key fuel efficiency standards aimed at promoting cleaner transportation.

At the heart of the proposal is a move to eliminate the $7,500 tax credit for new EV buyers and the $4,000 credit for used EVs starting December 31. There’s a narrow exception for automakers that haven’t yet sold 200,000 electric vehicles. Those companies would retain access to the new vehicle credit for one more year, offering a brief lifeline to newer or smaller EV manufacturers still ramping up production.

Genevieve Cullen, president of the Electric Drive Transportation Association, didn’t mince words in criticizing the proposal. Calling it “catastrophically short-sighted,” Cullen warned that pulling back on federal EV incentives would cede ground to international competitors—especially China—and could deliver a blow to domestic innovation, manufacturing, and job creation. “It’s an enormous market advantage for China at America’s expense,” she said.

This year alone, the U.S. Treasury handed out more than $2 billion in point-of-sale EV rebates, making these incentives a key part of the Biden administration’s clean energy strategy. The House proposal doesn’t completely pull the plug on all EV-related incentives. It keeps a critical battery production tax credit in place, which is vital for automakers and battery suppliers looking to expand U.S.-based operations. However, there’s a catch. Starting in 2027, vehicles with components made by certain Chinese companies or even using Chinese-licensed technology could be barred from receiving that credit. That provision could hit American automakers like Ford and Tesla, who have licensing arrangements with Chinese battery firms.

In addition to tax credits, the Republican plan also aims to dismantle a loan program that supports the development and manufacturing of advanced technology vehicles. The program has helped fund large-scale battery plant projects across the country, with billions already committed to joint ventures involving Ford, Stellantis, Samsung SDI, and Rivian. These loans were finalized during the final months of President Biden’s term and were seen as a cornerstone of the administration’s effort to supercharge America’s EV transition.

If passed, the proposal would also rescind corporate average fuel economy (CAFE) standards and greenhouse gas rules set to take effect in 2027 and beyond. That part of the legislation is expected to be reviewed by the Energy and Commerce Committee in the coming weeks.

This push from House Republicans reflects broader political tensions around clean energy policy and federal spending. While proponents of the reform argue it’s time to let the EV market stand on its own without government intervention, critics fear the rollback could halt the progress the U.S. has made in electrifying its transportation sector. With China and the European Union accelerating their own EV investments, the decisions made in the coming months could have lasting implications for the U.S. auto industry and its competitiveness on the global stage.

There are 47 different Biden-era energy regulations set to be eliminated, including water pressure, air pollution, gas stoves and auto emissions.

Republican lawmakers say the new measures are driving up costs and lowering the quality of life for Americans, while Democrats say otherwise. There has not been a clear answer on what, or if, there will be any cost savings.

House Republicans killed a Democrat-backed amendment that called for a cost analysis study to find out what the average American would save under the plan. According to the Government Accountability Office, in 2024, efficiency standards saved the average American household about $576 on water and gas bills.

The GAO also reported that total energy consumption was down 6.4% and public water use dropped by 12.5%.

Some of the 47 regulations on the chopping block include fast-tracking permitting for oil and gas infrastructure by allowing companies to pay fees to win approvals, and on a household level, energy conservation standards for microwaves, water use standards for faucets and design requirements for ovens and stoves would all be rescinded.

Some experts say the rollbacks likely won’t make things cheaper and benefit consumers.

“I don’t think any of these rollbacks will have any significant short to medium term implications on the costs to the consumer,” Carolyn Kissane, associate dean at NYU’s Center for Global Affairs, said. “Partially, that is because many of those appliances are already in production and they’re not going to suddenly change production or standards.”

While water standards aren’t being scrapped entirely, they are being tweaked to be more friendly towards utility companies. The limits on three different PFAS, or forever chemicals, in water are being removed and reconsidered by the Environmental Protection Agency.

The Biden administration set the first federal drinking water limits for PFAS, or perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances, finding they increased the risk of cardiovascular disease, certain cancers and babies being born with low birth weight. Those limits on PFAS, which are human-made and don’t easily break down in nature, were expected to reduce their levels for millions of people.

Limits on three types of PFAS, including what are known as GenX substances found in North Carolina, will be scrapped and reconsidered by the agency, as will a limit on a mixture of several types of PFAS.

The Biden administration’s rule also set standards for the two common types of PFAS, referred to as PFOA and PFOS, at 4 parts per trillion, effectively the lowest level at which they can be reliably detected. The EPA will keep those standards, but give utilities two extra years — until 2031 — to comply.

“We are on a path to uphold the agency’s nationwide standards to protect Americans from PFOA and PFOS in their water. At the same time, we will work to provide common-sense flexibility in the form of additional time for compliance,” said EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin.

The development was first reported by The Washington Post.

Large scale changes and utility pushback

It appears few utilities will be impacted by the withdrawal of limits for certain, newer types of PFAS. So far, sampling has found nearly 12% of U.S. water utilities are above the Biden administration’s limits. But most utilities face problems with PFOA or PFOS.

Health advocates praised Biden’s administration for the limits. But water utilities complained, saying treatment systems are expensive and that customers will end up paying more. The utilities sued the EPA.

The EPA’s actions align with some arguments in the utilities’ lawsuit. They argued the EPA lacked authority to regulate a mixture of PFAS and said the agency didn’t properly support limits on several newer types of PFAS that the EPA now plans to rescind. They also sought the two-year extension.

Erik Olson, a senior strategist at the nonprofit Natural Resources Defense Council, said the move is illegal. The Safe Water Drinking Act gives the EPA authority to limit water contaminants, and it includes a provision meant to prevent new rules from being looser than previous ones.

“With a stroke of the pen, EPA is making a mockery of the Trump administration’s promise to deliver clean water for Americans,” Olson said.

President Donald Trump has sought fewer environmental rules and more oil and gas development. EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin has carried out that agenda by announcing massive regulatory rollbacks. The EPA plans to loosen regulations for greenhouse gas emissions, cleanup standards for coal plant waste and car emission limits, among many other clean air and water rules.

Zeldin’s history with PFAS is more nuanced; during his time as a New York congressman, he supported legislation to regulate forever chemicals.

Evidence of harm builds and so does the cost

Manufactured by companies like Chemours and 3M, PFAS were incredibly useful in many applications -– among them, helping clothes to withstand rain and ensuring that firefighting foam snuffed out flames. But the chemicals also accumulate in the body. As science advanced in recent years, evidence of harm at far lower levels became clearer.

The Biden-era EPA estimated the rule will cost about $1.5 billion to implement each year. Water utility associations say the costs, combined with recent mandates to replace lead pipes, will raise residents’ bills and fall hardest on small communities with few resources.

The Biden administration did work to address cost concerns. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law provided $9 billion for chemicals like PFAS, utilities have won multibillion-dollar settlements against PFAS polluters.

Utilities see partial relief, activists see a backslide

Some utilities have been surprised to find out they are over limits. And small water providers might struggle with compliance costs and expertise.

“This gives water pros more time to deal with the ones we know are bad, and we are going to need more time. Some utilities are just finding out now where they stand,” said Mike McGill, president of WaterPIO, a water industry communications firm.

Some utilities wanted a higher limit on PFOA and PFOS, according to Mark White, drinking water leader at the engineering firm CDM Smith. He suspects the utility industry will continue to sue over those limits. Environmental groups will likely file challenges, too.

Melanie Benesh, vice president of government affairs at the nonprofit Environmental Working Group, said utilities may not have to install treatment that’s as broadly effective if they just have to focus on two types of older PFAS.

“You really reduce what utilities have to do to make sure that the other, newer generation PFAS are captured” she said.

When the Biden administration announced its rule, the head of the EPA traveled to North Carolina and was introduced by activist Emily Donovan, who said she was grateful for the first federal standards. She had long campaigned for tougher rules for GenX substances that had contaminated a local river.

Now the EPA says it will roll back those GenX limits.

“This current administration promised voters it would ‘Make America Healthy Again’ but rescinding part of the PFAS drinking water standards does no such thing,” she said.

Today, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) announced that it intends to revoke and delay federal restrictions on PFAS in drinking water. Communities across the country continue to grapple with severe PFAS contamination in their drinking water, despite well-documented harms to human health caused by these toxic chemicals.

EPA intends to roll back the 2024 landmark regulations that set drinking water standards for the ‘forever chemicals’ known as GenX, PFNA, PFBS, and PFHxS. The agency also intends to delay the standards for PFOA and PFOS until 2031. Just last year, EPA determined that the standards for these 6 PFAS were necessary to protect public health and feasible to implement. EPA’s new plan would eliminate or substantially delay urgently needed protections for up to 105 million people across the country whose drinking water is contaminated with PFAS at levels exceeding the 2024 standards.

After decades of advocacy, communities harmed by PFAS contamination celebrated EPA’s 2024 standards—the first federal regulations to address widespread contamination of drinking water with PFAS. But lobbying groups for water utilities and chemical companies sued EPA to overturn the 2024 standards. That litigation is ongoing, and eight community groups represented by Earthjustice have intervened in the lawsuit to defend the 2024 standards.

“The Trump Administration’s decision to green light the continued pollution of our drinking water with toxic PFAS while crowing about their commitment to making America healthy is a sick joke,” said Earthjustice attorney Katherine O’Brien. “This is an illegal and cynical move that will needlessly perpetuate the epidemic of disease from PFAS contamination across our country.”

PFAS don’t easily break down and can persist in our bodies and the environment for decades or more. EPA has known for decades that PFAS endangers human health. The chemicals—which are found in the drinking water consumed by more than half the U.S. population—are associated with serious health harms. Research links PFAS exposure to a wide range of serious health issues, including kidney and testicular cancer, endocrine disruption, and immune system suppression.

Quotes from our clients:

“This current administration promised voters it would ‘Make America Healthy Again’ but rescinding part of the PFAS drinking water standards does no such thing. It’s disrespectful to PFAS contaminated communities who have suffered debilitating illnesses and devastating losses,” said Emily Donovan, co-founder of Clean Cape Fear in North Carolina. “This is a clear victory for the trillion-dollar chemical industry–not public health. Americans need to call their members of congress immediately and demand action.”

“As a PFAS impacted community advocate who has been engaged in federal policy since the first ever EPA PFAS listening session in New Hampshire, I am stunned at this administration’s course moving us backwards. The national water standards for six PFAS are based on the most rigorous science and the EPA is fully aware of the harm to health from drinking water exposure,” said Laurene Allen, founder of Merrimack Citizens for Clean Water and 2025 Goldman Prize winner. “We are exposed as a class, keeping the focus on two legacy PFAS ignores the immense body of toxicological evidence the EPA has accrued is a travesty. In an administration that claims they will ‘Make America Healthy Again’, today’s announcement is an insulting action that shows how reality is being manipulated for profits.”",https://earthjustice.org/wp-content/uploads/earthjustice-logo-1200-1.png,N,,2025-05-14 13:14:29.385679

Washington – Today, EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin announced that the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) was rolling back protections on PFAS in drinking water. The rules, set by the Biden administration last year, would have required the removal of six prevalent types of PFAS from drinking water systems throughout the country. Zeldin intends to rescind limits on four of those – PFHxS, PFNA, HFPO-DA (known as GenX) and PFBS – while delaying the remaining two (PFOA and PFOS). The compliance deadline for the limits on PFOA and PFOS will be delayed for two years, until 2031, and a new rule will be issued that also establishes a federal exemption framework.

The announcement was made by EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin, who has repeatedly stated support for stronger PFAS protections and even voted for the PFAS Action Act of 2021 to address PFAS contamination while serving in the U.S. House.

In response, Mary Grant, water program director at Food & Water Watch issued the following statement:

“Today’s decision is a shameful and dangerous capitulation to industry pressure that will allow continued contamination of our drinking water with toxic PFAS. This will cost lives.

“Zeldin and the Trump administration are illegally gutting basic water safety protections, blaming the cost of upgrades to comply with those important public health rules. Yet just last week the administration proposed to virtually eliminate the main source of federal funding that would help make the necessary water system improvements to protect from PFAS.

“Once again, the Trump administration has demonstrated that its priority is bending to corporate interests, not protecting the safety and wellbeing of everyday people. Nothing is safe from Trump’s greed-driven agenda — not even our drinking water.”

Known as “forever chemicals,” PFAS are lab-made chemicals that have been linked to a large range of health problems including various cancers, altered hormone levels, decreased birth weights, digestive inflammation, and reduced vaccine response. New research comes out almost every day that indicates no amount is safe. It is estimated that about half of all Americans are regularly exposed to PFAS contamination through their drinking water.

Last year, after decades of community organizing, the Biden EPA finalized long-awaited protections to remove six types of PFAS from drinking water. In April 2024, the EPA set maximum contaminant levels (MCLs) for PFOA and PFOS of 4 ppt each; MCLs for PFHxS, PFNA and GenX at 10 ppt, and limits on a combination of four PFAS types (PFNA, PFHxS, PFBS and GenX) based on a hazard index. Utilities had five years to comply with the new limits.

Today’s decision to rollback the Biden EPA’s rules was in response to a consolidated lawsuit from water utility associations and industrial associations, including the National Association of Manufacturers, the American Chemistry Council and Chemours. The chemical lobby has long-fought regulations on these toxic substances, while not disclosing a growing body of evidence linking their products to serious health problems. A Food & Water Watch report found the chemical industry spent more than $110 million from 2019-2022 alone on lobbying Congress on scores of bills, including many to address the crisis of PFAS contamination throughout the country. The Trump administration has stacked the EPA with former executives and staff from the American Chemistry Council, including Nancy Beck and Lynn Ann Dekleva and lawyers like David Fotouhi, who have defended companies from PFAS pollution claims.

As a result of today’s action, the EPA is seeking to delay action to protect drinking water that will lead to the proposal of weaker protections. Although the EPA intends to defend the PFOS and PFOA regulations from court challenges, it also intends to propose a new rule this Fall and finalize it in the Spring of 2026. The Safe Drinking Water Act, however, has strong provisions barring the weakening existing drinking water regulations, so efforts to gut the existing PFAS rules should expect legal opposition. Further complicating matters, the Trump administration has issued an executive order requiring 10 rules to be tossed for every new regulation issued, making the future of any new PFAS protection uncertain.",https://www.foodandwaterwatch.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/press_header_cleanwater_7b.png,N,,2025-05-14 12:22:21.198129

The White House’s EPA budget shows an absolute and irreverent disregard for their responsibilities to the American people.
And, let’s not forget the Clean Air Act hotline set up for companies to request presidential waivers.
Question 7 According to post-2024 election polling data, 88% of voters, including 81% of Trump voters, support maintaining or increasing EPA funding.
Congress can and should hold Administrator Zeldin accountable During this week’s hearings with Administrator Zeldin, Congress should stand up and take back the power of the purse.","U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Administrator Lee Zeldin is set to testify before Congress this week, and he should be held accountable for decimating bedrock environmental protections that keep our air clean, the water we drink safe, waterways we swim and fish in clean, and soil unpolluted, as he oversees massive staffing and budget cuts, an assault on agency science, and unprecedented loopholes for polluters.

The rhetoric from this administration that mischaracterizes core public health and environmental programs as wasteful or ideologically driven is a dangerous distortion of reality. Framing environmental protection as excessive or radical is a deliberate tactic to discredit science, weaken enforcement, and strip communities—especially frontline and low-income communities—of essential protections against pollution, climate risk, and environmental injustice.

In addition to all the harms that have already happened, now President Trump’s “skinny” budget for fiscal year 2026 proposes cutting EPA funding by a massive 54.5%, or $4.2 billion, and includes harmful, anti-science provisions such as cutting funding for state clean and drinking water programs, the hazardous substance Superfund program, and even removing air monitors at National Parks. If implemented, these cuts would represent a reckless and deeply unpopular assault on the health and safety of all Americans. Despite holding the power of the purse, Congress has thus far put up little resistance to President Trump’s overreach.

Zeldin’s unprecedented assault on the EPA’s ability to deliver on its mission is entirely designed to prop up big polluters, including fossil fuel interests—while the rest of us pay the price. The American public—across the political spectrum—support clean air, water and land. According to a 2024 post-election poll sponsored by Environmental Protection Network, 88% of all voters, and 81% of Trump voters want Congress to increase EPA funding or at least keep funding steady.

As Zeldin goes up before Congress, here’s what lawmakers could ask him.

Question one

How do you expect to protect clean air, water and lands while acquiescing to the lowest EPA funding levels since the 1980s, including steep cuts to critical environmental programs, which would inevitably put our children’s health at risk and place the burden of cleanup on future generations?

President Trump’s proposed budget will put children, seniors, and frontline workers in harm’s way, and Congress should reject it. Cutting EPA’s budget by greater than 50% will result in higher asthma rates, more contaminated water systems, and delayed cleanups of toxic sites. And from a historical perspective, these cuts would lower EPA funding to levels not seen since the early years of EPA’s history (EPA was formed under President Richard Nixon in 1970) when its statutory mandate was much narrower.

Over the past 40 years, regardless of political persuasion, presidential administrations have generally recognized EPA’s vital function and funded it accordingly. The Trump 2026 proposal constitutes an abdication of environmental governance and mocks the thoughtful, intentional, hard-fought process of setting up a system upholding public health priorities.

The White House’s EPA budget shows an absolute and irreverent disregard for their responsibilities to the American people. There’s a proposed 89 percent cut to EPA’s bipartisan water infrastructure programs. And major cuts to noncompetitive state passthrough grants.

No doubt, states will be forced to shoulder responsibilities once backed by robust federal programs, from clean water enforcement to toxic site cleanups, all while facing rising pollution, public health crises, and climate-related disasters. The result will be patchwork protections, deepening inequities, and greater risk for every community, especially those least able to absorb the blow.

Imagine the smokestack across the state line making your child’s asthma attacks worse, or your swim in the river unsafe because of water pollution from the state upstream.

Question 2

During your confirmation hearing, you promised to “defer to scientists,” yet you have repeatedly undercut science-based public health protections, distorted scientific facts and undermined scientific expertise at the EPA. How do you intend to ensure that the EPA’s actions to protect our health are guided by the best available science?

Administrator Zeldin is also seeking to undermine and eliminate scientific expertise and evidence, giving the Trump administration a way to avoid taking action to cut pollution despite the overwhelming proof of harms to people. By bypassing regulatory processes and silencing scientific expertise, the Trump administration is seeking to gut efforts to address the impacts and economic damage caused by climate change, and the impacts of toxics exposures to the American people. All to protect the profits of the oil, gas and chemical industries at our expense.

Question 3

You say the environment will be safer for all and “a cleaner planet for future generations”. How will EPA protect communities most in danger from pollution if there is no staff or budget in the environmental justice program left to help while you expend taxpayer dollars to dig up dirt for your appeals in the courts?

The EPA’s environmental justice office was created to challenge the historic pattern of pollution disproportionately harming low-income communities and communities of color. The office’s work is based on robust research that identifies communities most affected by pollution. Scientific data shows that, due to historic and ongoing injustices, communities overburdened by polluting industries, smog-forming traffic, and contaminated waterways and soil are home to predominantly low-income, Black, Brown and Indigenous people. Exposure to consistently higher levels of pollution increases the risk of asthma, heart and lung ailments, cancer and even death. Prioritizing limited public resources into the most overburdened communities is efficient governance.

EPA received $3 billion for Climate and Environmental Justice Block Grants through the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) and also had been given clear direction from the previous administration to more fairly distribute the benefits of environmental protections across the country. After doing their jobs of getting sorely needed money to communities, while complying with abundant government regulations on contracts and grants, employees were vilified, and their grantees were denied their rightfully executed funding agreements. Promises made were broken. Despite numerous court orders to turn IRA funding back on, Zeldin’s EPA has repeatedly denied funding, and instead terminated nearly 800 grants, all with environmental justice in the descriptions, without demonstrating mismanagement or negligence. Although an agency official stated that they did “an individualized, grant-by-grant review” to satisfy court orders, it is hard to see how that was possible.

Not only has Zeldin gone after the $3 billion IRA Climate and Environmental Justice grants, he has targeted $20 million of the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund. He has repeatedly alleged falsehoods and set the investigative power of government on a witch hunt to find fraud, waste and abuse. It seems that EPA and the Trump administration would rather search for evidence to support their legal appeals, while communities suffer the effects of climate change caused by the very greenhouse gases this program was designed to prevent.

Simultaneously, Zeldin’s team has announced their intent to shutter EPA’s Office of Environmental Justice and External Civil Rights (OEJECR) and regional environmental justice divisions by laying off or reorganizing staff effective July 31. This means leaving those living, working, studying, and playing near polluting industries, smog-forming traffic, and contaminated waterways and soil with little support from the very agency they rely on to enforce protective laws.

Thousands of people have been intimidated into resigning through the Department of Government Efficiency’s (DOGE) infamous “fork in the road,” terminating recent hires, suggesting all scientists be reclassified from positions with career civil service protections into ones that allow for easy removal, much like political positions (formerly known as “Schedule F”). The words of Russell Vought, the head of the White House Office of Management and Budget, about intentionally traumatizing federal workers, should set off alarm bells of our appropriators in Congress.

Once again, the Trump administration is sidelining both science and programs to assist the nation’s most overburdened people.

Question 4

Bedrock clean air and water protections are designed to take account of the latest science, but you’ve signaled your intent to scrap science-based standards and question the scope of EPA’s clear statutory obligations. Are you planning on taking EPA’s Office of Air and Radiation back to the 1970s?

The EPA’s Office of Air and Radiation (OAR) leads a large share of the regulatory work of EPA, required by the Clean Air Act statute. In the 1970s the Clean Air Act covered only four chemicals, now it’s in the hundreds – not to mention the threat of climate change.

A recent study showed that rollbacks of just a subset of these regulations would lead to nearly 200,000 premature deaths by 2050 (think 20 sports arenas-full) and at least 10,000 asthma attacks every day. And the cost? For every dollar saved by corporate polluters, it would create six dollars of cost to the public from things like health care bills and the loss of a longer, healthier life—and that doesn’t even capture many known but difficult to quantify impacts.

The work of the OAR is being threatened through a drastic reorganization plan, which seeks to eliminate its Atmospheric Protection Program and disrupt other parts. The reorganization is planned with Zeldin on record saying there will be a focus on state air programs (a.k.a. expedited permitting of polluting projects). UCS has been tracking the administration’s deregulatory agenda, focusing on key regulations such as carbon rules for power plants and those limiting vehicle emissions.

Zeldin is also proposing to eradicate the climate-related voluntary programs, like the industry supported, popular Energy Star appliance labeling program that delivers huge benefits for consumers’ pocketbooks. He would also eliminate reporting programs for greenhouse gases.

Question 5

How do you expect businesses to navigate the unfair playing field you have created and stay competitive when some have complied with regulations and others can look for a free pass?

The EPA’s Office of Enforcement and Compliance Assurance and all regional enforcement directors received notice in March that they should not follow any previous guidance documents, particularly where there are EJ concerns. Moreover, they have specific limitations on enforcing for example, methane releases coal ash contamination, reducing air toxics and pollution, and reducing risks of chemical accidents. The preeminence of oil and gas industry interests is laced throughout, as further detailed by my colleague Julie McNamara.

The effect? Enforcement cases have already dropped compared to prior administrations. Not only that, the President’s skinny budget would erase $1 billion in categorical (noncompetitive) grants across all 50 states, which provide the funding to enforce federal clean air, water, and waste rules.

And, let’s not forget the Clean Air Act hotline set up for companies to request presidential waivers. These waivers ensure that certain favored companies can operate outside the law.

Question 6

Can you explain how you plan on meeting EPA’s mission that demands unbiased science while cutting the Office of Research and Development’s budget and proposing to dismantle it?

EPA’s Research and Development Office produces independent science that’s used to keep people safe from pollution and chemical exposure. Industry doesn’t always like what’s coming out of this office. Dismantling this office by cutting its budget by $235 million and planning to remove more than 1,000 staff is a dangerous move during a period of intensifying environmental threats, wildfires, flooding, and other climate change impacts.

UCS has pointed out the threats to human health and the environment from the loss of a one-of-its-kind program, the Integrated Risk Information System (IRIS), which provides independent reviews of chemicals like formaldehyde or ethylene oxide tied to certain health effects, like cancer. IRIS assessments are known to be a gold standard in toxicity reviews. Read this fact sheet for more information.

Question 7

According to post-2024 election polling data, 88% of voters, including 81% of Trump voters, support maintaining or increasing EPA funding. So, who exactly is served by these cuts, and why are you ignoring the public’s clear demand for stronger environmental protections?

If Administrator Zeldin goes forward with this destructive move, he will be responsible for ending decades of work intended to help set right the harmful legacy of pollution in overburdened communities in a handout to big polluters. This is also part of the Trump administration’s larger ongoing strategy to dismantle EPA and its core functions and undermine its very mission, which is to help keep all people in America safe.

Congress can and should hold Administrator Zeldin accountable

During this week’s hearings with Administrator Zeldin, Congress should stand up and take back the power of the purse. Congress must see the proposed budget for the sham that it is and hold Zeldin accountable for his promises to protect public health and the environment during his confirmation hearings. Members of Congress must show Zeldin they understand—even if he’s forgotten— the importance of EPA as a longstanding investment in our health and safety, and see through the ruse of “fiscal responsibility” and “streamlining” as just code words to gut the agency. The administration knows, and history shows, that industry will not regulate itself.

We urge lawmakers to reject these shortsighted and harmful reductions, restore critical EPA funding, and reaffirm the federal commitment to public health, environmental justice, and scientific integrity. If they don’t act, under Zeldin’s watch, the very mission of the agency will be subverted—from protecting public health, environmental justice and scientific integrity to becoming an instrument of unchecked polluting industry interests. The cost of inaction will be measured in lives, livelihoods, and long-term environmental damage.",https://blog.ucs.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Copy-of-Blog-Lead-Image-Template192.jpg,N,,2025-05-14 12:22:25.633480

The U.S. EPA will roll back significant parts of the National Primary Drinking Water Regulation by rescinding four of the six chemicals named in the regulation.

The agency announced on Wednesday it will rescind and “reconsider” regulations for PFHxS, PFNA, PFBS and HFPO-DA, commonly known as GenX. EPA says it plans to keep regulations for two other chemicals in the standard: PFOA and PFOS.

The announcement rolls back major parts of the drinking water rule set under the Biden administration last April, which set legally enforceable limits for the six types of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances in drinking water. The EPA has said PFAS exposure can cause numerous health problems.

The drinking water rules have become the default standard for treating a range of wastewater categories. The standards are relevant to waste facility operators because of how the rules might affect leachate management and groundwater monitoring efforts, as well as how these facilities interact with wastewater treatment facilities. The regulations also represent business opportunities for waste companies that service industrial clients.

The EPA now plans to extend compliance deadlines for PFOA and PFOS, saying it would give drinking water system operators more time to develop plans for complying with maximum contaminant levels (MCLs) for the two chemicals.

The agency is planning a new rulemaking process to propose extending that compliance date from 2029 to 2031. EPA said it may issue the proposed rule sometime this fall and finalize the rule in spring of 2026.

As part of the drinking water standard review, EPA says it will also step up its outreach to water utilities, especially in rural and small communities and those that need capital improvements to be able to reduce PFOS and PFOA levels to the current MCL.

The new initiative, dubbed the PFAS Outreach Initiative, aims to offer “resources, tools, funding, and technical assistance to help utilities meet the federal drinking water standards,” it said. The agency also acknowledged that it sees these utilities as “passive receivers"" of PFAS, a term waste industry groups also say applies to their operations. Administrator Lee Zeldin has said he believes the EPA should support a “polluter pays” model that helps passive receivers avoid major costs to treating or mitigating PFAS at their facilities.

That move comes weeks after Zeldin told reporters he was reviewing concerns from water utilities and lawmakers about how to meet the upcoming compliance deadlines.

The agency also noted it would work toward building a “federal exemption framework,” but it’s unclear what the framework would entail or who would be eligible.

The EPA also continues to face litigation over the drinking water rules. The American Water Works Association and Association of Metropolitan Water Agencies sued the agency last year, saying the EPA did not use the most up-to-date data when crafting the standard and raised questions over whether the rule was consistent with the Safe Drinking Water Act. That case is expected to be back in court in a few weeks after the EPA requested an abeyance on Monday.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/0FQTQPHeP4q8fiP2vjk5ZH8U3TgXdqKSJO1MRVWhQEI/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9HZXR0eUltYWdlcy0yMTY3MDM4NzIzLmpwZw==.webp,N,,2025-05-14 12:22:29.032101

Large scale changes and utility pushback

It appears few utilities will be impacted by the withdrawal of limits for certain, newer types of PFAS. So far, sampling has found nearly 12% of U.S. water utilities are above the Biden administration’s limits. But most utilities face problems with PFOA or PFOS.

Health advocates praised Biden’s administration for the limits. But water utilities complained, saying treatment systems are expensive and that customers will end up paying more. The utilities sued the EPA.

The EPA’s actions align with some arguments in the utilities’ lawsuit. They argued the EPA lacked authority to regulate a mixture of PFAS and said the agency didn’t properly support limits on several newer types of PFAS that the EPA now plans to rescind. They also sought the two-year extension.

Erik Olson, a senior strategist at the nonprofit Natural Resources Defense Council, said the move is illegal. The Safe Water Drinking Act gives the EPA authority to limit water contaminants, and it includes a provision meant to prevent new rules from being looser than previous ones.

“With a stroke of the pen, EPA is making a mockery of the Trump administration’s promise to deliver clean water for Americans,” Olson said.

President Donald Trump has sought fewer environmental rules and more oil and gas development. EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin has carried out that agenda by announcing massive regulatory rollbacks. The EPA plans to loosen regulations for greenhouse gas emissions, cleanup standards for coal plant waste and car emission limits, among many other clean air and water rules.

Zeldin’s history with PFAS is more nuanced; during his time as a New York congressman, he supported legislation to regulate forever chemicals.

Evidence of harm builds and so does the cost

Manufactured by companies like Chemours and 3M, PFAS were incredibly useful in many applications -– among them, helping clothes to withstand rain and ensuring that firefighting foam snuffed out flames. But the chemicals also accumulate in the body. As science advanced in recent years, evidence of harm at far lower levels became clearer.

The Biden-era EPA estimated the rule will cost about $1.5 billion to implement each year. Water utility associations say the costs, combined with recent mandates to replace lead pipes, will raise residents’ bills and fall hardest on small communities with few resources.

The Biden administration did work to address cost concerns. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law provided $9 billion for chemicals like PFAS, utilities have won multibillion-dollar settlements against PFAS polluters.

Utilities see partial relief, activists see a backslide

Some utilities have been surprised to find out they are over limits. And small water providers might struggle with compliance costs and expertise.

“This gives water pros more time to deal with the ones we know are bad, and we are going to need more time. Some utilities are just finding out now where they stand,” said Mike McGill, president of WaterPIO, a water industry communications firm.

Some utilities wanted a higher limit on PFOA and PFOS, according to Mark White, drinking water leader at the engineering firm CDM Smith. He suspects the utility industry will continue to sue over those limits. Environmental groups will likely file challenges, too.

Melanie Benesh, vice president of government affairs at the nonprofit Environmental Working Group, said utilities may not have to install treatment that’s as broadly effective if they just have to focus on two types of older PFAS.

“You really reduce what utilities have to do to make sure that the other, newer generation PFAS are captured” she said.

When the Biden administration announced its rule, the head of the EPA traveled to North Carolina and was introduced by activist Emily Donovan, who said she was grateful for the first federal standards. She had long campaigned for tougher rules for GenX substances that had contaminated a local river.

Now the EPA says it will roll back those GenX limits.

“This current administration promised voters it would ‘Make America Healthy Again’ but rescinding part of the PFAS drinking water standards does no such thing,” she said.

Biden Jr. had, for the first time, required water utilities to start bringing down levels of six types of PFAS chemicals to near zero.
The Trump administration said it would uphold the limits for those two types of PFAS, but would delay a deadline for water utilities to meet those limits by two years, to 2031.
Government studies of private wells and public water systems have detected PFAS chemicals in nearly half the tap water in the country.
Under the Biden-era rules, water utilities were required to monitor their water supplies for PFAS chemicals.
“This current administration promised voters it would ‘Make America Healthy Again,’ but rescinding part of the PFAS drinking water standards does no such thing,” she said.","The Environmental Protection Agency said Wednesday that it would uphold drinking water standards for two harmful “forever chemicals,” present in the tap water of millions of Americans. But it said it would delay deadlines to meet those standards and roll back limits on four other related chemicals.

Known as forever chemicals because of their virtually indestructible nature, PFAS are a class of thousands of chemicals used widely in everyday products like nonstick cookware, water-repellent clothing and stain-resistant carpets, as well as in firefighting foams.

Exposure to PFAS, or per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, has been associated with metabolic disorders, decreased fertility in women, developmental delays in children and increased risk of some prostate, kidney and testicular cancers, according to the E.P.A.

President Joseph R. Biden Jr. had, for the first time, required water utilities to start bringing down levels of six types of PFAS chemicals to near zero. He set a particularly stringent limit of four parts per trillion for two of those chemicals, called PFOA and PFOS, which are most commonly found in drinking water systems.

The Trump administration said it would uphold the limits for those two types of PFAS, but would delay a deadline for water utilities to meet those limits by two years, to 2031.

The E.P.A. said it would rescind the limits for the other four chemicals.

“We are on a path to uphold the agency’s nationwide standards to protect Americans from PFOA and PFOS in their water,” Lee Zeldin, the E.P.A. administrator, said in a statement. “At the same time, we will work to provide common-sense flexibility in the form of additional time for compliance,” he said. “EPA will also continue to use its regulatory and enforcement tools to hold polluters accountable.”

The move to weaken some PFAS limits came after trade groups representing the chemicals industry, as well as water utilities, had challenged the Biden-era limits, saying they created an impossible standard that would cost municipal water agencies billions of dollars to meet.

The chemicals are so ubiquitous that they can be found in the blood of almost every person in the United States. Government studies of private wells and public water systems have detected PFAS chemicals in nearly half the tap water in the country.

Under the Biden-era rules, water utilities were required to monitor their water supplies for PFAS chemicals. And they were required to notify the public, and work to bring contamination levels down, if levels exceeded set thresholds: four parts per trillion for PFOA and PFOS, and 10 parts per trillion for four others.

Those four chemicals include GenX, once thought to be a safer alternative to PFOA, but which has now been linked in animal studies to damage to the liver, kidneys and immune system, as well as to developmental problems and cancer. The others are PFHxS and PFNA, as well as PFBS, a mixture of the chemicals, which have also all been linked to adverse health effects.

The agency said it planned to begin a new rule-making process for the four chemicals in the fall, and to issue the new rule next spring.

The administration’s plans were first reported by The Washington Post.

Health and environmental advocates criticized the move.

“This is a clear victory for the trillion-dollar chemical industry, not public health,” said Emily Donovan, a co-founder of Clean Cape Fear, an environmental group that has been working to address GenX and PFAS contamination of the Cape Fear River in North Carolina.

“This current administration promised voters it would ‘Make America Healthy Again,’ but rescinding part of the PFAS drinking water standards does no such thing,” she said. “It’s disrespectful to PFAS contaminated communities who have suffered debilitating illnesses and devastating losses.”

Erik D. Olson, senior strategic director for health at Natural Resources Defense Council, said the E.P.A.’s plan offered “modest consolation.”

But he also said the agency’s effort to roll back drinking water standards violated a no-backsliding provision included in the Safe Drinking Water Act.

“The law is very clear that the E.P.A. can’t repeal or weaken the drinking water standard,” he said. “This action is not only harmful, it’s illegal.”

Industry groups suing the agency over the Biden-era PFAS rules — including the American Water Works Association, the American Chemistry Council and the National Association of Manufacturers — did not immediately provide comment.

But in a statement accompanying the E.P.A.’s announcement, Alan Roberson, executive director of the Association of State Drinking Water Administrators, said he supported the Trump administration’s approach. The association represents drinking water program administrators in 50 states.

Mr. Roberson said states and water systems had been “struggling with the time frames” under the Biden-era rules to test for PFAS and build the necessary filtration infrastructure to start ridding drinking water supplies of the chemicals.

The moves came just weeks after Mr. Zeldin announced a spate of measures to tackle PFAS contamination, including designating an official to lead the agency’s efforts on the chemicals.

The agency said it would also create guidelines for how much PFAS factories could release in their wastewater, and engage with Congress to come up with ways to hold polluters responsible.

Mr. Trump and the White House have also weighed in on the health harms of PFAS, albeit in a document outlining a strategy to rid the country of paper straws.

Maintaining the stringent limits for PFOA and PFOS was still expected to translate to a significant cost burden for water utilities. The E.P.A. had estimated that it would cost utilities about $1.5 billion annually to comply with the rule. Utilities had said that the costs could be twice that amount, and that the public would ultimately foot the bill in the form of increased water rates.

James L. Ferraro, an environmental attorney who represents several water utilities, said the Trump administration’s approach, while representing a compromise, was “not one utilities were necessarily hoping for.”

PFOA and PFOS, for which E.P.A. maintained strict limits, “are by far the most commonly detected, owing to their decades-long, widespread use” and cleaning them up “remains a serious challenge for many utilities,” he said.

Many environmental groups say that the costs of cleaning up PFAS should ultimately be borne by the manufacturers of the chemicals. They point to how chemical companies for decades hid evidence of the dangers of PFAS, according to lawsuits, industry documents and peer-reviewed studies.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/05/14/multimedia/14cli-epa-pfas-hcjw/14cli-epa-pfas-hcjw-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-05-14 12:22:53.742925

v. EPA - Court Documents Water Utility Groups Seek to Dismantle Public Health Protections - Blog Toxic Drinking Water: The PFAS Contamination Crisis - Factsheet","WASHINGTON, D.C. – The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) today announced plans to repeal health standards for four of six toxic PFAS “forever chemicals” found in drinking water and to delay implementation of the remaining two standards, reversing course on a crucial public health rule adopted last year.

About half of the U.S. population is drinking PFAS-contaminated water, including as many as 105 million whose water violates the new standards, and the EPA has known for decades that PFAS endangers human health, including kidney and testicular cancer, liver damage, and harm to the nervous and reproductive systems.

The EPA restricted six PFAS chemicals in April 2024, the first time the agency issued a final rule on its own initiative for unregulated contaminants in tap water in 28 years. The chemical industry, which manufactures these forever chemicals that pollute the nation’s water, sued to block the rule; water utility trade associations, which are responsible for protecting their customers’ health from toxic chemicals in tap water, joined the chemical industry to challenge the PFAS rule. NRDC and its allies are intervenors in that litigation, seeking to protect the standards. The groups are expected to oppose the EPA’s new action, which is unlawful under the Safe Drinking Water Act’s “anti-backsliding” provision, which says the agency cannot legally weaken these rules.

The following are reactions from Erik D. Olson, senior strategic director of health at NRDC (Natural Resources Defense Council), and Dr. Anna Reade, director of PFAS advocacy at NRDC:

“With a stroke of the pen, the EPA is making a mockery of the Trump administration’s promise to deliver clean water for Americans. More than 100 million people are drinking water contaminated with ‘forever chemicals,’ which can cause cancer, harm fetuses and kids, and pose other health hazards. But now the administration is going to toss out most of these long-sought protections and allow this contamination to continue unabated all at the behest of the chemical industry and water utilities. With this action, the EPA is making clear that it’s willing to ignore Americans who just want to turn on their kitchen taps and have clean, safe water. The EPA’s plan to retain but delay standards for two legacy 'forever chemicals' may offer modest consolation to some, but throwing out protections against four others will be devastating. The law is very clear that the EPA can't repeal or weaken the drinking water standard. This action is not only harmful, it’s illegal,"" said Olson.

“The federal government knows toxic ‘forever chemicals’ are dangerous to our health and it’s well established that drinking water is a major route of exposure to PFAS for many people. The PFAS crisis is immense, and we need more action, not less, to protect people from this extraordinary environmental and public health threat,” said Reade.

Background:

Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are a class of thousands of synthetic chemicals that are widely used in an array of consumer, commercial, and industrial products due to their ability to withstand heat and repel water and stains. Also known as “forever chemicals,” PFAS are extremely persistent in the environment and can accumulate in humans or animals. PFAS exposure is linked to many negative health effects at extremely low levels of exposure, including but not limited to kidney and testicular cancer, liver and kidney damage, changes in hormone and lipid levels, and harm to the nervous and reproductive systems.

After decades of advocacy on the part of environmental and public health advocates, the EPA proposed in March 2023 to regulate six PFAS chemicals in drinking water. In April 2024, the agency concluded there is no safe level of PFOA or PFOS exposure, and the final rule covered six PFAS chemicals in total, and set individual limits for five PFAS chemicals and a limit on mixtures of four PFAS chemicals. The rule also requires water systems to monitor for the six regulated PFAS chemicals and publicly communicate their compliance with the new limits, while giving them the law’s maximum compliance time of five years to comply by April 2029. The rule is a long overdue step to address a public health crisis that threatens millions of people nationwide.

The EPA reportedly plans to repeal four of the six PFAS drinking water standards—those for GenX (the forever chemical that contaminates the drinking water source of 500,000 people in North Carolina), as well as for PFHxS, PFNA, and the hazard index, which includes PFBS. The agency says it plans to extend the compliance deadline for the other two legacy PFAS covered by the rules (PFOA and PFOS) by 2 years from 2029 to 2031.

In the end, Newberry supported the Bay Legacy bill.
State officials, advocates fear impact of expected Medicaid cuts in House bill “Maryland will always be a safe haven for abortion access,” Moore said.","Gov. Wes Moore (D) signed what he called “the most comprehensive piece of Chesapeake Bay legislation that Maryland has seen in years,” at a time when federal cuts threaten environmental programs for the estuary.

The Chesapeake Bay Legacy Act was signed Tuesday, one of 171 bills signed into law at the fourth and next-to-last bill signing ceremony following the 2025 legislative session.

The wide-ranging Legacy Act allots “up to $900,000 per year” to a new certification program for farmers who use sustainable practices that decrease runoff into the bay, establishes a water quality monitoring program to unify current testing efforts and aims to streamline oyster aquaculture leasing, among other provisions.

“At a time when we see how our federal administration has stepped back from protecting our air and our water, Maryland is stepping up,” Moore said.

The governor also signed an abortion grant program that will help fund abortion services for uninsured and underinsured individuals, and a bill allowing individuals with autism and other nonapparent conditions to add an identifying symbol to their state IDs. That, and Tuesday saw the approval of a new state mineral, chromite, and a new state cocktail, the Orange Crush.

Chesapeake Bay Legacy Act

President Donald Trump (R) and his Department of Government Efficiency have already cut positions at the Chesapeake Bay Program, which administers the bay cleanup, as well as at agencies whose work touches the bay, such as the Environmental Protection Agency and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. DOGE also threw environmental grant programs into chaos by freezing funds, some of which were later unlocked.

But advocates say Trump’s proposed “skinny” budget for fiscal 2026 would go considerably further, and “devastate” efforts to clean up the estuary, according to the Chesapeake Bay Foundation.

A ‘chrometastic’ finish for one state symbol bill

The bill would hack $5 billion from the EPA, including $2.46 billion in cuts that would “cripple” programs that help sewage treatment plants reduce pollution into waterways like the bay, according to CBF. Trump’s proposal would also slash $1.3 billion in grants and research programs at NOAA and $564 million at the U.S. Geological Survey, eliminating climate-related work to “focus on achieving dominance in energy and critical minerals.”

Allison Colden, the bay foundation’s Maryland executive director, said the federal losses make Maryland’s Bay Legacy law even more important.

“With federal cuts and rollbacks looming heavily on our state, Maryland’s environmental leadership is more important than ever,” Colden said in a statement. “This Act will help maintain forward momentum and ensure that investments in clean air, clean water, habitats, and local economies are secured.”

The new law came in a challenging budget year, during which lawmakers had to correct a multibillion-dollar deficit by cutting programs and raising fees.

As drafted, the bill would have allocated $2 million to the Leaders in Environmentally Engaged Farming, or LEEF, program, but budget-conscious lawmakers cut that to “up to $900,000” a year. The budget reconciliation process further reduced the sum to $500,000 for next fiscal year, with some of that money contingent on the Maryland Department of Agriculture submitting a plan for program spending.

“Unfortunately, we saw less coming out of the state budget for that program than maybe we would have liked to see,” Colden said. “But the point is, we have that program established. They have some initial seed funding.”

With funding and other incentives, Agriculture Secretary Kevin Atticks said the LEEF program will encourage farmers not only to pursue environmentally friendly practices, but to engage the community and share information about the practices with others.

“It incentivizes them in a way that we believe farmers and the community will rally behind and will make extra progress,” Atticks said.

As he signed the bill, Moore was backed by Nia Nyamweya, who brought a basket of leafy greens harvested from her Beauty Bloom Farms in Montgomery County. The produce and flower farm aims to regenerate the soils, formerly used for corn and soybean farming, with organic practices and cover cropping, according to its website.

Nyamweya leases her farm land from the Maryland Department of Natural Resources, Moore said. The bill codifies the practice in state law.

“That kind of partnership is rare, but the Bay Legacy Act will make these kinds of lease agreements easier,” Moore said.

The bill drew some early concerns for its massive scope, touching on everything from agricultural practices to a Japanese fish processing technique called ikejime. Delmarva Fisheries Association Chairman Robert Newberry called it “an ag bill with a side salad of fishery management and aquaculture.”

He initially balked at a provision that would have removed DNR’s obligation to produce its own fishery management plans for a variety of species, from white perch and blue crabs to croakers and horseshoe crabs, deferring to plans created by the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission.

The final law requires DNR to keep producing state-level plans for blue crabs, oysters, white and yellow perch, and a few other species, but it lifts the requirement for others, such as menhaden, spot and black sea bass.

In the end, Newberry supported the Bay Legacy bill. In particular, he appreciated an amendment that added specificity to an existing law preventing discrimination against groups of fishermen, adding fishing guides and charter boat captains.

Newberry has been among a group of fisherman fighting rules from the Atlantic States Commission limiting charters to one rockfish per person, beginning last year.

“I wanted to have the fisheries specifically defined,” Newberry said. “So that protects us.”

Abortion grant program

Maryland will also have a new grant program that will help fund abortion services for uninsured and underinsured individuals using a stockpile of unused premium surcharges, now that Moore signed House Bill 930 and Senate Bill 848 into law.

State officials, advocates fear impact of expected Medicaid cuts in House bill

“Maryland will always be a safe haven for abortion access,” Moore said.

The legislation prompts the Department of Health to tap into about $25 million in premium surcharges that were required as part of the federal Affordable Care Act but have not yet been spent down.

That money is the $1-a-month fee that insurers in the ACA marketplace are required to collect on every policy to fund abortion services for their policyholders. But that fund has been growing by about $3 million annually as collections have outpaced need.

Moore said the legislation builds off previous efforts to expand abortion access in the state, calling it the “next chapter in our work to protect and defend basic health care rights.”

Eric’s ID

Moore also signed legislation known as “Eric’s ID Law” that will let people with nonapparent disabilities, including autism, have a butterfly icon added to their driver’s licenses, to alert police officers and other officials that they are interacting with someone with a disability that may not be immediately visible.

Lt. Gov Aruna Miller noted that the “thoughtful and compassionate initiative” was inspired by Eric Carpenter-Grantham, a 20-year-old Montgomery County resident with autism, one of the nonapparent disabilities identified in House Bill 707 and Senate Bill 618.

Eric’s Law has been in the works for several years, in collaboration with members of the disability community, finally receiving House and Senate approval this past session, Senate President Bill Ferguson (D-Baltimore City) noted.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/DSC_0197-2048x1365.jpeg,N,,2025-05-14 12:23:44.073024

Rachel Frazin reports for The Hill.

In short:

Political officials at the EPA have reportedly told scientists to apply for newly posted jobs or risk termination, part of a broad restructuring under the Trump administration.

Internal communications suggest lab research in the Office of Research and Development may halt due to a lack of supplies, though the EPA disputes those claims and says research is ongoing.

The agency aims to cut its workforce by thousands and shift research responsibilities to regulatory offices, sparking concerns about the loss of scientific independence and institutional knowledge.

Key quote:

“Without the evolution of the science …we would see a difference that EPA will do less to protect public health and the environment.”

— Chris Frey, former head of the Office of Research and Development under the Biden administration

Why this matters:

The future of environmental science at the federal level looks increasingly precarious. The Environmental Protection Agency's research arm plays a pivotal role in assessing the health impacts of air and water pollution, chemical exposures, and climate change. Independent, peer-reviewed science underpins the EPA’s regulations, from setting safe drinking water standards to determining which pesticides stay on the market. The downsizing of labs and loss of expert staff would come as the U.S. faces mounting public health challenges from toxic chemicals, extreme weather, and industrial pollution. And shifting research to policy offices risks entangling science with political agendas.",https://assets.rbl.ms/60206925/origin.jpg,N,,2025-05-14 08:08:34.662449

On his first day in office, President Trump signed an executive order halting permits for onshore wind energy projects and leases for offshore wind farms in US coastal waters.
The clean energy boom in the US Clean energy in the US has grown significantly in recent years.
The former government pledged to invest $370 billion (€330 billion) over the next decade to boost clean energy technology and reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
The impact of tariffs on the renewable sector But it is in contrast to the beliefs of the new president.","US President Donald Trump has long made his thoughts on wind energy known. But in a recent speech in Michigan marking his first 100 days in office, he made it plainer than ever before.

Commenting on his support of coal-fired power plants, he added: ""You know what I don't give approval to? Those stupid windmills that go round and round.""

It marks the latest in a number of attacks the president has made on the clean energy industry since entering the White House — with much of that focused on wind.

On his first day in office, President Trump signed an executive order halting permits for onshore wind energy projects and leases for offshore wind farms in US coastal waters.

It's taken a toll on forecasts for the sector, with a recent Bloomberg NEF report projecting lower growth by the middle of the next decade, ""reflecting the administration's actions on permitting and seabed leases"".

It has investors and those working in the sector worried, says Hannah Hess, associate director on energy and climate at independent research provider the Rhodium Group.

""When you're seeing hostility towards a certain type of clean technology from the administration, understandably the people who are developing both wind projects and the manufacturing of components like blades and towers are deciding that maybe now is not the right time to build one of these facilities in the US,"" she said.

And that's despite the incentives currently in place through the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), she added.

The clean energy boom in the US

Clean energy in the US has grown significantly in recent years. In 2024, more than 90% of new energy capacity came from wind, solar and battery storage, a figure that was boosted by investment through the IRA.

Passed in 2022, under the administration of then-President Joe Biden, it was the biggest climate investment in US history. The former government pledged to invest $370 billion (€330 billion) over the next decade to boost clean energy technology and reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

""That was a really exciting point of growth to see, and I think part of that is that the costs have just come down for these clean tech generators,"" said Leslie Abrahams, deputy director of the Energy Security and Climate Change program at the nonprofit policy research organization Center for Strategic and International Studies.

""Part of that has been from the IRA tax credits,"" she added.

Overall, renewables now account for more than 20% of electricity generation in the US, with wind making up almost half of that. And while it took 40 years to build capacity for utility-scale clean power to 200GW, another 100GW was added in just three years, marking a ""dramatic acceleration"", according to report from clean energy industry body the American Clean Power Association.

As demand for electricity in the US grows for the first time in more than a decade, reflecting the needs for data centers, and expanding manufacturing sector and increasing electrification for electric vehicles, for example, more power than ever is needed, say analysts.

""We are really trying to get ahead of that problem and make sure that we have enough generation capacity on the grid and the manufacturing side,"" said Abrahams, adding that she believes clean energy is the key.

""Clean energy is the fastest to get online,"" she said.

The impact of tariffs on the renewable sector

But it is in contrast to the beliefs of the new president. Even on the campaign trail, Trump promised more investment in fossil fuels, proclaiming his now-infamous slogan to ""drill, baby, drill"".

Since taking office, the Trump administration has tried to stop funding already approved for green energy projects and threatened to repeal parts of the IRA.

In early April, the president proposed tariffs that in the long run could also have an impact on the clean energy industry — particularly those targeting Southeast Asia, a region where countries are facing some of the highest figures.

""Tariffs on Southeast Asia would have a quite dramatic impact on solar, in particular in the US, because some of those earlier-stage components that are critical inputs to our already quite developed solar module manufacturing sector would now be subject to high tariffs,"" said Hess from Rhodium.

""There isn't one clean energy that doesn't rely on imports,"" added Abrahams.

If put in place, the tariffs could mean companies developing renewables — but also natural gas, for example — end up paying much higher prices, and that could have a trickle-down effect, said Abrahams.

""My concern is that that's going to get passed on ultimately to the customers, to the ratepayers, at a time when affordability is a key issue in electricity,"" she said.

Although the president has since put the brakes on many of the tariffs for 90 days, that, along with the funding freezes and anti-renewables rhetoric, is ""injecting uncertainty into the future trajectory of the place for clean tech in the United States,"" she added.

In the first quarter of this year, before Trump had made his initial tariff announcements, six clean energy projects, representing $6.9 billion (€6.2 billion) of investment, were cancelled, according to Rhodium's Clean Investment Monitor, ""the highest quarterly value on record"".

The situation is ""nuanced,"" says Hess, adding there had also been a high number of new manufacturing projects announced, up from the last quarter of 2024, but lower than the same period last year.

""The uptick in new announcements, coupled with significant cancellations, highlights both the progress achieved under the IRA and the risks posed by an unstable policy environment,"" reads the Rhodium report.

Clean energy will continue to grow, but at a slower pace

Despite the headwinds facing the clean energy industry in the US, the consensus is that the sector will continue to grow, albeit at a slower pace. Experts at Bloomberg NEF's New Energy Outlook predict that wind capacity will double by 2035 and solar will triple, while battery storage will increase from 29GW in 2024 to 175GW.

Still, the US will have to compete globally as countries all over the world move away from fossil fuels and look to cleaner energy sources.

""Ultimately, I think there's so much momentum behind clean tech right now. It's not just about climate, it's really about economic competitiveness, geopolitical leverage and national security,"" said Abrahams.

She added that if the US continued to isolate itself, the sector would push ahead without US involvement.",https://static.dw.com/image/72532268_6.jpg,N,,2025-05-14 07:07:44.850367

Georgia climate scientists are raising concerns about federal changes they say could hamper research and hurt their overall understanding of climate change. They warn the threat isn’t just to science; farmers, weather forecasters and emergency planners all rely on climate and weather information that’s now at risk.

The Trump administration has taken several steps in recent weeks that alarm climate scientists, including dismissing National Climate Assessment authors and cutting or interrupting funding to key weather, forecasting and data programs.

The White House’s new budget request to Congress includes billions of dollars of cuts to the National Science Foundation and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, which pay for important research and programs in Georgia.

The National Climate Assessment is a behemoth of a report taking stock of all the most recent research on climate change and laying out the current and future impacts around the country.

It comes out every four years, by Congressional mandate. It’s a huge undertaking that takes a lot of time, said University of Georgia climatologist Pam Knox.

“As soon as one is published, the next group is already starting,” said Knox, one of the authors of the last assessment, which came out about a year and a half ago.

The next is due in 2027, but with the authors dismissed, the status of it is uncertain. That will make it harder for Georgia leaders, Knox said, because the climate assessment highlights the most critical threats to the region.

“If we don’t have good information about that, it’s very difficult to respond to what’s likely to be occurring,” she said. “If you can’t respond, you’re going to have more economic losses.”

Other recent changes and cuts concerned Knox as well.

Regional Climate Centers that provide key information about past weather to everyone from farmers to electric companies to historians briefly went offline last month due to a lapse in their federal funding; Knox co-authored an op-ed advocating for their restoration.

Databases full of information on ocean currents, estuaries and the Earth’s geology are becoming harder to access. Fewer weather balloons are going up. NOAA has announced it will no longer be updating its database of weather and climate disasters that cause at least $1 billion in damage, an important tool for contextualizing storm damage and showing how it has increased over time.

Knox said changes like this will make things harder, both for researchers and for forecasters at the National Weather Service.

“It’s not like they’re going to go away, but they’re just going to be hampered in their ability to do the best job that they could,” she said of NWS forecasters.

Further cuts to NOAA, the agency that houses the Weather Service, and other federal departments could be coming if Congress follows the changes laid out in the recent White House budget request.

Clark Alexander, director of the University of Georgia’s Skidaway Institute of Oceanography, said the proposed cuts to the National Science Foundation would harm the research done at institutions like UGA and Georgia Tech.

The cuts would defund much of the “curiosity-driven research that doesn’t necessarily have a payoff tomorrow but may form the building blocks for great advances that might occur over the next decade or so,” Alexander said.

Some of the proposed cuts to NOAA, meanwhile, would hit closer to home for Georgia’s coastal economy, particularly the Sea Grant program.

“The Georgia Sea Grant program has been the driving force behind developing aquaculture in our state,” Alexander said, pointing to the state’s burgeoning homegrown oyster industry. “They’ve also worked with shrimpers. They’ve worked with people that work on the water in a variety of different ways.”

NOAA is involved in life and research on the Georgia coast in many other ways, too, including management of the Gray’s Reef National Marine Sanctuary and the annual effort to track North Atlantic right whales giving birth offshore.

The agency did not respond to a request for comment, but has previously said it remains committed to providing timely information, research, and resources. The White House did not respond to questions from NPR about the National Climate Assessment.

This budget is just a proposal and still has to go through Congress, though federal research funding is already facing other cutbacks and changes, including a recently-announced change in funding for indirect expenses like laboratory maintenance that Alexander said could severely hamper researchers’ ability to pay for their work. That and many other cuts are likely to be challenged in court – likely a lengthy process.

In the meantime, Alexander said, the disruption could have long-term impacts both for the public’s understanding of science and for the new researchers and policymakers just entering their fields.

“In some ways we are slowing down the development and the training and the handing off of management and research to a new generation by cutting all these programs,” he said.",https://thecurrentga.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMG_7518-1.jpg,N,,2025-05-14 07:09:39.127063

Programs across the country, including New Mexico, Tennessee and Wisconsin, were suddenly unable to access their grant funding and proceed with solar projects that require significant upfront investment.
While Zeldin’s ire wasn’t aimed at Solar for All, his attack launched an audit into the program by the EPA Office of Inspector General.
Until the investigation is concluded, Solar for All funding will continue to trickle down to Vermonters.
Separate programs that fall under the state’s Solar for All program push benefits toward single-family homeowners and community solar projects.","In Washington, D.C., House Republicans plan to gather Tuesday to vote on whether to shred the Inflation Reduction Act, the landmark law that has issued hundreds of billions of dollars in clean energy incentives since 2022, as part of President Donald Trump’s new budget proposal.

Meanwhile, in Vermont on Tuesday morning, a state program funded by that very law announced more than $22 million of the state’s total grant of $62.5 million would go to help install solar power on low-income housing in the state.

“Currently towns with the highest energy burden in Vermont have the least amount of installed solar,” Kerrick Johnson, commissioner for the Department of Public Service, which controls the state’s grant, said in a statement. “That’s why the primary objective of this program is to deliver benefits to disadvantaged Vermonters, regardless of their dwelling status.”

The funding is part of the Solar for All program, a $7 billion national initiative to lower the cost of electricity by installing solar on buildings and developing solar arrays in communities. Across the country, the program could pass on solar benefits to more than 900,000 households in low-income and disadvantaged communities, according to the Environmental Protection Agency, the federal office that administered the grant to 49 states and six tribes, among others.

Vermont’s congressional delegation championed the initiative, including U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., who introduced Solar for All into the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA).

But funding for the solar program has been under threat before by the Trump administration, and it could be under threat again as the Republican-dominated Congress moves to axe programs from the IRA to achieve the multi-trillion-dollar budget President Trump is calling “The One, Big, Beautiful Bill.”

On Sunday, the U.S. House Energy and Commerce committee proposed to meet the budget goals by repealing grants from a $27 billion IRA program called the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund, which aims to lower carbon emissions. One of the three programs in that fund is the Solar for All program.

“Donald Trump campaigned on lowering electric bills for working Americans. As president, he’s doing exactly the opposite,” Sanders said in an email Tuesday. “The disastrous reconciliation bill being pushed by Trump and Congressional Republicans would not only make electric bills more expensive for Vermonters, it would make the climate crisis worse.”

Sanders said the good news was that the budget bill couldn’t legally rescind Vermont’s $62.5 million grant that was allocated to the Vermont Department of Public Service.

“The bad news is that Trump does not respect the Constitution or rule of law,” Sanders said. “I will continue to do everything I can to make sure Solar for All funding is deployed to lower electric bills, slash carbon emissions, and create thousands of good jobs.”

The road to how the federal government got to this massive repeal process began in January, when Trump took office and issued a flurry of executive orders. Those included Unleashing American Energy, which called for a 90-day freeze on IRA funds. A letter sent a week later by the EPA notified Solar for All recipients that the hundred of millions of dollars they’d received so far was paused until further notice. Programs across the country, including New Mexico, Tennessee and Wisconsin, were suddenly unable to access their grant funding and proceed with solar projects that require significant upfront investment.

“While the federal funding landscape is dynamic, we have a binding agreement with EPA and the funding is obligated,” said Randy Brittingham, grant program manager at the state energy office for the Vermont Department of Public Service, in an email. After a pause in communication and access to funds this winter, Brittingham said the state is back in regular contact with the EPA. “We’ve successfully drawn funding for this program since that February pause,” he said.

But Lee Zeldin, the new EPA administrator, has gone further since February, claiming in March that President Joe Biden’s administration had doled out billions of dollars that were vulnerable to “waste, fraud, and abuse.” Zeldin tried to claw back $20 billion from the two other programs in the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund, and while caught up in court battles, those funds largely remain frozen. While Zeldin’s ire wasn’t aimed at Solar for All, his attack launched an audit into the program by the EPA Office of Inspector General. The audit is ongoing, according to Kim Wheeler, director of strategic communications for that office.

“Solar for All was selected because it is a $7 billion program with a financing structure that is new and different for the EPA, with $25 million already spent,” Wheeler said in an email on Tuesday. She did not respond by the time of publication to a question about whether the EPA considers only $25 million of the program obligated.

While Wheeler said her office doesn’t have the authority to make or revoke funding decisions, if her office found an issue with an award during an investigation, it could make recommendations to the EPA.

“If we identified an issue during an audit (such as the project you are asking about), we could recommend that the Agency evaluate whether to suspend payment or terminate the award,” Wheeler said of the Solar for All program.

Until the investigation is concluded, Solar for All funding will continue to trickle down to Vermonters. More than a third of the $62.5 million grant was awarded this week to the Vermont Housing Finance Agency, a quasi-public entity that acts like a bank for affordable housing, to make solar more accessible for low-income households.

These funds – called Multi Family Affordable Housing – will be awarded to new developers for affordable housing projects like multi-family apartment buildings, largely benefitting renters. Separate programs that fall under the state’s Solar for All program push benefits toward single-family homeowners and community solar projects.

“We know that renters have been very underserved by solar resources in the past, so it’s exciting for us as a housing funder to help developers successfully electrify their buildings and rely less on fossil fuels,” said Mia Watson, special programs manager for the Vermont Housing Finance Agency, who is supporting the Solar for All award.

Tenants who have an electric bill could see at least 20% in bill savings and tenants without an electric bill would receive an equivalent benefit, Brittingham said. He added that all residents would benefit from the climate impacts of growing Vermont’s solar generation.

Residents and developers can attend public outreach sessions hosted by the finance agency in the coming months. The finance agency in partnership with the state will submit a work plan for EPA approval by December. They expect to award funds to developers early next year.

“We’re still cautious about what may happen at the federal level, but so far the indications we have are good that this program is going to happen,” Watson said. “We’ve had strong support from the state and our congressional delegation, especially Sen. Sanders, but I think everyone involved is a little concerned that things could change unexpectedly.”",https://vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/solar-for-all-1-20230628.jpg,N,,2025-05-14 09:03:29.635630

It explains: “The House Committee on Energy and Commerce laid out a proposal, which will be voted on on Tuesday, that would raise $6.5bn from the repeal of climate-related parts of the Biden administration’s massive Inflation Reduction Act legislation.” The newswire adds: “The House Ways and Means panel, meanwhile, proposed the phase-out or cancellation of several lucrative tax credits from former President Joe Biden’s signature climate law, including ending a consumer-facing credit for electric vehicle purchases and a tax credit for home energy efficiency improvements, and the phase out of various key clean energy subsidies for expiry by 2031, according to a document it released on Monday.” The Hill reports: “[The proposed legislation] claws back numerous Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) programs, including hotly contested ‘green bank’ funding, a $20bn programme that gave money to financing institutions so they can support climate-friendly projects. Other EPA programs targeted include a ‘methane fee’ that charges oil and gas companies for excess emissions during production, as well as programs that seek to provide monitoring outside of polluting facilities and address air pollution at schools. It also repeals a $3bn grant program that funds efforts that seek to reduce air pollution and planet-warming emissions in disadvantaged communities. In addition, the text repeals Biden-era rules expected to push the market toward electric vehicles.” E&E News says that the plans “threaten to increase carbon pollution by making it easier to build natural gas power plants and sustain some coal facilities”. Separately, the outlet reports that the legislation “would affect the Department of Energy’s loans program office, EPA’s greenhouse reduction fund and many other climate law initiatives”. Heatmap says the proposals would “effectively kill the Inflation Reduction Act”. Bloomberg says the proposal “may not be as bad for producers of clean electricity from sources such as solar and wind, who feared a more aggressive phase out”.

E&E News reports that “Hawaii lawmakers are encouraging insurance companies to sue the oil and gas industry for climate damages”. This is a “first-of-its-kind state resolution – which supporters hope can be replicated elsewhere”, according to the outlet. Elsewhere, Semafor says: “A Silicon Valley weather startup will soon begin replacing National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration weather balloons with AI-powered alternatives, a cost-cutting measure brought on by severe budget cuts carried out by the Trump administration.” Reuters quotes former head of the EPA, Gina McCarthy, who says that “US companies may not be putting their hands up, but they are still investing in clean energy”. Yale Climate Connections asks: “Can states and cities lead on climate under Trump?”

Solar and wind power projects now account for 59% of China’s energy investments in Africa, according to a new report by UK-based thinktank ODI Global, the Hong Kong-based South China Morning Post (SCMP) says. The research also finds that “one-fifth of China’s overall energy sector and also a fifth of renewable energy investment and construction activity had taken place in Africa, amounting to $66bn between 2010 and 2024”, the outlet adds. The Communist party-affiliated newspaper People’s Daily reports that South African policymakers travelled to China to discuss “large-scale renewable energy integration”, “advanced clean coal technologies” and “sophisticated grid management”. Chinese president Xi Jinping said in a speech at the China-CELAC [Community of Latin American and Caribbean States] Forum in Beijing that “China would also provide 66bn yuan ($9bn) in credit” to the region and pledged to expand cooperation in “clean energy”, SCMP reports. Electricity news outlet Dianlian Xinmei says that, in the years ahead, countries included in the Belt and Road Initiative have “tremendous potential for renewable energy development”, adding there is “broad space” for Chinese companies to participate in energy-related projects.

Meanwhile, SCMP reports that although the total number of Chinese electric vehicle (EV) exports to the UK fell by 32.6% year-on-year in the first quarter of 2025, exports of plug-in hybrid vehicles surged nearly 600%. Another SCMP article says India’s “fast-growing” domestic EV industry faces “renewed uncertainty”, following China’s curbs on rare earth exports. On the same day that the US and China “agreed a deal to slash tariffs”, China said that it will “strengthen controls over the full supply chains of strategic minerals exports”, Reuters reports. State-run newspaper China Daily reports that China’s production and sales of automobiles surpassed 10m units in the first four months of this year, adding that EVs accounted for 43% of new vehicle sales.

The Wire China publishes an opinion article by Jeremy Wallace, professor at Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies, discussing how China’s “combined wind, solar and coal bases” reflect the country’s economic strengths and weaknesses. Chinese researchers have “unveiled the world’s most advanced ocean simulation system”, which could enhance predictions of extreme weather events, SCMP says.

The UK opposition Conservative Party’s acting shadow secretary for energy, Andrew Bowie, has told the Guardian that the country’s 2050 net-zero target is “arbitrary” and “not based on science”, the newspaper reports. It adds that he also “indicated that the UK’s participation in the 2015 Paris climate agreement was up for reconsideration in the party’s ongoing review of key policies”. The outlet quotes Bowie saying: “We are not climate deniers and while we believe in getting to net-zero, what we shouldn’t do is be hamstrung by arbitrary targets such as a date of 2050, which was concocted simply because it was a good end point as a date. There’s no scientific rationale for choosing 2050 as the point to which we should reach net-zero.” The newspaper notes that, on the contrary, the 2050 date is in line with scientific advice on meeting the goal of the Paris Agreement. It continues: “Bowie said of the IPCC: ‘They’re biased towards their worldview, which is that we need to reduce climate emissions by a certain arbitrary date. That is not conducive to the overall economic wellbeing of this country.’ He added: ‘There’s quite a few scientists that say we don’t need to get to net-zero by 2050.’ Bowie and his office were unable to name such scientists when pressed.”

Separately, the Guardian covers new analysis, which it says finds that making the UK’s windfall tax on oil and gas producers permanent would raise at least £2bn per year – enough to ”fund switch to green jobs for North Sea oil workers”. The newspaper says the analysis comes from campaign group Oil Change International. Elsewhere, BusinessGreen says: “Plans for a giant 1GW [gigawatt] floating offshore wind farm in the North Sea could support over 1,000 jobs and generate nearly £11bn of investment for the UK over its lifetime, according to the developers behind the ambitious project.” The Irish Times reports that “Irish offshore windfarm developers have reacted with surprise and some alarm following the decision by the world’s largest wind developer to halt work on a vast UK project, citing rising costs and the risk of delays”.

In other UK news, the Guardian reports that “the British bioethanol industry could collapse as a result of Keir Starmer’s trade deal with Donald Trump, industry bosses have said”. Separately, the Guardian has published another article on Zack Polanski, the 42-year-old deputy leader of the Green party, who is standing in the party’s leadership election. The Press Association reports that a “huge cross-party group” of 71 MSPs and 10 MPs are “urging Rachel Reeves to deliver the money needed to progress the Acorn carbon capture and storage project in Aberdeenshire”. The Guardian reports that legal campaign group Wild Justice is “planning a judicial review against the UK government’s new planning bill, arguing it will result in a weakening of environmental protections which were fought for and created over decades”. The Daily Express reports that “highways bosses are set to permanently remove more than 140 miles of motorway lighting on some of the busiest sections in the UK – to cut carbon emission”.

BusinessGreen reports that “influential analyst firm” Cornwall Insight has published a new report, which finds that “even under ambitious timelines, it would likely take until the early 2030s to transition [the] UK market to a zonal electricity pricing regime”. The outlet continues: “The plans have been the subject of an intense lobbying battle that has divided companies and experts across the energy sector. Advocates for zonal pricing argue it could curb energy costs across the UK, deliver some of the lowest power prices in Europe to regions with surplus renewable power, and accelerate decarbonisation efforts by optimising the use of clean energy. But critics have countered such radical reforms would create uncertainty that could drive up the cost of capital for clean energy projects, delay projects that are crucial to meeting the government’s clean power goals, and create a ‘postcode lottery’ for energy bills across the UK.” The Press Association says: “Ministers are expected to make a decision on zonal pricing this summer after lobbying efforts for and against it have ramped up since Labour entered government.” The Financial Times carries a lengthy piece unpacking how zonal pricing would work and explaining the key points of the debate.

In other UK news, Euronews has factchecked the “misleading claims and conspiracy theories” surrounding new government-funded trials of solar radiation management. The outlet says: “Despite assertions that the UK’s plans are in the experimental stage, they haven’t stopped social media users from claiming that the country has already been engaging in geoengineering for years without public consent as a way to control the population. The claims also feed into the widely debunked ‘chemtrails’ conspiracy theory, whose believers insist that some vapour trails from planes contain harmful chemicals that are sprayed over the public around Europe or that others are being used to dim the sun and block out the light. EuroVerify put these notions to experts, who resoundingly rejected them.”

The Guardian reports on a new map of England’s peatlands, which shows that 80% of the regions are “dry and degraded”. The Press Association reports that scientists used “satellite imagery, artificial intelligence and in-depth data analysis” to create the map. BBC News also reports on the map. Finally, Simon Lee and Matthew Patterson from the University of St Andrews explain in the Conversation how a “blocking” weather system over the UK has “produced one of the driest, warmest and brightest starts to spring on record”. The scientists unpack how climate change may have played a role in setting up the “unusual spring”.

In a comment for the Hill, New York state senator Liz Krueger and New York assembly member Jeffrey Dinowitz write: “The foundation of American government rests on a simple but powerful principle: states are not mere departments of the federal government…President Trump’s recent executive order, which instructs the Justice Department to block state climate laws such as New York’s Climate Change Superfund Act, is a direct attack on that principle.” Krueger and Dinowitz continue: “Trump’s executive order does not simply challenge this one law, but rather the very idea that states have the right to hold powerful interests accountable when Washington will not.” They conclude: “The costs of climate change are here; the only question is who will pay those costs. States like New York are choosing fairness. We are choosing to make the biggest global polluters pay. The right to protect our communities belongs to the people and the leaders they elect, and it’s not limited by the whims of Washington insiders or oil industry lobbyists. We intend to defend that right, in the courts, in the legislature and in the court of public opinion, for as long as it takes.”

In other comment on the US, Bloomberg columnist Javier Blas writes: “For now, everything suggests the US won’t see a rapid decline in annual average oil production. A peak seems very likely; and even a slight drop could materialise if prices remain depressed. But nothing suggests that the US is about to see a repetition of the large decline in 2020, when average annual output fell almost 650,000 barrels a day from 2019.” Bloomberg columnist Gautam Mukunda writes that “slowing innovation is ruining American politics”. He says: “The administration’s new budget proposes a 55% cut to the National Science Foundation (the government’s primary arm for research outside medicine) and a 40% cut to the National Institutes of Health (America, and the world’s foremost medical research institution)…Even the flow of scientific talent into the US – long one of the nation’s greatest advantages – is reversing, with top AI minds no longer coming here and the EU allocating almost $600m to lure away top American researchers.”",,N,,2025-05-14 07:07:50.288494

An environmental group is voicing concern about the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's efforts to tackle PFAS pollution.

The EPA recently announced steps to reduce the toxic ""forever chemicals"" in drinking water and hold polluters accountable.

Dan Firth, chair of the solid waste and mining committee for the Tennessee chapter of the Sierra Club, is concerned the EPA's efforts could be undermined by proposed budget cuts and regulatory rollbacks of pollution rules.

""We certainly hope that they will follow through and will improve, will strengthen the controls of around PFAS,"" Firth emphasized. ""That they will truly make the polluters pay, and that they will clean up the drinking water and protect the residents of Tennessee.""

EPA data show more than 143 million were exposed to toxic ""forever chemicals"" last year.

Firth pointed out if the EPA follows through on enforcing safe drinking water rules, it could improve water quality across Tennessee and ease the cleanup burden on taxpayers. He added the agency should also go further by treating PFAS as a class of chemicals and limit their use to prevent future contamination.

Firth noted the Tennessee Department of Environment Conservation is still in the process of revising its permit process. His group is encouraging the department to include some testing requirements for PFAS in biosolids.

""Grundy County had a bill in the legislature this year to gain local control over how they handle, whether they can permit or can deny the land application of biosolids at the local level,"" Firth observed.

Firth is calling for swift, meaningful action to improve access to clean water, noting PFAS exposure is linked to pregnancy complications and increase the risk of certain cancers.

A Michigan group is speaking out after a top congressional leader's comment that lawmakers will most likely scrap the $7,500 federal tax credit for buying electric vehicles.

Ending the tax credit could deal a major blow to both the EV market and the country's clean-energy goals. Michigan automakers and suppliers have pumped more than $30 billion into the state's EV industry since 2020.

Jane McCurry, executive director of Clean Fuels Michigan, said her group joined several local and national nonprofits in signing a letter to the U.S. House Transportation Committee in support of the EV tax credits.

""Demonstrating that it's not just industry, not just individuals,"" she said, ""but large nonprofits and advocacy groups that really care about continuing to show support for the clean mobility transition.""

Despite growing Republican support for EV tax credits, some GOP senators have introduced the ELITE Vehicles Act. It would eliminate the $7,500 credit, a $4,000 credit for buying used EVs, and charging-station incentives. The senators have argued these are luxury cars and that taxpayers shouldn't foot the bill for incentives.

McCurry said it isn't just about cutting incentives. She said there are also new disincentives being pushed in Lansing and Washington, D.C. - including a proposal to increase the gas tax from 31 cents to 51 cents, which would hike EV fees.

""Because of the way that the EV registration fee in Michigan is designed, that would increase our EV registration fee by $100,"" she said, ""and that would make Michigan's EV registration tax the highest in the country.""

McCurry said her group, along with 70 companies, is working to bring back the Competitive Fuels Act in Michigan. It would reward cleaner, more innovative fuels based on how environmentally friendly they are. By 2030, hybrid or electric vehicles will be more than half of all vehicle sales in Michigan, according to the state.

Nonprofits, businesses, organizers and leaders have signed a letter calling for more climate solutions in Arizona and around the country. They claim the climate crisis is here, and say action is needed now more than ever.

Research shows most Arizonans are worried about the consequences of climate change on their own lives, and they want more renewable energy sources.

As the Trump administration takes steps to roll back environmental protections and boost domestic oil and gas production, people such as Gloria Walton, president and CEO of The Solutions Project, argue too much is at stake. Her organization is among 150 partners pledging renewed commitments to advancing climate solutions - especially from communities of color.

Walton said these are the areas disproportionately affected by the climate crisis, from their proximity to industry pollution to a lack of infrastructure to deal with extreme weather events.

""Frontline communities are literally taking a proactive stance to addressing the climate crisis, and they're thinking about the collective creativity that can change the material conditions when we work together,"" she said. ""And they're thinking about the hope and possibility of new systems that can be created that benefit people, versus corporations.""

The Solutions Project works with cooperatives and community organizers to cultivate policy and campaign wins, which Walton said work to fill in the gaps the current administration is not.

Historically, said Judith LeBlanc, executive director of the community organization Native Organizers Alliance, their advocacy work has been about defending and protecting natural resources, but added that the approach has changed in recent years.

""But what we've been moving in the direction of for eight, nine years - since Standing Rock, really,"" she said, ""is putting forward solutions, generating possible ways to continue to build up the infrastructure for rural, and therefore our reservations.""

LeBlanc said Indigenous stewards understand their inherent role and legal responsibility to take care of lands and waters for all. She added that organizing, engaging and mobilizing communities is key, ""since the majority opinion is, 'Let's get 'er done, let's take care of Mother Earth, let's invest' - especially by registered voters, who play a big role in shaping government policy.""

A Commonwealth Court panel of five judges agreed.
They argue the Commonwealth Court wrongly decided the case because it failed to consider the DEP and Environmental Quality Board’s obligations under the Environmental Rights Amendment (ERA) to the state constitution.
Comitta said the Supreme Court case and RGGI would make the Supreme Court case moot, but GOP lawmakers have said the plan falls short of their goals to reduce energy costs and ensure reliable electricity supplies.","Pennsylvania’s long-delayed membership in the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative that would require fossil fuel-burning power plants to pay for carbon dioxide emissions was the subject of arguments Tuesday before the state Supreme Court.

The program, known as RGGI, established a carbon credit auction for electricity producers in 11 northeast states to pay for the right to emit carbon dioxide. The money received would go to each state for uses, ranging from utility assistance and energy efficiency projects to subsidies for alternative energy.

Gov. Tom Wolf entered the compact in 2022 over the objections of Republican state lawmakers. They raised concerns it would increase electricity prices, hasten the closing of the commonwealth’s remaining coal power plants, and not reduce carbon emissions overall, but simply force them into other states.

In a legal challenge to the program’s constitutionality, GOP leaders in the House and Senate contended the requirement to buy carbon credits was an impermissible tax. A Commonwealth Court panel of five judges agreed.

In its decision, the appellate court said that Pennsylvania’s participation in RGGI must be approved through the General Assembly and that the state Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) does not have the authority to impose a tax.

Gov. Josh Shapiro’s administration appealed, with the DEP, arguing that the commonwealth’s membership in RGGI is authorized by the state’s Air Pollution Control Act (APCA). The law empowers the state to enact rules and regulations to reduce pollution, including establishing fees used to eliminate air emissions.

Several nonprofit citizens rights and environmental groups, including Penn Future, the Sierra Club, the Clean Air Council and the Environmental Defense Fund, moved to intervene in the appeal. They argue the Commonwealth Court wrongly decided the case because it failed to consider the DEP and Environmental Quality Board’s obligations under the Environmental Rights Amendment (ERA) to the state constitution. The groups also back the DEP’s argument that the agency is empowered to establish fees to enforce the APCA.

Adopted in 1971, the ERA requires the commonwealth to preserve public natural resources for the benefit of all people. It’s considered one of the strongest such constitutional protections in the nation, according to PennFuture.

Since the Commonwealth Court’s decision in 2023, Shapiro has introduced a Pennsylvania-focused alternative to RGGI called the Pennsylvania Climate Emissions Reduction Act (PACER) that he said would leverage the commonwealth’s status as an energy exporter to fund carbon-neutral energy development.

Sen. Carolyn Comitta (D-Chester), who plans to introduce legislation to establish PACER, said Shapiro’s alternative was developed in collaboration with Republican lawmakers and energy companies. Comitta said the Supreme Court case and RGGI would make the Supreme Court case moot, but GOP lawmakers have said the plan falls short of their goals to reduce energy costs and ensure reliable electricity supplies.",https://www.alleghenyfront.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/DSC_8924-2048x1300-1.jpg,N,,2025-05-14 07:08:02.264662

Animal agriculture accounts for 32% of global emissions of methane, a greenhouse gas about 80 times more potent than carbon dioxide over a 20-year period, with the breeding of cattle for milk and meat a key driver.

Methane has been assessed as responsible for nearly half the total global temperature rise since 1750. But since it is short-lived in the atmosphere compared with carbon dioxide, cuts to emissions have been identified as an urgent move in tackling climate breakdown.

However, an assessment of 20 major dairy and coffee shop chains – with combined revenues exceeding $420bn (£323bn), almost half the value of the estimated size of the global dairy industry – found most lack clear methane reduction targets, credible action plans or even basic transparency on emissions.

The food products corporation Danone came top in a league table compiled by researchers, being the only company to have a methane-specific target. The US-based company General Mills came in second place, having published a climate target but not one specific to methane. Nestlé and Arla came third, with Nestlé the only company to have explicitly supported reducing dairy consumption.

Of the companies assessed, only Nestlé and Danone claimed to have actually cut emissions, despite all but two having affirmed methane and livestock pose a threat to the climate.

“Dairy production is a rare lever to control methane emissions, but one that firms clearly don’t want to touch,” said Nusa Urbancic, the chief executive of Changing Markets, which carried out the research.

“The near-total absence of methane-specific targets and credible action plans sends a clear signal: companies are turning a blind eye to emissions of one of the most potent and solvable drivers of global heating.”

Companies in the assessment included the largest dairy companies in Europe and North America by annual revenue, the five largest coffee chains in Europe and North America, and all eight members of the Dairy Methane Action Alliance (DMAA), an industry initiative.

Urbancic added: “Our audit shows that fine words from businesses and a few voluntary actions are little more than hot air. Governments must finally grab the bull by the horns and set science-based methane cuts for the agricultural sector.

“All eyes are on European governments, given its leadership on the global methane pledge and upcoming legislation in this area.”

An Arla spokesperson said: “Alongside our farmer owners, Arla is committed to producing more sustainable dairy and has clear science-based targets in place.”

WASHINGTON—The House Ways & Means Committee released draft legislative text for markup that, if passed, would effectively kill the electric vehicle (EV) tax credits for the majority of the auto industry by the end of this year.

The targeted credits for termination include:

Section 30D (New Clean Vehicles), which provides up to $7,500 for the purchase of an eligible new clean vehicle,

Section 30C (Alternative Fuel Infrastructure), which provides up to $1,000 for eligible refueling infrastructure,

Section 45X (Advanced Manufacturing Production), which subsidizes a percentage of the cost of producing certain clean energy technologies,

Section 45W (Commercial Clean Vehicle), which provides up to $7,500 for the purchase of eligible vehicles under 14,000 lbs. and up to $40,000 for those over 14,000 lbs., and

Section 25E (Used Clean Vehicles), which provides up to $4,000 for the purchase of an eligible used clean vehicle.

EC Executive Director Ben Prochazka has issued the following statement in response:

“Today’s draft legislative text would represent a troubling step back for the automotive and the broader EV industry in the U.S. The electric transportation sector is a critical and rapidly growing part of the U.S. economy and is paramount in the global race to control the future of transportation. The U.S. must continue with an aggressive approach to policy and market incentives to ensure we can compete with fierce competition from abroad, especially China. Additionally, electrification diversifies how we power our cars, trucks, and buses, reducing our reliance on volatile oil markets and improving our economic and national security.

“These tax credits have already spurred hundreds of billions of dollars of private-sector investments in domestic manufacturing, created hundreds of thousands of well-paying jobs, and increased the U.S. auto industry’s global competitiveness. They have enticed companies, including auto manufacturers, battery producers and suppliers of critical minerals, to make long-term investments in the United States. Dismantling these investments would potentially strand billions of dollars of assets, challenge the economy, reduce U.S. jobs and disincentivize future investment in the U.S.

“As the Trump administration recognized, our economy and military depend on reliable supplies of critical minerals, which can only be secured by creating and maintaining a robust domestic EV industry. Hindering the development of the U.S. EV industry at a moment when China (which controls the majority of global critical mineral mining and processing capabilities) has begun to restrict exports of these materials to the United States would threaten U.S. military, manufacturing and innovation capabilities.

“While the EV market must and will eventually survive without incentives, this reversal will create an uncertain market in the U.S., potentially affecting jobs and communities across the country. We urge members of Congress to recognize the economic and national security imperative of these policies and encourage an approach that preserves the EV incentives and the future of the auto industry.”

Under the amended law, nuclear plants that could previously only operate for 40 years will be allowed to renew or extend their licenses for up to 20 years at a time, according to Legislative Speaker Han Kuo-yu. The revision also allows operators to apply for license renewal before or after it expires.

Energy security is a critical issue for Taiwan, which has sought to phase out its nuclear industry but has also been forced to contend with the needs of a vital chipmaking industry and an uncomfortable reliance on imported fossil fuel. Concerns have increased as Beijing exerts more pressure and the technology industry’s power demands soar.

The bill comes just days before Taiwan’s last operating reactor is set to go offline. The May 17 closure will not be averted, but Tuesday’s vote hints at a reversal that could bring the territory into line with a global trend of renewed interest in nuclear energy, seen as an effective, low-carbon solution for the world’s needs.

Taiwan’s Premier Cho Jung-tai told a locally-produced podcast that his cabinet would not oppose bringing back decommissioned reactors if the legal amendment is approved. But he added it would take 3.5 years to review safety before a restart, citing state-owned Taipower’s estimate.

The government does not have immediate plans to evaluate any nuclear plant extensions or restarts, according to a statement by the cabinet on Tuesday after the passage of the bill. That’s because detailed regulations have not been formulated yet, it said.

Using nuclear power could slash Taiwan’s reliance on imported liquefied natural gas — which arrives by sea and would be vulnerable in the event of any sharp rise in tensions with Beijing, particularly a naval blockade. It would also ease fears about energy security in the coming years as power consumption is set to grow by about 13% by end-decade, thanks to the rapid growth of artificial intelligence.

According to nuclear stakeholders, the credits (including 45U) have helped catalyze efforts to reopen shuttered facilities like Palisades in Michigan and Three Mile Island in Pennsylvania, among others.

The battle may not be going their way, at least when it comes to 45U, the incentive born out of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), which offers a credit for electricity produced at a qualified nuclear power facility.

That’s because House Republicans are calling for billions of dollars in cuts to the IRA, and the 45U credit would be included in these cuts, according to a draft bill issued Monday. The House committees on Energy and Commerce and Ways and Means are set to discuss the plans Tuesday as part of the so-called budget reconciliation process.

Beginning with tax years starting after December 31, 2028, the value of the credit would be gradually reduced. It would decrease to 80 percent of its original amount in 2029, 60 percent in 2030, 40 percent in 2031 and would be fully phased out by 2032.

In addition to the phase-out, the legislation introduces new restrictions aimed at limiting access to the credit for entities with foreign ties. Specifically, no credit would be allowed for any taxpayer classified as a “specified foreign entity” for tax years beginning after the enactment of the law. Further, beginning two years after enactment, the credit would also be denied to any taxpayer defined as a “foreign-influenced entity.”

The legislation also repeals the transferability of the nuclear production tax credit. After December 31, 2027, utilities and other qualifying taxpayers would no longer be permitted to transfer the credit to other entities.

According to nuclear stakeholders, the credits (including 45U) have helped catalyze efforts to reopen shuttered facilities like Palisades in Michigan and Three Mile Island in Pennsylvania, among others. Along with enabling nuclear uprates, the credits have allowed the planned additions of more than 3 GW of clean power to the grid.

“The 45U credit enacted to support the existing nuclear fleet is vital to reversing the trend of prematurely closing nuclear plants,” the stakeholders said in their April 30 letter to lawmakers.

The stakeholders appealed to a national security imperative, saying the needs of artificial intelligence and others are driving unprecedented surges in electricity demand, and “nuclear power remains the only energy source capable of delivering reliable, baseload power—24/7/365.”",https://www.power-eng.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Nine-Mile-Point-Nuclear-Station.jpg,N,,2025-05-14 07:08:10.317618

To meet the growing demand from residential, industrial and commercial buildings, the city is beginning construction on the Home Road water plant.
“Initially, this plant will start off with about 48 million gallons per day.
We have the capacity to go up to 80 million gallons per day,” says John Newsome, administrator for the City of Columbus Division of Water.
The city says the water plant was also built with consideration of changing weather patterns.","COLUMBUS, Ohio — As the Columbus region grows, so does its thirst for water. The city says water usage has increased from about 136 million gallons of water per day in 2012 to nearly 150 million gallons of water per day in 2024.

To meet the growing demand from residential, industrial and commercial buildings, the city is beginning construction on the Home Road water plant.

“Initially, this plant will start off with about 48 million gallons per day. We have the capacity to go up to 80 million gallons per day,” says John Newsome, administrator for the City of Columbus Division of Water.

This supply will flow through more than 20 miles of underground pipelines, stretching from Delaware County through Dublin and into Columbus, ensuring homes and businesses have the water they need for decades to come.

In a move toward sustainability, the $1.6 billion plant can be powered by an array of floating solar panels.

“Actually, the entire plant can be run by that solar facility,” Newsome said.

The city says the solar panels will reduce reliance on the grid and lower the city’s carbon footprint, which is a growing trend among modern water utilities.

Currently, Columbus customers are served by three water plants. The addition of the Home Road facility will shift much of the supply for the city’s northwest, reshaping how water is delivered across the region.

“The whole region is growing as a whole, so this plant helps with all of that growth,” Newsome said.

With such a large investment, city officials acknowledge that water rates will need to rise to pay for the project. While the exact increase remains under review, residents can expect more details later this year.

Construction won’t be without its challenges. The city notes that while Scioto River water levels won’t be affected as two up ground reservoirs are expected to be built, some homeowners with wells near the construction zone may experience temporary disruptions as crews de-water certain areas to lay the massive pipes.

“During construction, we will have to de-water some of the area, so we may impact some of the neighborhood wells,” says Matt Steele, Assistant Administrator for the Columbus Division of Water. Customers who have issues should sent issues to here.

The Home Road plant is being built on the site of the former Scioto Juvenile Correctional Facility, land the city purchased from the state in 2015 in anticipation of the region’s growth. Central Ohio is growing – from about 2.5 million residents today to more than three million by 2050.

The facility is scheduled to open in 2030, marking a major milestone in Columbus’ efforts to provide reliable, sustainable water for generations to come.

HOUSTON & PORT HAWKESBURY, NS, July 13, 2022 – Buckeye Partners, L.P. (“Buckeye”) today announced that it closed on the previously announced acquisition of Bear Head Energy, Inc. (“Bear Head”), which is developing a large-scale green hydrogen and ammonia production, storage and export project in Point Tupper, Nova Scotia with hydrogen electrolyzer capacity of over two gigawatts.

“Buckeye’s intention with this acquisition is to develop a large-scale green energy production, distribution and export hub,” said Buckeye CEO Todd Russo. “Given the project’s unique features and the geographic advantages of the region, including its status as one of the top locations globally for wind energy generation, we believe that this has the potential to become one the world’s premier green hydrogen production facilities. As Buckeye continues to evolve into a more diversified energy company, acquisitions like Bear Head represent an opportunity for us to invest in growth that aligns with our customers’ evolving needs and ESG priorities while leveraging our existing expertise and capabilities.”

As part of the project’s phased development, Buckeye plans to partner with on-shore and off-shore renewable energy developers to build out a large-scale green hydrogen hub for Atlantic Canada. Buckeye and Bear Head believe this development will create a significant number of new clean energy jobs in the province, help support Nova Scotia’s carbon emissions reduction targets, and establish the region as a global leader in the production of green hydrogen for domestic and export markets.

“Together, Bear Head and Buckeye have the experience and resources necessary to successfully develop, construct and operate a world class green hydrogen facility on the Bear Head site,” said Bear Head President and CEO John Godbold. “Under Buckeye’s ownership, we believe that the Bear Head project will become a premier asset in the global hydrogen value chain by matching Nova Scotia’s considerable renewable resources with the world’s growing need for green fuels.”

“Bear Head is striving to build the modern clean hydrogen economy, and every decision we make is with a focus on creating a carbon-neutral future,” said Bear Head COO, Paul MacLean. “We are proud to be fully aligned with Buckeye, who shares our core values with respect to our commitment to working with Nova Scotia Mi’kmaw communities through open communication, engagement and delivering a broad partnership on key elements of our project. With the full support from local stakeholders and our owners, we believe that Bear Head will be well-positioned to help drive the transition to a low-carbon economy.”

Buckeye established its Alternative Energy operating segment as a clean energy business that focuses on the development, construction, and operation of alternative energy projects, including hydrogen, wind, and solar-powered energy solutions. The Bear Head Project is an addition to Buckeye’s growing asset portfolio in the clean energy sector and will further diversify the company’s revenue sources and position Buckeye to meaningfully participate in the energy transition.

“Buckeye’s new and ongoing commitment to Canada is an investment in the skills of Canadian workers, in our access to global markets, and in our dedication to powering the green future,” says Katie Curran, Interim CEO, Invest in Canada. “Foreign direct investment is bringing jobs, stability and promise to some of Canada’s smaller communities, further proving that global investors will look at all corners of Canada for opportunities.”

Hydrogen, which burns without releasing carbon, is one of the most promising paths to reducing emissions from hard-to-abate industries including the maritime sector, heavy vehicle transportation, fertilizer and power generation. As the world moves steadily towards rapid decarbonization and governments around the world set new, progressively ambitious climate goals, hydrogen will play a central role in the energy, industrial and transportations sectors.

Support for Snake River dams Wright said the Trump administration is aligned with Newhouse on saving the dams, and thinking first of taxpayers and the citizens who need the power produced by the dams.
The energy secretary praised dams, saying such large infrastructure projects were built “when America was bold” and that a number of dams have been critical to the economic prosperity of the nation.
In his prepared remarks submitted to the House Energy and Water Appropriations Subcommittee, Wright said the administration is focused on energy addition, versus subtraction or even replacement.
When he visits PNNL, he also will visit the Hanford nuclear site and hydroelectric dams, he told Newhouse.","The nation’s new energy secretary is “passionately in support” of leaving the four lower Snake River dams in Eastern Washington intact, he said at a hearing last week in Washington, D.C.

Rep. Dan Newhouse, R-Wash., asked Secretary Chris Wright about his stand on the dams during a hearing to address the Trump administration’s proposed fiscal 2026 budget for the Department of Energy.

Newhouse also questioned him about layoffs at the Bonneville Power Administration and money for the Tri-Cities’ largest employers — the Hanford nuclear site and research at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory.

The lower Snake River dams provide reliable, low-cost hydroelectric power and other benefits, including transportation and irrigation, Newhouse stated.

Those benefits would be lost if the four dams from Ice Harbor Dam near Pasco to Lower Granite near Lewiston, Idaho, were breached in an effort to help save endangered salmon, he said.

He argued progress has been made to increase salmon populations, showing that hydroelectric dams and salmon can co-exist.

Support for Snake River dams

Wright said the Trump administration is aligned with Newhouse on saving the dams, and thinking first of taxpayers and the citizens who need the power produced by the dams.

The energy secretary praised dams, saying such large infrastructure projects were built “when America was bold” and that a number of dams have been critical to the economic prosperity of the nation.

Hydroelectric dams produce “high-value electricity,” because it is there when you need it, he said.

They are “very valuable assets” at a time of increasingly rapid growth in the need for power for artificial intelligence and advanced manufacturing, he said.

The nation needs to be ready to meet that demand without driving up the costs for ratepayers, he said.

“We should not spend money to go backward to reduce our energy-generating capacity, particularly of such high value electricity,” he said.

In his prepared remarks submitted to the House Energy and Water Appropriations Subcommittee, Wright said the administration is focused on energy addition, versus subtraction or even replacement.

“As government leaders, we need to be of the mindset that more is better,” he said in submitted remarks. “Replacing energy sources does not add to the finite energy supply that American families, businesses and innovators are competing for.”

The Biden administration announced in December that it wanted an updated look at findings of a four-year, $55 million federal study completed in 2020 that rejected calls to tear down the four lower Snake River dams.

A coalition of Northwest power, navigation and agricultural users that rely on the dams said what they called a “redo” of the 2020 environmental impact statement could lead to breaching the four dams.

The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and the Bonneville Power Administration have began work on a supplemental environmental impact statement, considering possible changes due to species proposed for listing under the Endangered Species Act and new reports, studies and information published since 2020.

Hanford nuclear site progress

Wright has pledged to visit every national laboratory, including Pacific Northwest National Laboratory in Richland, within a year of his appointment.

When he visits PNNL, he also will visit the Hanford nuclear site and hydroelectric dams, he told Newhouse.

Wright pointed out that the Trump administration’s proposed budget for fiscal 2026 includes maintaining level funding for Hanford, while other environmental clean up projects likely will share in budget cuts.

Wright has had multiple meetings with leaders at Bechtel National, the DOE contractor that is preparing to start turning radioactive waste now stored in underground tanks at Hanford into a stable glass form at the vitrification plant this summer.

He’s discussed with Bechtel the importance of bringing the plant online this year and is likely to be at the ribbon cutting, he said. Construction on the plant started in 2002.

Budget cuts and PNNL

Newhouse said he is concerned about significant cuts in programs that fund research for PNNL in Richland, including the DOE Office of Science and the DOE Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy.

“We don’t want to shrink or stop any of the critical research in our national labs ... from cybersecurity that (PNNL) is so strong at to fusion energy, to advanced computing, artificial intelligence, basic fundamental physics,” Wright said. “All of these things will go on, virtually unimpacted.”

But in recent years there has been growth in what he calls “political science,” because it is tied to political messaging or campaigns, he said.

The goal in the Trump administration’s proposed budget is to not touch what he called “hard science,” but “to trim out the fluff,” he said.

“The future of the national labs is very bright and the scientific and substantive output from the labs will not be reduced,” Wright said.

BPA layoffs questioned

The Bonneville Power Administration lost 200 workers who took voluntary layoffs as part of a federal program to reduce federal spending, Newhouse said.

He supports the goal of getting control of waste of federal taxpayer funds, but BPA does not receive federal funds, he said.

There appears to be the potential for the loss of grid reliability due to the loss of employees and institutional knowledge, Newhouse said.

BPA was already short staffed, Wright acknowledged. He said BPA employees were not allowed to participate in a second round of voluntary layoffs.

BPA supplies much of the electricity used in the greater Tri-Cities area and delivers it on the BPA electric grid.

Energy Star is on the chopping block, despite a government report that found the program has saved households and businesses $500 billion in energy costs since it was implemented by George H. W. Bush.

Since the early ‘90s, the federal government has been rating appliances by their energy efficiency, according to Steve Nadel, executive director of the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy.

Things like “refrigerators, clothes washers, dishwashers,” he said. And commercial buildings, homes, air conditioners and furnaces, too.

“And if they are certified, they can use a little blue Energy Star label, which makes it real easy for consumers to say, ‘Ah, here's a high-efficiency product.’ And as a result, sales of these products have generally increased quite a bit,” said Nadel.

Consumers who buy Energy Star products save money by reducing their electricity bills and consumption. Millions of efficient product sales later, and energy savings really add up including at times of peak demand, Nadel added.

“So it really is helping to reduce the demand for electricity and the need for power plants,” he said.

Over the years, those energy savings have helped electricity demand stay relatively flat for the last couple of decades. But that’s changing thanks to new industries, per Joshua Rhodes, a research scientist with the University of Texas at Austin.

“The electricity grid is looking to grow with new loads, like AI and data centers and all these other types of things,” he said.

Building new natural gas power plants and transmission lines and other infrastructure takes time and money. Meaning, “it would be good to continue to be efficient in places where we can, like with the Energy Star program,” he said.

Because this is the time we need all the energy we can get.

“Energy efficiency programs can help to reduce the rate at which electricity demand is growing,” said Ramteen Sioshansi, a professor in the department of engineering and public policy at Carnegie Mellon University.

Of course, losing Energy Star won’t have an immediate impact. Sioshansi said a lot of appliances today won’t need replacing for a while. But looking ahead, “you might see less of a drive by those appliance manufacturers to make their appliances more energy efficient.”

And it will become more challenging, he said, for consumers to pick an appliance that is more energy efficient.

Crazy!

Here’s our recap of legislative happenings related to the environment from Monday, May 12, 2025.

House floor

House Joint Resolution 138 (Alders) proposed a constitutional amendment that would prevent the imposition of a carbon tax in the state of Texas. Because it’s a constitutional amendment it needed a two-thirds majority to make it to a public vote and, fortunately!, it failed to meet that threshold. This doesn’t mean that a carbon tax is forthcoming from the legislature, but at least it doesn’t tie the hands of future lawmakers by foreclosing the possibility of a tax in the future.

The House did pass another proposed constitutional amendment. This one by Rep. Brooks Landgraf would shift 12% of the revenue generated from oil and gas production taxes, that currently go to the Rainy Day Fund, to a new Texas STRONG fund. The new fund would invest in community projects, including oil and gas cleanup and emissions reductions projects, in parts of the state heavily affected by oil and gas production.

Senate floor

The Senate passed SB 261 (Perry) which aims to ban the manufacture, processing, possession, distribution, and sale of cultivated meat. Advocates for this measure pointed to the deleterious impact cultivated meat could have on the livestock market and the state economy. Opponents of this measure argue that cultivated meat provides a more sustainable alternative to farming because it has a lower environmental impact.

In a win for water conservation, the Senate passed House Bill 517 (Harris Davila). This bill prevents Home Owners Associations (HOAs) from fining homeowners for having brown or discolored lawns when the property is subject to a watering restriction imposed due to drought conditions. Now, homeowners won’t be penalized for adhering to municipal regulations designed to conserve water. Hopefully this bill will help to alleviate confusion for homeowners as we head towards Texas’ hottest season.

Senate Committees

Senate Bill 2497 (Zaffirini) was approved in the Water, Agriculture and Rural Affairs Committee in the Senate. This bill is designed to address concerns regarding murky or smelly water. Although these conditions are not generally harmful to health, they still pose a threat to public confidence in their drinking water and may push consumers to purchase unsustainable plastic water bottles.",https://environmentamerica.org/texas/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/coal-power-plant-smokestacks-546538735-Mr-James-Kelley-via-shutterstock-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-05-14 07:09:45.921195

The agency is shuttering its Office of Research and Development – the second largest of which operates in Corryville – and cutting off funds for its work, according to a current official, a retired official and multiple national news reports.

Research will shift to a new EPA entity, the agency announced May 2.

The new Office of Applied Science and Environmental Solutions will be part of the Office of the Administrator and “tackle statutory obligations and mission-essential functions,” according to an agency press release.

The restructuring will save taxpayers $300 million a year by fiscal year 2026, the agency said, with some of the savings coming from job cuts.

Cincinnati will remain an EPA facility and laboratory “housing the important work of the new office,” EPA spokesperson Molly Vaseliou told The Enquirer.

What that means for local employment – once reported at more than 900 – remains murky.

10-story building sits on 22 acres

EPA’s Office of Research and Development employs about 1,500 people across the country.

As recently as 2017, EPA employed 980 people at Corryville's Andrew W. Breidenbach Environmental Research Center, according to its website. Of them, 537 were federal employees, with a combined payroll of $58 million a year, the site profile reported.

The Breidenbach Center, named for a wastewater treatment expert who spent nearly two decades working in Cincinnati, opened in 1978. The building includes 10 stories of labs and offices, filling about 472,000 square feet. At least seven more structures sit on a 22-acre site at the corner of Martin Luther King Drive and Vine Street.

In addition to the Breidenbach Center, EPA operates sites in Lower Price Hill, Milford, Winton Hills, Blue Ash and Erlanger, Kentucky.

Current Cincinnati employment is between 300 and 600, according to Michael Ottlinger, president of Chapter 279 of the National Treasury Employees Union, which represents EPA employees.

EPA’s Vaseliou did not answer questions about its current and future headcount.

But she did say Cincinnati will retain its water-related offices.

Research on water, landfills, even anthrax

EPA’s local water focus dates to 1912. That’s when a former U.S. Marine hospital, located on Third Street at the base of Mount Adams, became part of what was then the U.S. Public Health Service’s station to investigate stream pollution.

Over the following years, that office took on work related to air, industrial and chemical pollution and became part of the Department of Interior and then, with its creation in 1970, the EPA.

In recent years, EPA researchers have focused on lead and other contaminants in drinking water, along with threats to water quality from natural and man-made disasters. They’ve also focused on stream issues, including fecal contamination that threatens drinking water and closes beaches.

“Drinking water researchers are routinely called on by states and public water systems to diagnose problems and provide solutions,” the 2017 profile of local operations said.

Just two years ago, local EPA officials introduced its drinking water pilot plant to media, outlining their focus on removing PFAS, known as forever chemicals, from drinking water.

Other Cincinnati EPA research has focused on how to manage and clean up landfills and spills of oil and other chemicals.

In 2002, in the wake of 9/11 attacks during the Bush administration, EPA alarmed some officials when it added a Homeland Security Research Center in Cincinnati, to test anthrax and other biological agents.

The Corryville campus had earlier added what’s called a full containment facility to handle hazardous material research, winning approval to build it near the Breidenbach building in 1987.

'Not enough lifeboats'

Ottlinger, the union official, said local EPA employees were offered a second round of deferred retirements earlier in May.

Employees who decided against that and have not been offered a spot in the new Office of Applied Science and Environmental Solutions may be out of luck, Ottlinger said.

“If you’re not in a lifeboat, you are going down with the ship,” he said, adding “there aren’t enough lifeboats to take everybody.”

More than EPA jobs will be lost in the agency restructuring, he said. That includes relationships with universities and contracted employees. “We’ve been canceling contractors left and right.”

Cindy Sonich-Mullin, who retired in 2019 as Cincinnati director of the national risk management research lab, is disappointed that former colleagues cannot complete current projects.

“All that research is just going to be shut down,” she said.

Earlier this year, Sonich-Mullin's former colleagues were told to slow down and wrap up their priorities, she said. Instead, some have been speeding up and aiming to publish research results – both to advance science and complete work that might help them land new jobs.

“It’s heartbreaking to see what’s happening,” she said. “The people are so good and so dedicated.”","https://www.cincinnati.com/gcdn/presto/2023/02/15/PCIN/f1236adb-b96b-494d-8d68-5aaa35466e56-021423EPAoffice_26.JPG?crop=8639,4860,x0,y439&width=3200&height=1801&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-05-14 01:00:08.722963

Earth Day, which takes place annually on April 22nd, was established 55 years ago in 1970 after American rose up to fight against the destruction of our beautiful planet. The same protests led to the founding of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the adoption of the Clean Air Act, Clean Water Act, and most of the country’s other major environmental laws. The April 22, 1970 protests were the biggest social uprising in human history.

Over the years, though, what was originally a day of protests and teach-ins has largely become an excuse for polluters to “greenwash” their products and operations. But not this year. Given the Trump Administration’s assault on federal environmental protections, Earth Day took back some of its original character.

This year there was a rally organized by the AFGE Union Local 3907 members from the EPA and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) to celebrate Earth Day and to fight against the attacks on these federal agencies and workers. The rally took place just outside EPA’s National Vehicle and Fuel Emissions Laboratory (NVFEL) and NOAA’s Great Lakes Environmental Research Laboratory (GLERL) offices here in Ann Arbor.

At the event, there were impassioned speeches by representatives from AFGE union members representing, EPA, NOAA, and USGS; Huron River Watershed Council; A2Zero: Ann Arbor Office of Sustainability and Innovations; Thurston Nature Center, and the Ecology Center with special appearances from Representatives Rashida Talib and Debbie Dingell. All speakers talked about the big role the federal agencies and workers play to make sure our planet is healthy and the negative impact the current attacks would have.

“We only won our rights by fighting for our rights.” — Mike Garfield, Director of Ecology Center

Ecology Center director, Mike Garfield, spoke about how the EC was conceived during the first Earth Day event to keep the energy of the uprising alive. He asserted that “we only won our rights by fighting for our rights,” and it is on us to continue that fight, especially now that EPA workers in the environmental justice department were recently told that they will all be fired by July. He urged everyone to continue to take a stand and raise our voices.

“We shouldn’t have to fight for clean water or air in the richest nation in the world.” - Rashida Tlaib

Rep. Rashida Tlaib stated that “we shouldn’t have to fight for clean water or air in the richest nation in the world.” While we face serious and urgent issues, she said that it gives her hope to see more and more Americans rising up. In her speech, she also gave recognition to those who may not be able to attend such events in person for various reasons, but taking action in ways they can to remind us that the collective efforts expand beyond those we saw at the rally.

There were many local residents and community groups in attendance at the event including Ann Arbor Indivisible, a non-partisan grassroots movement to protect democracy. Gus Teschke, one of the organizers of the group, stated that though they do not work specifically on environmental issues, their work understands the importance of protecting regulatory agencies like the EPA and NOAA.

“Taking care of the environment is taking care of people” — David, former EPA worker.

David was one of many retired EPA workers and former AFGE Union members that came out to the rally. He stated that while we cannot prevent the administration from making legal changes, he is concerned about the illegal and reckless actions. He also commented that we need the EPA because “taking care of the environment is taking care of people.”

“The legislation could have incentivized biofuel producers to install carbon capture systems, for example, but instead would lower the bar on tax credit eligibility.","WASHINGTON – Today, the House Energy and Commerce and Ways and Means committees are voting on legislation that would eliminate clean energy programs and undermine clean energy tax credits. These programs and tax credits “are essential to protecting public health and the climate, bolstering domestic energy production, and driving economic growth and global competitiveness,” according to Reece Rushing, U.S. federal policy director at Clean Air Task Force (CATF).

Rushing continued:

“Just a few weeks ago, the Trump administration touted its support for energy innovation and clean technologies like next-generation geothermal, nuclear energy, and carbon capture and storage. But the legislation moving through House committees today would undermine the viability of many projects using these innovative clean energy technologies. Contrary to the administration’s goal of American energy dominance, this legislation cedes the energy future to global competitors like China. Innovative clean energy projects will be abandoned and good-paying jobs lost, while energy bills go up and grid reliability goes down.”

The House Energy and Commerce Committee is voting to eliminate the U.S. Department of Energy’s Loan Programs Office, which is critical to expanding nuclear energy, among other clean technologies, and repeal the Methane Emissions Reduction Program (MERP) to reduce natural gas leaks and waste.

The House Ways and Means Committee is simultaneously voting on legislation that would undermine vital clean energy tax credits, including the zero-emission nuclear power production tax credit (45U), the clean electricity investment and production tax credits (48E and 45Y) that benefit technologies like geothermal, advanced nuclear energy, and fusion energy, the 45Q tax credit that supports carbon capture and storage (CCS) and direct air capture (DAC), the 45V hydrogen production tax credit, and the 45Z clean fuels credit.

“The combination of limiting the transferability provisions and the imposition of unworkable Foreign Entity of Concern provisions included in the legislation will hinder deployment of CCS projects in the U.S., despite the Trump administration’s stated goal to support cutting edge technologies like carbon capture,” said Sam Bowers, U.S. policy manager, Carbon Capture at CATF. “The proposed reduced transferability window will cut the legs out from a key pathway to project financing. Restricting the ability to transfer 45Q credits beyond a narrow two-year window would also limit developers’ ability to extract the full value of 45Q to finance carbon capture projects, risking fewer projects and fewer carbon emissions reductions across the country.”

“Nuclear energy is one of the few zero-emissions sources that can provide reliable, grid-scale electricity and heat. Under the proposed phaseout of key tax credits for existing and new nuclear included in today’s bill, first- and early-of-a-kind projects set for deployment in the early-to-mid 2030s will struggle to qualify for incentives that are necessary for unlocking commercial nuclear projects at scale,” said Victor Ibarra, Jr., senior manager, Advanced Nuclear Energy at CATF. “In a world of growing economic demand, the viability and expansion of new nuclear depends on preserving, extending, and enhancing these federal tax credits.”

“Geothermal projects take years to plan and construct. The proposed phaseout of the investment tax credit (ITC) will functionally exclude any projects not already well underway,” said Terra Rogers, director, Superhot Rock Geothermal at CATF. “Phasing out the ITC now is like shutting down drilling rigs in the early 2000s, right before U.S. shale production surged over 700% and reshaped global energy markets. It’s just too soon to pull support for geothermal technologies that can drive American energy abundance and security. And, without preserving the ITC’s transferability clause, many early-stage developers who lack tax appetite will be unable to access the credit at all. Without these tools, leading geothermal innovators will look abroad to countries actively investing in advanced energy technologies. This would dramatically slow geothermal development in the U.S. and risk forfeiting our leadership and competitive edge in this abundant, secure, and homegrown energy resource.”

“Fusion energy is no longer decades away, with companies already building toward deployment. The proposed phaseout of 48E and 45Y pulls the rug out from under U.S. commercial fusion deployment as many American companies are actively preparing to add watts to the grid in the early-to-mid 2030s – just shy of a few years following the proposed phaseout,” said Sehila Gonzalez, global director, Fusion Energy at CATF. “Policy certainty is essential for driving American innovation, and eliminating these tax credits will harm U.S. competitiveness.”

“Eliminating the clean hydrogen production tax credit (45V) by the end of this year means essentially no facilities – including the hydrogen hubs currently under development – will qualify,” said Rachel Starr, senior U.S. policy manager, Hydrogen at CATF. “This credit, alongside other policy mechanisms, has provided momentum to grow the U.S. hydrogen industry, which contributes to domestic energy security, jobs, competitiveness, and innovation. This legislation would effectively end the U.S. hydrogen market before it’s able to take off and throw away the tens of thousands of high-paying American jobs that the hydrogen economy is projected to create.”

“Changes proposed to the clean fuel production tax credit (45Z) are both ineffective and costly. Extending the lifetime of the credit and also ignoring how increased demand for biofuels affects land use changes and the associated loss of soil carbon around the world is a dishonest way of making conventional biofuels look better than they are – all while increasing federal spending in the long run,” said Jonathan Lewis, global director, Transportation Decarbonization at CATF. “The legislation could have incentivized biofuel producers to install carbon capture systems, for example, but instead would lower the bar on tax credit eligibility. It’s a multi-billion-dollar giveaway to an existing industry, plain and simple.”

“The Methane Emissions Reduction Program (MERP) protects public health and the climate, reduces waste, and supports American leadership on methane pollution reduction,” said Darin Schroeder, methane legal and regulatory director at CATF. “This short-sighted proposal would shelve that leadership, and not only ignores the public’s support for MERP but also the direction the world is going in demanding low methane intensity gas. There’s no reason the U.S. should take this step backward.”

The Ways and Means Committee plan would create a new “money account for growth and advancement,” or MAGA account.
The Ways and Means Committee plan calls for raising that rate to as high as 21%, depending on the endowment’s size.","(CNN) — The details of House Republicans’ plans for their sweeping tax and spending cuts package – otherwise known as President Donald Trump’s “big, beautiful bill” – are coming into view now that lawmakers have revealed many of the consequential and controversial proposals.

The House Ways and Means Committee on Monday released their long-awaited plan to extend trillions of dollars in tax cuts that are set to expire at the end of this year, as well as add the tax cuts that Trump promised during his 2024 campaign, including exempting tips from taxation. It would beef up some tax breaks – including the popular child tax credit – as well as add at least one relatively new idea, a “MAGA” savings account for kids.

Overall, the proposal would cost a little more than $3.8 trillion over 10 years, according to a revised Joint Committee on Taxation score – below the Ways and Means Committee’s target of at least $4 trillion.

The House Energy and Commerce Committee on Sunday unveiled the initial text of its contentious proposal to slash spending on Medicaid, though the measures did not slice as deeply into program as some conservative members would like. The plan would hit the committee’s target of reducing the deficit by at least $880 million over a decade, according to an initial Congressional Budget Office analysis.

The two committees’ proposals aren’t finalized yet and could still change before they are voted on by the panels, which is expected to take place in the coming days.

The overall package aims to extend the GOP’s 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, as well as to fulfill several of Trump’s campaign promises. To help offset these tax reductions, the House is also looking for at least $1.5 trillion in spending cuts.

Republicans are also signaling they will make good on other Trump campaign promises, such as significant investments in staffing at the US southern border, new systems to discourage immigration into the US and a gigantic new missile defense shield. Then there are other longtime GOP policy goals, such as an overhaul of the nation’s outdated air traffic system, new fees targeting electric cars and a pivot away from federal student loans.

Eleven House committees are working on pieces of the larger bill, which will then be assembled into the package. Speaker Mike Johnson hopes to vote on the legislation before Memorial Day — an ambitious deadline. The Senate, however, has different ideas of what should be in the package. The chamber also has stricter rules of what can be included since congressional Republicans are pushing the legislation through using the budget reconciliation process so they don’t need Democratic support in the Senate.

Here’s what we know about the initial plans that some House committees have proposed for the legislative package:

For the first time in Medicaid’s 60-year history, certain recipients ages 19 to 64 would be required to work at least 80 hours a month to retain their benefits, according to an initial version of the Energy and Commerce Committee’s plan. They could also meet the controversial mandate by engaging in community service, attending school or participating in a work program.

The requirement, which would take effect in 2029, would not apply to parents, pregnant women, medically frail individuals and those with substance-abuse disorders, among others.

Republicans have long sought to add work requirements to Medicaid, which provides health insurance to more than 71 million low-income Americans. The first Trump administration granted waivers to several states to implement such a mandate, but the efforts were halted by federal courts.

The mandate may result in millions of people losing their coverage, multiple analyses have shown. While many adults on Medicaid have jobs, they may have trouble meeting the reporting requirements, obtaining exemptions or landing enough hours each month to maintain their eligibility.

The plan also mandates states to check Medicaid expansion recipients’ eligibility every six months, instead of annually, and to require that certain low-income adults covered under Medicaid expansion pay for a portion of their care. Recipients would also have to prove they have US citizenship or legal immigration status.

In addition, the plan would penalize states that have expanded Medicaid and that provide Medicaid coverage to undocumented immigrants using state funds. These states would see a 10% reduction in their federal matching funds for the expansion population. Several states, including California, New York, Utah and Illinois, cover undocumented children, adults or both in state health plans.

And it would limit states’ ability to levy taxes on health care providers, the revenue which states use to boost provider rates and fund health-related initiatives, among other uses. All but one state levy at least one type of provider tax, which some Republicans claim is a scheme by states to get more federal matching funds.

However, the committee did not include several other controversial proposals that would have reduced the share of federal funds that states receive.

The child tax credit would rise to $2,500, up from $2,000, per child from 2025 through 2028, under the Ways and Means Committee plan.

Also, the measure would require that parents, in addition to the child, have Social Security numbers. Currently, parents can claim the credit if they have individual taxpayer identification numbers, which some noncitizens who are not eligible for Social Security numbers use to file federal taxes. The change would mean 2 million fewer children would be eligible next year, according to the JCT.

The Ways and Means Committee plan would create a new “money account for growth and advancement,” or MAGA account. The federal government would provide a one-time $1,000 credit to the accounts of children born from 2025 through 2028 who are US citizens at birth.

The annual contribution limit to the tax-preferred accounts would be $5,000, and money could not be withdrawn before the beneficiary turns 18. After that, the funds could be used for higher education or a first-time home purchase, among other purposes, and taxed at capital gains rates. After a beneficiary turns 31, the account would cease to be a MAGA account.

Certain taxpayers would be able to deduct the income they receive from tips on their tax returns, fulfilling a key Trump campaign promise, under the Ways and Means Committee plan.

But it would only apply to occupations that traditionally receive tips, in an effort to prevent employers and workers from recharacterizing their income as tips to escape taxes. The Treasury secretary would be tasked with publishing a list of such jobs.

Highly compensated individuals, who make more than $160,000 in 2025, would not qualify. The deduction would apply to 4 million tipped workers, according to a fact sheet from Rep. Jason Smith, the committee’s chair.

Likewise, many workers who receive overtime would not have to pay taxes on that extra compensation. It would apply to 80 million hourly workers, according to Smith.

Both breaks would be available to taxpayers who do not itemize their deductions, who are the majority of Americans. However, the measures would only be in effect from 2025 through 2028.

Senior citizens would receive a $4,000 increase to their standard deduction from 2025 through 2028, according to the Ways and Means Committee plan. But the benefit would start to phase out for individuals with incomes of more than $75,000 and couples with incomes double that amount.

This measure is aimed at fulfilling Trump’s promise to end taxes on Social Security benefits since lawmakers cannot include such a measure under the rules of budget reconciliation, which Republicans are using to advance the package without Democratic support in the Senate.

The Ways and Means Committee is proposing a new temporary deduction for the interest on car loans, in keeping with Trump’s campaign promise.

Eligible taxpayers could deduct up to $10,000 in interest annually from 2025 through 2028. But the tax break would start to phase out for single filers earning more than $100,000 and married couples earning $200,000.

It applies to taxpayers who get car loans starting in 2025 and who buy passenger vehicles that had their final assembly in the US.

The Ways and Means Committee plan would temporarily boost the standard deduction by $1,000 for single filers and $2,000 for married couples.

And it includes some measures that would benefit wealthy Americans. It would make permanent the larger estate tax exemption, which would be set at $15 million per person for 2026 and would be indexed to inflation thereafter.

Plus, it would make permanent a special deduction for the owners of certain pass-through entities who pay their business taxes on their individual tax returns. It would beef up that deduction to 23%, up from 20%. These so-called pass-through businesses include partnerships, such as those formed by lawyers, doctors or investors.

The Ways and Means Committee plan would also hike the current limit on state and local tax deductions to $30,000 annually for married couples, up from $10,000. But the full amount would be limited to those making $400,000 or less, before it starts to phase out.

For single filers, the cap would be raised to $15,000 for those earning $200,000 or less, before phasing out.

The change would take effect starting in 2026.

Republican lawmakers from high-tax states, including California and New York, have been demanding an increase to the so-called SALT cap for years since it disproportionately hits their constituents. The limit mainly affects higher-income residents in those states. Four New York representatives said last week that raising the cap to only $30,000 was “insulting.”

Republicans introduced the cap as part of their 2017 tax cuts package as a way to help pay for the sweeping legislation. Trump had promised to eliminate the cap on the campaign trail last year, but doing so would be very costly.

The Ways and Means Committee would restore a tax break from the 2017 tax package that allowed businesses to fully write off the cost of equipment in the first year it was purchased. The incentive has been phasing out since 2023.

Also, the plan would once again allow businesses to write off the cost of research and development in the year it was incurred. The TCJA required that companies deduct those expenses over five years, starting in 2022.

The two provisions would expire after 2029.

However, the plan would limit writing off the purchases of professional sports teams.

Some universities currently pay a 1.4% tax on the net investment income from their endowments. The Ways and Means Committee plan calls for raising that rate to as high as 21%, depending on the endowment’s size.

Similarly, private foundations would see their tax rate jump to as much as 10%, up from roughly 1.4%.

The Ways and Means Committee’s plan would also raise the debt ceiling by $4 trillion.

Congress needs to raise the debt limit before its August recess to prevent the nation from defaulting on its obligations, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent wrote to lawmakers last week.

Under a plan released by the House Agriculture Committee on Monday, more food stamp recipients would have to work to qualify for benefits.

Currently, adults ages 18 to 54 without dependent children can only receive food stamps for three months over a 36-month period unless they work 20 hours a week or are eligible for an exemption.

The committee’s plan would extend the work requirement to those ages 55 to 64, as well as to parents of children between the ages of 7 and 18. Plus it would curtail states’ ability to receive work requirement waivers in difficult economic times, limiting them only to counties with unemployment rates above 10%.

The measure would also require states to pay for a portion of the benefit costs – at least 5% – for the first time, starting in fiscal year 2028. States with higher payment error rates would have to shoulder more of the burden – as much as 25% of the costs for those with error rates of at least 10%.

Plus, states would have to pick up 75% of the administrative costs, rather than 50%.

Advocates quickly criticized the proposals, saying recipients could lose crucial food assistance and states would be on the hook for millions of dollars, which could lead them to cut benefits and eligibility.

Some 42 million Americans are enrolled in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, the formal name for food stamps.

The proposals from House Republicans would effectively deal a blow to the Inflation Reduction Act, former President Joe Biden’s major clean energy law passed in 2022.

The proposals would end consumer tax credits helping lower the cost of electric vehicles and buying energy efficient appliance, rooftop solar and insulation. It would also phase out tax credits that businesses could use to build new electricity generation like wind and solar, as well as clean energy sources that the Trump administration has voiced support for, including nuclear and geothermal energy.

Tax credits that remain largely intact include one that would allow the oil and gas industry to capture and sequester the planet-warming pollution it emits.

Elsewhere, the House Energy and Commerce committee proposed clawing back unspent IRA funds, targeting a $27 billion grant program at the Environmental Protection Agency and other EPA and Energy Department programs.

Over 20 House Republicans have called for the preservation of several tax credits that would be killed by the proposed bill, with some saying it’s a red line given how much money and jobs have come to their districts following the Inflation Reduction Act.

Here’s what we know about what other House committees have already voted to approve:

The Education and Workforce Committee’s plan would dramatically restructure the way students can borrow from the federal government for college, as well as make big changes to the popular Pell grant program. It is seeking to find about $330 billion worth of savings by limiting the federal role in the student borrowing process.

The measure would cap the total amount of federal aid a student can receive annually at the “median cost of college” and end economic hardship and unemployment deferments. Plus, it would bar loan servicers from temporarily suspending student loan payments for more than nine months over a two-year period.

The changes also include terminating the subsidized loan program for undergraduate students and the Graduate PLUS loan program for new borrowers, with a three-year exception for students with such loans. The plan would amend the maximum annual and aggregate loan limits for unsubsidized loans, as well as require undergraduate students to exhaust their unsubsidized loan options before their parents can take out Parent PLUS loans.

In addition, the measure would terminate all income-contingent repayment plans — including Biden’s SAVE plan, which has been blocked in federal court. Instead, borrowers would have a choice of a standard repayment plan or a repayment assistance plan based on borrowers’ income.

The committee is proposing alterations to the Pell grant program, including requiring students attend school at least half time and increasing the number of credit hours needed for full-time enrollment. But it would expand eligibility for such grants for students enrolled in short-term workforce programs.

And the measure would create “skin-in-the-game accountability” for colleges participating in the Direct Loan program by requiring them to reimburse the Department of Education for a portion of loans that aren’t fully repaid.

It would also establish a “Promise” program to provide colleges with performance-based grants of up to $5,000 per federal student aid recipient. The colleges must provide students with a guaranteed maximum total price for their program of study based on income and financial needs categories. The formula would reward institutions for strong earnings outcomes, low tuition, and enrollment and graduation of low-income students.

Immigrants applying for asylum and work authorization, as well as those applying for humanitarian parole and temporary protected status, would have to pay new or higher fees, under the House Judiciary Committee’s plan.

Asylum seekers and parolees would have to pay $1,000 to apply and $550 for an initial work permit, for instance. Plus, sponsors of unaccompanied children would have to pay up to $3,500.

The measure also provides $45 billion to build new immigration detention facilities, including family detention centers, to allow the detention of at least 100,000 people a day, on average. It supports hiring 10,000 more Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers, including money for retention and signing bonuses for the agents, and provides funding for 1 million annual deportations through ground and air transportation.

And it provides $1.3 billion to hire immigration judges and support staff, as well as to expand courtroom capacity.

The House Homeland Security Committee is proposing tens of billions of dollars to bolster border security, including $46.5 billion to expand and modernize the border barrier system. Planned investments include the completion of 700 miles of primary wall, the construction of 900 miles of river barriers, and the replacement of 141 miles of vehicle and pedestrian barriers.

The measure would also provide $5 billion to acquire, construct or improve Customs and Border Protection facilities. Plus, it would funnel $4.1 billion for the agency to hire and train 3,000 new Border Patrol agents, 5,000 new Office of Field Operations customs officers, 200 new Air and Marine Operations agents, 290 support staff, and eligible retired agents and officers. It would also invest $2 billion in annual retention bonuses and signing incentives.

It would provide nearly $1.1 billion to strengthen technology to detect and disrupt the smuggling of illegal drugs and people into the US, and $2.7 billion for border surveillance technology, including tunnel detection capability and unmanned aircraft systems.

And the plan includes $1 billion for security and planning for the 2028 Olympics in Los Angeles, as well as $625 million for the 2026 FIFA World Cup, which will be hosted by the US, Canada and Mexico. It would also provide $300 million for the Federal Emergency Management Agency for the reimbursement of extra law enforcement costs for protecting presidential residences.

The plan approved by Republicans on the House Oversight Committee, which is tasked with cutting at least $50 billion in spending, would require federal employees to contribute more to their pensions and make other changes to their retirement benefits.

The most significant measure would be raising the Federal Employees Retirement System contribution rate for many current civilian and postal employees to 4.4% of their salary. Those hired prior to 2014 generally contribute either 0.8% or 3.1%, while more recent hires generally already contribute 4.4%.

For new, younger retirees, the plan would also eliminate the additional retirement annuity payment they would receive until they are eligible for Social Security benefits. And it would base retirees’ pension payments on their average highest five earning years, instead of highest three years, as well as reduce retirement system contributions for employees who agree to serve “at will,” giving them fewer job protections.

Plus, the plan would institute a fee for employees’ appeals to the Merit Systems Protection Board, which would be refunded to them if they win their appeal. And it would require a comprehensive audit of workers’ dependents enrolled in the Federal Employees Health Benefits program, including the verification of marriage and birth certificates.

Under the House Transportation Committee’s plan, electric vehicles would have to pay an annual registration fee of $250 and hybrid vehicles would be assessed an annual fee of $100. The funds would be deposited into the Highway Trust Fund.

But a proposal to levy a $20 annual tax on gas vehicles was dropped, after it faced swift pushback from conservatives.

The committee’s plan would also eliminate seven green programs authorized by the Democrats’ 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, including the Low-Carbon Transportation Materials Grants Program and the Federal Aviation Administration’s Alternative Fuel and Low-Emission Aviation Technology Program.

The committee is tasked with providing $10 billion in savings.

The House Transportation Committee would appropriate $12.5 billion for the modernization of the nation’s air traffic control system. The funds would begin replacing outdated technology and enhance the hiring of air traffic controllers.

The plan proposed by the House Financial Services Committee would limit the embattled Consumer Financial Protection Bureau’s authority to draw funds from the Federal Reserve. Also, it would essentially eliminate the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, which was established by Congress to oversee the audits of public companies, by shifting its responsibilities to the Securities and Exchange Commission and barring it from collecting fees from companies and brokers and dealers.

The House Armed Services Committee is proposing to add roughly $150 billion to strengthen the nation’s defense programs.

The committee’s plan includes nearly $25 billion for Trump’s “Golden Dome” missile defense initiative, which calls for developing a space-based system and quickly accelerating defense capabilities against hypersonic threats. It would provide nearly $34 billion for ship building and more than $20 billion for munitions, including ramping up the domestic production of rare earth and critical minerals.

Also, the measure would funnel more than $8.5 billion to improving service members’ quality of life, including renovating military barracks, providing supplemental payments of the Basic Housing Allowance, expanding educational opportunities and child care fee assistance, and broadening professional licensure assistance programs for military spouses.

The House Judiciary Committee’s plan would defund the enforcement of contempt orders if the judge had previously not ordered the plaintiffs in the case to put up a security bond with a preliminary injunction or temporary restraining order granted in their favor. The goal is to stop frivolous lawsuits, according to a committee spokesperson.

,EVs,2025-05-14 02:01:04+00:00,TechCrunch,GM's new 'manganese-rich' battery promises cheaper EVs in 2028 | TechCrunch,Tim De Chant,,,,,https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/13/gms-new-manganese-rich-battery-promises-cheaper-evs-in-2028/,"“With LMR, we can deliver over 400-mile range in our trucks while significantly reducing our battery costs,” Kurt Kelty, GM’s vice president of battery, propulsion, and sustainability, told TechCrunch.
The LMR chemistry will have 0-2% cobalt, 30-40% nickel, and 60-70% manganese.
LMR battery packs will contain prismatic cells instead of pouches.
The new cells will be made by Ultium Cells, GM’s joint venture with LG Energy Solution.
GM’s LMR research has been underway for a decade.","General Motors revealed Tuesday a new battery chemistry called lithium-manganese-rich (LMR), which it says should slash costs while delivering driving range that’s just shy of the most advanced batteries on the market.

“With LMR, we can deliver over 400-mile range in our trucks while significantly reducing our battery costs,” Kurt Kelty, GM’s vice president of battery, propulsion, and sustainability, told TechCrunch.

LMR will also dramatically reduce the amount of nickel and cobalt compared with GM’s most advanced cells, two critical minerals that aren’t readily available from domestic sources in the United States.

Today, the Chevrolet Silverado EV uses nickel-manganese-cobalt (NMC) cells to drive 492 miles on a full charge. That impressive range comes with a hefty price tag. The electric trucks start at over $73,000 for the general public (a fleet version costs less). GM is planning a version with cheaper lithium-iron-phosphate (LFP) cells, which would drop the price by $6,000, but also cuts range to 350 miles.

The new technology would preserve the LFP price cuts without sacrificing as much range.

GM says the new cells will be cheaper for a few reasons. For one, manganese is cheaper than cobalt or nickel. The LMR chemistry will have 0-2% cobalt, 30-40% nickel, and 60-70% manganese. That’s significantly less than today’s leading NMC cells, which are up to 10% cobalt and 80% nickel.

Previous attempts at manganese-rich batteries have tended to degrade quickly. GM thinks it has cracked the problem. The automaker experimented with a range of materials and manufacturing processes to arrive at the current formulation.

LMR battery packs will contain prismatic cells instead of pouches. Today’s Ultium batteries use the latter. Kelty said switching to prismatic cells, which have a rigid shell, will help the company build a battery pack with more than 50% fewer parts.

“It’s a huge, huge cost savings we’ll get,” he said.

GM has big plans for LMR, with the chemistry potentially spreading throughout the EV lineup. Andy Oury, business planning manager at GM, said that LMR could “take up a huge chunk in the middle” of the market, pushing LFP to entry-level vehicles and pricey NMC to applications that need long range and high energy density.

The new cells will be made by Ultium Cells, GM’s joint venture with LG Energy Solution. Through Ultium, the two companies have invested billions of dollars in battery manufacturing in the United States.

Both have been pursuing LMR for years. GM has more than 50 patents on LMR, though LG has also been working on the technology itself. Kelty acknowledged it’s possible that LG could make its own version of LMR cells that don’t infringe on GM’s patents, making the chemistry more widely available. “It’ll be interesting to see how this all plays out,” Kelty said.

GM’s LMR research has been underway for a decade. Its efforts kicked into high gear in the last couple years as engineers successfully produced large-format cells similar to those in EVs on the road today.

GM has made about 300 large format cells so far, and its testing regime equates to around 1.5 million miles of typical driving, said Kushal Narayanaswamy, director of advanced cell engineering at the automaker.

That leaves just a few short years for the company to modify its existing manufacturing plants to accommodate the new chemistry and then scale up production. Scaling, in particular, tripped up the first Ultium cells.

Kelty is confident that GM can hit the 2028 target.

“It meets all our performance metrics, we have a partner that’s going to manufacture it, and we’ve got a manufacturing location,” he said. “The other thing is, the supply chain is much more local than high-nickel or LFP, so we’re really incentivized to do this. There’s a lot of things coming together here that really make us want to go quickly.”","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/A00005-3-4.jpg?resize=1200,633",N,,2025-05-13 22:05:47.463422

Blasty Bough now produces more energy than it uses, turning clean power into a dual source of savings and revenue.","With help from the United States Department of Agriculture’s (USDA) Rural Energy for America Program (REAP), a federal initiative that helps rural small businesses and farms invest in renewable energy, more small operations across New England are discovering the benefits of going solar. Blasty Bough Brewing Company, a farm-to-kettle brewery in Epsom, New Hampshire, is one of them.

Founded in the mid-2000s as a working farm, Blasty Bough blends its agricultural roots with forward-thinking energy solutions. The brewery pairs craft beer and live music with its self-described secret weapon: sheep grazing beneath rows of solar panels.

Sunshine as income

Blasty Bough’s solar array, installed by ReVision Energy, produces 800 to 1,000 kilowatt-hours (kWh) more than the brewery needs each month, turning sunshine into a small but steady income stream. As the brewery continues to grow, it expects to eventually use all the power it generates — making solar not just a sustainable choice, but a strategic investment in its future.

The solar-powered setup underscores the brewery’s commitment to sustainability, serving as a model for clean energy integration in craft brewing.

Brewing with clean energy

Revision Energy first connected with Blasty Bough owner Dave Stewart in 2018, when he began exploring solar as a way to align the brewery’s agricultural roots with a more sustainable future. For Stewart, clean energy wasn’t just a practical choice—it was, in his words, “the right thing to do.” It also offered a way to lower energy expenses and support the local economy.

The solar project truly took shape in 2022, as most good ideas do, over a couple of beers. The connection was sparked at the brewery itself, where early conversations between Stewart and ReVision Energy laid the groundwork for a collaboration. Over the wooden bar, we began planning a project that paired our local renewable energy expertise with Stewart’s vision for the future of the brewery.

“Beer is no longer the only driver — people come for the full experience, and sustainability is a big part of that,” says Stewart.

We worked with Stewart to plan a system tailored to the brewery’s energy usage and future expansion. The final system was installed between October 16 and November 27, 2023. It consists of 182 QCELLS Q.PEAK DUO XL-G10.3 BFG 480W solar modules, paired with nine SMA SB 7.7-ITP-US-41 inverters and mounted on APA Ready Rack fixed-tilt ground mount racking.

The 87.3 kW direct current (DC) system produces more than 9,000 kWh of clean energy each month. It currently exceeds demand, feeding excess energy back into the grid and generating valuable credits.

Raising a Glass to REAP

Blasty Bough applied for a REAP grant during the March 2023 cycle. With our help, Stewart submitted the application just in time. Though the USDA had not yet awarded the grant, they confirmed the submission was complete, clearing the way for the project to proceed at the owner’s risk.

REAP empowers rural businesses to move forward with confidence, even before grant funds are disbursed. Once Stewart’s application was confirmed as complete, he made the proactive choice to begin construction. With Epsom’s frozen winter soil approaching, the timing proved critical. Thanks to swift coordination between our teams, the project broke ground in time, avoiding costly seasonal delays and maximizing the impact of the REAP grant.

Ultimately, the grant reimbursed roughly one third of the total project cost, making the solar installation not only possible, but financially viable at a critical time. Although REAP funding was temporarily frozen in January 2025, it was eventually reinstated — a reminder of how important it is to protect American energy incentives from shifting political winds. As funding for clean energy programs faces renewed challenges, the stakes for rural farmers and small businesses remain high.

“The USDA’s REAP program has been a game-changer for family farms and small businesses across New England — helping them lower energy costs, strengthen local economies, and reduce their carbon footprint,” says Dan Weeks, vice president of business development at ReVision Energy. “Uncertainty around future funding puts these real, community-level benefits at risk. We hope policymakers recognize how vital this program is for rural prosperity and energy independence.”

Sheep grazing a crucial element

Blasty Bough Brewing incorporates solar grazing as a practical, sustainable solution for vegetation management. Sheep from a nearby farm graze the fields beneath the solar array, reducing maintenance needs while benefiting from shade. This eliminates the need for fossil fuel-powered mowers and aligns with the brewery’s agricultural values.

“We have always kept sheep — they do their job and require almost nothing in return,” Stewart notes.

This approach not only supports local farmers and operational efficiency, but it also contributes to the site’s visual appeal and sustainability goals.

Brewing Up Future Sustainability

The brewery has plans to eventually open a bed and breakfast, transforming the property into a full countryside retreat. Stewart sees the solar installation as a way to prepare operations for future growth while offering a sustainable getaway for guests.

Blasty Bough now produces more energy than it uses, turning clean power into a dual source of savings and revenue. Looking ahead, the brewery plans to expand operations, eliminate reliance on oil heating, and operate entirely on solar power, including electric vehicle charging, further advancing its long-term sustainability goals.

“The bill is written to come across as reasonable, but the devil is in the details,” Robbie Orvis, a senior analyst at Energy Innovation, a nonpartisan energy and climate think tank, told me. “It may not be literally the worst text we envisioned seeing, but it’s probably close.”

The proposal would strangle new energy development so quickly that it could raise power costs by as much as 7% over the next decade, according to the Rhodium Group, an energy and policy analysis firm.

Senate Republicans have already indicated that the proposal is unworkable. But to understand why, it’s worth diving into the specific requirements that render the proposal so destructive.

The clean energy tax credits are one of the centerpieces of American energy policy. They’re meant to spur companies to deploy new forms of energy technology, such as nuclear fusion or advanced geothermal wells, and simultaneously to cut carbon pollution from the American power grid.

The U.S. government has long used the tax code to encourage the build-out of wind turbines or solar panels. But when Democrats passed the Inflation Reduction Act in 2022, they rewrote a pair of key tax credits so that any technology that generates clean electricity would receive financial support.

Under the law as enacted, these clean electricity tax credits provide 10 years of support to any electricity project — no matter howit generates power — for the foreseeable future. But the new Republican proposal would begin phasing down the value of the credit starting in 2029, and end the program entirely in 2032.

That might sound like a slow and even reasonable phase-out. But a series of smaller changes to the law’s text introduce significant uncertainty about which projects would continue to qualify for the tax credit in the interim. Taken together, these new requirements would kill most, if not all, of the tax credits’ value.

Here are three reasons why the Republican proposal would prove so devastating to the American clean electricity industry.

1. The new proposal introduces profound uncertainty about power plant financing for individual developers.

The new Ways and Means proposal begins to phase out the clean energy tax credits immediately. The proposal cuts the value of the tax credit by 20% per year starting in 2029, and ends the credit entirely in 2032.

But the GOP proposal changes a key phrase that helps financiers invest confidently in a given project.

Under the law as it stands today, developers can’t claim a tax credit until a project is “placed in service” — meaning that it is generating electricity and selling it to the grid. But a project qualifies for a tax credit in the year that construction on that project begins.

For example, imagine a utility that begins building a new geothermal power plant this year, but doesn’t finish construction and connect it to the grid until 2029. Under current law, that company could qualify for the value of the credit as it stands today, but it wouldn’t begin to get money back on its taxes until 2029.

But the GOP proposal would change this language. Under the House Republican text, projects only qualify for a tax credit when they are “placed in service,” regardless of when construction begins. This means that the new geothermal power plant in the earlier example could only get tax credits as set at the 2029 value — regardless of when construction begins.

What’s more, if work on the project were delayed, say by a natural disaster or unexpected equipment shortage, and the power plant’s completion date was pushed into the following year, then the project would only qualify for credits as set at the 2030 value.

In other words, companies and utilities would have no certainty about a tax credit’s value until a project is completed and placed in service. Any postponement or slowdown at any part of the process — even if for a reason totally outside of a developer’s control — could reduce a tax credit’s value.

This makes the tax credits far less dependable than they are today. Generally, companies have more ability to plan around when construction on a power plant begins than they do over when it is placed in service.

This change will significantly raise financing costs for new energy projects of all types because it means that companies won’t be able to finalize their capital stack until a project is completed and turned on. The most complicated and adventurous projects — such as new geothermal, nuclear, or fusion power plants — could face the highest cost inflation.

2. The proposal imposes unworkably strict rules on the parts, components, and minerals used in clean energy projects.

The Inflation Reduction Act as it stands today attaches a “foreign entity of concern” rule to its $7,500 tax credit for electric vehicle buyers.

In order to qualify for that EV tax credit, automakers had to cut the percentage of Chinese-processed minerals and battery components that appear in their electric models every year. This phased in gradually over time — the idea being that while China dominates the EV and battery supply chain today, the requirement would provide a consistent spur to reshore production.

Somewhat ironically, the GOP proposal ditches the EV tax credit and its accompanying foreign sourcing rules. But it applies a strict version of the foreign entity of concern rule to every other tax credit in the law, including the clean electricity tax credits.

Under the House proposal, no project can qualify for the tax credits unless it receives no “material support” from a Chinese-linked entity. The language defines “material support” aggressively and expansively — it means any “any component, subcomponent, or applicable critical mineral” that is “extracted, processed, recycled, manufactured, or assembled.”

This provision, in other words, would essentially disqualify the use of any Chinese-made part, subcomponent, or metal in the construction of a clean electricity project, although the rule includes a partial and narrow carve-out for some components that are bought from a third-party. Even a mistakenly Chinese-sourced bolt could result in a project losing millions of dollars of tax credits.

Technically, the law also disqualifies the use of goods from other “foreign entities of concern” as defined under U.S. law, which include Russia, Iran, and North Korea. But China is the United States’ third largest trading partner, and it is the only manufacturer of the type of goods that matter to the law.

Solar projects would face immediate challenges under the new rule. China and its domestic companies command more than 80% of the market share for all stages of the solar panel manufacturing process, according to the International Energy Agency.

But then again, the proposal would be an issue for virtually all energy projects. Copper wiring, steel frames, grams of key metals — even geothermal plants rely on individual Chinese-made industrial components, according to Seaver Wang, an analyst at the Breakthrough Institute. These parts also intermingle on the global market, meaning that companies can’t be certain where a given part was made or where it comes from.

These new and stricter rules would kick in two years after the reconciliation bill passes, which likely means 2027.

This provision by itself would be unworkable. But it is made even worse by being coupled to the tax credit’s change to a “placed in service” standard. That’s because projects that are already under construction today might not meet these new foreign entity rules, essentially stripping them of tax credits that companies had already been banking on.

These projects have assumed that they will qualify for the tax credits’ full value, no matter when their power plant is completed, because they have already begun construction. But the GOP proposal would change this retroactively, possibly threatening the financial viability of energy projects that grid managers have been assuming will come online in the next few years.

In some ways, these two changes taken together are “worse than repeal,” Mike O’Boyle, an Energy Innovation analyst, told me. “A number of projects under construction now will lose eligibility.""

It is also made worse by the House GOP plan to phase out the tax credits. If companies could plan on the tax credits remaining on the books long-term then the foreign entity rules might spur the creation of a larger domestic — or at least non-Chinese — supply chain for some clean energy inputs. But because the credits will phase out by 2032 regardless, fewer projects will qualify, and it won’t be worth it for companies to invest in alternative supply chains.

3. The GOP proposal would end developers’ ability to transfer their tax credits to other firms.

Finally, the House Republican proposal would end companies’ ability to sell the value of tax credits to other firms. The IRA had made it easier for utilities and developers to transfer the value of tax credits to other companies — essentially allowing companies with a lot of tax liability, such as banks, to acquire the rights to renewable developers’ credits.

The GOP proposal ends that right for every tax credit, even those that Republicans have historically looked on more favorably, such as the tax credit that rewards companies for capturing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.

This change — coupled with the foreign entity and placed-in-service rules — will have an impact today on power markets by further gumming up the pipeline of new energy projects planned across the country, according to Advait Arun, an analyst at the Center for Public Enterprise.

The end to transferability “functionally imposes higher marginal tax rates on all of these projects,” Arun told me. “The prices that developers will get for their tax credits on the tax equity market today will be a lot lower than normal.”

That could significantly raise the cost of any new energy projects that get planned. And that will lead in the medium term to a further slowdown in the growth of electricity supply, just as turbine shortages have made it more difficult than ever to build a new natural gas power plant.

While many of these changes may seem academic, they will hit energy consumers faster than legislators might realize. Natural gas prices in the U.S. have been unusually high in 2025. A slowdown in the growth of non-fossil energy will further stress natural gas supplies, raising power prices.

Taken together, Orvis told me, these changes to the IRA “will increase the price of the vast majority of new capacity coming online next year,” Orvis said. “It’s an immediate price hike for new energy, and you can’t replace that with new gas.”",https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy82MDIwNzIwMi9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc1MTgwNDU4Nn0.ysB5ThxsQQimLGeiTdvtmbKRW2Q2v81hiMw7-xLLYfg/image.jpg?width=1200&height=600&coordinates=0%2C100%2C0%2C100,N,,2025-05-13 22:05:58.130351

And we’ll have to try all over again to use government’s power to address climate change — only we’ll be starting from even further back.","After months of sitting on the sidelines and nodding approvingly while Donald Trump and Elon Musk eviscerate the federal government, congressional Republicans are finally joining in. To offset extending tax breaks for the wealthiest Americans, Republicans are searching high and low for spending cuts. And that means wiping away any policy initiatives — even, perhaps especially, the successful ones — that were enacted under President Joe Biden.

Republicans particularly have homed in on rolling back the substantial recent progress on fighting climate change. Many Americans are likely unaware that we are in the midst of a green energy revolution, driven not only by market forces but by government at all levels. But the GOP is determined to stop success in its tracks.

It all adds up to a future of more gas-guzzlers and more pollution.

The Trump administration, in its zeal to demolish any government program meant to address climate change, often seems to be violating existing law — for instance, by refusing to spend money that had been appropriated by Congress. As a result, many of those efforts are tied up in court. But the mega bill under consideration in Congress is moved under the budget reconciliation process, which means it can pass with a simple majority. That offers the White House and its GOP allies an opportunity to make just about whatever spending changes they like.

This week, a group of House committees released the text of their portions of the bill, including the Energy and Commerce Committee and the tax-writing Ways and Means Committee; those two are where the assault on climate spending is centered. The fattest target for cuts is the Inflation Reduction Act, which Biden signed in 2022. Widely regarded as the most important climate law in history, the IRA established a panoply of programs for conservation, climate resilience, emissions reduction and green energy development. Yet since many of those programs roll out spending over years or even decades, Republicans can be cut them off just as they’re ramping up.

The highest-profile program may be the IRA’s $7,500 tax credit for electric vehicle purchases, which the Ways and Means bill looks to repeal (though in a complicated, years-long fashion). Republicans also want to loosen auto emission standards and eliminate funding for new kinds of zero-emission vehicles. It all adds up to a future of more gas-guzzlers and more pollution.

EVs are still a small portion of the American market; the IRA sought to help U.S. manufacturers catch up with the rest of the world, where EVs are taking off in both production and adoption. The Chinese EV industry in particular has left us in the dust. Republicans, however, seem determined to keep us in the last century.

The GOP legislation would also gut the Loan Programs Office, a venture capital operation within the Department of Energy. The LPO, created in 2005 under a law passed by a Republican Congress and signed by Republican President George W. Bush, funds promising companies that banks and private venture capitalists might not back. It has been successful at helping many innovative American firms develop new technologies and bring them to market. In 2010, for example, it provided a $465 million loan to a fledgling car company named Tesla.

No project is too small or unobjectionable to escape the knife.

Republicans are also looking to phase out tax credits for wind and solar development, as well as homeowner credits for things like energy audits and heat pumps. They want to claw back billions of dollars from the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund, a kind of green bank meant to fund local projects promoting conservation and clean energy use. And while they plan to largely preserve a popular advanced manufacturing tax credit the IRA created, they want to phase it out for wind power projects.

No project is too small or unobjectionable to escape the knife; as E&E News summarized, the bills “would repeal a variety of IRA programs designed to reduce air pollution at schools and ports, reduce emissions from diesel engines and construction materials, and promote carbon monitoring initiatives.” In addition, the Ways and Means Committee bill seeks to promote fossil fuels through measures such as expediting permits for liquid natural gas export facilities.

Climate advocates had hoped that since so much of the government’s climate spending benefits Republican districts, from battery production to rural energy conservation, that spending might be spared the cuts the party is eager to make to fund its tax cut for the wealthy (which, we should keep in mind, is the primary justification for all this slashing and burning). That might happen here and there — this process still has far to go, and there may be cases where a member of Congress manages to preserve a program that benefits their district.

But the big picture on climate is grim. Unlike the Republican effort to slash Medicaid spending and kick millions of people off their health coverage, which has divided the party and generated growing controversy, climate policy attracts far less notice. The climate measures put in place under the Biden administration — as well as those that date back much further — comprise a disparate collection of initiatives spread across multiple departments, rather than one big program that millions of people understand they have an interest in preserving.

Under Joe Biden, the U.S. took great strides forward in the fight against climate change. He can legitimately claim to have accomplished more on climate change than any president before him. Republicans can’t undo all of it; some funds have been spent, and some programs are so beneficial to GOP constituencies that they’ll probably be left alone.

But the setback to our efforts to stop the warming of the planet will be severe. Unfortunately, many of these cuts will go unnoticed by most of the public, which means there will be little political cost for those who would undermine efforts to secure a stable future. And we’ll have to try all over again to use government’s power to address climate change — only we’ll be starting from even further back.","https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-02/250219-donald-trump-mike-johnson-vl-1027a-a5d0b1.jpg",N,,2025-05-13 22:06:03.392396

IRA job creation is at stake

Since the IRA’s passage in 2022, the ICCT writes that automakers and battery manufacturers have committed around $125 billion to US-based projects, creating hundreds of thousands of American jobs. (The BlueGreen Alliance’s EV Jobs Hub puts announced EV investment even higher, at $212.5 billion.)

The ICCT’s new study, “How the Inflation Reduction Act is driving US job growth across the electric vehicle industry,” projects that the IRA would drive a net creation of more than 118,000 new direct jobs across the US EV, battery, and charging industries from 2026 to 2030.

However, if key provisions of the IRA are rolled back, up to 130,000 direct manufacturing jobs would be lost by 2030. An IRA repeal would cause direct job losses of about 30,600 in vehicle production, 85,000 in battery manufacturing, and 14,200 in charging infrastructure.

Moreover, another 310,000 indirectly connected jobs could vanish by 2030. Stephanie Searle, chief program officer at ICCT, said, “These job losses would cascade throughout the economy, affecting not just autoworkers but also employees in mineral processing, retail, hospitality, and others dependent on a strong manufacturing base.”

According to ICCT’s analysis, states that have become hubs for EV and battery production – like Michigan, Texas, and Tennessee – face the most significant losses. Michigan alone can lose nearly 16,000 jobs, with Texas and Tennessee potentially shedding around 13,000 jobs. The ripple effects would extend beyond factories, impacting retail, hospitality, and mineral processing businesses.

This alarming outlook comes as US policymakers plan to impose a new 25% tariff on imported vehicles to bring manufacturing jobs back home. However, ICCT’s study demonstrates that Joe Biden’s signature policy has already achieved a domestic manufacturing boom and job creation.

“Most of the job losses associated with IRA repeal are in the Midwest and southern states, where significant EV and battery investments have been announced,” noted Peter Slowik, co-author of the report. “The 15 states where we project the greatest number of jobs at risk are Michigan, Texas, Tennessee, Nevada, California, Kentucky, Georgia, Ohio, Indiana, North Carolina, South Carolina, Illinois, Arizona, New York, and Alabama.”

Electrek’s Take

The current administration claims to want to create domestic manufacturing and jobs. It just wants to do it with the stick (tariffs) instead of the carrot (IRA tax credits). The thing is, the carrot is already working. Investors have already said they will pull out without incentives. The stick is going to beat the EV and battery industry to death, and some states are going to suffer a lot more than others. The irony is, some of those states are the biggest supporters of the Trump administration’s policies.

Homeowners in the area could then be eligible for up to $15,000 in energy-efficient upgrades.

One such homeowner, Haley Henley, told CBS her home had major electrical problems that would cost thousands of dollars to repair. But thanks to the Neighborhood Solar Initiative, she was able to replace fuses throughout her house and get a new furnace and water heater.

""I was in tears, I was so happy,"" Henley said. ""I'm just grateful. I'm thankful for everything that they did.""

The U.S. Chamber of Commerce supports the Congressional Review Act resolutions of disapproval aimed at overturning the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s federal preemption waivers that led California to set unattainable standards and ban gasoline and diesel cars and trucks. These resolutions would disapprove the EPA waivers for the following regulations adopted by California: (1) Advanced Clean Cars II (ACC II), S.J. Res. 45 (2) the “Omnibus” Low NOx, S.J. Res 47, and (3) Advanced Clean Trucks, S.J. Res 46. In light of the broad impact of these preemption waivers on consumers and the nationwide vehicle marketplace, among other considerations, EPA has appropriately designated them to be rules subject to Congressional Review Act scrutiny. Disapproval of the rules is essential to ensuring a unified national vehicle marketplace that promotes continued progress on fuel economy while safeguarding economic growth and consumer interests.

The ban on sales of internal combustion engine-powered cars and trucks, central to ACC II and ACT, poses significant challenges. Adding on top the Omnibus rule, combined they would severely restrict consumer choice and impose substantial costs on businesses, not only in California but also in other states that have adopted California’s regulatory programs. By mandating adoption of technologies not yet commercially viable at scale, and on a recklessly accelerated timeline, these rules risk significant increases to transportation costs and could hinder the movement of people and goods nationwide. Additionally, factors such as insufficient vehicle charging infrastructure, which are beyond the control of manufacturers, further deter market adoption of electric vehicles and exacerbate compliance challenges. Allowing California to set de facto national standards creates a fragmented regulatory landscape, complicating supply chains and compliance for businesses operating across state lines. This patchwork approach undermines the efficiency and predictability needed for thriving interstate commerce.

We urge Congress to act swiftly in passing these resolutions of disapproval to prevent the detrimental effects of such costly and impractical regulations. The Chamber is committed to collaborating with policymakers to ensure that federal regulations are fair, pragmatic, effective, and conducive to economic growth.

The Inflation Reduction Act, passed by a straight party-line Democrat vote and signed by President Biden three years ago, has undoubtedly incentivized several hundreds of billions of dollars in new and pending clean energy and microgrid investments.

These energized many renewable project supporters but left skeptics wondering if the juice is worth the squeeze.

The future inevitability of IRA lighting the path toward a more decarbonized and decentralized power sector is certainly in doubt, now, as the Republican-led U.S. House of Representatives is crafting a new budget bill to weaken and even kill some aspects of the IRA bundle of tax credits and subsidies for renewable energy, efficiency and distributed power.

The proposed new House funding bill would phase out tax credits and funding for decarbonized energy projects such as electric vehicles and reallocate billions in funding from IRA-supported programs to other, more GOP-favored programs.

An analysis of IRA funding for microgrids, done by project developer and operations firm PowerSecure several years ago, estimated that the tax credits could help cut microgrid upfront costs by 10 to 50%. The Investment Tax Credit (ITC) for microgrid controllers was expanded by 30% under the IRA, according to the report by PowerSecure.

According to multiple news reports, one of the proposed changes to energy funding contained in the new bill include capping the Investment Tax Credit at 6% (compared with current potential increases to 30%). The ITC and the Production Tax Credit, which predated the IRA but were expanded by it, both would be completely phased out by 2032 and 2031, respectively.

The GOP movement, encouraged by President Trump, could curtail years of momentum-creating record installation of solar and battery storage capacity.

Some clean energy groups have urged caution at making sudden changes in policy.

""With energy demand surging, this is not the time for disruption,” Jason Grumet, CEO of advocacy group American Clean Power Association (ACP) said in a statement. “It is possible to phase out incentives for clean energy investment, production, and manufacturing without harming American consumers or businesses — and we stand ready to help. As the legislation moves through the process, we will work with lawmakers to ensure that the final product achieves necessary cost savings while maintaining investment certainty, energy reliability, economic growth, and global competitiveness.”

Some of the transfer provisions with the IRA could be sunset potentially as early as next year, if the House bill is signed into law. Peter DeFazio, managing partner at investor Greenprint Capital, called the GOP bill a “clear shot” at the IRA’s clean energy framework

“For developers, tax equity investors, and manufacturers: this could mean reduced liquidity, less certainty, and higher financing costs—just as IRA-backed project pipelines were gaining traction,” DeFazio wrote in a LinkedIn post outlining some of the House GOP’s more dramatic reversals of IRA funding mechanisms. “Whether this bill passes or not, it sets the stage for a fierce 2025 tax policy fight—and a potential rollback of the most ambitious U.S. climate incentives to date.”

In August 2024, the Biden Administration was still in power and touting its perceived infrastructure-building benefits of the IRA. The bill barely passed the Senate by a 51-50 vote—with then Vice President Kamala Harris casting the tie-breaker—but the Biden White House calculated that the resulting law delivered tax credits that helped more than 250,000 Americans acquire electric vehicles and that led to commercial and industrial clean energy projects totaling $900 billion in reported investments.

The Trump White House, however, has criticized the IRA for relying on intermittent energy resources when the looming industrial load requires baseload power such as natural gas and nuclear generation. Trump went as far as declaring a national energy emergency and temporarily freezing components of the IRA funding for renewable projects.

Either way, the legislative battle promises to be a ""fierce policy fight"" on both ends, as DeFazio predicted on his LinkedIn post.","https://img.microgridknowledge.com/files/base/ebm/microgridknowledge/image/2025/05/6823b47e208ba077ada5547c-capitol_dreamstime.png?auto=format,compress&fit=fill&fill=blur&w=1200&h=630",N,,2025-05-13 22:06:11.397076

Chris Carnevale

Yesterday, the Ways and Means Committee of the U.S. House of Representatives introduced the first draft of its section of the GOP’s “one big bill,” and it takes a chainsaw to tax credits for clean energy and transportation. In this draft, nearly all of the federal clean energy credits are taken away from Americans, the result of which would be higher energy costs we all would be forced to pay, and fewer options for taxpayers to reduce their tax bills.

Here is a brief summary of how the draft policy would harm Americans through repealing key tax credits:

Tax credits for electric vehicles (personal and commercial) would mostly be taken away after this year, depriving Americans of 7 years of availability, generally, and hundreds of billions of dollars of credits and reduced transportation costs

Tax credits for residential energy efficiency, solar, and batteries would be taken away after this year, depriving American households of 7-9 years of availability and more than 100 billion dollars

The availability of commercial tax credits for businesses, governments, schools, nonprofit organizations and more to install or produce clean electricity would be cut very short, with most future clean energy projects ineligible for the full credits

Tax credits for businesses to manufacture wind energy components get taken away 5 years early

Tax credits for businesses, governments, schools, nonprofit organizations and more to install geothermal heat pump credits would get 3 years of availability taken away

A provision known as transferability of commercial tax credits would be taken away on various timelines, depending on the specific credit, so the credits will be worth less and harder to monetize

This draft proposal harms American households and is also anti-business. Here are a few reasons why Congress must rethink this reckless approach to energy policy:

1) Clean Energy Tax Credits Lower Energy Costs For Everyone

Clean energy tax credits lower energy costs for all Americans, not just those directly filing for the tax credits. Recent research by multiple independent expert firms has found that repealing the clean electricity tax credits would raise energy costs for consumers and worsen inflation. Repealing two of the biggest tax credits is estimated to raise household energy bills by around $6 billion annually in the next five years and $25 billion annually by 2040. Put another way, annual household utility bills would increase by more than $110 on average, and businesses would see at least a 10% increase in energy costs, which would be passed on to consumers. One of these studies found that North Carolinians, South Carolinians, and Tennesseans would be particularly hard hit by higher electricity prices, facing 10-15% higher prices for residential customers in 2026 and 2029 without the major clean energy tax credits. Without these tax credits, commercial and industrial customers in these states would be paying 15-22% higher electricity prices in 2026 and 2029.

2) Clean Energy Tax Credits Are Incredibly Effective At Reshoring Manufacturing and Spurring The Economy and Job Growth Nationally and Especially in the Southeast

The current energy tax credit law is spurring the largest expansion of factory construction in American history. Companies have announced and advanced 751 new projects, $422 billion in investments, and 406,007 new jobs in the clean energy and clean vehicle industries across the nation since August 2022, when many of the clean energy tax credits were either extended or initially created.

Looking specifically at our region of the Southeast, in North Carolina, Tennessee, South Carolina, Georgia, and Florida, we have benefited with announcements totaling more than $73 billion in private investment into the clean energy industry supply chain, and more than 92,000 new clean energy jobs.

Repealing or compromising the clean energy and clean vehicle tax credits would jeopardize or reverse this growth. For example, expert research has found that eliminating the clean vehicle tax credits would put as much as 100% of planned construction and expansion of U.S. electric vehicle assembly and half of existing assembly capacity at risk of cancellation or closure, and could put 29-72% of battery cell manufacturing capacity currently operating or online by the end of 2025 at risk of closure, in addition to 100% of other planned facilities.

3) Clean Energy Resources Are Best Positioned to Meet Near-Term Energy Demands for Economic Growth

Power demand is surging with economic growth, seen most dramatically in domestic manufacturing and the computing needs for AI. Solar and battery projects are already in grid interconnection queues and can be built to supply these needs much faster than any other sources of new generation. Large solar and battery projects can typically be online less than 18 months after contracts are signed and permits approved, whereas gas power plants typically take multiple years and nuclear plants take over a decade.

You don’t need to take our word for it…the trade group for investor-owned utilities, Edison Electric Institute, says “In the event of a significant reduction in these tax credits, it is estimated that nearly 75 gigawatts of planned new generation capacity will be cancelled between 2025 and 2032. While some of the planned renewable generation will shift to natural gas, it is not enough to meet the anticipated energy demand during this time frame.”

Republicans in Congress Must Fix This Mess

If the goal of this bill is to lower costs for working families and grow American businesses, this draft bill not only fails miserably, but completely backfires. This bill is widely expected to be a party-line bill, meaning if it’s Republicans who pass it, then it’s Republicans who will bear the blame of these dramatic cost increases on Americans and business-stifling policies. It’s also Republicans who can fix it, starting today. Indeed, quite a number of Republican members of Congress have put themselves on the record in support of continuing the tax credits and keeping the positive impacts the credits bring about (i.e. here, here, and here).

Today is the bill’s first hearing in the Ways and Means Committee. It is expected that the bill will be taken up on the House floor next week, and then will be taken up by the Senate next month. Each of these steps gives opportunities for legislators to fix this mess and preserve the good energy policy that is demonstrably working in favor of Americans.

Repealing tax credits effectively acts as a energy tax increase.","The House Ways and Means Committee issued its proposed language for inclusion in Congress’s massive budget reconciliation package. It’s the opening attempt to reduce spending in order to partially cover the cost of nearly $5 trillion in proposed extensions and expansions of the tax cuts initially passed in 2017. While we are still analyzing the package, our preliminary analysis shows that the impact of the proposal is likely to be similar to the impact of a full repeal of the energy tax credits initially extended and expanded in 2022. This will raise energy costs for American households by as much as 7% in 2035, stifle energy technology innovation, increase pollution, and could put a meaningful portion of half a trillion dollars of new manufacturing, industrial, and clean electricity investments across the country at risk.

The opening salvo in the budget reconciliation debate

After the House and Senate agreed to a budget framework last month, work commenced on sorting out how exactly to meet the budget targets established in that bill. House Ways and Means released its contribution, which per the resolution cannot add more than $4.5 trillion to the deficit over the next ten years. The Joint Committee on Taxation, the scorekeepers of the federal fiscal impacts of policy, reckons the Committee’s efforts to extend components of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and add new tax cuts, including modified tax rates, no tax on tips or Social Security benefits, changes to deductions and the alternative minimum tax exemption, as well as extending and increasing the state and local tax deduction cap, would increase the deficit by $5.6 trillion. This means Ways and Means needs to find at least $1.1 trillion in savings to meet the budget target. As a result, the Committee has, among other things, chosen to cut most energy-related tax credits way back to make up the difference.

Last year, House Speaker Mike Johnson argued that his members should use “a scalpel and not a sledgehammer” to make changes to energy-related tax credits. In recent months, he’s walked that back to “somewhere between a scalpel and a sledgehammer.” In fact, as a starting point, Ways and Means committee chair Jason Smith (R-MO) and other bill drafters have come down firmly on the sledgehammer end of the spectrum, targeting cuts to a host of provisions, including many that have attracted Republican support in recent weeks and months and historically have enjoyed bipartisan backing.

Major changes in the Ways and Means proposal that will affect energy include:

Termination of a number of tax credits at the end of 2025, including credits for clean vehicles (with a limited exception for some vehicles in 2026), commercial clean vehicles, previously owned clean vehicles, alternative fuel refueling properties, energy efficiency and clean energy improvements for homes, and clean hydrogen

Statutory phase-out of the clean electricity production and investment tax credits beginning in 2029 through 2031 on a placed-in-service basis—a shift from the current commence construction deadlines. De facto sunsetting of the credits as early as 2026 (one year after passage of the bill) with imposition of highly restrictive and administratively complex (and potentially unworkable) limits on sourcing of components, subcomponents, and critical materials used at a facility, or 2027 with the phase-out of the ability for clean energy developers to transfer or sell the tax credits they generate to other entities.

Sunset of the advanced manufacturing production credit after 2031, except for wind components, which sunset after 2027; application of similarly strict sourcing requirements aligned with those proposed for the clean electricity credits; and removal of transferability

Repeal of transferability, which reduces options for monetizing the credits, and implementation of foreign sourcing limits for a host of other credits

Phase-out of the zero-emitting nuclear credit beginning in 2029 through 2031; extension of clean fuels credit through 2031 with changes to what fuels could potentially qualify

Beyond the specific policy changes, the proposal will also require a hollowed-out federal bureaucracy to propose and finalize extremely complicated and unprecedented implementation rules before investors and developers will have the certainty they need to make investment decisions. It took the first Trump administration nearly three years to finalize regulations for implementing the 45Q tax credits for carbon capture, rules which pale in comparison to the complexity of what will be required to implement key portions of the Ways and Means proposal.

Impacts of the provisions

Since Ways and Means just released a draft of the bill yesterday, we have yet to fully model the proposal in its current form. In December, we modeled a potential legislative pathway that fully repealed all major energy components of the Inflation Reduction Act beginning on January 1, 2025. For some credits like clean vehicles and residential clean energy, the Ways and Means proposal offers just one more year of credits compared to our repeal scenario. For the technology-neutral clean electricity tax credits, the Ways and Means proposal’s harshest restrictions on material from foreign entities of concern (FEOC) are likely to begin in 2026—so two more years of credit would be available compared to our repeal scenario. Because of the high degree of consistency with the Ways and Means proposal and our previous modeling, our prior work provides useful insights into the expected direction and magnitude of impact of these policy changes. As discussed above, the administrative complexity of implementing these rules also likely puts significant downward pressure on near-term investments, further aligning our previous modeling with this proposal. We plan to refine our modeling after the Ways and Means mark-up to reflect where the committee lands.

We compare modeling outcomes with and without these changes to quantify the impact of the proposal—in both cases holding constant a “rollback” regulatory environment as a baseline where all major Biden-era environmental regulations are removed. The Trump administration and Congress have taken numerous actions to follow through on these rollbacks, the latest of which is the House Energy and Commerce reconciliation bill attempt to repeal EPA tailpipe regulations for light, medium and heavy duty vehicles. Such legislative moves are unprecedented and likely to face scrutiny from the Senate parliamentarian, though Senate Republicans could make another unprecedented move and opt to ignore her ruling.

Whatever comes of these congressional machinations, we expect the rules we identified in our December rollback scenario to be removed from current law in the near future, so we consider the impacts of efforts to change tax policy compared to a baseline where the regulations are rolled back. We report a “baseline” policy case reflecting regulatory changes made by the Trump administration and Congress and then a “repeal” policy case that estimates the incremental impact of revision and removal of energy-related provisions of the IRA beginning in 2025.

As we detail in our December note, rolling back regulations alone will meaningfully impact the energy system, increasing energy bills for consumers and businesses, reducing clean energy deployment, and increasing greenhouse gas emissions. In this note, we focus only on the impacts of changes akin to those proposed by Ways and Means legislation. As part of budget reconciliation, several committees have proposed policy changes that will impact the energy system, including the House Energy and Commerce’s proposed recission of funding for a number of grant programs established as part of the Inflation Reduction Act, new fees on EVs proposed by the Transportation and Infrastructure committee, and the Natural Resource committee’s proposed changes to energy production public lands. We will assess the aggregate impact of the entire reconciliation bill as the complete legislation takes shape.

As in the past, to understand the range of potential impacts, we use the same three main emissions scenarios reported in Taking Stock 2024: a low-emissions scenario that pairs cheap clean energy technologies with more expensive future fossil fuel prices and slightly slower GDP growth; a high-emissions scenario that pairs more expensive clean technologies with cheap fossil fuels and as-anticipated GDP growth; and a mid-emissions scenario that cuts the difference between the two. To model these policy pathways and emissions scenarios, we use RHG-NEMS, our version of the National Energy Modeling System developed by the US Energy Information Administration.

Energy prices and costs rise for households and businesses

An often-stated goal of these changes is to bring costs down for American households. We find that repealing the energy tax credits has the opposite effect, increasing household energy costs by $95-290 in 2035—a 2-7% increase in costs that year (Figure 1). Repealing tax credits effectively acts as a energy tax increase. Higher spending on mobility energy, including motor gasoline, diesel, and electricity for charging electric vehicles, make up 41-68% of that increase. There are a couple of reasons for this. First, with fewer electric vehicles on the road (discussed further below), consumers will buy more liquid fuels, especially motor gasoline. Relatedly, this increase in demand for gasoline drives up prices at the pump by 1-5% (Figure 2), increasing costs for all drivers. Domestic crude oil production increases very modestly (less than 1%), while crude oil imports increase more meaningfully (5-11%). Electricity bills make up 25-50% of the increase, with households paying $46-72 more each year to power their homes.

Increasing demand for natural gas, particularly driven by more gas demand for power generation, increases wholesale natural gas prices by 2-7% in 2035, despite 6-8% higher gas production (Figure 2). That leads to higher retail prices for all consumers across the economy.

Despite the administration’s stated desire to bolster domestic manufacturing, we find that repealing tax credits places extra burden on industrial producers through higher fuel costs. These higher costs drive up industrial expenditures by $9-11 billion in 2035 (Figure 3). Electricity bills comprise 56-73% of this increase—a consequence of industrial electricity rates rising by 7-12% in 2035. Natural gas expenditures increase by $2 billion on average due to higher wholesale prices. At a time when trade policy turbulence is driving uncertainty around inflation, consumer confidence and the continued economic growth increasing energy costs could add to the turbulence.

Stalled progress on clean energy deployment

An outright repeal of the energy tax credits similar to the Ways and Means proposal reduces the amount of new clean capacity installed on the grid from 2025 through 2035 by 57-72% (Figure 4). The lion’s share of the decline in capacity comes from lower growth of renewables and storage, and there is no meaningful uptick in non-renewable clean capacity. A part of this decline is made up for by modestly less coal capacity retiring by 2035, though the coal fleet still shrinks by at least half from today’s levels, and no new coal plants are built. Gas capacity expands by as much as 9% in 2035, and both new and existing gas plants run more, compared to the baseline.

Our previous modeling is best suited to estimate the impact of policy change on commercially available technologies, but there are important impacts beyond commercial technologies as well. The near full repeal of energy tax credits in the Ways and Means language have an outsized effect on innovative emerging clean technologies like enhanced geothermal, advanced nuclear, long duration storage, and fusion. Developers of these technologies are counting on the long-term availability of the tax credits in current law to support initial projects that are unlikely to be placed in service before 2028. The FEOC constraints on clean electric credits and manufacturing tax credits will make it harder to develop and scale supply chains to accelerate technology deployment and drive down costs. The Ways and Means proposal will stifle innovation at a time when the US needs all the power it can get to meet surging electric demand.

In our baseline, electric vehicle sales already slow meaningfully from removal of EPA tailpipe regulations and the revocation of waivers that prevent California from pursuing more stringent standards. Repealing the clean vehicle tax credits reduces EV sales by another 16-38% in 2035 compared to baseline (Figure 5).

Manufacturing growth threatened

Taking a major step back on domestic deployment of clean energy technologies will likely impact the future of announced manufacturing facilities that produce these technologies. As reported in the Clean Investment Monitor’s Q1 2025 update, six manufacturing facilities totaling nearly $7 billion in investments were cancelled last quarter. In The State of US Clean Energy Supply Chains in 2025 released last month, the Clean Investment Monitor found that domestic manufacturing of key clean technology components including solar modules, battery modules and cells, and zero-emitting vehicles are scaling up above current levels of demand for these technologies and toward deployment levels we see in our modeling of current policy through 2035.

Between investments in these manufacturing facilities as well as investment dollars flowing from installing clean electricity and industrial facilities, $321 billion was invested from mid-2022 through the first quarter of 2025—but a total of $522 billion in investment remained outstanding as of Q1. Steep reductions in clean energy technology deployment plus the proposed material sourcing constraints on clean manufacturing tax credit eligibility could put a meaningful amount of that $522 billion in outstanding investment at risk.

Meaningfully higher greenhouse gas emissions levels

The net result of proposed tax policy changes on the energy system leads to a meaningful reduction in the pace of decarbonization. Repealing the energy tax credits increases emissions by 500-730 million metric tons in 2035 relative to the baseline and more than a gigaton compared to Taking Stock 2024. In the high emissions scenario, repeal leads to emissions that are only 23% lower than 2005 levels in 2035 (Figure 6), or just 4 percentage points lower than annual emissions in 2024—effectively no progress on decarbonization. In the low emissions scenario, emissions are 39% lower than 2005 levels.

What’s next?

The House Ways and Means Committee is considering this proposal today. Whatever moves out of that committee is one step closer to the House floor and a vote of the full House, and we’ll be tracking the bill as it evolves throughout the process. The latest Joint Committee on Taxation revenue effects estimate of the full suite of policy changes in the current Ways and Means proposal is still nearly $800 billion below its spending target, so there’s certainly room for the proposal to evolve in response to ongoing member conversations.

Meanwhile, the Senate Finance Committee (the equivalent tax-writing committee on the Senate side) has a meaningfully different deficit reduction target to achieve and a different set of stakeholders’ interests to balance. How the two chambers will get to passage individually and then in agreement with each other remains a very open question.

A front-wheel-drive version of the bZ is now available with a 167-kW electric motor, boosting power figures to 221 hp.
Toyota is taking advantage of this facelift to add North American Charging System ports to all of its 2026 model year bZs, too.
Screen size has also increased for 2026, with Toyota adding a 14-inch screen as standard fare to all bZs.","Toyota's only true EV, the bZ4x, is getting a makeover for 2026, and a major part of that overhaul is a name change. Well-intentioned Toyota drivers will no longer have to explain that their car is not named after the lovechild of Elon Musk and Grimes.

Instead, Toyota announced Tuesday it has opted for the classy option by dropping the ""4x"" portion of the name and simply calling it the Toyota bZ. The automaker's capitalization style is still in question, but we think that bZ is a much better name for what is a quite subtle car. Even so, Toyota hopes that some of the other material changes to its Subaru-shared EV will prompt a stronger consumer response.

Namely, the addition of a second battery size for a total of six different range options marks the most significant upgrade for the bZ. Toyota previously offered all bZ4x models with 63.4-kWh or 65.6-kWh battery packs, but now buyers can choose between an upgraded 74.7-kWh battery pack or a smaller 57.7-kWh powerplant. Opting for the smaller battery will give the XLE FWD trim of the bZ a low-end total range of 236 miles, while the highest total range of 314 miles is available on the XLE FWD trim equipped with the larger battery pack.

This increase in range is joined by a boost in power, too. A front-wheel-drive version of the bZ is now available with a 167-kW electric motor, boosting power figures to 221 hp. All-wheel-drive bZs also get a power bump up to 338 hp thanks to the same 167 kW e-motor up front and an 87 kW e-motor in the rear. That's an increase of over 120 hp for AWD versions and 21 hp for FWD variants. The quickest bZ will now sprint from 0-60 mph in 4.9 seconds, placing it in much closer contention to competitors like the Hyundai Ioniq 5 or Volkswagen ID.4.

Toyota is taking advantage of this facelift to add North American Charging System ports to all of its 2026 model year bZs, too. This upgrade, paired with a new battery preconditioning system on all models, should alleviate some of the criticism of the bZ4x, namely that it was behind the charging times before it was even released. A heat pump system for both air conditioning and cabin heating has been added as well, reducing strain on the driving range from internal climate controls, while Toyota has generously made front seat and steering wheel heaters standard.

The driving experience has been modernized, too. New paddles on the steering wheel control the level of regenerative braking, while a system called Grip Control uses motor drive power modulation to help the AWD versions move smoothly through loose surfaces. Essentially, the traction system will distribute e-motor power according to levels of perceived grip and road surface characteristics.

Screen size has also increased for 2026, with Toyota adding a 14-inch screen as standard fare to all bZs. Charging devices should be easier, too, with two wireless charging pads and two USB-C ports at your disposal. Limited trim models benefit from an 8-way power seat, driver's seat memory function, and a digital rear-view mirror.","https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/toyota-2026-bz-0002-2-682259c46cdfd.jpg?crop=0.744xw:0.501xh;0.109xw,0.246xh&resize=1200:*",N,,2025-05-13 22:06:22.734145

But similar to crude, China has halted imports of U.S. LNG with Kpler showing no cargoes since February.
This was about 2.5% of China’s total seaborne coal imports, although the U.S. share of metallurgical imports was higher at about 13% of the total.
Of course, the COVID-19 pandemic ended any chance that China would increase its energy imports from the United States.
But the lesson is any future deal between Trump and Beijing that promises a massive increase in China’s imports of U.S. energy should be treated with a significant degree of scepticism.","The truce between the world’s two largest economies will see the United States lower its tariffs on imports from China to 30%, while Beijing cuts its levies on U.S. goods to 10% for a 90-day period.

The deal, negotiated after two days of talks in Geneva between the two sides last week, does pull the trade relationship back from the cliff it was headed towards.

But it does little to provide certainty beyond the 90-day period and it does even less to encourage China to resume buying U.S. energy commodities.

The most likely outcome is that U.S. importers of China’s manufactured goods rush to buy as much as they can under the lower 30% tariff in the next 90 days in a bid to restock.

What is unlikely to happen is that China will resume buying U.S. crude oil, liquefied natural gas (LNG) and coal.

Imports of the energy commodities have ground to a halt since U.S. President Donald Trump launched his trade war across the globe, but with a particular focus on China, which was hit with tariffs of 145% until the pause announced on Monday.

China’s retaliation saw it impose tariffs on U.S. goods of 125% and impose restrictions on exports of some rare earth minerals.

But while tariffs of 125% killed China’s imports of U.S. energy, they were effectively gone as soon as Beijing put an initial 10% tariff on crude oil and 15% on LNG and coal in early February, its first response to Trump’s initial tariff moves.

This means that U.S. crude, LNG and coal will remain uncompetitive in China even at the lower 10% tariff for the next 90 days.

No U.S. crude is scheduled to arrive at Chinese port in May, according to commodity analysts Kpler, while only three cargoes unloaded in April.

China imported about 242,000 barrels per day from the United States in 2024, down from about 400,000 bpd in 2023, which was the strongest year on record.

The U.S. share of China’s seaborne crude imports in 2024 was about 2.4%, meaning that the world’s largest oil importer was able to source cargoes from alternative suppliers with relative ease.

LNG, COAL

China was slightly more reliant on U.S. LNG in 2024, with imports of 4.31 million metric tons representing about 5.5% of total arrivals.

But similar to crude, China has halted imports of U.S. LNG with Kpler showing no cargoes since February.

China’s imports of U.S. coal have also dropped sharply, with Kpler showing only one cargo of metallurgical coal due to arrive in May, although this may be diverted to another country before it arrives.

China bought 10.78 million tons of U.S. coal in 2024, of which about 75% was metallurgical, which is the higher quality fuel used primarily to make steel.

This was about 2.5% of China’s total seaborne coal imports, although the U.S. share of metallurgical imports was higher at about 13% of the total.

However, China is likely able to replace U.S. metallurgical coal with cargoes from the world’s biggest exporter Australia, although it may come at a slightly higher cost as steel mills will have to draw some Australian coal away from other buyers such as India and Japan.

While the tariff de-escalation won’t be enough to restart China’s imports of U.S. energy commodities, it’s likely that they will once again be a major negotiating point in the talks expected in the next 90 days.

It’s likely that any deal between China and the Trump administration will include a commitment by Beijing to import more U.S. crude, LNG and coal.

But it’s worth noting that the agreement reached by Trump and China during his first term was massively unsuccessful insofar as China came nowhere close to buying the value of U.S. energy commodities it had said it would.

In terms of the so-called Phase 1 deal agreed in January 2020, China agreed to buy energy over and above a $9.1 billion baseline of U.S. imports in 2017, with a split of an extra $18.5 billion in 2020 and $33.9 billion in 2021, as well as some $36.5 billion in agricultural commodities annually.

Using the crude oil prices that prevailed at that time, at the peak of China’s imports of U.S. crude the shortfall was still about 50% of what would have been required, and even more for LNG and coal.

Of course, the COVID-19 pandemic ended any chance that China would increase its energy imports from the United States.

But the lesson is any future deal between Trump and Beijing that promises a massive increase in China’s imports of U.S. energy should be treated with a significant degree of scepticism.

It's still a long night ahead. Republicans are working to push President Donald Trump's signature legislative package through a gauntlet of committees over mounting opposition from Democrats, advocacy groups and even some wary Republicans themselves.

Right from the start, one meeting was immediately disrupted by protesters shouting down what the panel's top Democrat called “cruel” cuts to Medicaid.

“People feel very strong because they know they’re losing their health care,” said Rep. Frank Pallone, D-N.J., on the Energy & Commerce Committee. He asked for the police to refrain from making arrests, noting that some of the people protesting were disabled.

And on it went for hours.

It’s the biggest political and legislative debate for the Republicans leading Congress since Trump’s first term, setting up a career-defining clash over the nation’s priorities, all coming at a time of economic unease with Trump's trade war and other uncertainties.

Trump, speaking at a forum in the Middle East, struck an ambitious chord, saying Congress was “on the verge of passing the largest tax cut and regulation cut in American history.""

""If we get that, that will be like a rocket ship for our country,” Trump said in Saudi Arabia.

But to be sure, there are many more steps before the package becomes law.

At its core, the goal for GOP lawmakers is to extend — and enhance — tax cuts approved in 2017, adding the president’s campaign promises for no taxes on tips, Social Security income and car loan interest.

There's also larger standard deduction, $32,000 for couples, a boost to the Child Tax Credit and a potentially higher cap of $30,000 on state and local tax deductions, known as SALT, among others.

That’s offset by $1.9 trillion in savings largely from the rollback of green energy tax credits, for a net tally of $3.7 trillion in costs over the decade, according to the most recent estimates — along with billions more in savings from the safety net cuts

Additionally, the Republicans are boosting spending on their GOP priorities, with $350 billion for Trump’s mass deportation plans and funding for the Pentagon.

At the same time, the Republicans are seeking to defray the lost tax revenue and avoid skyrocketing national deficits by with another GOP goal, which is scaling back federal spending.

The Republicans are proposing cuts of nearly $800 billion over the decade to the Medicaid health care program, which is used by 70 million Americans; $290 billion to food aid in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, known as SNAP; and others.

Tucked into the package is a smattering of other provisions important to the White House — including one that would allow the Trump administration to yank the tax exempt status of groups it says support terrorists, sending a chill through civil society organizations who warn it's a way to punish opponents.

House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries accused Republicans of “jamming another GOP tax scam” that benefits the wealthy at the expense of programs and services used by many Americans.

Speaker Mike Johnson is determined to push the package through the House by Memorial Day, sending it to the Senate, where Republicans are working on their own version and approach.

Johnson and his leadership team have been conferring constantly with Trump at every step.

Rep. Jason Smith, the Republican chairman of the Ways & Means tax writing committee said he met with Trump on Friday and went over the tax provisions “line by line.”

“He was very happy with what we’re delivering,” Smith said.

On Tuesday, the final three of 11 House committees working on the package drilled down on some of the largest components.

Tempers flared in the hearing rooms. At one point, Rep. Brett Guthrie, the Republican chairman of the Energy & Commerce Committee, banned lawmakers from accusing colleagues of “lying.”

Democrats up posters of constituents with the words “Medicaid Matters.” One, Rep. Marc Veasey of Texas, put one on speaker phone to share her story — until her testimony was ruled out of order.

Estimates from the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office show that at least 7.6 million people could lose health insurance with the Medicaid cuts, and potentially more with the changes to the Affordable Care Act. Mostly, the health care changes involve imposing new work requirements for aid recipients.

But Republican Rep. Gary Palmer of Alabama said his side is trying to make the health care program work better by rooting out waste and inefficiencies.

“We're trying to save Medicaid,” he said.

As the minority party in Congress, Democrats unable to stop the bill, are planning to use the procedural tools available in to slow down the process. The hearings are expected to push into the morning hours.

Republicans have dissent within their own ranks over the health care and green energy cuts, which shows the pressure points ahead.

Smith suggested that some changes could be made to the bill to win over those high-tax state lawmakers from New York and California who believe the proposed SALT cap is inadequate.

“There’s a little bit of wiggle room there to try to deliver additional priorities,"" Smith said.

With the slimmest majority in the House, Johnson has just a few votes to spare, and is running into resistance from his party, including lawmakers in the Senate, which also has thin GOP margins.

The lawmakers are racing for a July 4 deadline to have the whole package sent to Trump’s desk in time to also avoid a dangerous debt default. The Treasury Secretary has said federal tax revenues are running short and Congress needs to raise the spending limit to keep paying the bills.

The package includes a $4 trillion boost to the nation’s now $36 trillion debt limit, enough to fund operations past the 2026 midterm election.

“Start/stop technology: where your car dies at every red light so companies get a climate participation trophy,” Zeldin tweeted Monday in a post that has since racked up more than 8 million views.

“EPA approved it, and everyone hates it, so we’re fixing it.”

The feature kills internal combustion engines at red lights and has been touted by proponents for being able to conserve fuel and cut down on pollution.

Critics have questioned whether the feature can wear down the car’s battery or engine more quickly.

The “off-cycle CO2 reducing” tech has its origins in a federal rule proposed under former President Barack Obama in 2012 — but didn’t take effect until new fuel economy standards to reduce greenhouse gas emissions five years later.

Between 2012 and 2021, the number of vehicles produced with a stop-start feature due to the carbon credits surged from 1% to 45%.

Up to 65% of vehicles had the technology included in new models by 2023.

The smart start tech can improve fuel economy by between 4% and 5%, according to past EPA estimates.

But it hasn’t shown clear reductions in emissions tests, an EPA spokesperson noted.

If finalized, automakers could no longer receive any credits to produce the stop-start tech in new models.

Reps for the largest auto industry trade group, the Alliance for Automotive Innovation, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The move follows Zeldin targeting other tax incentives from a New York climate law and green grants from the Biden administration as part of a renewable energy push.

Zeldin charged that New York Gov. Kathy Hochul unwisely ended “safe extraction” of natural gas, gas hookups on new building construction, and gas stoves — but sought to cut sales of gas-powered vehicles and block the new Constitution Pipeline’s construction.

The Honorable Jason Smith

Chairman, House Committee on Ways and Means

21139 Longworth House Office Building

Washington, DC 20515

Dear Chairman Smith and Members of the Committee,

On behalf of National Taxpayers Union (NTU), the nation’s oldest taxpayer advocacy organization, we write to express our support for the Committee’s budget reconciliation proposal. While we strongly urge additional refinements that would promote more economic growth, simplify the tax code, and improve our nation’s fiscal health, the Committee Print accomplishes many core taxpayer goals and is worthy of support.

The economic benefits of this proposal are clear. This proposal renews a number of key individual and business provisions from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) that help fuel economic growth. For businesses, it renews deductions for interest payments, incentives for U.S. R&D, immediate expensing for capital investments, and makes both the small business deduction and key international provisions permanent. According to the White House Council of Economic Advisers, relative to allowing the tax cuts to expire, the included provisions are projected to raise real wages of American workers by between $2100 and $3300 a year, provide large increases in manufacturing wages, and unleash small business economic growth. The bill’s provisions should help U.S. small businesses add an estimated 1 million jobs every year over the next decade. Immediate expensing of R&D should add $20 billion annually in new investment, while expansions in interest deductibility will boost the American economy by over $100 billion. Overall, the bill should add over $850 billion to U.S. GDP every year over the next decade, compared to the current law baseline.

While growing the American economy, the provisions in the Committee Print will also provide continued tax relief for hard working Americans. It loosens Biden-era tax restrictions on gig workers, makes the increased standard deduction from TCJA permanent, keeps the lower tax rates from TCJA that benefited most Americans, and increases exemption levels from the death tax, which, in combination with the extension of key small business deductions, will ensure stability and job growth in small businesses and farms across the country. The extension of core TCJA provisions will keep over six million jobs from being lost, including over one million manufacturing jobs.

The Committee Print will also end a range of expensive onerous environmental policies that often helped the wealthy at the expense of most other Americans. It ends or phases out in a prudent and harmonious manner a host of green tax credits including those for luxury electric vehicles, rooftop solar and other green home improvements, and green buildings. Alternative energy projects could benefit more from permitting reform, and pro-growth, cost-recovery, and R&D tax provisions extended further ahead than narrowly drafted, complex provisions with an uncertain future. Other costly and distortionary IRA provisions should be considered for the same expedited and harmonized phaseout to prevent attempts to extend them in a future Congress.

While NTU strongly supports most provisions in this “One Big Beautiful Bill,” there are a few measures included that warrant additional consideration or refinement. We strongly urge the cost recovery provisions—full expensing, R&D, and interest deductibility—to be made permanent to maximize economic growth. Additionally, the new deduction for certain structures should be expanded to all structures and made permanent.

We urge removal of the increased tax proposal on private foundations, many of which provide invaluable services and education to communities across the country.

We believe that the revenue dedicated to the “no tax on tips,” “no tax on overtime,” and “no tax on auto loan interest” measures should instead be used to further increase the standard deduction, thus providing across-the-board tax relief to all workers regardless of their line of work. While we are pleased to see a cap on the SALT deduction, we urge the $30,000 figure to be further limited. With that in mind, despite the shortcomings of these few measures, NTU strongly supports this Committee Print.

Extending and building on the pro-growth elements of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act while controlling our mounting debt crisis are the most pressing legislative matters that this Congress will address this year, and we commend the Committee for authoring a set of comprehensive, thoughtful, and serious solutions to tackle these critical issues. More reforms are needed in the nearer and intermediate term to bring federal spending growth under control.

NTU urges Committee members to SUPPORT this pro-taxpayer proposal as part of the larger tax reconciliation package. Thank you for your leadership on this important legislation and please do not hesitate to contact NTU should you have any questions.

Sincerely,

David Timmons

The fact that auto executives are forecasting Chinese EVs hitting the U.S. means we're about to get some serious competition.
So, finally, we come to the big question: are you excited for Chinese EVs to make it to the U.S.?","China has been pumping out some pretty sweet EVs lately. They're cheap, packed with boatloads of tech, and are arguably a pretty amazing value proposition for the money. It's kind of obvious why U.S. automakers are worried about the thought of these cars ever hitting the U.S. market.

Welcome back to Critical Materials, your daily roundup for all things electric and tech in the automotive space. Today, U.S. auto execs foresee Chinese EVs eventually hitting U.S. streets, China's version of cash-for-clunkers tops 10 million trade-ins for NEVs, and Tesla Employees call for CEO Elon Musk's resignation. Let's jump in.

30%: U.S. Automakers Agree: Chinese Cars Will Enter U.S. Market

Photo by: Patrick George

It turns out the suits in Detroit aren't sweating whether or not Chinese EVs will make it to U.S. soil. Despite the attempts to implement protectionist measures (like tariffs) to keep China's biggest automakers at bay, the vast majority have just accepted Chinese cars as an inevitable competitor on their home turf.

The notion comes straight from Kerrigan Advisors' 2025 OEM Survey, a study that polls some of the top talent in automotive executive leadership on industry trends. According to respondents, a whopping 76% of automakers believe that Chinese carmakers will eventually begin selling vehicles in America. And perhaps equally as concerning, at least for legacy automakers, is that 70% say they're concerned about the financial implications it will bring.

Let's be clear, this isn't just some random paranoia that a bully is coming to take your lunch money. Chinese brands like BYD and Geely are already muscling their way into global markets like Europe and Latin America. They're using ruthless tactics like low costs, solid tech, and extremely fast production cycles to quickly penetrate the local market share.

This is just the start of a shifting industry. The survey also suggests that the way automakers sell cars will change.

That doesn't mean legacy automakers will get out of the dealer sales model they're stuck in. Instead, OEMs are looking to shrink their dealer networks to have a few hundred large dealers to do business with, rather than a few thousand smaller ones. In fact, only 14% of respondents said that they anticipated their dealer networks to grow.

Here's a great synopsis of the theory from Automotive News:

Another new question on this year’s survey found a third of automaker executives expect to have fewer dealers in their network in the next five years; just 14 percent expect to have more. And in another new question, 28 percent said they will exercise a right of first refusal—a tool that allows an automaker to refuse a potential store buyer and replace them with a buyer of their choice—more than a quarter of the time in the buy-sell deals they receive.

“It’s certainly consistent with what we have observed in the buy-sell market and in our conversations with OEMs where certain OEMs are vocally saying ‘We want fewer, larger dealers,’” Kerrigan said. “As we see it, the OEMs are retreating from the idea that they will be the direct-to-consumer seller.”

When China's finely-tuned industrial machine finally does land here at home, Detroit will be in for a wake-up call. There's a reason these brands spend so much time doing reverse engineering on cars coming out of Guangdong—China is very good at this whole ""make-a-car"" thing. And if their automakers can do it better than U.S. companies at a fraction of the cost, legacy brands are in trouble.

60%: China's Version Of Cash-For-Clunkers Gets 10 Million Trade-Ins

Back in 2009, the U.S. had this crazy scheme to stimulate the economy while also simultaneously lowering emissions around the country. Cash For Clunkers was a brazen way of offering Americans a boat load of cash on the hood of just about any new car, so as long as the vehicle they traded-in towards it sucked down fuel more quickly. The program bled through its entire funding in just two months. The total number of cars crushed for the program? 677,081.

Last May, China decided to try its own take on that model and basically supersized America's success. According to Car News China, its year-long program had a whopping 10 million crusty combustion cars traded in for shiny, state-of-the-art New Energy Vehicles (NEVs).

Here are the facts from Car News China:

According to recent figures from the Ministry of Commerce, China’s vehicle trade-in scheme has received more than 10 million applications since the policy began in 2024. As of May 11, 2025, 3.225 million applications were submitted this year, including 1.035 million for scrapping older vehicles and 2.19 million for trade-in replacements.

The policy has had a notable impact on vehicle purchasing behaviour. Data from the China Passenger Car Association (CPCA) shows that in April, nearly 70% of private car buyers utilized the trade-in scheme, while first-time buyers accounted for just 31%, suggesting a shift in demand toward vehicle upgrades.

[...]

Two major trends are currently shaping the automotive sector. First, consumer interest in green and smart vehicles is increasing. New energy vehicles (NEVs) accounted for over 53% of all trade-in transactions. NEV sales totalled 3.324 million units from January to April, up 35.7% year-on-year. Market penetration for NEVs reached 48.4%, a 0.8 percentage point increase from 2024.

Second, the recycling activity has expanded significantly. Between January and April this year, 2.767 million scrapped vehicles were processed for recycling, representing a 65% year-on-year increase. This reflects greater attention among consumers to environmental issues and resource reuse.

China's goal was pretty much the same as America's program. It helped reduce vehicle emissions while simultaneously boosting domestic auto production of BEVs and hybrids, something that China is propping up as its automakers prepare for world automotive domination. As the numbers alone can probably tell you, the plan is working.

This is also kind of a big flex against America, which is pretty audibly fighting over whether or not to keep the EV tax credit alive. Stateside automakers have backed off of otherwise ambitious EV goals when consumers weren't biting, while China doubled down to support domestic manufacturing and growth. If auto executives are worried about China's EV dominance, perhaps the success of this program shows that the real fight should be lobbying in Washington to advocate for more effective support.

90%: Tesla Employee Fired After Calling For Elon Musk's Resignation

Photo by: InsideEVs

At Tesla, the concept of being open to feedback seems to stop somewhere between ""there's a safety problem with the Model S"" and ""Elon should resign."" Recently, one employee tested that line when he published an open letter to the CEO calling for his resignation due to the seeping of Musk's personal brand onto that of Tesla's.

Meet Matthew LaBrot. He's a Tesla employee who drives a Cybertruck, owns a Model Y, has Tesla Solar, and believes in the company's mission—albeit without Elon Musk at the helm. LaBrot found himself growing increasingly frustrated with Musk over the past few months (a sentiment similar to many would-be Tesla buyers who chose to avoid the brand due to Musk's political involvement).

The employee went on to publish a website called Tesla Employees Against Elon that called out the CEO's recent behavior as grounds for him to resign and let someone else take over the automaker. That public call-out quickly got him fired.

Here's an excerpt from the site:

The damage done to Elon’s personal brand is now irreversible and as the public face of Tesla, that damage has become our burden. We are now at a crossroads: continue with Elon as CEO and face further decline as customers abandon the brand, or move forward without him and allow our products and mission to succeed or fail on their own.

We vote for the latter. It’s time to say the quiet part out loud.

Elon’s recent claim that he is “refocusing” on Tesla is not only tone-deaf, it’s insulting. It implies that the hardships of the past six months stem from a lack of his attention, not from his actions. It shifts the blame onto the very people who have held this company together. Let’s be clear: we are not the problem. Our products are not the problem. Our engineering, service, and delivery teams are not the problem. The problem is demand. The problem is Elon.

[...]

Now those very cars are sitting unsold, growing week after week. Production is running better than ever. Quality is high. Processes are strong. Demand is what’s broken. This is not a product problem. It is a leadership problem.

We want to be clear: none of this erases the impact Elon has had on Tesla’s journey. He helped create something extraordinary. The mission we’re fighting for exists in large part because of his early vision. But that doesn’t mean he’s the right person to lead us forward now. In fact, it’s clear he’s not.

After publishing the site (which is signed as if it were penned by multiple employees), LaBrot attended a protest at a Tesla facility. He spray-painted his personal Cybertruck with his website and the slogan ""pro clean energy, pro sustainability, pro EV, pro Tesla, anti Elon"" and parked it outside the Tesla facility where the protest was held. The next day, he got a call from Tesla's HR that his employment at his ""dream job"" was terminated. His account on X—owned by the self-proclaimed ""free speech absolutist"" CEO—was also suspended.

Now, it wasn't actually publishing the website that got LaBrot fired. According to Business Insider, LaBrot was told that the reason he was let go was because he used ""company resources to build a website that did not align with the company's perspective."" LaBrot denied using Tesla resources to build the site in an interview with Business Insider.

The claims made on LaBrot's site aren't exactly hot takes. They're lukewarm at best, and Tesla is well aware of the public perception of its CEO since he began his involvement in U.S. politics. In fact, Tesla even acknowledged that ""changing political sentiment"" was affecting demand for its vehicles in some markets.

It's not difficult to connect the dots here, and LaBrot's firing highlights Musk's zero tolerance for dissent. In this case, an employee disagreed with the guy at the top of the company, publicly aired grievances, and experienced a professionally lethal blow to his career. It seems that if the CEO has carved his public image into stone and the board won't take measures into its own hands to improve sales, then it's going to be up to the public to determine Tesla's future. Judging by the recent drop in vehicle demand, public opinion has already issued a verdict.

100%: Are You Excited For Chinese EVs?

Photo by: Patrick George

The other day, the crew here at IEVs was having a conversation about Chinese EVs. And after hearing all about Patrick's George's time in China, it finally struck me: those China-market-only models were a mistake. The entire world should be getting these cars.

Personally, if you offered me a Xiaomi SU7 Ultra for the price that the home market is paying, I'd buy it in a heartbeat. Name another car with the style, features, and 1,548 all-electric horsepower you can nab for under $75,000 brand new.

The fact that auto executives are forecasting Chinese EVs hitting the U.S. means we're about to get some serious competition. If America wants to stay ahead, then our automakers need to become pioneers again. You know what they say, ""innovate or die.""

So, finally, we come to the big question: are you excited for Chinese EVs to make it to the U.S.? Let me know why (or why not) in the comments.",https://cdn.motor1.com/images/mgl/QeKN6O/s1/xiaomi-su7-us-flag-hero.jpg,N,,2025-05-13 21:01:54.694800

But the current administration seems more committed to ending the EV subsidies than ever.
While one might assume that Tesla CEO Elon Musk endorsing Trump during the 2024 campaign might discourage the president from wanting to end the EV tax credits, Musk has repeatedly come out against them.","On Monday, the U.S. House of Representatives proposed lowering emissions requirements while also ending federal tax incentives pertaining to all-electric vehicles. This initiative is being led by House Republicans and would be executed under more comprehensive tax reform legislation.

The proposal is being reviewed by the House Ways and Means Committee at the time of this writing and seeks to end the $7,500 tax credit for new EVs and up to $4,000 credit for used models by the end of this year. However, the plan will allow a grace period (ending in 2027) that would permit automakers who had not yet reached 200,000 EV sales to continue taking advantage of the program.

Absent from the plan are any provisions to end federal subsidies of battery production, provided the work is being done without help from China. EV batteries produced within the United States would be fine. But any units manufactured under Chinese licenses or using components made by select Chinese companies will be deemed ineligible.

According to Reuters, this still sent some groups into a tizzy. While environmental organizations have become less enamored with EVs due to the ecological concerns surrounding the manufacturing and disposal of batteries, some of the largest entities still support them unconditionally. But it was the industry groups that had the most to say about the proposal thus far.

From Reuters:

The president of the Electric Drive Transportation Association, Genevieve Cullen, criticized the proposal, saying that plans ""to abandon U.S. leadership in energy innovation by gutting federal investment in electrification are catastrophically short-sighted.""

The proposal, she said, would deliver ""an enormous market advantage"" to competitors like China and threaten U.S. manufacturing and jobs.

The U.S. Treasury in 2024 awarded more than $2 billion in point-of-sale rebates for EVs.

There is certainly a case to be made that the U.S. would be foolish to totally abandon embracing new technologies. But it could just as easily be argued that China still has the most to gain from global electrification, regardless of where the manufacturing takes place, due to how much of raw materials required for battery production pass through its borders. China presently holds a staggering 70 percent of the world lithium-ion battery manufacturing capacity. That effectively means Central Asia controls the global supply chain.

Ergo, China likewise benefited from the manufacturing incentives initiated under Joe Biden. But many of those joint ventures fell through as additional scrutiny was given to industry partnerships and those efforts have only ramped up under Trump. Still, billions upon billions in government subsidies have likewise gone to South Korean companies as part of subsequent joint ventures with U.S. brands to build batteries domestically. A significant amount of money is still technically being sent offshore to swiftly increase U.S. battery production and determining how much of that is necessary will be tricky for legislators who want to see more electric vehicles produced as soon as possible.

As part of the House proposal designed to curtain emissions and end EV tax credits, there are likewise provisions to eliminate some of the Department of Energy’s Advanced Technology Vehicles Manufacturing Loan Programs, including those pertaining to battery production.

Working against the House Republicans’ efforts is the fact that the automotive-related inclusions only represent a fraction of what’s in the larger bill. It’s not inconceivable that other components could serve to undermine its passing. This is ultimately a budget reconciliation bill and includes items pertaining to cutting back Medicaid, numerous welfare programs, and loads of environmental spending. Bipartisan support likewise seems to be lacking and isn’t anticipated to come up due to how much the proposal targets climate and ""environmental justice"" initiatives.

However, both the House of Representatives and Senate presently have Republican majorities. The likelihood of President Trump signing off on the legislation, should Congress pass it, is strong as well. He attempted to reduce U.S. fuel economy standards during his first term on the premise that it would allow manufacturers to build less complicated and more traditional vehicles boasting lower price tags. He contended that this would simultaneously boost American manufacturing, due to the fact that those products could be less reliant on foreign-made electronics.

Trump has tacitly supported ending EV tax credits in the past. But the assumption at the time was that they would eventually exhaust themselves as part of the vehicle quotas they were attached to. However, the 200,000 car limit was done away with during the Biden administration (which made pivoting America to EVs a major platform) and EV subsidies effectively became indefinite, if manufacturers could adhere to the content requirements. That latter aspect is likely something Team Trump would have probably supported. But the current administration seems more committed to ending the EV subsidies than ever.

While one might assume that Tesla CEO Elon Musk endorsing Trump during the 2024 campaign might discourage the president from wanting to end the EV tax credits, Musk has repeatedly come out against them. The assumed reasoning is that Tesla was the first automaker to manufacture enough electric vehicles to exhaust the quota and has little to gain by allowing legacy brands to continue benefiting from government subsidies.

The final angle to this ludicrously complicated issue pertains to how the automotive lobby ultimately responds. The industry is incredibly influential in terms of setting policy and has some deep pockets. Whether we’re discussing restrictions on imported trucks via the “Chicken Tax,” creating emissions loopholes via the “Footprint Rule,” extending EV subsidies, or securing billions of dollars in bailouts after going bankrupt in 2008, the automotive sector has a tendency of getting its way.

However, the industry cannot control everything and even the best-laid plans can sometimes backfire. For example, the response to aggressive emission mandates from Western governments was to have the auto lobby help carve out special exemptions for larger vehicles and subsidize electrification indefinitely. While this temporarily boosted profit margins on just about every vehicle sold, automakers are now confronting a situation where a large amount of new product is out of reach for the average customer.

Small, affordable vehicles boasting superior reliability have effectively evaporated from the North American market. Tiny, increasingly complex powertrains are simultaneously becoming the norm and mandated technologies help balloon MSRPs. The push toward EVs has likewise failed to progress at a pace industry leadership assumed would be financially viable. While nothing can be truly assured, much of the public has signaled they’re not altogether pleased with the direction the industry has been heading and we’re starting to see vehicle sales reflect that.

It’s plausible that the industry would absolutely embrace a reduction in emission requirements at this juncture. But there is still a lot of free money (for lack of a better term) from the taxpayers being left on the table if the subsidies are done away with. Meanwhile, the fact that this is all part of an expansive budget reconciliation bill means it’ll undoubtedly go through numerous changes before the matter is settled.",https://cdn-fastly.thetruthaboutcars.com/media/2025/05/13/14301/social-44513860.jpg?size=1200x628,N,,2025-05-13 22:06:33.981248

Wisconsinites can unlock thousands of dollars by engaging in the rebate and tax credit programs below.

Home Energy Rebates

Wisconsin was one of the first states in the country to roll out the Home Energy Rebates, which are separated into two programs: the Home Efficiency Rebates (HOMES) for whole home upgrades and the Home Electrification and Appliance Rebates (HEAR) for purchasing and installing new appliances. These rebate programs are still available for Wisconsinites and should continue to be until the funds allocated to our state – totaling $149 million – run out.

HOMES provides rebates of up to $10,000 for energy-saving, whole-home improvements. This program requires homeowners to receive an energy assessment, which helps determine what upgrades will be best for the home. Upgrades can include insulation, high efficiency heating and cooling appliances, and window replacements. Households of any income level can participate, but households with lower income levels and higher projected energy savings qualify for larger rebates. In some cases, households that have already made efficiency upgrades can retroactively receive HOMES rebates. To find out more, visit Focus on Energy’s website.

HEAR provides rebates of up to $14,000 to low- and moderate-income households for the purchase and installation of energy efficiency equipment and appliances. Qualifying appliances include heat pumps for heating and cooling, electric stoves and heat pump clothes dryers. These rebates are available for existing home appliance upgrades and for new home construction. Electric wiring, insulation, ventilation and air sealing upgrades in existing homes are also eligible for upgrades. Households must be below 150% of the area median income to qualify. To find out more, visit Focus on Energy’s website.

HOMES and HEAR are available for single-family homes and Focus on Energy has begun to roll out HOMES for multifamily buildings as well. The HEAR multifamily roll out will begin later this year.

Tax Credits

There are many federal tax credits available until 2032 for home and transportation upgrades such as renewable energy systems, energy efficiency upgrades and electric vehicle purchases. Credits exist for homeowners, renters, businesses and non-taxable entities such as places of worship. Tax credits can be claimed by filling out form 5695 (home upgrade tax credits) and form 8936 (vehicle upgrade tax credits).

Residential Clean Energy Tax Credits are available for Wisconsinites who install renewable energy systems on their property. This credit equals 30% of the costs of new clean energy systems such as solar panels, geothermal heat pumps and battery storage. In 2023, over 7,000 households in Wisconsin benefited from this program. Find out more here.

Energy Efficient Home Improvement Credits are available for certain energy efficiency home upgrades. This credit equals 30% of the cost of upgrades such as door and window replacements; insulation and air sealing; certain energy efficient heating air conditioners, boilers, furnaces and water heaters; heat pumps; and energy audits. In 2023, more than 60,000 households in Wisconsin benefited from this program. Find out more here.

New Clean Vehicle Credits are available for anyone under a certain income level who purchases qualified plug-in EV or fuel cell electric vehicles. The credits are up to $7,500 and the credit amount depends on vehicle battery capacity and critical mineral requirements. In 2023, over 3,000 Wisconsinites benefited from this program and received an average credit of $6,767. Find out more about the tax credits here, and search for qualifying vehicles here. A similar credit exists for the purchase of used clean vehicles.

“That’s really going to be critical to growing and unlocking this market.” GM started research on the new battery cells in 2015, building prototypes at its tech center.
Last year, he said, GM researchers applied 1 ton of LMR cathode materials, which equates to roughly 300 large-format LMR prismatic cells.","General Motors says it has developed a new battery cell with joint venture partner LG Energy Solution that will bring down costs on mainstream electric vehicles without compromising on range.

The cell, called lithium manganese-rich, or LMR, is expected on the market by 2028 starting with pickups and full-size SUVs. It also will be the first commercial application of prismatic EV battery cells by Ultium Cells LLC, the companies’ joint venture.

GM’s current-generation EVs are powered by pouch-style lithium ion batteries, with cathodes made from nickel, manganese, cobalt and aluminum. GM said LMR cells are cheaper because manganese costs less than nickel and cobalt, and because prismatic cells are more efficient and simpler to assemble.

“It unlocks the premium range and performance at an affordable cost. It’s a game-changing battery for electric trucks,” Kurt Kelty, GM’s vice president of battery, propulsion and sustainability, told reporters at the automaker’s Global Technical Center in Warren, Mich. “We believe we can deliver more than 400 miles of range in a single charge in a truck, while significantly reducing our battery costs.”

To date, GM has used the same battery chemistry and form across its entire EV lineup, underpinning everything from the Chevrolet Equinox EV compact crossover to the GMC Hummer EV pickup and SUV.

Kelty, who joined GM last year after spending 30 years working with lithium ion batteries at companies including Panasonic and Tesla, has said the automaker’s future EVs will incorporate a range of form factors and chemistries. GM envisions lithium iron phosphate, or LFP, cells in some smaller, entry-level EVs to provide an estimated 350 miles of range at a lower price, Kelty said.

Nickel-rich formulas, meanwhile, can be reserved for the longest-range and highest-performance EVs, with range reaching 490 miles, GM said. The Chevy Silverado EV full-size pickup, for instance, tops out at this range.

LMR cells cost about the same as the LFP batteries but offer 33 percent more energy density and greater range — at least 400 miles, GM said, allowing an EV with an LMR battery to weigh hundreds of pounds less than one with an LFP battery offering similar range.

Expanding GM’s battery options is part of the automaker’s effort to reduce EV costs, improve range and charging performance, and further localize its battery supply chain, Kelty said. GM, for instance, in 2023 signed a deal with Australian supplier Element 25 to source manganese sulfate through a facility in Louisiana.

Prismatic packs require half as many parts as pouch-style batteries, Kelty said. The automaker also is preparing to build prismatic cells at a joint venture plant with Samsung SDI starting in 2027.

Other companies are exploring LMR cells, including Ford Motor Co., which in April said it planned to use them in EVs within this decade.

Kelty said GM wants to offer multiple battery configurations on the same vehicle to give customers choices on price and range.

High-nickel batteries will “continue to be well-suited to specialty or premium applications, or customers who absolutely want the highest range,” said Andy Oury, a GM battery engineer and business planning manager.

“What’s exciting about LMR is that we can take that affordable chemistry and we can expand it much further across the portfolio,” Oury said. “That’s really going to be critical to growing and unlocking this market.”

GM started research on the new battery cells in 2015, building prototypes at its tech center. LG Energy Solution also has gotten more than 200 patents related to the technology since 2010, the companies said.

“This is a good strategy for the industry,” said Sam Abuelsamid, vice president of market research at Telemetry. “LMR provides a really nice compromise in a lot of ways between LFP and the nickel-rich cells that have been dominant in the North American market.”

Kushal Narayanaswamy, GM’s director for advanced battery cell engineering, said the automaker’s work on LMR cells has accelerated in the past five years.

Last year, he said, GM researchers applied 1 ton of LMR cathode materials, which equates to roughly 300 large-format LMR prismatic cells.

If the legislation passes, houses of worship, cities, school districts and businesses would also face higher costs and more barriers to go solar, electrify their fleets or improve the efficiency of their buildings. Credits for electric school buses, police cruisers and other commercially used EVs would end this year, while incentives for large-scale renewable energy projects would phase down starting in 2029.

In response, Lisa Frank, executive director of Environment America, said:

“Producing your own power on your roof means freedom for you and a cleaner environment for all of us. Adding a battery keeps the lights on in a storm, and an EV saves you trips to the gas station. Lawmakers should be cheering this on, but this bill would make it harder for Americans to choose clean energy. Why make us pay for polluting power from a plant hundreds of miles away when solar panels on our roofs can do the job even better?”",https://environmentamerica.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/SocialCardEnviroC4_AME.jpg,N,,2025-05-13 22:06:41.625421

Tribal officials and experts argue those conclusions rely on inaccurate information that underestimates the project’s effects on the watershed and number of wetlands impacted.

The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers held a virtual hearing Tuesday after the Bad River Band of Lake Superior Chippewa objected to permitting Enbridge’s planned Line 5 reroute under the Clean Water Act.

Enbridge proposed relocating Line 5 after the Bad River tribe sued the company in 2019 to shut down and remove the pipeline from its lands. The pipeline runs 645 miles and carries up to 23 million gallons of oil and natural gas liquids daily from Superior through northern Wisconsin and Michigan to Sarnia, Ontario.

Information submitted by the tribe didn’t support the Bad River’s finding that the project would violate its water quality, according to Tera Fong, water division director for Region 5 with the Environmental Protection Agency.

“The materials EPA reviewed did not provide data, studies or modeling analysis that showed and quantified impacts of distance from any given discharge point to water quality on the reservation, the likelihood of discharges, including discharges of pollutants traveling from groundwater to surface waters and then to the reservation boundary,” Fong said.

The EPA in 2009 approved the tribe’s water quality standards, which go beyond state standards. Bad River Tribal Chair Robert Blanchard argued that permitting the project would cause irreparable harm to its lands and all living things.

“As Anishinaabe, we believe every living plant or animal has a spirit. Even the water has spirit. Whatever happens upstream from our reservation will affect the waters that we and many others depend on for survival,” Blanchard said.

The Line 5 reroute is slated to cross more than 200 waterways, and it will affect 101 acres of wetlands in Ashland and Iron counties. The Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources in November issued permits and a water quality certification, which the tribe and environmental groups are challenging. The tribe said the agency didn’t consider its standards.

Bad River says blasting and filling wetlands will harm water quality

Bad River argues the project would affect its water quality by blasting bedrock, dredging or filling wetlands and disrupting groundwater flows. The tribe and its experts say work could increase water temperatures, runoff, invasive species or contamination from PFAS and mercury. They also fear aquifer breaches and inadvertent releases similar to those that occurred on Enbridge’s Line 3 replacement in Minnesota.

Joe McGaver, Enbridge’s environmental projects manager, said effects to wetlands would be temporary and only an area roughly the size of a small house would be permanently filled. Enbridge and its consultants said it doesn’t expect conditions similar to those that led to aquifer breaches on Line 3 and designed the project to avoid releases.

“We don’t want to have inadvertent [releases] as much as anybody because of the impacts and then the extra effort to clean it up and other social implications with having a release,” McGaver said.

Matt Horn, principal scientist for engineering firm Tetra Tech, which is working for Enbridge, said such releases related to drilling to install the pipeline could result in more sediment runoff in waters more than a mile upstream of the reservation. Enbridge’s consultants also said the project wouldn’t result in increased levels of mercury, PFAS or nitrates flowing into the tribe’s boundaries.

The tribe’s experts disputed findings from Enbridge’s consultants, including Esteban Chiriboga, environmental specialist with the Great Lakes Indian Fish & Wildlife Commission. He said distance from the reservation doesn’t mean the company would comply with water quality standards.

“Because contaminants can and do persist in the water column for fairly large distances,” Chiriboga said. “The land alterations caused by pipeline construction and operation will cause some changes in water quality, and the close proximity to the reservation means that there’s little opportunity for dilution.”

The company’s consultants also said the project wouldn’t result in measurable effects to flow rates or temperatures of surface waters flowing into the reservation. They added that blasting won’t affect groundwater or nearby wells. Experts for the tribes disputed that.

The hearing continues Wednesday with an opportunity for the public to weigh in online from noon to 7 p.m.

The Line 5 reroute is expected to cost more than $500 million. Enbridge said it will generate millions of dollars in local spending during construction and create more than 700 jobs, but it’s still locked in a legal battle with the tribe.",https://www.wpr.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/line_5.jpg,N,,2025-05-13 19:09:14.091333

In the first quarter of 2025, clean energy and transportation investment in the United States totaled $67.3 billion, a 6.9% increase from the same period in 2024 but a 3.8% decrease from the previous quarter. Despite this second consecutive quarterly decline, clean investment continues to represent a significant share of US private investment, accounting for 4.7% of total private investment in structures, equipment, and durable consumer goods in Q1 2025.

Investment activity was driven primarily by retail consumer purchases and installations of clean technology, which accounted for nearly half of the total at $33.5 billion. This segment saw 17.4% growth compared to Q1 2024, though investment declined 2.2% from the prior quarter. Investments in manufacturing were up 7.7% relative to Q1 2024, but down 11.5% compared to Q4 2024. Investments in utility-scale clean electricity and industrial decarbonization technologies declined by 7.7% from Q1 2024, but stayed roughly flat compared to Q4 2024.

The pipeline of new project announcements offered a mixed outlook, with $41.3 billion in new utility clean electricity projects, mainly in solar and storage, a level roughly on par with average quarterly clean energy announcements during 2024. New industrial decarbonization announcements declined sharply to $79 million, compared to $16 billion in Q1 2024 and $7.8 billion last quarter. Companies announced $9.4 billion in new manufacturing projects, 23% below the value announced in Q1 2024, but a 46% increase from Q4 2024. Six clean technology manufacturing projects, representing $6.9 billion in investment, were cancelled in Q1 2025, as detailed in our recent clean energy supply chains report.

This report also highlights the jobs created by clean investments. The Clean Investment Monitor database expanded this year to track both the construction and operational jobs generated by completed facilities and those jobs expected from announced facilities that have not yet come online. The data, available at the state and congressional district levels, are derived from publicly reported facility-level data and supplemented by modeled values where necessary.

Our analysis highlights the significant role in job creation of the 2,369 new manufacturing, utility-scale clean electricity, and industrial decarbonization facilities that have opened across the US since the enactment of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). Spurred by $321 billion in company-driven clean investment, those facilities have created nearly 13,000 operational jobs in Texas, more than 12,500 in Georgia, and more than 7,500 in North Carolina and Michigan. Looking ahead, $522 billion of outstanding investment remains to be spent on construction and installation for announced or under-construction facilities. This pipeline includes 2,217 facilities that are expected to generate significant employment opportunities in South Carolina (14,013), Kentucky (11,795), Tennessee (9,632), Ohio (9,622), and North Carolina (9,299).

Investment trends

Actual clean energy and transportation investment in the US in Q1 2025 totaled $67.3 billion (Figure 1). While this represents a 6.9% increase from Q1 2024, it is the second consecutive quarterly decline, with a 3.8% decrease from Q4 2024. In Q1 2025, clean investment accounted for 4.7% of total US private investment in structures, equipment, and durable consumer goods nationwide, down slightly from 4.9% in Q4 2024 but up from 4.5% in Q1 2024 (Figure 2).

We categorize our clean investment tracking into three segments: investment in the manufacture of GHG emission-reducing technology (“manufacturing”); investment in the deployment of that technology, both to produce clean energy or decarbonize industrial production (“energy & industry”); and investment through the purchase and installation of that technology by individual households and businesses (“retail”). Each dollar figure in this report reflects actual investment—the real dollars spent in the given quarter on retail purchases, facility construction, and equipment purchase and installation. For facilities, we track actual capital expenditures invested over the construction timeline once a project breaks ground. In the following sections of this report, we summarize actual and announced investments, which provide context and insight into potential future actual investments.

Retail investment again drove clean investment in Q1 2025, accounting for 49.8% of total clean investment at $33.5 billion. While actual retail investment decreased 2.2% relative to the previous quarter, it was up 17.4% compared to Q1 2024. In the energy & industry segment, $19.8 billion was invested in clean energy production and industrial decarbonization, roughly the same level as the previous quarter, but a 7.7% decline compared to Q1 2024. Manufacturing investment decreased by 11.5% quarter-on-quarter to $14.0 billion invested, though it remained up by 7.7% compared to Q1 2024. Notably, six clean technology manufacturing projects, representing $6.9 billion in investment, were cancelled in Q1 2025, as detailed in our recent clean energy supply chains report.

Manufacturing

Manufacturing investment dropped by 11.5% from Q4 2024, though it remained up by 7.7% compared to Q1 2024. The electric vehicle (EV) supply chain—critical minerals, batteries, vehicle assembly, and charging equipment—remained the dominant force in clean manufacturing investment, accounting for $13 billion (93%) of the total $14 billion in actual investment (Figure 4). Battery manufacturing investment fell by 11.4% quarter-on-quarter to $10.4 billion, though it was up 14% relative to Q1 2024. Solar manufacturing investment dropped slightly to just under $1 billion, a 23.3% decrease from Q4 2024 and a 41.5% decline relative to Q1 2024, marking the fifth consecutive quarterly decline.

Companies announced $9.3 billion in new manufacturing projects in Q1 2025, a 46% increase from Q4 2024, but 23% below the value announced in Q1 2024. Of these Q1 2025 announcements, 75% were in the EV supply chain. The new pipeline includes $2.3 billion in solar manufacturing and $0.1 billion in wind manufacturing investment, the first new wind manufacturing projects announced since Q3 2023.

Energy & industry

In Q1 2025, the US saw a total of $19.8 billion in new actual investment in clean energy production and industrial decarbonization, down 0.3% quarter-on-quarter and down 7.7% relative to the same period in 2024. Within this segment, $18.3 billion (92%) went toward clean electricity and $1.5 billion (8%) supported industrial decarbonization projects, a distribution consistent with previous quarters.

Utility-scale solar and storage investment dominated clean electricity investment, accounting for $14.4 billion, a 5.3% decrease from Q4 2024 and a 15.4% decline from Q1 2024 (Figure 5). In contrast, wind investment recorded a third consecutive quarterly increase, rising by 26.8% from the previous quarter to $3.9 billion in Q1 2025.

Industrial decarbonization investment declined 3% quarter-on-quarter, but increased 5.4% relative to Q1 2024. Industry actual investment continues to represent a small fraction of the total value of announced projects, with most facilities not yet started and a small number of facilities moving into construction and operation. Hydrogen led actual investment in industry at $0.5 billion, up 3.4% from the previous quarter and 40.5% compared to Q1 2024. Sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) investment dropped by 22.9% quarter-on-quarter to $0.4 billion, a 42.1% decline from Q1 2024. The remainder of Q1 industry investment included carbon management at $0.5 billion and clean fuels at $0.1 billion, reflecting the highest quarter on record for the latter. Another $0.1 billion was invested in clean iron and steel production.

The pipeline of new energy projects expanded with the addition of $41.3 billion in new utility electricity project announcements, roughly on par with the quarterly average value of announcements in 2024. Most of these announcements ($36.5 billion) were for solar and storage projects. In contrast, industry announcements were at their lowest since Q2 2020. Companies announced $79 million in new projects in Q1 2025, roughly 1% of the value of industry announcements in Q4 2024.

Retail

Consumer spending on zero-emission vehicles (ZEVs), distributed renewable electricity generation and storage, and heat pumps totaled $33.5 billion in Q1 2025, a 2.2% decline from Q4 2024, but a 17.4% increase compared to Q1 2024.

Investments in ZEV registrations (a proxy for sales) declined by 11.5% quarter-on-quarter to $23.0 billion, predominantly driven by a substantial 21% decline in sales by Tesla. Despite overall ZEV registrations declining quarter-on-quarter, this level represents a 15.2% increase from Q1 2024 (Figure 7).

Distributed electricity generation and storage investment reached a new post-IRA peak in Q1 at $5.6 billion, up 57.4% from Q4 2024 and 48.3% compared to Q1 2024. Heat pump investments also saw modest growth, rising by 4.2% quarter-on-quarter to $5.0 billion, a 2.9% increase compared to Q1 2024.

Jobs tied to clean investments

Since the enactment of the IRA in Q3 2022, $321 billion has been invested in manufacturing, clean electricity, and industrial facilities, and 2,369 new facilities have opened across the US. Looking ahead, $522 billion of outstanding investment remains to be spent on construction and installation for announced or under-construction facilities. This pipeline includes 2,217 facilities that have yet to come online.

The Clean Investment Monitor (CIM) expanded tracking earlier this year to provide insights into the employment generated by these post-IRA clean technology investments across the US. By adding state and congressional district jobs data—covering both the construction and operational jobs that are directly tied to specific facilities—we provide a clearer understanding of the local economic impacts of the IRA.

For this report, we use CIM data through Q1 2025 (March 31, 2025) to report the operational jobs created so far in each state at completed manufacturing, utility clean electricity, and industrial decarbonization facilities that have come online since Q3 2022, when the IRA was enacted. Additionally, we report the jobs expected from facilities with outstanding investment, reflecting announced projects that are not yet operational. This jobs data is derived from publicly reported facility-level data and supplemented with modeled values where necessary.

Table 1 ranks the top 20 states by the operational jobs created since Q3 2022, with states that have attracted significant clean technology manufacturing projects leading. Table 2 focuses on the pipeline of outstanding investment, ranking the top 20 states by expected operational jobs if these projects come online. Texas, Georgia, and Michigan ranked among the top 5 on both lists. Within the top 10 on both lists sit Tennessee, Ohio, North Carolina, Arizona, and Indiana. All these states stand out for the significant role that clean technology manufacturing investment is expected to play in job creation in these regions.

In Texas, for example, $62.3 billion has been invested in new or expanded facilities since the IRA passed, and 29 manufacturing facilities and 209 clean energy and industrial decarbonization facilities have come online during the same period. These facilities have created 12,931 jobs. Companies have announced projects worth $128.5 billion, which are not yet online but are expected to generate 15,384 operational jobs.",https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/64e31ae6c5fd44b10ff405a7/682274146ce1bc29bbbbe090_cim-q1-2025.jpg,N,,2025-05-14 10:10:52.097943

Louisiana Revolving Loan Program

The Louisiana Department of Energy and Natural Resources offers low-cost financing for retrofitting and alternative fueling projects. If you’re a business or a public entity, you can apply for a loan with a 2% fixed interest rate for a term of ten years or less. This offers businesses a great way to finance workplace and other commercial EV charging projects!

Louisiana EV Rebates

Louisiana does not currently offer a state-level EV rebate. However, one local utility is encouraging customers to go electric by offering a credit for buying an EV:

Dixie Electric Membership Cooperative

Whether you are buying or leasing an EV, you can get a $100 rebate for simply registering an electric vehicle within this utility’s service territory.

Louisiana EV Tax Credits

Louisiana does not have a state-wide EV tax credit, but residents may qualify for federal EV tax credits like the $7,500 clean vehicle tax credit for new vehicles, or the $4,000 used clean vehicle tax credit. Income restrictions as well as battery component and critical mineral restrictions may apply. Be sure to speak to a qualified CPA or tax professional to check your eligibility.

Additionally, the Alternative Fuel Vehicle Refueling Property Credit provides a federal tax credit up to $1,000 to offset costs related to installing an EV charger at home. Businesses can claim EV charger tax credits worth up to $100,000.

Louisiana EV Charger Rebates

Charging your EV at home is both affordable and convenient. To achieve the best charging speed with your residential electrical infrastructure, it is essential to install a Level 2 EV charger with the help of a qualified EV charger installation professional.

Three utility providers in Louisiana offer EV charger rebates, with average an rebate amount of $250 dollars:

Cleco Power EV Charger Rebates

Cleco Power, which serves 24 parishes and 295,000 customers, offers several ways to save on EV charging. As a residential customer, you can claim a $250 rebate toward a Level 2 charger.

Cleco can also help your business transition to electric with a free fleet assessment. Plus, you may be eligible for a $1,000 rebate when installing a Level 2 charger at a multifamily property, workplace, fleet site, or public location. The utility also offers a rebate of $3,500 to support your DC Fast Charger project.

Entergy EV Charger Rebates

With a presence in five states, Entergy is a key provider of electricity for the state of Louisiana and offers some noteworthy Louisiana EV rebate programs. You can earn $250 toward a Level 2 charger with Entergy’s EV rebate program. However, if you live in New Orleans and enroll in the utility’s time-of-use plan, you’ll become eligible for a $350 rebate instead.

Businesses can claim a $250 rebate toward a Level 2 charger, get $750 for a DC Fast charger with a capacity of 50 kW or less, or qualify for a $1,500 rebate for a DC Fast charger with more than 50 kW in capacity. Commercial customers in New Orleans can claim a rebate of up to $2,500 per public, fleet, or multifamily Level 2 charger. Financial incentives for DC Fast chargers range from $2,500 to $12,500, depending on the charger’s capacity.

Southwestern Electric Power Company (SWEPCO) EV Charger Rebates

Southwestern Electric Power Company (SWEPCO) is also working to bring greater electrification to Northwestern and Central Louisiana residents through rebate programs. SWEPCO offers a $250 rebate to help you save on a Level 2 at-home charger. SWEPCO also offers a $250 rebate toward multifamily Level 2 EV charging projects.

EV Charging Rates in Louisiana

To further help EV owners reduce charging costs by encouraging off-peak charging, utilities in Louisiana offer time-of-use (TOU) electricity rates designed to lower the cost of charging EVs.

These TOU plans incentivize vehicle charging during off-peak hours, making EV ownership more affordable.

Dixie Electric Membership Cooperative

The cooperative offers a residential time-of-use rate to help customers save money by charging when electricity demand is low. You can contact the utility directly to learn more about this program.

Entergy (New Orleans Customers Only)

Entergy offers a $7 cash incentive if you can switch your EV charging to off-peak hours, which last from 9 p.m. to 6 a.m. and all day long on weekends and holidays. The utility even allows you to charge your EV outside these hours three times a month without losing your incentive.

Southwestern Electric Power Company (SWPECO)

If you enroll in SWEPCO’s time-of-use plan, you’ll save the most by charging your EV at night. From May to October, you’ll pay $0.16 between 3 p.m. and 7 p.m. Your rate will drop to $0.10 from 5 a.m. to 3 p.m. and from 7 p.m. to 11 p.m. You’ll only pay $0.03 per kWh during off-peak hours, which last from 11 p.m. to 5 a.m.

Between November and April, an on-peak rate of $0.09 per kWh will be effective from 5 a.m. to 11 p.m. Outside of these hours, you’ll pay $0.03 per kWh.

Public EV Charging Stations in Louisiana

How Many Public EV Charging Stations Are in Louisiana?

As of May 2025, Louisiana has over 200 public charging stations including 194 Level 2 and 78 DC Fast stations. There are 768 public EV charging ports, 19 Tesla Supercharger stations and 199 Tesla Supercharger ports in Louisiana.

For Ford EV drivers, the Ford BlueOval network has many options, with nearly 100 locations in the New Orleans area alone.

How Much Do Public EV Charging Stations Cost in Louisiana?

Charging cost is mainly dependent on where you’re charging. For example, the charger located at 5001 Johnston Street in Lafayette costs $3 for an hour of charging. There are also more affordable options, such as the charger at 6889 Corporate Boulevard in Baton Rouge, which only costs $1 per hour.

Be sure to read our article discussing the Cost of Charging an EV at Home vs. Public Charging.

Are There Free EV Charging Stations in Louisiana?

You can find some free EV charging stations located throughout the state. In fact, the city of New Orleans operates some free EV chargers in partnership with Entergy. You can find these stations at Bayon Oaks at the City Park Driving Range on Filmore Avenue, as well as at the City Park Reunion Shelter on Friederichs Avenue.

Where Are Public EV Charging Stations Located in Louisiana?

Since the state is still developing its EV charging infrastructure, most charging options are in large cities and along major highways such as New Orleans, Shreveport, and Baton Rouge. However, that doesn’t mean you can’t find charging stations outside of major cities.

Visit the U.S. Department of Energy’s Alternative Fuels Data Center Map of EV Charging Station Locations in Louisiana, which can be sorted and filtered based on public access, charger type (Level 1, Level 2, DC Fast), and connector type (NACS, J1772, CCS, CHAdeMO).

Home Electrification Incentives in Louisiana

Combining EV ownership with other electrification projects, such as upgrading your home with solar panels & battery storage, or investing in a heat pump, will help you save even more while reducing your environmental impact.

You may qualify for home electrification incentives through your local electricity provider in addition to the U.S. federal government. Scroll down to read tax credit and incentive details for specific home electrification technologies.

Battery Storage

The 25D Residential Clean Energy Tax Credit provides a 30% federal tax credit on the cost of new battery storage systems size 3kWh and larger.

Electrical Panels

The 25C Energy Efficient Home Improvement Tax Credit provides a federal tax credit for electrical panel upgrades needed to complete electrification projects like heat pumps and heat pump water heaters (up to 30% of project costs, capped at $600). The 25C tax credit can be used by renters, and homeowners making upgrades to their primary or secondary home.

Qualifying electrical panels must meet the standards of the National Electric Code (NEC) and have a capacity of 200 Amps or more. This means that your new/upgraded panel must be able to serve a load of at least 200 Amps, but you don’t need 200 Amps of incoming utility service. Smart panels may qualify if they allow you to serve a load of 200 Amps.

If you’re claiming 25D for a residential solar or battery storage project and the installation required you to upgrade your main panel, you may be able to apply 25D to electrical panel costs as well.

Heat Pumps & Heat Pump Water Heaters

The 25C Energy Efficient Home Improvement Tax Credit also applies to heat pumps and heat pump water heaters. A 30% federal tax credit is available (capped at $2,000 dollars). Eligible technologies must meet certain energy efficiency requirements.

Solar Panels

The 25D Residential Clean Energy Tax Credit also provides a 30% federal tax credit on the cost of photovoltaic (PV) solar panel systems.",https://qmerit.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/louisiana-draft.jpg,N,,2025-05-13 22:06:46.515283

It’s a long day and night ahead. Republicans are working to push President Donald Trump’s signature legislative package through a gauntlet of committee hearings over mounting opposition from Democrats, advocacy groups and even some wary Republicans themselves.

Right from the start, one hearing was immediately disrupted by protesters shouting down what the top Democrat on the committee called “cruel” cuts to Medicaid and other programs.

“People feel very strong because they know they’re losing their health care,” said Rep. Frank Pallone, D-N.J., on the Energy & Commerce Committee. He asked for the police to refrain from making arrests, noting that some of the people protesting were disabled.

It’s the biggest political and legislative debate for the Republicans leading Congress since Trump’s first term, setting up a career-defining clash over the nation’s priorities — some $5 trillion in tax breaks, including the president’s promises for no taxes on tips, Social Security income and car loan interest, offset by $1.9 trillion in tax savings largely from green energy rollbacks, for a net tally of $3.7 trillion in taxes, according to the most recent estimates.

Trump, speaking at an forum in the Middle East, struck an ambitious chord, saying Congress was “on the verge of passing the largest tax cut and regulation cut in American history.”

“If we get that, that will be like a rocket ship for our country,” Trump said in Saudi Arabia.

But to be sure, there are many more steps before the package becomes law.

House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries accused Republicans of “jamming another GOP tax scam” that benefits the wealthy at the expense of programs and services used by Americans.

“It is an egregious and outrageous bill,” Jeffries said.

At its core, the goal for GOP lawmakers is to extend — and enhance — tax cuts approved in 2017.

Additionally, the Republicans are boosting spending on their GOP priorities, with $350 billion for Trump’s mass deportation plans and funding for the Pentagon.

At the same time, the Republicans are seeking to defray the lost tax revenue and avoid skyrocketing national deficits by with another GOP goal, which is scaling back federal spending with nearly $800 billion cuts to health care, $290 billion to food programs and billions in the Biden-eras green energy investments that millions of Americans rely on in states across the country.

And tucked in is a smattering of other provisions important to the White House — including one that would allow the Trump administration to yank the tax exempt status of groups it says support terrorists, sending a chill through civil society organizations who warn it’s a way to punish opponents.

Speaker Mike Johnson is determined to push the package through the House by Memorial Day, sending it to the Senate, where Republicans are working on their own version and approach.

With the slimmest majority in the House, Johnson has just a few votes to spare, and is running into resistance from his party, including lawmakers in the Senate, which also has thin GOP margins.

“In the current form, I can’t support it,” said Wisconsin Republican Sen. Ron Johnson, a deficit hawk who wants deeper spending reductions.

On Tuesday, three House committees will gavel into session for what is expected to be marathon hearings on the three largest components of the package — the Ways & Means tax writing committee; the Energy & Commerce Committee that handles health care and energy policy; and later in the evening, the Agriculture Committee that has proposed the food stamps cuts.

Advocacy groups are protesting the cuts and Democrats, as the minority party in Congress unable to stop the bill, are planning to use the procedural tools available in to slow down the process.

The lawmakers are racing for a July 4 deadline to have the whole package sent to Trump’s desk in time to also avoid a dangerous debt default. The Treasury Secretary has said federal tax revenues are running short and Congress needs to raise the spending limit to keep paying the bills.

""We're adopting flexible chemistries for the best balance of range, performance and affordability,"" said Kurt Kelty, GM's vice president of battery, propulsion and sustainability, during a media briefing on the announcement. ""My mission here is to get as many EVs on the road as possible. We need to get price parity with (internal combustion engine vehicles) and then this thing's just going to take off.""

Senator Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.), Ranking Member of the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works, is demanding that Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin halt plans to dismantle landmark federal climate programs, citing newly revealed documents and warning of harm to American industry and consumers.

According to documents obtained exclusively by Democratic staff on the Senate EPW Committee, the EPA is preparing to shut down the Climate Change Division and Climate Protection Partnership Division within the Office of Atmospheric Protection. These divisions oversee the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program (GHGRP) and the widely used Energy Star Program, which has saved Americans more than $500 billion and prevented nearly 4 billion metric tons of greenhouse gas emissions over three decades.

“For the past 15 years, the GHGRP has collected facility-level emissions data from over 8,000 facilities, supplying vital information to policymakers, scientists, investors, and the public,” Whitehouse wrote in a letter to Administrator Zeldin. “These data inform our national GHG inventory, support international emissions reporting, and serve as the de facto standard for many companies’ climate disclosures.”

Whitehouse warned that the proposed rollback would remove a competitive edge for U.S. manufacturers. GHGRP data has shown that American facilities are less carbon-intensive than foreign competitors. Eliminating this program, he argued, would strip U.S. companies of data that allows th

em to market themselves as cleaner than global rivals, including those in China.

“[E]limination of the GHGRP would likely harm the very companies supposed to benefit from fewer reporting requirements,” Whitehouse added. “You will rob American industry of data giving [it a] competitive advantage.”

The documents indicate the agency’s justification for dismantling the GHGRP is based on feedback from industry trade associations, citing a desire to reduce regulatory burdens on oil and natural gas producers. Critics, including Whitehouse, argue the move aligns with the interests of fossil fuel companies, which supported former President Donald Trump’s campaign with significant funding and lobbying efforts aimed at environmental rollbacks.

“EPA’s recent actions—including the elimination of the GHGRP—continue the pattern of allowing polluters to dictate environmental policy,” Whitehouse stated. “Dismantling the GHGRP prioritizes polluter interests over the international competitiveness of American steel, aluminum, fertilizer, cement, and chemicals industries.”

He's vowed that the agency will ""fix"" it.

How that will be executed is an unknown, but AST tech isn't really broken to begin with.

If you've ever driven a gas car with Auto Start-Stop (AST) tech, you know just how annoying it can be. You roll to a stop and after a slight delay, the RPMs drop to zero until you let your foot off the brake and the engine quickly roars back to life. It shouldn't seem like a problem, but it's widely regarded as one of the most disliked eco features on modern gas cars. Now, the Administrator of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Lee Zeldin, says he's going to ""fix"" the feature because ""everyone hates it.""

Here's the thing: it might be annoying to some people, but it's not actually broken.

Zeldin announced that the agency was looking into the feature via a post on X. He didn't supply any real information on how the EPA was looking to solve the supposed problem, though, He just hinted that the EPA was responsible for fixing it, since the agency approved and promoted the use of AST systems to begin with.

Things get weirder when you realize that the EPA doesn't actually mandate AST tech.

Yes, you read that right. There's no actual federal rule that requires automakers to implement AST features in cars, but there are incentives in the form of carbon credits for automakers that do. And automakers gobbled that up as an easy win to offset emission standards. Plus, AST drives down fleet-wide average emissions, which is important to automakers.

In a report published by the EPA in 2023, the agency noted that AST was rapidly adopted by automakers once the agency began offering carbon credits for implementation. In 2016, just 9% of cars had the tech—that ballooned to more than 60% by 2022. One could also argue that it's pretty much industry standard at this point.

Here's an excerpt from the now-deleted EPA paper (which has since been removed from the agency's website):

The implementation of stop/start has been increasing rapidly, as discussed in Section 4, which aggregates and reports on these systems regardless of the regulatory eligibility for credits. In model year 2022, 60% of new vehicles qualified for and claimed this credit, resulting in a fleetwide CO2 reduction of about 2.2 g/mi. Twelve manufacturers installed stop start systems on at least half of their model year 2022 vehicles.

You may have caught an important figure above. The EPA itself shows that AST tech actually does what it's supposed to do—it reduces tailpipe emissions. The U.S. Department of Energy even published a separate report showing real-world testing of the tech compared to cold starts and idling. Unsurprisingly, it resulted in a significant reduction of emissions.

It has also been shown to save fuel. The same report from the DoE claims that if each gas-powered car registered in the U.S. idled for 6 minutes per day, it would waste around 3 billion gallons of fuel annually (that's around $9.9 billion, or $42.50 per licensed driver).

National Resources Canada also had similar findings with claims that AST tech cut fuel consumption by between 4% and 10% during city driving. Edmunds put this to the test using some of its long-term test cars and found that each vehicle tested managed to save at least 9% more fuel when AST was enabled in ideal conditions. One vehicle even reached 10.9% savings. SAE International even says its tests show that the feature can save up to a whopping 26.4%.

So why the backlash? Partly because drivers hate unpredictability. If we're being real, AST can feel like an engine stall even if it restarts in milliseconds. It's also an always-on feature by default that requires drivers to turn it off every time they turn on the car (or buy a small device to disable it; or code it out using tuning software). It makes people feel like they've lost control of their car, and that's not an easy sell. Plus, consumers worry that it puts extra wear on their vehicles, even though vehicles with AST are built differently to support the feature.

AST is actually a great leap in fuel-saving tech that took off in the last decade. Hell, it might be one of the best—low cost, low tech and it's effective. Automakers have also gotten significantly better at implementing the feature in a less intrusive way. But nevertheless, it's still a change to the way a car works that irks drivers.

If Zeldin wants to implement a ""fix"" (if you can call whatever the EPA decides to do that), the best route certainly isn't to eliminate the feature altogether. Maybe it's to encourage OEMs to implement a memory feature or software ""opt-out,"" or maybe even demanding smoother, consistent execution across brands But eliminating something that shows very measurable real-world results? That's a personal vendetta that just doesn't make sense.",https://cdn.motor1.com/images/mgl/KbYVLb/s1/auto-start-stop-hero.jpg,N,,2025-05-13 18:10:19.344543

MONTPELIER, VT - Vermont Department of Public Service","Vermont Business Magazine The Vermont Department of Public Service is pleased to announce a $22.34 million subaward with Vermont Housing Finance Agency (VHFA) as part of the federal Solar for All Program (SFA). This funding represents over a third of Vermont's $62.45 million federal grant from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and will support affordable housing solar initiatives across the state.

SFA was created under the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022. It will offer $7 billion nationally to help lower the cost of electricity through solar power, which has historically been out of reach for low-income households.

The initiative was championed by Vermont's Congressional delegation, particularly by Senator Bernie Sanders who introduced the Solar for All Program.

“Solar for All will not only combat the existential threat of climate change by making solar energy available to working class families,” said Senator Sanders. “It will also substantially lower the electric bills of Americans and create thousands of good-paying jobs. This is a win for the environment, a win for consumers, and a win for the economy.”

Under this partnership, VHFA will award grants and loans to affordable housing developers to support installation of solar arrays on building rooftops, on-site ground-mounted arrays, or participation in larger off-site community solar installations.

""We are pleased to partner with VHFA to deliver solar options for affordable housing residents,"" remarked Department of Public Service Commissioner Kerrick Johnson. ""Currently, towns with the highest energy burden in Vermont have the least amount of installed solar. That’s why the primary objective of this program is to deliver benefits to disadvantaged Vermonters, regardless of their dwelling status.”

""VHFA is excited to participate in this historic program,"" said VHFA Executive Director Maura Collins. ""The program will assist our residents, who can expect to receive a long-term reduction in their utility costs or equivalent benefits. Solar power will also help affordable housing developers become part of the climate solution by offsetting the increased costs associated with heating with electricity.""

In the coming months, VHFA will hold public outreach sessions with housing developers, residents, and other key stakeholders to further inform the design of the program.

About Vermont’s Solar for All Program

Vermont's application to the EPA includes three separate programs:

The VHFA affordable housing solar initiative, referred to as the Multi-Family Affordable Solar Housing (MASH) Program;

The Affordable Community Renewable Energy (ACRE) Program, which is an existing community solar program run through utilities and will be expanded through the funding made available by SFA; and

The Residential Assistance in Solar Energy (RAISE) Program, which will offer low-income single-family homeowners the opportunity for direct ownership of net-metered rooftop solar installations of up to 5 kilowatts.

Marston Associates LLC that resolves a February 2024 incident where the company spilled approximately 1,680 gallons of biodiesel into a storm drain from a fuel truck on the Bates College campus in Lewiston, Maine.

The biodiesel reached Jepson Creek through the storm drains, and an oil sheen was observed in the Androscoggin River in alleged violation of the federal Clean Water Act.

P.S. Marston will pay a $49,528 civil penalty to resolve this case.

“This settlement holds accountable a company that polluted Maine waterways and was not able to contain all of the spilled biodiesel before it reached Jepson Creek and the Androscoggin River,” said Mark Sanborn, EPA’s regional administrator for New England.

“This case exemplifies EPA’s core mission to protect human health and the environment and ensure clean air, land and water for every American,” Sanborn said.

The spill occurred while a truck driver with the fuel-delivery company was conducting a transfer of biodiesel to Bates College.

The driver did not follow the company’s standard operating plan and walked away from the transfer.

Immediately following this, the truck and the transfer hose disconnected from one another and released an estimated 1,680 gallons of product.

The biodiesel flooded a parking lot, flowed into storm drains and eventually reached nearby waterways.

Following the spill, Bates College called the Maine Department of Environmental Protection and reported the spill to the federal National Response Center.

P.S. Marston reported that some, though not all, of the spilled oil was recovered.

Recovery of the oil in the Androscoggin River was not possible due to high levels of water and ice, and Maine DEP placed booms in the affected storm drains and in accessible areas of Jepson Brook.

Any unobligated funding under this program would be rescinded, if the Committee’s proposal is approved.

DEP received $44.4 million for grants under this program and only a small portion has been obligated so far. Read more here.

DEP would still have federal funding remaining for conventional oil and gas well plugging under the federal Bipartisan Infrastructure Act for its primary well plugging effort and to plug orphan conventional wells, unless Congress acts to rescind the funding.

US House Committee Action

The MERP's waste emissions charge is estimated to raise $7.2 billion in federal revenues and save American families and taxpayers tens of billions in avoided health costs.

In response, EEN Action President & CEO Rev. Dr. Jessica Moerman submitted the following letter urging members of the House Energy and Commerce Committee to oppose efforts to delay or repeal this cost-effective fee on wasted natural gas and instead come together to optimize the MERP program to generate federal revenue, create jobs, and defend the health and lives of our children--

Dear Member of the House Committee for Energy and Commerce,

On behalf of the more than 600,000 pro-life Christians who have voiced their support for methane pollution safeguards over the last decade, I write to urge you to oppose efforts to repeal the Methane Emissions Reduction Program (MERP) and delay implementation of the Waste Emissions Charge (WEC) in the forthcoming budget reconciliation package.

As evangelical Christians, we believe that all human life is sacred and worthy of protection.

We are committed to defending life, especially that of our children both born and unborn, from all harms.

This includes harms from pollution from carbon-based energy, which medical research finds is the leading environmental threat to children’s health.

Air pollution emitted with wasted natural gas is linked to the development and exacerbation of asthma, other respiratory diseases, cancer due to exposure to carcinogenic benzenes, heart disease, premature death, and poor birth outcomes including birth defects, low birth weight, and premature birth, and even stillbirth.

Together, air pollution associated with methane waste emissions from the oil and gas sector is estimated to cost Americans $77 billion in health impacts each year, with energy-producing regions most affected.

While some have called the WEC a tax on natural gas that companies will pass on to consumers; in truth consumers are already paying a natural gas tax: through $77 billion per year in health costs, poor health, and the grief of losing a loved one early from exposure to toxic pollution that can be avoided by capturing wasted natural gas.

To defend the health of our children, energy workers, and their families, our country must curtail needlessly wasted natural gas.

The MERP is a fiscally responsible, market-based measure designed to curb methane waste that will raise billions in federal revenues and save American families and taxpayers tens of billions in avoided health costs.

While the current draft text extends the WEC through 2035, it simultaneously delays its start date by a full decade—pushing the first year of covered emissions from 2024 to 2034 and effectively gutting the program’s impact for the next ten years.

The delayed implementation of the fee until 2034 would eliminate $7.2 billion in projected federal revenue and allow for another decade the egregious waste of $1 billion in lost commercial value per year.

While concerns have been raised that a fee to encourage the oil and gas sector to capture wasted natural gas could negatively impact small producers, the MERP was specifically designed to support small producers in reducing their methane waste.

As part of the program, only the largest producers would be assessed a fee, which would end once methane waste emissions are sufficiently reduced.

Furthermore, federal taxpayers have already provided generous financial assistance to assist industry in reducing methane waste, with much of the $1.55 billion in MERP grant funding already out the door.

Much of this assistance was aimed at lowering the bar for small producers to put in place waste reduction technologies.

Wasted natural gas is not only poor stewardship of our energy resources but robs our children and loved ones from reaching their full God-given potential.

Excessive methane waste should be assessed a fee to defend the health of our children, ensure taxpayers are compensated for the loss of a valuable American resource, and encourage oil and gas partners to address the energy emergency by bringing more gas to market instead of wasting it into thin air.

Now is not the time to put a significant federal revenue raiser on the sidelines.

We urge you to oppose efforts to repeal the Methane Emissions Reduction Program (MERP) and delay implementation of the Waste Emissions Charge (WEC).

We instead urge the committee to come together for discussion and dialogue on optimizing the implementation of MERP to generate federal revenue, create jobs, and defend the life of our children.

This Clean Air Month, the DNR’s Air Management Program is highlighting the nonattainment challenges facing Wisconsin and sharing resources available for individuals, businesses and communities to stay informed about air quality.

Wisconsin’s air quality successes over the last 20 years include an 88% decrease in sulfur dioxide concentrations, a 26% decrease in fine particle pollution and a 21% decrease in statewide ozone concentrations. Still, even as air pollution has declined over the past few decades, that trend has slowed in recent years. Longstanding issues such as unique geography and meteorology and transported emissions continue to impact the air quality along Wisconsin’s Lake Michigan shoreline.

Additionally, impacts from increased wildfire activity make it more challenging to meet today’s U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) air quality standards.

Ozone pollution remains a particularly complex challenge for Wisconsin. The EPA estimates Wisconsin contributes no more than 10% of the ozone concentrations measured in ozone nonattainment areas, while other states contribute as much as 50% (the remaining contributions are from non-state sources, like emissions from natural sources).

Ozone forming pollutants – volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and nitrogen oxides (NOx) – are emitted by upwind states and transported over Lake Michigan, where they react and form ozone, which is then carried onshore via lake breezes. This process can often lead to elevated ozone levels in Wisconsin’s lakeshore counties, even though a large portion of that pollution comes from other states, explains DNR Air Management Program Director Gail Good.

Wisconsin continues to seek effective federal rules to address and control pollutant transport. “Though Wisconsin does not emit the majority of the air pollution currently in the state, we are responsible for meeting federal air quality standards regardless of where the pollutants originate,” Good said. “The State of Wisconsin is working to ensure that rules addressing ozone transport adequately and fully resolve ozone transport obligations for Wisconsin and ensure Wisconsin businesses are not held responsible for nonattainment issues they have no control over.”

Over the past three years, companies have made plans to invest more than $843 billion across the United States in projects aimed at reducing planet-warming emissions, driven by lucrative tax credits for clean energy provided by the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act.

But only about $321 billion of that money has actually been spent, with many projects still on the drawing board, according to data made public on Tuesday by the Clean Investment Monitor, a joint project of the Rhodium Group and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

Now, much of the rest, about $522 billion, will depend on action playing out on Capitol Hill. Starting on Tuesday, Republicans in Congress will begin a contentious debate over proposals to roll back tax credits for low-carbon energy as they search for ways to pay for a roughly $4 trillion tax cut package favored by President Trump.

A draft bill issued on Monday by Republicans on the House Ways and Means Committee would effectively end most of the Inflation Reduction Act’s tax incentives.

A tax credit for low-carbon electricity sources like wind, solar, nuclear or geothermal power would be phased out over the next few years. Rebates for consumers to buy electric vehicles would mostly disappear by the end of 2025. Tax breaks for domestic factories that make batteries or solar panels would end by 2031 and would contain new restrictions that could make them extremely difficult to access. Incentives for producing hydrogen fuels would end this year.

While shrinking those tax credits could help Republicans save hundreds of billions of dollars, it could also cause companies to abandon plans for new nuclear reactors or battery factories. More than three-quarters of pending investments were planned in Republican-held congressional districts.

“It’s jobs, it’s tax revenue into local communities,” said Ben King, an associate director at the Rhodium Group, a research firm that tracks investment data with M.I.T.’s Center for Energy and Environmental Policy Research. “It does represent a meaningful economic change in some of these places.”

The prospect of repeal has set off a furious lobbying battle in Washington, with energy companies pleading with lawmakers to preserve the tax breaks.

At least three dozen Republicans have asked their colleagues to keep at least some tax credits to protect jobs in their districts and reduce electricity prices. But a nearly equal number of conservative House members are pushing publicly to kill the climate law altogether.

One Republican supporter is Representative Juan Ciscomani of Arizona, whose district includes an electric vehicle factory and several solar projects under construction. “When I looked initially at the energy tax credits and how they were benefiting Arizona, a lot of those projects were underway, the jobs had been created, the ball was more than rolling at that point,” Mr. Ciscomani, who was elected in 2022, said. “So it made sense for me to stand up for that.”

If the tax credits are completely rescinded, it would sharply reduce future demand for electric vehicles, batteries, solar panels and wind turbines, according to projections by the Rhodium Group. The effect would be compounded if the Trump administration moved forward as planned with undoing Biden-era tailpipe pollution limits for cars and trucks, which would have pushed automakers to sell more electric vehicles.

The uncertainty around the tax credits, as well as confusion over Mr. Trump’s tariffs, has led many low-carbon energy companies to put their investment plans on hold.

In the Midwest, Heliene, a solar manufacturer, has paused plans to build a $350 million factory that would produce cells for solar panels, which today mostly come from China. Martin Pochtaruk, Heliene’s chief executive, said it was too risky to finance the plant without clarity on whether Congress would maintain tax credits for domestic energy manufacturing.

“Right now, we see a lot of folks just waiting,” said Jason Grumet, chief executive of the American Clean Power Association, a renewable industry trade group. “People are not canceling things, but they’re also not breaking ground.”

“There is a remarkable tension right now, between probably the best fundamentals for investment in the energy sector that we’ve seen in a generation and the greatest amount of uncertainty that we’ve seen in the generation,” Mr. Grumet said. “That is a collision that all manufacturing now is trying to navigate.”

The Fate of Low-Carbon Electricity

The biggest tax breaks in the Inflation Reduction Act were for companies that build power plants that generate electricity without emitting any planet-warming greenhouse gases. Those credits were set to remain in place for many years to come, until emissions from the U.S. electricity sector fell 75 percent from 2022 levels.

So far, power companies have mainly taken advantage of these credits to propose new solar, wind and battery plants in places like Texas, California, Wyoming and Arizona, since those technologies are ready today. But the credit was designed to also spur a wave of innovative nuclear reactors, advanced geothermal plants, fusion plants, hydroelectric dams and novel types of batteries over the next decade.

The credits have already allowed developers to install solar panels on sites as varied as a carport in New Mexico and a shuttered coal plant in Illinois, said Russ Bates, chief executive of NXTGEN Clean Energy Solutions, a low-carbon energy developer.

Yet those credits may wind down much faster than many companies expected. Under the House bill issued on Monday, the full clean-electricity credits would only apply to new power plants that are “in service” by 2028, which would exclude a large array of wind, solar, nuclear and geothermal plants that are under development but won’t be completed by then. The credits would then phase down and disappear after 2031.

In South Carolina, Gov. Henry McMaster, a Republican, recently warned that, without the tax credits, efforts to expand nuclear power in his state “are dead.”

What Congress decides could reshape the nation’s power grids. If the credits are repealed entirely or severely restricted, one study found, wind and solar installations would likely fall by half over the next decade, while electric utilities would burn more fossil fuels like coal and gas instead. That could lead to higher electricity prices, since renewables are often the quickest and easiest source of power for utilities to build. Emissions would also rise.

Risks for Domestic Supply Chains

Perhaps the most visible effect of the Inflation Reduction Act so far has been a surge of domestic manufacturing. Four years ago, the United States had hardly any capacity to build solar panels, wind turbines or lithium-ion batteries. Most of that happened in China and elsewhere.

That’s quickly changing.

The law gave hefty tax breaks to wind and solar developers if they used components made in the United States. It also doled out additional tax credits for domestic clean-energy factories. In addition, billions of dollars in funding from a 2021 bipartisan infrastructure law allowed the Biden administration to support domestic supply chains, including mining for key elements like lithium.

That has had a major effect in places like Dalton, Ga., once known as the nation’s carpet manufacturing capital. In 2023, Hanwha Qcells, a Korean solar company, announced it would invest $2.5 billion to expand its factory in Dalton, creating the largest solar panel manufacturing facility in the Western Hemisphere.

“It’s a newer technology for us, but it’s one we’re excited to be making right here,” said Jason Mock, president of the Greater Dalton Chamber of Commerce.

If all the solar factories currently planned in the United States get built, the country would have the capacity to produce three times as many solar panel modules as were installed in 2024, according to an analysis by the Rhodium Group and M.I.T. Yet the solar industry is still reliant on countries like China for many underlying components, such as the polysilicon wafers.

It’s a similar story for batteries: The number of U.S. factories that are currently planned would build enough lithium-ion modules and cells to satisfy future demand for electric vehicles, although progress has been much slower in building up domestic supplies of raw ingredients like graphite and lithium.

It’s not clear if those supply chains will survive. In the House draft bill, Republicans proposed sharp new restrictions on the use of materials from China, which could make it difficult for many U.S. factories to qualify.

The bill would also end by next year a $7,500 consumer tax credit for electric cars that is available for buyers of cars largely produced in the United States. That would reduce demand for electric vehicles, which would in turn affect a broad swath of battery manufacturing and demand for critical minerals like lithium.

At least 24 factories have been set up in the United States to produce electric cars that qualify for the credit, including a Ford plant making plug-in hybrids in Louisville, Ky., and a General Motors battery plant in Ohio, according to a study from Atlas Public Policy, a research firm.

Near Savannah, Ga., Hyundai invested in a $7.5 billion factory to build some of its most popular electric vehicle models, which qualify for the consumer credit. Local politicians, who spent years persuading Hyundai to come to the site, are concerned about possible changes to law.

“It’s difficult for a company to invest somewhere and then conditions change,” said Bert Brantley, chief executive of the Savannah Area Chamber of Commerce. “So our take is that some consistency is helpful for companies as they make large investments.”

Still, Mr. Brantley said he hoped that Georgia could continue to be a leader in electric vehicle production regardless of what happens to the tax credits. “This is a long-term play, we hope to be at it for a long time,” he said.

Other Energy Technologies in Limbo

Over the past three years, the federal government has also been supporting a broad array of emerging energy technologies that are less mature, including low-carbon hydrogen fuels that could power trucks, new processes to make cement and steel without emissions, as well as technologies to pull carbon dioxide out of the air.

Many of these projects could potentially qualify for tax breaks in the Inflation Reduction Act. Others have been supported by billions of dollars in grants and loans from the Department of Energy.

In Western Minnesota, DG Fuels plans a $5 billion plant to produce aviation fuel from agricultural waste. In Indiana, Heidelberg Materials, a cement maker, wants to capture the carbon dioxide it emits and bury it underground. In Louisiana, a company is planning to make a low-carbon ammonia that could be used for fertilizer.

New Orleans, which has become a major hub for exporting natural gas, has seen a boom in new industries like carbon capture and hydrogen that could help cut emissions in the future. “We’re becoming very diversified,” said Michael Hecht, president of Greater New Orleans, Inc., the economic development agency for southeast Louisiana.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/05/12/multimedia/00cli-energyinvest-wind2-zptm/00cli-energyinvest-wind2-zptm-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg,N,,2025-05-13 15:12:13.178292

Last Updated on:

The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), enacted in 2022, marked a seismic shift in U.S. industrial and energy policy, promising clarity and stability to a previously fragmented clean energy landscape. It introduced comprehensive, decade-spanning incentives designed to catalyze investments across renewables, hydrogen hubs, electric vehicles, and domestic manufacturing. Almost immediately, this legislation became a magnet for institutional capital and strategic corporate commitments, prompting over $200 billion in clean energy and manufacturing investments in its first year alone. America appeared to be reclaiming its position as a global clean-energy leader, driven by a coherent industrial policy that many international investors applauded and enthusiastically embraced.

Perhaps most importantly, it was the return of big industrial policy, in fact almost any industrial policy, to the United States. The concept went out of favor in the country, and its intellectual close follower the United Kingdom, much more so than in the rest of the West. Europe certainly didn’t have the coherence and focus of China, but it did manage to have an industrial policy, hence the reason it still has heavy industry and commercial ship building. But with the IRA, the United States was back in the industrial policy game, and focused on the economy of the future.

But now, barely two years into this promising trajectory, a House Republican bill just released dubbed “The One Big, Beautiful Bill“—Trump and company appear to be going out of their way to make governance look silly—is going to hobble movement. The proposed rollback will dismantle key IRA provisions, including clean energy production and investment tax credits, domestic manufacturing incentives, and targeted hydrogen production support, ending some programs far ahead of schedule. This abrupt about-face in regulatory direction sends a jarring signal to global markets. After promoting a compelling narrative of stable, long-term incentives, the U.S. is doubling down on being fragmented and unreliable, effectively advertising itself as closed for business to international investors who had previously been attracted by precisely the kind of policy consistency the IRA initially represented.

The implications for institutional investors globally are significant. For instance, the proposed elimination of transferable clean energy credits would abruptly terminate a mechanism widely seen as revolutionary for project financing. Transferability had expanded market access, simplifying financial structures, attracting more diverse pools of capital, and opening pathways for non-traditional investors—such as foreign institutions—to participate directly in American clean energy projects. Now, under the proposed legislation, these opportunities vanish, reinstating barriers that limit investment primarily to large, tax-equity-driven domestic investors. International institutional capital, which recently found the U.S. clean energy market compellingly attractive, will be pushed back onto the sidelines and will redirect toward other regions offering more predictable returns and consistent regulatory frameworks.

This policy reversal also critically undermines recent progress in domestic clean manufacturing, a major growth segment, especially in red states and counties. Prior to the IRA, the U.S. had largely ceded all dominance in solar, battery production, electric vehicles, and advanced materials to China and other Asian economies. With IRA incentives, however, American manufacturing of solar panels, wind turbines, battery cells, and critical minerals gained traction, starting to reverse decades of offshoring. Billions of dollars flowed into regions such as Georgia, Ohio, and Michigan, promising a manufacturing renaissance anchored in clean technology and the energy transition. But with the new House proposal shortening or outright ending crucial manufacturing credits, projects that once looked profitable and secure now face existential threats. This sudden evaporation of incentives jeopardizes factory expansions and new plant developments, with multinational corporations likely to relocate and reconsider future investments in jurisdictions perceived as more stable, notably the European Union or Canada.

Hydrogen hubs and associated infrastructure are equally vulnerable, which is a mixed blessing. As I noted a month ago when especially blue state hubs were rumored to be on the chopping block, cutting hydrogen for energy plays would accidentally be the right thing to do, and it appears that’s being followed through on. The IRA established a generous production tax credit for clean hydrogen intended to help build a robust domestic hydrogen economy, essential for decarbonizing hard-to-electrify sectors like refining and ammonia. Numerous regional hydrogen hubs attracted major global players eager to capitalize on these incentives, driving planning and early-stage development across the nation. But the House Republican bill dramatically truncates these incentives, imposing unrealistic construction deadlines that effectively render the hydrogen credit irrelevant to most developers. Institutional investors, who typically seek stable policy environments, will likely respond by halting or reducing their exposure to the emerging U.S. hydrogen market. Instead, they’ll redirect their capital towards European and Asian markets that offer clearer, longer-term commitments and strategic certainty.

Unsurprisingly, carbon capture incentives, including those related to blue hydrogen, aren’t touched in the bill. While Trump’s steroid-addled stampede through the economic China shop has added significantly to the structural headwinds facing the United State’s oil and gas industry, he can’t be directly removing their subsidies after all. On a similar note, electric vehicle incentives are on the chopping block too.

This new American uncertainty is especially advantageous to global competitors, primarily China and the European Union. China, already dominant in renewable energy supply chains, battery production, and electric vehicles, stands to gain significantly from U.S. flailing. The country continues to offer clear, consistent, and strategically aligned policies that attract long-term investment, reinforcing its supply-chain dominance. European policymakers, similarly, have responded to the IRA not by retreating but by solidifying their own incentives under the European Green Deal and various national strategies. Countries like Germany and France are aggressively courting clean technology investors through predictable regulatory frameworks, tax incentives, and public funding. As U.S. regulatory unpredictability grows, the EU emerges as a natural beneficiary, becoming an increasingly attractive destination for investment that might have otherwise flowed to the United States.

Of course, this further eliminates any pretense that the United States is a leader or even a reliable partner on the most important file of the 21st Century, climate change. Europe and China will continue to lead on this crucial file as the United States further isolates itself.

From an innovation standpoint, the abrupt legislative shifts disrupts U.S. attempts at technological leadership in new clean technologies. IRA incentives created a predictable market environment that accelerated innovation in emerging technologies like advanced geothermal, long-duration energy storage, and next-generation battery chemistries. While I don’t think much of advanced geothermal electrical generation, and said so at length in a dozen-part series recently, advanced drilling techniques are strongly advantageous for geothermal heat exchange and seasonal heat storage. Venture capital firms and global investors began allocating funds to early-stage U.S. companies, banking on stable, policy-backed demand growth. As these incentives abruptly vanish, the U.S. will lose its position as a destination for innovative capital in the space, ceding technological breakthroughs and intellectual property generation to more stable policy environments, particularly in Europe and East Asia. The innovation ecosystem in the U.S., once considered unmatched, faces potentially significant setbacks, undermining decades of competitive advantages carefully nurtured through previous policy and funding programs.

This is on top of the Trump Administration’s attacks on research and academia, attacks most analogous to Mao’s Cultural Revolution, ironically. The gutting of secondary grants for lab space and administration, the ideological attacks on climate science, health research and similar areas, and the attacks on foreign residents of all non-white hues are leading to brain drain instead of brain gain. The global conveyor belt of hungry, innovative, intelligent talent to the United States is stopping. The One Big, Beautiful Bill is just another nail in the country’s innovation coffin.

Ultimately, the tabled legislative rollback represents far more than just a domestic policy change. It signifies the breakdown of a coherent U.S. industrial strategy that, for a brief but impactful period, successfully combined climate ambition with economic opportunity. It reintroduces uncertainty precisely when certainty is most critical, signaling to global investors that America is neither reliable nor consistent in its strategic priorities. The clear message now resonating throughout global financial centers is that the U.S. investment market, previously seen as open and inviting, is volatile and unpredictable, prompting a long-term exodus of capital and talent to regions offering clearer and more stable frameworks.

The bill isn’t law yet. But investors will already be reading it and changing their investment strategies. Chinese and European policy strategists will be rubbing their hands with glee, and contacting global institutional investors to invite them to divert money to welcoming economies with stable policies.

The House Republican bill represents not merely a shift in policy but a profound strategic miscalculation. It closes American access to many of the global capital and innovation flows necessary to compete economically in the 21st century. Meanwhile, China and Europe stand ready to capitalize on these mistakes, capturing the investment, manufacturing opportunities, and technological breakthroughs that were within America’s grasp, undoubtedly reshaping the global economic and geopolitical landscape for decades to come.",https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/ChatGPT-Image-May-12-2025-07_35_36-PM.png,N,,2025-05-13 15:12:17.414384

Climate, energy and transport are now split apart, and climate and energy are relegated to conservative-led ministries where many climate researchers fear they won't get enough attention.","VIENNA – Vienna's city hall, with its stone towers and gargoyles, often reminds visitors of another neo-gothic building, says city council member Nina Abrahamczik.

""Children who come with the school classes are like, 'Oh, it looks like Hogwarts,'"" she says.

But Abrahamczik, who heads the city's climate and environment committee, says this building has something Hogwarts doesn't: solar panels.

When Vienna began requiring all new buildings and building extensions add solar panels two years ago, Abrahamczik says they also felt it was important to add panels to city hall. The panels aren't visible from the ground, so the city can maintain the building's 19th century look, while cutting climate pollution. ""That's something where also our job as a role model comes into play,"" Abrahamczik says. ""We have to show how it's possible.""

Vienna takes its job as a climate role model seriously. In addition to mandating solar panels and energy-efficient buildings, Vienna is now heating thousands of homes with geothermal energy instead of planet-heating natural gas. It's building massive heat pumps. It's investing in new infrastructure to help adapt to heat waves and floods. And this spring Vienna passed a historic climate law, outlining a plan to get its climate pollution down to zero by 2040.

Vienna is home to one in five Austrians, and its climate action is increasingly important for the country's climate leadership, says Gernot Wagner, Columbia University climate economist and an advisor for Vienna's Mayoral Advisory council. Austria's newly elected federal government is deprioritizing climate action, Wagner says. In the new coalition government, the ecological Green Party is out, and conservatives, who are less interested in climate action, have gained power. ""At the federal level things are taking a step back, climate is taking a back seat,"" he says.

Meanwhile Vienna is forging ahead, and its experience as a climate leader holds lessons and inspiration for cities around the world.

Cities — including those in the U.S. — can make a big dent in cutting climate pollution based on their policy actions, says Nathan Hultman, director of the Center for Global Sustainability at the University of Maryland. That's because 70 percent of global carbon dioxide emissions come from cities.

Hultman's group found city and state climate policies could drive down U.S. emissions 54 to 62% below 2005 levels by 2035, even with federal inaction or reversals of climate action. ""From a pure numbers standpoint,"" Hultman says, ""actions that are taken in cities can in fact have a real impact.""

Cities play a big role in cutting fossil fuels

At the edge of an old airfield in eastern Vienna there's a 15-story tall drilling rig where men in hardhats move seven-inch metal pipes. The clangs of the pipes echo as they fall to the ground.

Bernhard Novotny, project director for the site, says the pipes are for geothermal wells. The wells stretch miles underground to extract boiling water that lies under the earth's subsurface. That hot water will heat 20,000 Viennese homes by 2028, Novotny says.

Vienna has a goal of getting its buildings completely off gas by 2040. The city got off Russian gas in January, Wien Energie spokesman Alexander Hoor, says. Getting off gas ties into the city's climate goals because gas infrastructure leaks methane, a potent greenhouse gas, and gas also releases carbon dioxide when burned. To get off gas, Vienna plans to heat buildings using heat pumps, capturing gases from waste, burning waste, and geothermal wells.

These geothermal wells are a joint-venture between Vienna-based energy company, OMV, and Vienna's municipal heating and electrical utility, Wien Energie. Being a municipal utility means the company has a stable climate strategy linked to Vienna's, says Rusbeh Rezania, Wien Energie's head of decarbonized heating. That consistency has given Wien Energie flexibility to experiment with new combinations of energy sources, Resania says. ""We are not like a private company in which the strategy is changing every year or every two years,"" Rezania says. "" We have time to learn, and we can have time to use the right technology.""

In addition to innovating ways to cut climate pollution, Vienna is finding new ways to hold itself accountable for its climate goals, says Jürgen Czernohorszky, executive city councilor responsible for climate and environment.

Vienna's new climate law now requires projects of the city and municipal companies to detail both the financial costs of the project and the planet-heating emissions costs. ""There's now a city climate budget which allows us to plan not only in Euro, but also in CO2,"" Czernohorszky says.

And if individuals or organizations find that Vienna isn't living up to its climate goals, the law has a remedy for that, too, says Katharina Rogenhofer, head of the Austrian climate think tank Kontext Institute for Climate Matters. If Vienna isn't taking promised climate actions, the public ""can actually go to court and then trigger those processes.""

Vienna leads as Austria slows down

Vienna is leading on climate action at a time when the new Austrian federal government is losing momentum, Wagner says. In the previous Austrian government, the Green party was in charge of a large ministry with climate, energy, and transport grouped together so it could be more effective. ""This Austrian climate super-ministry, if you will,"" Wagner says.

In Austria's new coalition government, which came into office in March, the Green party is out of power. Climate, energy and transport are now split apart, and climate and energy are relegated to conservative-led ministries where many climate researchers fear they won't get enough attention.

Things are not as bad for climate as they could have been, Czernohorszky, a member of the Social Democrats party which is part of the coalition, says. The country narrowly avoided a far-right government that promised to cut billions of dollars worth of climate measures. ""We looked into an abyss of abandoning every climate policy Austria has come up with in the last decade,"" Czernohorszky says. "" The alternative would've been rather bad for everybody.""

Stefan Gara of the liberal NEOS party, part of the coalition government, writes in an email he wants to make ""clear how important the issue of climate is to us at NEOS.""

The conservative ÖVP party, also in the coalition, didn't respond to NPR's request for comment.

Austria still has a goal of reaching ""climate neutrality"" by 2040, like Vienna. For Austria, that means both cutting fossil fuel use and trying to store carbon dioxide underground. It's unclear if the Austrian federal government will reach the goal, Wagner says. But Vienna is a different story, says Karl Steininger, professor of climate economics at the University of Graz.

""Vienna said, if [federal politicians] don't go ahead,"" Steininger says, ""We'll go ahead. And set an example that others can follow.""

Vienna offers a pollution-cutting model — to a point

Vienna offers a climate action model for cities around the world, says Andy Deacon, co-managing director of the Global Covenant of Mayors for Climate and Energy. Deacon says city governments can play a key role in cutting emissions through policies in areas like public transit, food waste, building codes and energy.

Not all of Vienna's climate actions are replicable in cities like the U.S. For example, while Vienna is able to achieve pollution reductions through its municipal electric utility, around 70 percent of Americans get their electricity from private investor-owned utilities. It can often be hard to compel private utilities to move away from fossil fuels, says David Pomerantz, the executive director of the Energy and Policy institute, a utility watchdog group.

""Who can make an investor-owned utility do something they don't want to do? It ultimately runs through public utility commissions. A lot of them are openly hostile to anything that smacks of climate stuff,"" Pomerantz says.

Still Justin Bibb, the mayor of Cleveland, says his city is forging ahead on reaching the city's goal of climate neutrality by 2050. He's focusing on areas his city does control, like energy-efficient building standards and electric vehicle infrastructure.

""The tools and levers I have, I'm gonna keep using them. And while we don't have a good partner in DC,"" Bibb says, ""as the mayor, I still gotta deliver. I still gotta lead. I still gotta get stuff done.""

Ready for when pendulum swings again

Researchers say city governments hold key tools to help their communities adapt to climate change's growing risks.

Vienna is seeing increased flooding because of climate change, including a 1,000 year flood event in September. Abrahamczik says increased flood risk is why the city is building ""sponge cities"". That's when cities incorporate things like sand, ponds and green spaces in urban design to soak up excess water and better manage flooding. Because Vienna is seeing more deadly heatwaves, it's planting trees for shade, and expanding district cooling, a climate-friendly alternative to air conditioning.

Wagner says while Austria's federal government right now isn't as active on climate change, he hopes ""the pendulum will swing back"".

In the meantime, Abrahamczik says Vienna isn't waiting around. "" Waiting for others is something we cannot afford in the time of climate crisis,"" she says. ""We are done waiting.""",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/2400x1350+0+251/resize/1400/quality/100/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fc0%2Fd0%2Fc54ca01f4e8885dda9726bafcabc%2Fdsc6419-2.jpg,N,,2025-05-13 15:13:15.906558

The plans are part of a reconciliation package being debated by Congress aimed at forcing through cuts to essential services for working families to give tax breaks to billionaires and large corporations.

The cuts being proposed would slash tax credits, some of which have been in place for 20 years, that have successfully helped consumers save money through energy efficiency upgrades and rooftop solar. Several tax credits and funding programs intended to spark the development of homegrown clean energy, including offshore wind, would be scheduled to sunset years earlier than the original dates set by Congress, leaving Maine and the nation further dependent on expensive, polluting oil and gas.

This climate realism agenda can come in left- and right-wing flavors.","Second, Donald Trump is the President of the United States. He began the process to withdraw the United States from the Paris Agreement on January 20, 2025, his first day in office in his second term. (He, of course, did this in his first term as well.) He illegally froze funding for climate programs that had passed and became law during the Biden administration, and his administration continues to ignore court orders to unfreeze these monies. He has signed numerous executive orders, including onreinvigorating clean [sic] coal,reversing state-level climate policies, “Zero-based regulatory budgeting to unleash American energy,” and “unleashing” American energy, the last of which revoked more than a dozen Biden era executive orders.

How do we address a world that is increasingly shaped by these two facts?

One attempt can be seen in the Council on Foreign Relations’s new “Climate Realism Initiative.” Its statement of purpose attempts to make climate action palatable to MAGA world by securitizing it, framing climate change as a foreign threat to Fortress America. It calls for investing in next-generation technologies and geoengineering in the hopes of leapfrogging the Chinese-led clean energy revolution that is beginning to decarbonize the world today is the best realistic way forward.

This attempt is doomed to failure. Real climate realism for the United States is to stop the destruction of American state capacity, and then to reflect and build on areas of core strength including finance and software.

CRI’s launch document does not call for the U.S. to reduce its own emissions. I’ll say that again: There is no call for the U.S. to reduce its own emissions in the essay establishing the mission and objectives of the Climate Realism Initiative. Written by Varun Sivaram, formerly chief strategy and innovation officer at wind energy developer Orsted and now the leader of the initiative, the essay proposes that four dug-in “fallacies” are getting in the way of effective policy-making: that climate change “poses a manageable risk” to the U.S.; that “the world’s climate targets are achievable;” that the clean energy transition is a “win-in for U.S. interests and climate action;” and that “reducing U.S. domestic greenhouse gas emissions can make a meaningful difference.” For Sivaram, the problem is always other places and their emissions.

He then goes on to propose three “pillars” of climate realism: the need for America to prepare for a world “blowing through climate targets;” to “invest in globally competitive clean technology industries;” and to “lead international efforts to avert truly catastrophic climate change.” How an America that does not commit to reduce its own emissions will have any credibility or standing to lead international efforts is left unstated.

Sivaram attempts to trick the reader into overlooking America’s emissions by ignoring the facts of the past and focusing instead on guesses about the future. It’s true that in 2023, China produced more than a quarter of new global carbon pollution — more than the United States, Europe, and India combined. But no country has contributed more to the blanket of pollution that traps additional heat in our atmosphere than the United States, which has emitted over 430 billion tons of CO2, or 23% of the world’s total historical emissions. Even in 2023, the U.S. remained the world’s number two carbon polluter.

Sivaram goes further than merely minimizing the U.S. role in creating our current climate problems. Indeed, he sets up climate change as a problem that foreign countries are imposing on Americans. “Foreign emissions,” he writes, “are endangering the American homeland,” and the effects of climate disasters “resemble those if China or Indonesia were to launch missiles at the United States.” There is something to this rhetoric that is powerful — we should think about climate-induced disasters as serious threats and respond to them with the kind of resources that we lavish on the military industrial complex. But the idea that it is foreign emissions that are the primary source of this danger is almost Trumpian.

The initiatives proposed in the Climate Realism launch are the initiatives of giving up. Investing in resilience and adaptation is needed in any scenario, but tying this spending on adaptation to Trumpian notions of protecting our borders reeks of discredited lifeboat ethics, which only cares to save ourselves and leaves others to suffer for our sins. And while supporting next-generation technologies is an appropriate piece of the policy puzzle, they should be like the broccoli at a steakhouse: off to the side and mostly superfluous compared with the meat and potatoes of deployment and mitigation to decarbonize today.

Sivaram may argue that there’s no point in trying to compete against China in the technologies of today when Chinese firms are so dominant and apparently willing to make these products while earning minimal profits. And from a parochial profit-maximizing perspective, there is a business case that firms should not be building lots of new solar cell manufacturing facilities given global manufacturing capacity.

But if American automotive firms simply ignore the coming EV wave and hope against hope that some breakthrough in solid state batteries will allow them to leapfrog over the firms vying today, they are fooling themselves. Electric vehicle giant BYD and world-leading battery manufacturer CATL have both announced batteries that can charge a car in five minutes. Both are also moving in the solid state space, and CATL is pushing into sodium ion batteries.

The notion that U.S. firms ought to sit out this fight for strategic reasons also ignores how China has come to dominate these sectors — by investing in today’s state of the art and pushing it forward through incremental process improvements at scale. The Thielian notion that “competition is for losers” leads to an immense amount of waste as wannabe founders search for unbreakable technological advantages. If venture capitalists want to fund such bets, I’m not going to stop them. But as a policy prescription for climate realism, it fails.

The final gambit of the essay is to advocate for America-controlled geoengineering. This, too, is an area where research may be needed. But regardless, it is the kind of emergency backup plan that you hope that you never need to use, rather than something that should be central to anyone’s policy strategy. Trump is currently decimating American capacity to research hard problems, whether they be cancer or vaccines or social science or anything else, so it is difficult to imagine that this administration is likely to spend real resources to investigate geoengineering.

The Climate Realism Initiative pitches itself as “bipartisan.” But where is the MAGA coalition that supports this? Even simple spending on adaptation and resilience seems unlikely to find much of a political home given the Trump administration’s drastic cuts in weather and disaster forecasting. Sivaram even mentions the need to balance the budget as part of climate realism, which must be a sick joke. For all of the fanfare over cuts to the federal government under Trump, the budget deficit is the last thing that they care about. Tax cuts remain the coin of the realm, with the House budgetary guidelines expanding the deficit by $2.8 trillion. Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency, similarly, has a distorted notion of government efficiency, ignoring the returns to government investments and gutting the tax collection capacity of the IRS.

The Biden administration had plans — “all of the above” energy among them — that were coherent, if not necessarily the most appealing to the world. They were based on the idea that a resilient climate coalition in the U.S. required more than just deploying Chinese-made products.

CRI seems to want to engage instead in a fantasy conversation where anti-Chinese nationalism can unite Americans to fight climate change — an all-form, no-content negative sum realpolitik that does little to address the real, compelling, and deeply political questions that the climate crisis poses.

Alternative visions are possible. The American economy is services based. Americans and American firms will inevitably make some of the hardware components of the energy transition, but the opportunities that play to our strengths are mostly on the software side.

It is critical to remember that the clean technologies that power the energy transition are categorically different from the fossil fuels that the world burned (and still burns) for energy. We do not require a constant stream of these technologies to operate our economy. The solar panels on your roof or in the field outside of town still generate electricity even if you can’t buy new ones because of a trade war. Same with wind turbines. In fact, renewables are a source of energy security because the generation happens from domestic natural resources — the sun and wind. Yet smart thinkers like Jake Sullivan fall into the trap of treating “dependence” on Chinese renewable technologies as analogous to European dependence on Russian natural gas.

Even China’s ban on U.S.-bound rare earth exports won’t make much of a dent. Despite the name, rare earths aren’t that rare, and while China does dominate their processing, it’s a tiny industry; in making fun of the “critical” nature of rare earths, Bloomberg opinion writer Javier Blas noted that the total imports of rare earths from China to the U.S. in 2024 was $170 million, or about 0.03% of U.S.-China trade. That being said, the major concern is if supplies fall to zero then major processes that require tiny amounts of rare earths (like Yttria and turbine construction) could be completely halted with serious fallout.

The American government should carefully choose what industries it would like to support. Commodity factories that have little-to-no profits, like solar cells, seem unattractive. There are many more jobs in installing solar than there are in manufacturing it, after all.

On the other hand, sectors with a much larger existing domestic industry, such as wind turbines and especially automobiles, should not be left to wither. But rather than a tariff wall to protect them, the U.S. auto firms should be encouraged to partner with the leading firms — even if those firms are Chinese — to build joint ventures in the American heartland, so that they and the American people can participate in the EV shift.

But the core of real climate realism for the United States is not about new factories. It’s about playing to our strengths. The United States has the best finance and technology sectors in the world, and these should be used to help decarbonize at home and around the world. This climate realism agenda can come in left- and right-wing flavors. A leftist vision is likely state-led with designs, guides, and plans, while the right-wing vision relies on markets.

Take Texas. On May 7, 2020, the Texas grid set a record with 21.4 gigawatts of renewable electricity generation. Just five years later, that figure hit 41.9 gigawatts. Solar and batteries have exploded on the grid, with capacity hitting 30 gigawatts and 10 gigawatts respectively. They have grown so rapidly because of the state’s market-based system, with its low barriers to interconnection and competitive dynamics.

Of course, not every location is blessed with as much wind, sun, and open space as Texas. But there’s no reason why its market systems can’t be a template for other states and countries. This, too, is industrial policy — not just the factory workers building the technologies or even the installers deploying them. There is lots of work for the lawyers and power systems engineers and advertisers and policy analysts and bankers and consultants, as well.

Yet instead of seizing these real chances to push climate action forward at home and abroad, the Trump administration is eviscerating American state capacity, the rule of law, and global trust in the government. The whipsawing of Trump’s tariffs generates uncertainty that undercuts investment. The destruction of government support for scientific exploration hits at the next-generation moonshots that Sivaram is so enamored of, as well as the institutions that educate our citizens and train our workforce. Trump’s blatant disregard for court orders and his regime’s cronyism undercut belief in the rule of law, and that investments will rise and fall based on their economics rather than how close they are to the President.

But it’s not just Trump. Texas legislators are on the verge of destroying the golden goose of cheap electricity through rapid renewables deployment out of a desire to own the libs. Despite the huge economic returns to rural communities that have seen so much utility-scale expansion in the state, some Republican legislators are pushing bills that would stick their fingers into the electricity market pie, undercutting the renewable expansion and mandating expensive gas expansion.

The Trump business coalition, which was mostly vibes in the first place, is fracturing. There are conflicting interests between those who want to fight inflation and those who see low oil prices as a problem. Pushing down oil prices by pressuring OPEC+ to pump more crude and depressing global economic outlooks with the trade war (Degrowth Donald!) has hurt the frackers in Texas. Ironically, one way to lower their costs is to electrify operations, so they don’t have to rely on expensive diesel.

Climate change is here, but so is Donald Trump. Ignoring either one is a recipe for disaster as they both create destructive whirlwinds and traffic in uncertainty. The real solution to both is mitigation — doing everything possible today to stop as much of the damage as possible before it happens.

The decision will leave minimum U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods at 30%, down from 145%, and China’s tariffs on American imports at 10%, down from 125%, CNN notes. Monday’s news saw Dow futures rise by 2% and S&P 500 futures rise by almost 3%. But while some have hailed the result of the talks as a “best case scenario,” fears about rising costs have already caused companies including Rivian and First Solar to lower deliverable estimates and expected revenue for the year. China and the U.S. additionally agreed to a “mechanism to continue discussions about economic and trade relations,” while Bessent said both sides are committed to “more balance in trade” going forward.

2. CATL seeks to raise $4 billion in Hong Kong listing

Chinese electric-vehicle battery giant Contemporary Amperex Technology announced in a filing Monday that it aims to raise as much as $4 billion in its Hong Kong Stock Exchange listing this year. CATL EV batteries were installed in more than 17 million vehicles last year, including Teslas, meaning it was represented in one in every three EVs in 2024, The Wall Street Journal reports; however, earlier this year, the company was given a “scarlet letter” in the U.S. when the Pentagon added it to a blacklist of “Chinese military companies.”

CATL is reportedly offering around 118 million shares, with a final price to be announced on or around May 19, and trading starting on May 20. The offer price will be no more than 263 Hong Kong dollars per share, or about $33.81. Its share offering would “more than double proceeds in Hong Kong’s market for listings this year,” per Bloomberg.

3. States sue Trump administration, arguing there is no ‘energy emergency’

Fifteen states filed a lawsuit on Friday arguing that President Trump’s declaration of an “energy emergency” is “unsupported.” As we’ve covered at Heatmap, Trump’s January 20 executive order directed federal agencies to “use all necessary resources to build critical infrastructure” to expedite extraction of coal, natural gas, and oil, including by bypassing or shortening environmental protections and reviews. The states, however, argued in their filing that “U.S. energy production is at an all-time high and growing,” and that “the invocation of the nation’s emergency authorities … is reserved for actual emergencies — not changes in presidential policy.”

The lawsuit was brought by Democratic attorneys general in Washington, California, Arizona, Connecticut, Illinois, Massachusetts, Maine, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, New Jersey, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, and Wisconsin. Washington State’s Office of the Attorney General said in a press release that, in addition to being unlawful, Trump’s energy emergency order notably “excludes wind, solar, and batteries — among the cheapest and cleanest modern energy sources that exist today.”

Equinor has threatened to cancel its Empire Wind project if the Trump administration does not immediately lift its stop-work order,E&E News reports. The 54-turbine offshore wind project, located south of New York’s Long Island, is fully permitted and has been under construction since 2024. Equinor, however, said that the Interior Department’s order in April to “halt all construction … until further review of information that suggests the Biden administration rushed through its approval without sufficient analysis” is costing the company $50 million a week, which it called “unsustainable.” Equinor also took issue with the characterization of its permitting process as “rushed,” noting that it took the company eight years to receive its federal permits, and that its lease was obtained during the first Trump administration.

As my colleagues Emily Pontecorvo and Jael Holzman have reported, canceling the project would be a huge blow to New York State’s clean energy goals, since Empire Wind was seen as a path away from its dependence on fossil fuels. “The state’s target of deploying 9 gigawatts of offshore wind by 2035 was already going to be nearly impossible due to Trump’s pause on new leases and permits,” they wrote. “Without the 800 megawatt Empire Wind project, New York will only have 1 gigawatt in the pipeline.”

5. PJM warns hotter-than-normal summer could lead to historic supply shortages

PJM Interconnection issued a warning on Friday that anticipated above-average temperatures this summer “could trigger [grid] supply shortages for the first time,” Bloomberg reports. PJM — the country’s largest regional transmission organization, operating a 13-state market across much of the East Coast and Midwest — said that for most of the summer, it anticipates a peak of just over 154 gigawatts, “for which PJM should have adequate reserves to maintain reliability.” But 2025 also marks the first time PJM has assessed that an extreme scenario could put it over its generation capacity, with a potential peak demand as high as 166 gigawatts, beating 2006’s record of 165.6 gigawatts. “Under such circumstances, PJM would call on contracted demand response programs,” which pay customers to reduce their electricity use on an emergency basis, “to meet its required reserve needs,” the company said.

The award honors farmers and forestland owners who go above and beyond in their management of soil health, water quality, and wildlife habitat on working land.

Named in honor of renowned conservationist Aldo Leopold, this award recognizes landowners who inspire others with their dedication to environmental improvement. In his influential 1949 book, A Sand County Almanac, Leopold advocated for “a land ethic,” an ethical relationship between people and the land they own and manage.

Sand County Foundation and national sponsor American Farmland Trust present the Leopold Conservation Award to private landowners in 28 states. In Kentucky, the $10,000 award is presented with Kentucky Agricultural Council and the Kentucky Association of Conservation Districts.

The finalists are:

Steve and Melanie Kelley: The Kelleys utilize no-till practices and plant cover crops to conserve soil and moisture. This enhances the soil for the next year’s crop. Their farm located near Bardwell in Carlisle County features 48 acres of filter strips, and 17 acres of grassed waterways and rock chutes to mitigate erosion. Solar panels produce electricity and provide the farm with another source of income. Wildlife and pollinator-friendly habitat has been established on 800 acres.

Dr. James “Greg” Kuhns: Dr. Kuhn’s Crooked Creek Farm in Bullitt County has prioritized agronomy, timber, land, and water management practices. Milkweed patches have been preserved and expanded to serve as breeding sites for endangered Monarch butterflies. Riparian buffers have been established to reduce erosion and protect water quality. Forest pools were built for wildlife. Fescue fields were converted to native grasses to support haying and provide wildlife habitat.

John and Randy Seymour of Upton in Hart County: The Seymours have actively managed their woodland for timber and wildlife habitat since the 1970s. Overtime they converted a tobacco, hay, and beef cattle farm near Upton in Hart County into native seed production. In addition to a 100-acre savanna restoration they efforts protect a large cave that hosts thousands of bats in their breeding season. By creating the Roundstone Native Seed Company they have helped others to establish native grass and wildflower habitats.

Kentucky landowners were encouraged to apply, or be nominated, for the award. An independent panel of Kentucky agricultural and conservation leaders reviewed the applications.

The award recipient will be recognized at the Kentucky Association of Conservation Districts’ Annual Convention in August. Last year’s award recipient was Michael W. Wilson of Lawrenceburg in Anderson County.

“The Kentucky Agricultural Council is excited to recognize private landowners across the state who practice exceptional environmental stewardship,” said Tod Griffin, Kentucky Agricultural Council Chair. “Farmers are innovators in conservation and protecting our natural resources to ensure food and fiber production for future generations of Kentuckians.”

“KACD and conservation districts promote the sound management of all our natural resources, and we are excited to recognize these well deserving landowners in Kentucky,” said Allan Bryant, Kentucky Association of Conservation Districts President. “The Association and conservation districts work daily to assist private landowners in their efforts to adopt sound soil and water conservation practices on their land that benefit us all.”

“These award finalists are examples of how Aldo Leopold’s land ethic is alive and well today,” said Kevin McAleese, Sand County Foundation President and CEO. “Their dedication to conservation is both an inspiration to their peers as well as a reminder to all how important thoughtful agriculture is to clean water, healthy soil, and wildlife habitat.”

“As the national sponsor for Sand County Foundation’s Leopold Conservation Award, American Farmland Trust celebrates the hard work and dedication of the award finalists,” said John Piotti, AFT President and CEO. “At AFT we believe that exemplary conservation involves the land itself, the practices employed on the land, and the people who steward it. This award recognizes the integral role of all three.”

The Public Utility Commission of Texas (PUCT) is currently reviewing the extension of $5.38 billion worth of low-interest loans to companies planning nearly 10 gigawatts (GW) of new natural gas-fired capacity in a bid to boost generation capacity for ERCOT.

The Texas Energy Fund was established in 2023 by the Texas Legislature through Senate Bill 2627, the Powering Texas Forward Act, to provide grants and loans to finance the construction, maintenance, modernization, and operation of electric facilities in Texas.

Last year, ERCOT forecast that electricity demand in the Lone Star State could double in six years, necessitating the urgent addition of more generation capacity.

However, eight of the projects initially proposed have already been withdrawn or canceled, while Texas regulators have also denied state funding due to applicants failing to meet due diligence requirements.

Engie Flexible Generation North America, a unit of France’s energy giant Engie, and Howard Power Generation have withdrawn their applications citing “supply chain constraints”, according to PUCT’s recent actions cited in a Houston Chronicle review.

Constellation Energy Generation withdrew its application citing TCEQ permit uncertainty regarding environmental impacts, while WattBridge Energy withdrew its plans because of “lower than anticipated returns”.

The development highlights the difficulties energy firms face in planning and building new gas-fired capacity even in the state of Texas, even under pro-fossil fuel President Donald Trump.

The Texas Energy Fund and its program to back new gas powered generation are “falling apart”, Citigroup said earlier this year.

The need for new capacity in Texas is urgent to meet growing power demand and keep electricity supply reliable, following the collapse of the ERCOT grid during a winter storm in 2021 and several close calls in peak summer since then.

The Detroit automaker says it will begin commercial production of lithium manganese-rich cells at an Ultium Cells plants in Ohio or Tennessee. Ultium Cells is a joint venture between GM and LG Energy Solution.

The announcement comes amid pressure from President Donald Trump to increase U.S. manufacturing, particularly in the auto industry, by levying high import taxes. Increased production also would reduce reliance on low-cost batteries made in China.

GM touted its new battery cells as cheaper to make than the nickel-rich cells currently in use but with similar range thanks to a higher-percentage of less-expensive manganese. GM said trucks using the cells will have a 400-mile range.

“We’re pioneering manganese-rich battery technology to unlock premium range and performance at an affordable cost, especially in electric trucks,” Kurt Kelty, vice president of battery, propulsion and sustainability at GM, said in a statement.

Part of GM's long-term strategy for an all-electric fleet by 2035 includes making less-expensive battery cells and ramping up production.

The market for EVs is slowly growing, but most U.S. drivers still prefer gas-powered vehicles. Range anxiety, expensive price tags and limited infrastructure to support charging stations remain barriers for customers.

GM last month scaled back production to match dragging EV sales at its Factory Zero Detroit-Hamtramck Assembly Center, which makes all-electric SUVs and trucks.

Still, total GM sales of EVs nearly doubled in the first three months of 2025 compared to the same time last year, with a little less than 32,000 vehicles sold this year versus more than 16,000 sold in 2024.

Opening statements in the case, which was filed just days after the dam in Gladwin and Midland counties failed and led to catastrophic flooding, began Monday, according to online records for Michigan's Court of Claims.

The state had filed a motion seeking for summary disposition, but an attorney representing several victims of the destructive flood, said Judge James Redford denied the motion.

“We are pleased the court has denied the state’s motion for summary disposition, allowing this case to move forward to trial and ensuring that the victims of the Edenville Dam disaster will finally have their day in court,"" said attorney Kevin Carlson of Royal Oak-based Pitt, McGehee, Palmer, Bonanni & Rivers, in a statement.

On May 19, 2020, after several days of heavy rainfall in the area, Wixom Lake, the lake impounded behind the Edenville Dam, reached about 5.5 feet above normal pool level. The east embankment of the dam gave way, nearly emptying Wixom Lake and flooding downstream dams and communities.

The water released from the east embankment overwhelmed the Sanford Dam downstream, devastating the Village of Sanford, flooding buildings, causing $21 million in damage to the fishery and about $91 million to the freshwater mussel ecosystem, according to a filing by the state in a previous case related to the incident. More than 10,000 residents were forced to evacuate.

In October 2023, a federal judge found that Boyce Hydro, the private company that owned the dam, was responsible for the failure. Attorney General Dana Nessel filed suit against the company earlier that year, claiming Boyce officials were aware of a key defect in the structure about 10 years earlier but failed to make repairs or notify the state as required.

A month later, the same judge ruled that Boyce was liable for nearly $120 million in environmental damage caused when the dam collapsed.

As recently as four months before the dam failure, the state found the structure didn’t meet flooding capacity standards at the state level and was preparing a final report when the dam failed.

Boyce Hydro LLC and Boyce Hydro Power LLC filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in August 2020 in federal bankruptcy court in the Eastern District of Michigan.

The ongoing Court of Claims lawsuit seeks relief against the Michigan Department of Natural Resources and the Department of Environment, Great Lakes, and Energy, alleging the state failed to take action to ensure safety as the dam grew increasingly dangerous.

""These plaintiffs have suffered unimaginable losses, and we are committed to holding the parties responsible accountable for their actions,"" Carlson said in his statement. ""For five years, the State of Michigan knew about the dam’s dangerous condition but refused to act in the best interests of the public and instead made the dam more dangerous by authorizing higher water levels. We look forward to pressing forward with this case and ensuring justice for those impacted by this catastrophic failure.”

EGLE and Michigan DNR officials did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Online court records do not list a date for the next hearing in the case.

(NASDAQ: PLUG), a global leader in comprehensive hydrogen solutions, today announced its financial results and operational milestones for the first quarter ended March 31, 2025. The Company delivered improvements in cash flow and continued execution across its electrolyzer, hydrogen generation, and fuel cell businesses, while advancing its leadership in global decarbonization and U.S. energy security.

First-Quarter Results

Revenue: Plug reported revenue of $133.7 million for Q1 2025 versus $120.3 million in Q1 2024. Sales in Q1 2025 represent growing electrolyzer deliveries, continued demand in material handling, and ongoing deployments in our cryogenic platform.

Gross Margin: The Company reported gross margin loss of -55% in Q1 2025 versus a gross margin loss of -132% in Q1 2024. The improvement year over year reflects ongoing optimization of internal supply chains, continued cost reductions, price increases, and progress in leveraging the Company’s hydrogen platform.

Cash Flow: Net cash used in operating activities plus net cash used in investing activities declined to $152.1 million in Q1 2025 versus $288.3 million in Q1 2024. Plug ended the quarter with $295.8 million in unrestricted cash. The launch of Project Quantum Leap in Q1 2025—targeting over $200 million in annualized savings—combined with anticipated sales growth, strategic pricing actions, disciplined inventory and capex management, and increasing leverage of Plug’s hydrogen production platform, positions the Company for continued improvement in cash utilization in the near term as these initiatives take full effect across operations.

Liquidity Enhancements: In May of 2025, the Company closed the first tranche of a $525 million secured credit facility with Yorkville Advisors, drawing $210 million in aggregate principal. This financing was established commensurate with retiring $82.5 million of principal for the existing convertible debenture with Yorkville Advisors, which had approximately 55 million associated underlying shares given the conversion price and therefore this refinancing has reduced potential dilution risk. As Plug has commented previously, we anticipate no additional dilutive equity offerings this fiscal year.

In 2025, we are focused on three core areas: material handling, electrolyzers, and hydrogen supply. These are the businesses where Plug holds competitive advantages—and where we believe we can deliver the most meaningful impact for our customers and investors.

Hydrogen Generation Network Milestones

A key achievement in Q1 2025 was the commissioning of Plug’s 15-ton-per-day (TPD) hydrogen liquefaction plant in St. Gabriel, Louisiana, through its joint venture with Olin Corporation. This facility:

Increases Plug’s U.S. hydrogen production capacity to ~40 TPD;

Strengthens the Company’s ability to deliver clean, domestic hydrogen to customers such as Amazon and Walmart;

Additionally, Plug completed the transfer of approximately $30 million in energy storage Investment Tax Credits (ITCs) related to its Georgia hydrogen plant and is pursuing similar non-dilutive transactions for its Louisiana and other hydrogen equipment deployments.

Global Electrolyzer Growth and Energy Transition Impact

Plug’s GenEco electrolyzer business continues to scale rapidly, with revenue increasing 575% year over year. Other recent notable milestones include:

A signed 3 GW supply agreement with Allied Green Ammonia for a landmark green hydrogen-to-ammonia project in Australia;

Surpassing 8 GW in global Basic Engineering and Design Package (BEDP) contracts;

System deliveries to customer sites across North America, Europe, and Asia, accelerating decarbonization efforts globally.

Adoption of Fuel Cell Solutions

Plug deployed over 848 fuel cell units in Q1 2025 primarily supporting its material handling segment. Key highlights include:

A new partnership with STEF, a European leader in temperature-controlled logistics, supporting Plug’s expansion in Europe;

A $10 million Q4 2024 order structured under an ITC safe harbor investment strategy, unlocking over $200 million in future equipment opportunities, where deployments have commenced in Q1 2025;

Continued expansion of hydrogen infrastructure and fuel cell deployments with global logistics and automotive customers.

Additionally, Plug delivered cryogenic storage and refueling systems to transit agencies and fleet operators, reinforcing its presence in the hydrogen mobility sector.

2025 Outlook

Plug expects second-quarter 2025 revenue to range between $140 million and $180 million, with additional improvement from Q1 2025 in gross margin and working capital performance anticipated throughout the year. Building on the progress made in Q1 2025, the Company remains focused on leveraging its recently completed infrastructure—including the Louisiana hydrogen plant—to enhance margin performance and reduce third-party fuel costs.

Plug also plans to drive continued global adoption of its GenEco electrolyzer platform, which remains a key growth engine, while advancing financing initiatives such as investment tax credit transfers and project equity alignment to support long-term capital efficiency. Collectively, these efforts reflect Plug’s ongoing commitment to disciplined execution, profitable growth, and leadership in the global hydrogen economy.

“With new capacity online in Louisiana, accelerating adoption of our GenEco electrolyzers, and improved cash flow discipline, Plug is executing with focus and urgency,” said Andy Marsh, CEO of Plug. “We’re delivering real progress toward profitability and scaling our hydrogen ecosystem to meet growing global demand for clean energy.”

The House Energy and Commerce committee has jurisdiction over Medicaid. The committee has to cut $880 billion from the committee’s budget. Despite Speaker Johnson and President Trump stating Medicaid will not be touched, the Congressional Budget Office stated that there is no way to achieve the cut without harming the program. During markups, we expect to see committee members cut spending by implementing work requirements and shifting costs to states by reducing the federal expansion match rate or implementing per capita caps. All of these changes are counterproductive, forcing states to either reduce benefits or kick beneficiaries off the program.

The Agriculture Committee has authority over the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), and has to cut $230 billion from its budget. Proposed legislative text reduces the size of benefits, implements harsher work requirements, and shifts costs to states. All of these changes would be devastating for children and families receiving SNAP.

The Ways and Means Committee handles federal tax policy, and the committee is planning to extend the expiring provisions of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (P.L. 115–97). This extension would give the top 0.1% an additional $314,000 a year in tax breaks and cost trillions of dollars.

Repealing clean energy tax credits will raise costs for families and houses of worship

Members of the Ways and Means Committee hope to repeal or cut parts of the clean energy tax credits of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA, P.L. 117-169) in order to fund tax cuts for the wealthy and deportation and detention efforts.

Passed in 2022, the IRA created new and expanded existing historically bipartisan clean energy tax credits, incentivizing businesses, houses of worship, and individuals to invest in clean energy projects. Cutting these credits threatens to increase household electricity bills by around 10% on average in 2035. Quaker meeting houses across the nation have used clean energy tax credits through the “direct pay” provision, which allows certain tax-exempt entities to directly receive rebates from the Internal Revenue Service.

Because of their widespread economic benefits, 21 House Republicans and 4 Senate Republicans have come out in support of the credits. However, on May 1, 38 House Republicans issued a letter urging a full repeal of the IRA. As the Ways and Means committee members consider their fate, we urge Congress to build upon, not tear down, these wildly successful tax credits and continue to champion environmental stewardship.

Cuts to Social Programs to Put Kids in Cages

The House Judiciary and Homeland Security Committees marked up bills– totaling $81 and $69 billion respectively– toward the largest investment in immigration enforcement in U.S. history. The social costs exceed any dollar amount.

Since January, unchecked enforcement has forced toddlers to appear in immigration court without an attorney and separated families without due process. Agents have kidnapped international students and imprisoned them with insufficient medical care, inadequate food, cold temperatures, and without religious accommodations. U.S. citizen children, including multiple with terminal illnesses, have been held in family detention, denied access to counsel, and removed without medication. The reconciliation bill will continue these disappearances and drive up profits for private detention corporations.

Despite endless hours for deliberation during the House markups, the House majority refused to take up amendments to prevent the government from removing sick U.S. citizen children; protect Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) holders; or prevent the U.S. from sending funds to dictators to imprison deportees. A political show of concern for unaccompanied children over the last year failed to produce sheltering or legal representation for vulnerable minors navigating an intimidating system alone. To add more harm, the bill punishes poor people fleeing persecution through fee increases such as a burdensome $1,000 asylum application fee.

Conclusion

Congress must denounce unconscionable cuts to health care, food assistance, and clean energy initiatives that will bankroll tax cuts for the wealthy and incite fear in the immigrant communities we belong to and love. We instead urge lawmakers to instead fund programs that honor that of God in every individual. This means investments that meet the needs of families, advance the transition to clean energy, and provide orderly and humane pathways for people to immigrate to the United States.

The House Ways and Means Committee bill, if passed, would hamper these goals,” said Long.
A recent report from ACORE showed that the current tax credits have added US$115 billion in clean energy investments last year, while supporting over 3.5 million jobs.
It is possible to phase out incentives for clean energy investment, production, and manufacturing without harming American consumers or businesses — and we stand ready to help.","Released yesterday (12 May), the Committee is expected to vote on the proposed bill today. If it passes the Committee Vote, the bill will then need to pass a vote by the House before going to the Senate for approval.

“The accelerated phase-out would likely trigger a surge of solar installations as homeowners rush to complete their projects before the end of 2025,” said clean energy comparison company EnergySage. According to its data, a typical residential solar panel system costing US$20,552 after the Investment Tax Credit (ITC) could incur an additional US$8,978 cost after the deadline passes.

Section 25D is not the only provision that the Committee aims to end sooner than initially intended for US residential owners. A second amendment from the Reconciliation Bill would move forward the end of the advanced manufacturing production credits (Section 45X) by one year from the end of 2032 to the end of 2031.

A separate proposal will aim to terminate the new energy efficient home credit by the end of 2025, or 2026 if construction began before 12 May 2025. On top of all of these proposals, the bill aims to terminate a number of clean energy and vehicle credits earlier than the dates initially set, in most cases the end of 2032.

Moreover, Sections 112008 and 112009 – dubbed “the Phase-out and restrictions on clean electricity production credit” and “Phase-out and restrictions on clean electricity investment credit” – aim to restrict access to the credit for certain prohibited foreign entities. This includes the use of materials from foreign entities for a facility that begins construction a year after the enactment of the bill, or if the taxpayer is a foreign entity.

Similar to Sections 25D and 45X, the bill also aims to change the phase out dates for the production credits.

“There is a 20% credit reduction for facilities placed in service in calendar year 2029, a 40% reduction for facilities placed in service in calendar year 2030, a 60% reduction for facilities placed in service in calendar year 2031 and zero credit available after December 31, 2031,” reads the bill. “Transferability is repealed for facilities where construction begins two years after the date of enactment of this bill.”

The provisions from the Reconciliation Bill can be accessed here.

‘This is not the time for disruption,’ says ACP

Reaction from the industry to the released text of the Reconciliation Bill has been widely negative, with both the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) and The American Clean Power Association (ACP) claiming it will destroy jobs and force American factories to close.

“If adopted, the proposed language will raise energy costs for American consumers, force American factories to shut their doors and threaten American jobs,” said Jason Grumet, CEO of ACP.

Abigail Ross Hopper, president and CEO of added: “This legislation will cause hundreds of American factories to close, eliminate tens of thousands of jobs, force electric bills to skyrocket for everyone, weaken the reliability of our electric grid and eliminate our capacity to compete with China.”

Hopper added that the legislation would affect red-state economies, with more than “75% of at-risk factories and investments concentrated in these communities.”

“While American businesses are demanding more energy to compete against our adversaries and consumers are turning to clean energy to hedge against rising electricity prices, these proposals will undermine our nation’s efforts to achieve president Trump’s American energy dominance agenda,” Hopper said

The president and CEO of industry non-profit the American Council on Renewable Energy (ACORE), Ray Long, said that the US need to build the equivalent of 12 New York Cities’ worth of new power by 2030 in order to remain competitive with China in the artificial intelligence race, and that this legislation would hamper that goal.

“Energy dominance means a secure, affordable, reliable energy supply that serves as the basis for our national security, technological leadership, and economic prosperity. Achieving this is a bipartisan goal. The House Ways and Means Committee bill, if passed, would hamper these goals,” said Long.

A recent report from ACORE showed that the current tax credits have added US$115 billion in clean energy investments last year, while supporting over 3.5 million jobs. However, ACORE also released a survey of investors and developers in March 2025 where the majority of respondents said the uncertainty over tax credits could cause investors and developers – by 84% and 73%, respectively – to decrease their activity in renewable energy.

Grumet said: “With energy demand surging, this is not the time for disruption. It is possible to phase out incentives for clean energy investment, production, and manufacturing without harming American consumers or businesses — and we stand ready to help.

“As the legislation moves through the process, we will work with lawmakers to ensure that the final product achieves necessary cost savings while maintaining investment certainty, energy reliability, economic growth and global competitiveness.”",https://www.pv-tech.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Residential-solar.jpg,N,,2025-05-13 14:36:41.611884

The U.S. needs Canada’s lumber Howard Lutnick, the U.S. commerce secretary, is investigating whether lumber imports are a threat to national security.
The United States imports 85 percent of its potash from Canada, which is the world’s largest exporter of the minerals.
Mr. Trump s described his “love” for Canada and desire for continued friendship.","President Trump had one big question on his mind as Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney headed to Washington last week.

“I very much want to work with him, but cannot understand one simple TRUTH,” Mr. Trump said in a social media post, reiterating several of ways he believes Canada benefits unfairly from its trade relationship with United States.

The president also repeated his incorrect claim that the United States is “subsidizing” Canada to the tune of $200 billion, alluding to the country’s trade deficit with Canada, which is the value of what the United States imports minus its exports.

In fact, the trade deficit last year was $63.3 billion, according to U.S. data. And if Canada’s energy exports were stripped out, it turns into a trade surplus.

For Mr. Trump, it all boils down to one point: does the United States need Canada?

Mr. Trump’s resounding answer is no, and he has imposed tariffs on many Canadian goods.

“We don’t need their Cars, we don’t need their Energy, we don’t need their Lumber, we don’t need ANYTHING they have, other than their friendship,” he said in the social media post.

But industry groups and government say differently.

The U.S. needs Canada to make cars

The auto industries in Canada and the United States have become highly interconnected over the last three decades — especially between Detroit, Mich., and Windsor, Ontario, the busiest commercial crossing along the border — as the countries knocked down trade barriers.

So intertwined are the supply chains that car parts can cross the border as many as eight times during the manufacturing process. That has made it difficult to define what constitutes an auto import.

The U.S. needs Canada’s energy

The United States is the world’s top oil producer, but many of its refineries rely partially on heavy crude oil, a variety that Canada specializes in extracting. Retooling U.S. refineries to eliminate the need for crude oil would cost billions and companies are not willing to make those investments, especially because of the uncertainty over Mr. Trump’s trade policies.

Sixty percent of the heavy crude oil imported to the United States in 2022 came from Canada, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.

Besides oil, Canada, in 2023, supplied nearly 100 percent of the natural gas and 85 percent of the electrical energy imported by the United States, according to Canada’s energy regulator. Canadian electricity is especially important to powering New England.

Canada also more provides more than one-fourth of the uranium the United States imports to run nuclear reactors, federal data shows, a higher share than any other nation.

The U.S. needs Canada’s lumber

Howard Lutnick, the U.S. commerce secretary, is investigating whether lumber imports are a threat to national security.

In 2021, the most recent year figures were available, the United States purchased $28 billion worth of lumber from Canada, representing nearly half of lumber imports.

American industry groups have estimated that the tariffs on lumber that Mr. Trump has introduced will increase home costs by an average of about $9,000.

U.S. farmers need Canada to plant their crops

Farmers kicking off the planting season this year were reminded of the U.S. agriculture industry’s reliance on Canadian imports of key chemical ingredients used in fertilizer, like the potassium-rich minerals called potash.

The United States imports 85 percent of its potash from Canada, which is the world’s largest exporter of the minerals.

But Mr. Trump’s tariffs on Canada will make potash more expensive for farmers to import and the increases could be passed down to grocery store shoppers, according to the Fertilizer Institute, a U.S. industry group. The next biggest global exporters of potash are Russia and Belarus.

Trump says the U.S. needs Canada’s friendship. Many Canadians say forget about it.

The usually warm relationship between the two countries is in tatters, with Canada invoking a defensive tactic used in hockey — “elbows up” — as its posture against Mr. Trump’s economic attacks and threats to make Canada a U.S. state.

Canadians have taken to boycotting American-made products and shirking summer travel to the United States, with the number of flights scheduled to the country from Canada down by 21 percent, a New York Times analysis shows.

A quirky symbol of the countries’ special bond has also suffered. The United States has restricted Canadian access to the Haskell Free Library and Opera House, a historic site that straddles the border between Quebec and Vermont. American officials said the move was necessary to stop “drug traffickers and smugglers.”

Despite the frosty relations, Mr. Carney and Mr. Trump had a cordial exchange in front of news media cameras in the Oval Office last week.

Mr. Trump s described his “love” for Canada and desire for continued friendship. Still he repeated his desire for Canada to become part of the United States.

Mr. Carney quickly pushed back to make clear that his country was not for sale.

Mr. Trump did not relent: “Never say never!”",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/05/09/multimedia/00int-canada-trump-explainer-tqvm/00int-canada-trump-explainer-tqvm-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-05-13 14:42:02.724035

How to make a wine barrel Just as Kentucky is the epicenter of bourbon, so too is it the headquarters of bourbon barrel production.
This has been a particular blow to American bourbon and cooperages, conjoined industries already imperiled by changing consumer tastes.
Used bourbon barrel prices have dropped nearly 50% in the past six to eight months.
It takes at least two to four years to go from log to freshly emptied bourbon barrel, often longer,” said Albrecht.","No one at Tucson’s Hamilton Distillers knows exactly what wood the cognac barrels holding whiskey are made of.

“Probably Spanish oak?” one employee ventures a guess. The age of the barrels is also a question mark. No one working here is old enough to vouch for that; the distillery believes they are anywhere from 100 to 125 years old, which is old in the grand scheme of barrels’ lifespans, but not unusual. But it can say with certainty, using records of its vintages, that these barrels are on their fifth use – at least.

In the alcohol industry, when ageing liquor can easily take decades, the vessels that house them can also become more covetable over the years. In an age of disposable materials and dire news of plastics polluting our environment, reused wooden barrels exist in stark contrast. The lives of barrels are long, shockingly sustainable and currently imperiled by trade war.

Many circumnavigate the globe and end their days in distilleries in remote corners of the world, originating in the forests of Hungary and moving from mountain towns in Canada to distilleries in the Caribbean and Mexico. At Hamilton, new American oak barrels hold fresh distillate, alongside the dinosaurs: French cognac barrels that show their age. They’re gray, stained and a little warped.

Laws Whiskey House in Denver, Colorado, considers itself a “terroir-forward distillery”, the distillery’s brand manager, Casey Rizzo, told me over the phone. Terroir, the flavor that emerges from a specific environment, comes from both grain and barrels. “White American oak has a lot of natural wood sugars and natural vanillin. When you’re charring a barrel, you’re caramelizing it like a creme brulee. A barrel pulls whiskey in and then pushes it back out. Whiskey goes into the barrel clear and comes out with all that color, and vanilla and caramel flavors.”

Rizzo added: “We think of barrels as teabags. It gets used first for bourbon, like the first steep of a teabag. You get a lot of color and flavor from the barrel quickly. If you use the barrel again, it’ll take longer to impart, so maybe it’s used for scotch, which sits and ages longer. You mute the barrel’s flavors along the way.”

Modern distilling relies on increasingly sophisticated technologies for monitoring conditions in cellars and fermentation, but distilleries still depend on lo-tech barrels to impart flavor and color to their products. Barrels consist only of wood and steel hardware, held together with no glue or nails. Remove its rings and give it a smack, and a barrel can unfurl like a chocolate orange. At some distilleries, employees still rotate their barrels by hand, a practice called clocking (rolling barrels according to a clock’s face). “This ensures proper exposure to the varying temperatures within the warehouse and adds consistency from barrel to barrel,” said Frank Krockenberger, director of hospitality for Loretto, Kentucky’s Star Hill Farm, home of the Maker’s Mark distillery.

It was one stop on my journey to follow how barrels – so important for the beverage industry – are made. As a food and beverage writer, much of my work dredges up stories about monumental food waste, and the struggle to repurpose materials. But when it came to barrels, I found practices that were surprisingly sustainable, of wood being reused for centuries, and forests being protected.

How to make a wine barrel

Just as Kentucky is the epicenter of bourbon, so too is it the headquarters of bourbon barrel production. An hour away from Maker’s Mark, in Louisville, I witnessed the birth of American oak barrels at the Brown-Forman Cooperage, which produced barrels exclusively for the Cooper’s Craft and Jack Daniel’s brands, at least in terms of their first use (however, the cooperage recently closed, with the Kentucky Distillers’ Association citing changing consumer trends, European Union tariffs and taxes as reasons for the industry’s decline).

Machines carved staves (the vertical planks of a barrel), and master coopers (the craftsmen who make barrels) hammered hoops around them before charring them on a rotating belt with enormous bursts of flame. The scene blended with modern efficiency and ancient technology (the Roman historian Pliny the Elder wrote about coopers near the Alps who stored their wine in hooped wooden vessels, and there is archaeological evidence of barrels from ancient Egypt). The business had churned out barrels since 1945 and produced more than 60,000 barrels annually. But starting this year, Brown-Forman will now source barrels externally.

Oak is commonly used for barrels, due to the ease of carving it, its durability in holding liquid (it is unlikely to warp or crack) and its ability to impart desirable flavors to spirits. But not all barrels are made of oak. I encountered barrels made from chestnut, hickory and maple, as well as more exotic woods used in the ageing of specialty products (Hawaiian koa used to age sugarcane rum, and Brazilian amendoim bravo used to age cachaça, for example). I also found hybrid barrels in Patron’s distillery, their bodies composed of Brown-Forman American oak staves, and their heads (the ends of the barrels) made of French limousin oak.

The barrel-making process is zero-waste and astonishingly fast. It takes a cooper about 45 seconds to raise a single barrel. Sawdust is collected and used for horse and cow bedding. These barrels are frequently shipped flat, so “we don’t ship air”, one cooper told me, and are reassembled at their destinations.

I found Brown-Forman’s trademark “B” stamp on dozens of rusted hoop rivets, 1,900 miles away in the cellars and storage rooms of Don Fulano in Jalisco, Mexico. In the ageing rooms of a different tequila distillery, Volcán, I found barrels containing decade-old tequila held together by rivets stamped with Bs. The trained eye can spot other signs of where a barrel came from, said Greg Roshkowski, the vice-president of wood planning, procurement and processing at Brown-Forman, Jack Daniel’s and Cooper’s Craft’s parent company, wrote via email. He said some experts “will be able to spot Brown-Forman barrels by other various characteristics, such as the head placement, chime (the beveled edge of a barrel, where the staves meet), locations of hoops, etc. It’s certainly fun to walk through other countries and their warehouses and see 50- to 60-year-old Brown-Forman barrels ageing all sorts of spirits from rum to scotch and Irish whiskey.”

The international use of barrels is part and parcel of the global liquor industry. Large conglomerates like LVMH, Brown-Forman and Suntory have multiple spirits brands in their portfolios, and barrels make their rounds internally. A Kentucky-made barrel might end up in Scotland to age scotch because Brown-Forman owns both the Jack Daniel’s and Glendronach brands.

Given the barrels’ long lives and travels, makers are investing in regenerative cultivation of their raw materials. Though mature white oak trees are plentiful, the species could be on the decline, primarily due to a “lack of active management that creates the conditions needed for oak seedlings to thrive”, according to the US Department of Agriculture’s Forest Service. Maker’s Mark, part of Suntory, partnered with the University of Kentucky in a genome-mapping project of the American white oak to preserve the species. The partnership has also led to the establishment of the world’s largest repository of American white oak trees. It’s 24 acres with nearly 10,000 trees representing more than 400 varieties of white oak, among other sustainability initiatives.

The barrel-flavor equation

Sustainability isn’t the only concern. Manipulating flavors with barrels is a science and art. Roshkowski said: “[The barrels] are part of their recipes. You’ll see callouts for once-used Jack Daniel’s barrels from Scotland to Guyana, Russia to Malaysia and beyond. These barrels will live on for another 30 to 50 years ageing fine spirits, coffee beans, honey, soy sauce or Tabasco.”

Lucas Assis, an agave and sugarcane spirit educator, said: “Fortaleza used charanda [a rare Mexican sugarcane rum] barrels for their winter blend [last year],” he said. “Barrels tell a story. It doesn’t matter how many times you use it. French oak is still going to bring back chocolate or spiciness. Brazilian amburana wood gives a cinnamon finish.”

Distilleries that aren’t owned by large conglomerates enlist the help of a barrel broker who can source unique barrels. Mara Smith sources old pinot noir barrels from France through a broker, as they give her Inspiro tequila a rosy hue and flavors like “berries, some nuttiness, a floral [aroma] on the nose”.

Barrels foster circular economies. I see Whiskey Del Bac barrels at Tucson’s Monsoon Chocolate. “We get mesquite-smoked whiskey barrels a couple days after they’ve been drained, then we take refined chocolate, put it into nut milk bags, cut the top of the barrel off, and age the chocolate for four to six months. Cocoa butter is the carrier of aroma in chocolate, so it’s sitting there, absorbing the barrel’s aroma,” said Adam Krantz, the company’s founder.

I bite into the barrel-aged chocolate, tasting whiskey and smoke. A barrel is near the end of its life when it gets to Monsoon. Slicing it open for chocolate renders the barrel useless for anything other than furniture, planters and a rather stunning variety of items such as golf ball holders, ax targets, lazy susans and more, all under the Wine Enthusiast product umbrella.

In remote, mountainous Banff, Canada, Park Distillery sources barrels from wineries and other distilleries. “We are looking for sweet and rich flavors from the barrel. Lignin, vanillin, tannins and lactones are some of the important compounds in the wood,” said master distiller Scott Coburn. Like Tucson’s Hamilton Distillers, the operation is relatively small, and it receives assembled barrels. After about three uses for whisky (which must be aged for a minimum of three years in Canada), it uses them for barrel-aged gin and cocktails. Then the barrels are passed on to breweries for barrel-aged beer. Once spent, the barrels meet their end in Banff’s restaurants as decoration.

Rizzo outlines a Laws Whiskey barrel’s typical lifespan. “We age our Four Grain Bourbon and send those used bourbon barrels [after four to 10 years] to a local apiary, Bee Squared, in Berthoud, Colorado. They age their honey in those used barrels for 90 days to produce a glorious local barrel-aged honey. We then get those barrels back and put more bourbon into them to make a natural honey-aged bourbon [which takes a year and a half of ageing]. One went to our friends at Lady Justice Brewing, who aged a honey bock beer in the honey barrel. Once that was finished in six months to two years, they put malted barley grain inside the barrel for another six months to two years to flavor the grain to produce another beer. And then the barrel is made into furniture.” These barrels had seven lives.

But barrels’ travels are in danger

Recent tariffs are making the very aspect of manufacturing barrels, distilling alcohol and selling its finished product more expensive. In American winemaking, particularly in California, French oak barrels will be affected by the EU’s retaliatory tariffs. Since barrels are essentially an ingredient in any given type of alcohol’s recipe, a winemaker would not be able to easily switch out a type of wood they have used previously for something available domestically.

Since tariffs are duties placed on imported goods, used barrels costs are spiking, whether they are entering the US or departing it (due to retaliatory tariffs).

American spirits companies saw the effect that potential tariffs had on Canada immediately, as their products were pulled off Canadian shelves in February, in response to the 25% tariffs on Canadian goods that the Trump administration had put in place then. This has been a particular blow to American bourbon and cooperages, conjoined industries already imperiled by changing consumer tastes.

“Even when barrels aren’t directly targeted by tariffs, they’re deeply tied to the global trade of the products they help create – bourbon, wine, tequila, rum. Tariffs on those goods ripple down to the barrel market. Producers are scaling back how much they’re ageing and how far ahead they’re willing to invest, and that’s hit the barrel world hard. Used bourbon barrel prices have dropped nearly 50% in the past six to eight months. “Some days, it feels like they’re falling by the hour,” said Matt Albrecht, owner of River Drive Cooperage in Buxton, Maine, who also sells and sources used barrels.

“It’s a perfect storm,” said Albrecht. American producers are now rushing to empty barrels and bottle their spirits ahead of expected tariffs and are flooding the market. “Meanwhile, international buyers, many of whom were paying top dollar for barrels just last year, are holding off, betting that prices will drop even further if the US economy stumbles. That’s led to a standoff: supply is high, demand is frozen and prices are volatile.”

The consequences of this current disruption in the barrel economy might not be seen for years. “What’s on the market today started as trees harvested years ago. It takes at least two to four years to go from log to freshly emptied bourbon barrel, often longer,” said Albrecht.

After the 2008 recession, there was a barrel shortage in 2012, which meant there was four-year lag in the barrel supply chain. One can only hope that these emblems of sustainable, circular economies may continue to age gracefully, their journeys unhindered by tariffs.",https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3ac9b4dc1f1a1bc4ddfe0039d2ce9e90d3590eab/360_0_3598_2879/master/3598.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=6301a532e14dfd45e621b2b79a78db5f,N,,2025-05-13 14:45:05.878858

On the one hand, there's no daylight between Netanyahu and — Bibi and President Trump, in the sense that President Trump has not criticized Netanyahu's plans for Gaza, at least not publicly.","Amna Nawaz:

Tonight, the final living American hostage held by Hamas is free. Edan Alexander entered Israel from Gaza earlier today in a deal made directly between Hamas and the United States.

His release came as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu went further than before on his plans for Gaza, calling for its reoccupation, and as President Trump left today for his four-day trip to the region.

Nick Schifrin begins with the hostage release and an emotional reunion in Israel.

Nick Schifrin:

Five hundred and eighty-four days. Edan Alexander is free in his mother's arms, the Israeli-American soldier reunited with his family. He was kidnapped on October 7, 2023, when Hamas and its supporters rushed into Israel and overran a nearby military base. That day, he was just 19 years old, now 21, a native of New Jersey, where in Tenafly today, they cheered the moment they saw a native son released.

And the moment Yael Alexander got to speak to him.

Yael Alexander, Mother of Hamas Hostage: They just released a photo of you. And you look unbelievable. Wow, you look beautiful. I love you so much. I love you. And I'm going to see you very soon, very soon.

Nick Schifrin:

Tonight, Netanyahu went further, telling wounded soldiers that Israel had made a decision to reoccupy Gaza.

""Things have changed,"" he said. ""A decision has been made to go all the way. We will conquer Gaza and our security control there will be permanent.""

In Gaza, Israel has blocked all aid for two months, deepening the deprivation. Today, an umbrella organization of U.N. and international humanitarian groups declared that nearly half-a-million people face catastrophic hunger and are at risk of famine. In the next 11 months, more than 70,000 children are expected to be acutely malnourished.

The U.N. has recently run out of food, and residents say what little food is left in the markets is overpriced.

Nick Schifrin:

So he spoke to a group called the War Wounded Forum for Decisive Victory.

They confirmed Netanyahu's comments to me, but the prime minister's officials have not actually explain exactly what he meant. But the statement comes about one week after Israel said it was going to change its military strategy in Gaza, away from targeted raids in certain areas in Gaza to actually holding areas and clearing areas, and then forcibly moving the population of Northern Gaza to Southern Gaza, all of which will require tens of thousands of additional reservists that are being called up right now throughout Israel.

And all of that will bring more pain to the people of Gaza, Says Hussein Ibish of the Arab Gulf States Institutes in Washington.

Nick Schifrin:

There is absolutely concern among the officials I speak to, mainly because of three decisions that the president has made with Steve Witkoff, one of his most senior aides that you saw in the video there.

One is the release of Edan Alexander, which Witkoff led directly with Hamas over Israeli officials' heads, number two, a U.S. cease-fire with the Houthis in Yemen, despite the fact that the Houthis have not agreed to stop fire at Israel, in fact, recently fired at Israel again, and U.S. direct talks with Iran, something that was announced by President Trump while Netanyahu was actually in the Oval Office.

A U.S. official tells me this. On the one hand, there's no daylight between Netanyahu and — Bibi and President Trump, in the sense that President Trump has not criticized Netanyahu's plans for Gaza, at least not publicly. And last week, Trump met with Ron Dermer, a Netanyahu top aide for many years. That's an unusual level of coordination with a minister from a foreign government by the president.

But, on the other hand, this U.S. official says there's definitely a different approach that President Trump and Prime Minister Netanyahu has. This official says President Trump's been vocally anti-war and is trying to make deals that end the wars in Gaza and prevent a war in Iran, whereas Netanyahu has talked about military action in Gaza, in Lebanon, and floated the idea of military action in Iran.

And the official warns me that, as long as this war in Gaza continues, the more likely it is that President Trump will see Netanyahu as unwilling to compromise and make the kinds of deals that are clearly the priority of President Trump going into this Middle East trip, which, notably, by the way, does not include a stop in Israel.

Nick Schifrin:

Yes, we call them deliverables in the news business, right?

President Trump is on the way to Saudi Arabia right now, where a senior official there tells me that the deals announced tomorrow during this trip will include artificial intelligence, space technology, and energy, including a reference of future U.S. support for civilian nuclear energy in Saudi Arabia.

But much of the trip, this official and other officials tell me, will be focused on business deals. And these will be billed as enormous investments in the U.S. and into the U.S. economy. And that approach, according to analysts I speak to, works for Gulf leaders. They need U.S. military assistance. They need U.S. engagement in the region.

And they see flattering Trump, an investment in America, as the best way to do that. And they welcome how Trump administration officials have taken a more realist approach to the region, says Jon Alterman of the Center for Strategic and International Studies.

Jon Alterman, Center for Strategic and International Studies: They don't talk about democratization. They don't talk about human rights. They don't talk about humanitarian assistance. They don't talk about all sorts of things that a lot of regional governments feel are naive and weaken them in terms of security in the name of rights.

And this more transactional president narrows the area of interest of the United States in ways they feel is in their interest and gives them something to work with.",https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/static/2025/05/HostageReleased-1024x683.jpg,N,,2025-05-13 14:42:06.239875

For example, Rivian is an American automaker whose sales are young enough that US consumers might still be able to take advantage of the tax credit, and that could also include the upcoming R2 EVs.

May 13, 2025: As expected, the House Ways and Means Committee published markups of “The One, Big, Beautiful Bill” to the public domain. As we reported below, the proposal includes ending several federal tax programs on December 31, 2025.

That includes termination of the Qualified Commercial Clean Vehicles Credit and the Alternative Fuel Vehicle Refueling Credit, as well as the Energy Efficient Home Improvement Credit.

Lastly, the proposal includes a termination of the Clean Vehicle Credit at the end of this year. However, as originally reported below, there is an exception for automakers who have not sold at least 200,000 vehicles between December 31, 2009 and December 31, 2025.

That means Rivian EVs could very well still qualify for federal tax credits through December 31, 2026.

The past two years, federal tax credits for EV sales through the Inflation Reduction Act have done wonders for US adoption, helping give consumers the last little push they needed to go all-electric with at least one vehicle in their home.

It was great while it lasted.

These days, the current administration has its sights set on a delusional idea of “success” from the past, trying to breathe new life into dying industries like coal and, yes, combustion vehicles. EV adoption was never going to happen overnight, but recent discussions among the GOP stating it is likely to kill the federal EV tax credit is disheartening news.

We’ve already long-surpassed “critical mass” in the US adoption process, so it’s a fair wager that EVs are here to stay and will continue increasing their market presence. While most makes and models are likely to be disqualified from federal EV tax credits after 2025 (only about 20 or so currently qualify these days), some proposed exceptions in place will allow credits to continue for American companies like Rivian, for example.

Proposal states Rivian EVs could qualify for tax credits after 2025

According to Reddit user u/FiveDollarHoller, they are a lobbyist in the midst of Washington’s discussions to repeal the federal EV tax credit. According to the post, the US House Ways and Means Committee will finalize its tax title this week.

According to proposal shared by reliable source close to the lobbyist, a slew of credits will be eliminated on December 31, 2025, including the following:

Used EV credit

Clean Vehicle Credit

Qualified Commercial Clean Vehicle Credit

Alernative Fuel Vehicle Refueling Proprty Credit

We share the same sentiment as the lobbyist in that this proposal remains fluid and discussions are ongoing, so the details of these plans could have already changed by now and most likely will change before everything is approved through the necessary government channels.

One interesting tidbit in the current proposal is an exception within the $7,500 Clean Vehicle Credit for OEMs that have not sold 200,000 vehicles by December 31, 2025. If that exception makes its way into the final legislature, EVs from Rivian, including the R1S and R1T, could still qualify for tax credits.

Better still, Rivian recently shared that it remains on track to begin scaled production and deliveries of its second flagship model, the R2, in 2026, meaning customers of that BEV could also qualify for federal tax credits.

At the end of 2024, Rivian had sold 51,579 compared to 50,122 a year prior and 20,332 deliveries in 2022. Per its recent Q1 2025 quarterly report, the American automaker targets 40,000 to 46,000 deliveries in 2025. By those numbers, that puts Rivian around approximately 168,033 total deliveries if it hits the high end of its 2025 outlook.

As such, Rivian’s numbers would fall below the 200,000 sales threshold outlined in the current proposal. Again, this is hearsay at most until we get a legitimate proposal publicized by the Capitol. Still, it’s a noteworthy potential perk for companies like Rivian if it comes to fruition. It could also incentivize more US consumers to purchase a Rivian since it could be one of the only OEMs that still qualify (along with Lucid, probably).

Per the IRS, despite being built in Normal, Illinois, the Rivian R1 models are not listed as qualified BEVs for the $7,500 tax credit. We will have to see how this all plays out in the coming days and months.

Per the Reddit post, the complete text of the EV tax credit repeal proposal is supposed to be shared today (Monday) at 2 PM. Once a bona fide proposal is in place, it will still need to be approved by the House Ways and Means Committee, then the House, followed by the Senate (which may be a lot more challenging to get approved).

We will monitor this process closely, which will likely last well into 2025, and will report on what EVs (if any) may still qualify for federal tax credits next year and whether that will include Rivian. Regardless, if you’re pondering the idea of purchasing a BEV (Rivian or not), you should try to take delivery before the end of the year because the federal EV tax credit doesn’t appear long for this world.",https://i0.wp.com/electrek.co/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/05/Rivian-tax-credit-R2.jpg?resize=1200%2C628&quality=82&strip=all&ssl=1,N,,2025-05-13 14:33:58.858511

To lead the world in artificial intelligence (AI) and—as Adam Smith envisioned—enable people to earn a better living with greater ease, America must learn to build big things again without breaking people’s backs with rising costs—and we’ve got to do it with a sense of urgency. To succeed, we need stable energy policy, lasting permitting reform, and a sustained focus on cutting bills for American families.

COMMENTARY

The need to act is apparent. Demand is growing faster than we can build new generation from any source. U.S. load growth is projected to increase by up to 128 GW by 2029, while backlogs for new gas turbines are stretching out to four years or more, and the average interconnection queue for new generation takes more than five years to complete. The pressure on America’s ability to generate and deliver enough power isn’t just coming from AI and industry. The increasing impact and frequency of extreme weather is straining regional power grids with residential heating and cooling loads, with two more major winter storms and one intensive heatwave pushing system limits since Winter Storm Elliot forced rolling power outages across the Southeast on Christmas Eve in 2022.

At the same time that we need more energy, we also need more affordable energy, so hardworking families can keep the lights on without skimping on groceries. Families and seniors living on less in rural counties are particularly stressed. They already pay an average of 20% of their entire household income for electricity, not because rates are high, but because rural housing is in such a poor state of disrepair. Add upward pressure on rates from the cost of new generation, aggravated by the complexity tax of America’s antiquated permitting system, and residential energy bills will continue to rise if we don’t correct our course.

Market Stability

Against this backdrop, the House of Representatives is considering a full repeal-replace of the Inflation Reduction Act, which, despite its name, set an energy and industrial policy framework that the market has been executing against for three years. While course corrections are needed and necessary in a dynamic market, and the sharp upward shift in demand projections requires a legislative response, rapid reversals in policy direction are out of sync with an industry that undertakes resource planning in 10- to 30-year cycles. Even community-scale solar and storage projects like those we build at Groundswell take two or more years to complete and can barely keep up with the shifting sands in Washington.

Moreover, new potential energy projects representing more than double our current installed capacity are currently standing in line in interconnection queues. Repealing investment incentives that have driven large-scale project development since 2022 would kill too much of this in-process capacity while the market retools around new rules. Moreover, pre-commercial technologies including advanced nuclear, which use some of the same incentives as solar, have longer development timelines and an even greater need for market stability to reach commercial scale. If we are truly committed to an American-made nuclear renaissance, we need to sustain critical existing policies, including tax credits aligned with U.S. manufacturing, so we can finish building what we’ve started while Congress charts new paths to American AI leadership.

Lasting Permitting Reform

Whether it’s new nuclear or a weatherization program, large and small energy projects face a morass of federal, state, and local permitting and paperwork that isn’t just red tape, it’s a complexity tax that increases project delivery costs and timelines beyond our ability as a society to pay. As a nation, we will not be able to keep up with energy demand, or realize the kitchen table benefits of energy efficiency or AI-driven economic development, without lasting legislative permitting reform.

As a senior advisor at the Office of Management and Budget, I led President Obama’s permitting accelerator and cut timelines in half for $350 billion in infrastructure projects. While we made big gains, the work revealed the need for a more fundamental legislative modernization. More than a dozen federal agencies issue a host of permits defined in laws that have been layered on top of one another over more than a hundred years. Many of these permits have conflicting statutory requirements that make it impossible—and even illegal—for agencies to rally around a shared project timeline or goal. Only Congress can consolidate federal permits and eliminate the complexity tax so America can start building again, but it has yet to pass a bill.

Cutting Household Bills

We are currently producing—and paying for—the energy we need plus the energy we waste. Prioritizing energy efficiency, as mundane as it sounds, cuts waste and has the additional benefit of confronting the affordable housing crisis through the same measures. As with infrastructure permitting, however, there is an inherent complexity tax of duplication and red tape that limits the number of families who realize savings from federally funded energy efficiency programs. The most recent fiscal year (FY) 2026 federal budget proposal would eliminate them almost entirely, effectively increasing household energy bills and raising the risk of shut-offs for people who are already struggling to keep up. The greater opportunity, however, is to sustain the federal commitment to energy efficiency while undertaking the hard work of optimizing program design so that federal funds can be easily layered with utility and corporate investments to get more bill savings, and more available capacity, for the money.

Local solar projects paired with energy storage also have a role delivering bill savings where siting new capacity on the distribution system avoids more costly infrastructure investments. Initiatives like Groundswell’s Southeast Rural Power program and the City of Baltimore’s Community Resiliency Hubs show how municipalities, utilities, and nonprofits are working together to strengthen the local grid and reduce bills. Local programs can scale savings nationally. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA’s) Solar for All program, for example, is enabling 60 teams across every state to build new local solar capacity that will cut electricity bills by a minimum of 20% for nearly one million American families.

Working Together

We’re short on power and families are facing risings costs. We need to expand capacity and lower people’s bills. There are projects and programs in the pipeline that will help achieve these goals if we sustain a stable market environment, and keep investing in efficiency and local projects to keep energy affordable while we transform the permitting process to support the new technologies and American industries that will help make life better and easier for the next generation.

It won’t be simple, particularly in a cultural environment that increasingly rewards outrage, but it’s important to do hard things the right way. Remaining mired in conflict that whipsaws the market each election cycle costs precious time.

Known for its diversity and beauty, an agate stone is a form of quartz. It can be translucent and in some cases completely transparent.

Rockhounding, a cooler name for rock collecting, is a favorite pastime for visitors and residents who live in northern Michigan.

Here's what to know about the agate gemstone and where you can find it in Michigan:

How are agate stones formed?

Agates are formed when gas bubbles in lava leave a hole in the ""vesicle"" in the rock, according to the Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes, and Energy.

Silica (silicon dioxide) solutions flow into the hole in the host rock and fill it up over time, making the bands, the news release says.

Different chemicals in the solution cause the bands to be different colors.

How do I know my stone is an agate?

""Agates are sometimes hard to identify, even for the experts,"" Mary Ann St. Antoine, a senior environmental quality analyst in the Marquette District Office of EGLE, said in a news release.

Antoine, who said she found her favorite agate in Grand Marais, encourages collectors not to get discouraged when the outside of the rock has a dull, waxy luster.

Agates are often translucent, so collectors should hold them up to the light to see if they transmit some light.

When is the best time to look for an agate?

EGLE says the best time for Michiganders to look for agates is after a storm, when the waves have washed up new rocks.

Where can I find agate stones in Michigan?

The stones can be found across multiple locations in Michigan including:

Whitefish Point

Muskallonge State Park

Grand Marais Beach

Bay Furnace Beach

Pebble Beach

Agate Beach

Misery Bay

Black River Harbor Beach

Eagle River Beach

Techniques for identifying rocks

These identification techniques, according to the EGLE, can help rock hunters determine the type of rocks they have:

Appearance

Color(also color of a ""streak"" if it can be made by swiping the specimen on a piece of porcelain, creating a powder)

Luster (shiny, dull, glassy)

Fluorescence (shines under UV light)

Unique properties

Shape/structure (crystal form or amorphous?)

Breakage (how does it break apart, cleavage or fracture?)

Density/specific gravity (can get an idea by ""hefting"" to see if it's heavy for its size)

Unique properties

Magnetism

Smell

Radioactivity

What is a Yooperlite?

Yooperlite is a fluorescent rock that glows in the dark under ultraviolet light. It became known when a U.P. resident discovered them in 2017, according to a news release.

The republican proposal instead channels that money to wealthy elites, increasing the deficit by trillions of dollars along the way.

Republicans in Congress released their 389-page proposal today and, as expected, it includes several provisions to eliminate popular clean energy credits which were driving a boost in American manufacturing.

The credits were largely established under President Biden as part of the Inflation Reduction Act, which raised hundreds of billions of dollars through tax enforcement on wealthy individuals and corporations and channeled that into energy efficiency credits for American families.

We’ve covered how families could save thousands of dollars on upgrades to lower their energy costs through these credits.

But these credits aren’t just money-saving for Americans, they also work to boost American manufacturing.

Due to various provisions in the bill, particularly around the $7,500 EV tax credit which was limited to cars that undergo final assembly in North America. While loopholes exist, nevertheless the bill resulted in a massive expansion of American manufacturing, driving hundreds of billions of dollars of investment and creating hundreds of thousands of jobs.

But now, republicans in Congress are trying to roll much of that progress back.

Here’s a list of the bill’s various effects related to clean air and energy (via the BlueGreen Alliance):

Attaching restrictions to clean energy and manufacturing tax credits that would make them unusable in practical terms while also “sunsetting” those tax credits early, a move that research suggests will increase costs for American families;

Repealing the Clean Vehicle Tax Credits;

Repealing the Clean Hydrogen Tax Credit;

Clawing back unspent funds for air quality monitoring in schools, clean manufacturing, state and community energy programs, and electric grid upgrades;

Defunding and delaying the Methane Emissions Reduction Program (MERP), which reduces pollution and protects the health of workers and communities;

Clawing back all unspent Inflation Reduction Act funds, including many provisions that would have lowered energy bills, created jobs, and reduced pollution; and

Attacks on many additional Inflation Reduction Act programs and initiatives.

You can perhaps see a pattern in these effects: they’re primarily targeted towards increasing costs for regular American families who were taking advantage of these tax credits, and towards programs that would keep you and your children healthier.

Previous analyses show how repealing these tax credits would lead to increased electricity prices for all Americans.

It should not be any surprise to anyone that has been paying attention that republicans want to poison you and raise your costs, but some people apparently still need more examples, so here we are.

In particular, the new tax proposal eliminates the US EV tax credit which had driven so much of that investment due to its domestic manufacturing provision (though there are some small carveouts). Not only does that inflate the cost of the best vehicles available today for Americans, it also takes away one of the incentives that was driving investment in US manufacturing.

We’ve warned before that a bill like this would just send more EV jobs to China, a country where nobody is “debating” over which direction the auto industry is going. Chinese automakers all know the industry is going electric, and they’re putting all of their effort into it.

This is quite a contrast with Western automakers which keep hemming and hawing, begging their governments to let them go bankrupt with anti-EV policy decisions that will only slow down their transition towards modernizing to the global EV status quo.

We’ve already seen the effects of other poor policy decisions on manufacturing, with several companies pausing or canceling plans to build manufacturing facilities in North America as a result of tariff chaos at the hands of an ignoramus. Republican districts have been hit hardest, as they were where the majority of this investment had been going.

And we’ve seen it made clear that the republicans in government responsible for protecting clean air would rather poison you and raise your fuel costs, as long as it helps the oil industry which bribed them into their position.

But then, the cherry on top of today’s tax proposal is that its cuts of these credits don’t even have a greater budgetary purpose. Not only was the Inflation Reduction Act revenue-positive – which is to say, it raised more money than it spent, thus reducing the deficit – today’s republican tax bill is revenue-negative, which is to say, it will increase the deficit.

The republican proposal raises the debt ceiling by $4 trillion, and it makes use of virtually all of that headroom, as the Joint Committee on Taxation has estimated that it will add $3.7 trillion to US debt. This is largely due to the bill’s significant giveaways to wealthy elites, with the majority of tax cuts targeted at the wealthiest households.

So the government isn’t even getting any savings out of this bill, merely channeling more money from working families to the wealthy elites that the republican party has always tried to benefit (including in other ways than the clean energy credits, like by cutting health care for the poor).

If you have a republican representative, all it takes is 3 republican Congresspeople to oppose this job-killing bill and to stand up for the well-being of their constituents.

Of course, if you have a Democratic representative, it’s also worth letting them know that you oppose the tax bill, just in case a few of them decide to jump ranks and join the republicans in harming America. We certainly hope they don’t, but it could happen.

Among the proposed cuts is the rooftop solar credit. That means you could have only until the end of this year to install rooftop solar on your home, before republicans raise the cost of doing so by an average of ~$10,000. So if you want to go solar, get started now.

After aligning himself with Trump during the election, Musk came out last year in support of ending the $7,500 consumer EV tax credit, along with all subsidies in all industries generally.

The committee also wants to phase out the advanced manufacturing tax credit by the end of 2031, one year earlier than previously planned.","It’s shaping up to be a very bad week for Tesla. The House Committee on Energy and Commerce’s draft budget proposal released Sunday night axes two of the primary avenues by which the electric vehicle giant earns regulatory credits. Congress also appears poised to vote to revoke California’s authority to implement its Zero-Emission Vehicle program by the end of the month, another key source of credits for the automaker. The sale of all regulatory credits combined earned the company a total of $595 million in the first quarter on a net income of just $409 million — that is, they represented its entire margin of profitability. On the whole, credits represented 38% of Tesla’s net income last year.

To add insult to injury, the House Ways and Means committee on Monday proposed eliminating the Inflation Reduction Act’s $7,500 consumer EV tax credit, the used EVs tax credit, and the commercial EVs tax credit by year’s end. The move comes as part of the House’s larger budget-making process. And while it will likely be months before a new budget is finalized, with Trump seeking to extend his 2017 tax cuts and Congress limited in its spending ability, much of the IRA is on the chopping block. That is bad news for clean energy companies across the spectrum, from clean hydrogen producers to wind energy companies and battery manufacturers. But as recently as a few months ago, Tesla CEO Elon Musk was sounding cavalier.

After aligning himself with Trump during the election, Musk came out last year in support of ending the $7,500 consumer EV tax credit, along with all subsidies in all industries generally. He wrote on X that taking away the EV tax credit “will only help Tesla,” presumably assuming that while his company could withstand the policy headwinds, it would hurt emergent EV competitors even more, thus paradoxically helping Tesla eliminate its competition.

While it looks like Musk will get his wish, he probably didn’t account for a small but meaningful carveout in the Ways and Means committee proposal that allows the tax credit to stand through the end of 2026 for companies that have yet to sell 200,000 EVs in their lifetime. While Tesla’s sales figures are orders of magnitude beyond this, the extension will give a boost to its smaller competitors, as well as potentially some larger automakers with fewer EV sales to their credit.

A number of other provisions in the Ways and Means committee’s proposal spell bad news for Tesla and EV automakers on the whole. These include the elimination of the $4,000 tax credit for used EVs as well as the $7,500 tax credit for commercial EVs — which leased cars also qualify for. This second credit, often referred to as the “leasing loophole,” allows consumers leasing EVs to redeem the full tax credit even if their vehicle doesn’t meet the domestic content requirements for the buyer’s credit. The committee also wants to phase out the advanced manufacturing tax credit by the end of 2031, one year earlier than previously planned. While not a huge change, this credit incentivizes the domestic production of clean energy components such as battery cells, battery modules, and solar inverters — all products Tesla is heavily invested in.

The domestic regulatory credits that comprise such an outsize portion of Tesla’s profits, meanwhile, come from a mix of state and federal standards, all of which are under attack. These are California’s Zero-Emission Vehicle program, which sets ZEV production and sales mandates, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration’s Corporate Average Fuel Economy standards, and the Environmental Protection Agency’s greenhouse gas emissions standards.

While the mandates differ in their ambition and implementation mechanisms, all three give automakers credits when they make progress toward EV production targets, fuel economy standards, or emissions standards; exceed these requirements, and automakers earn extra credits. Vehicle manufacturers can then trade those additional credits to carmakers that aren’t meeting state or federal targets. Since Tesla only makes EVs, it always earns more credits than it needs, and many automakers rely on buying these credits to comply with all three regulations.

It’s unclear as of now whether lawmakers have the authority to eliminate the federal fuel efficiency and greenhouse gas emissions standards via budget reconciliation. A Senate stricture known as the Byrd Rule mandates that provisions align with the basic purpose of the reconciliation process: implementing budgetary changes; those with only “incidental” budgetary impacts can thus be deemed “extraneous” and excluded from the final bill. It’s yet to be seen how the standards in question will be categorized. At first blush, fuel efficiency and greenhouse gas emissions standards are a stretch to meet the Byrd Rule, but that determination will take weeks, or even potentially months to play out.

What’s for sure is that California’s ZEV program cannot be eliminated through this process, as the program derives its authority from a Clean Air Act waiver, which was first granted to the state by the Environmental Protection Agency in 1967. This waiver allows California to set stricter emissions standards than those at the federal level because of the “compelling and extraordinary circumstances” the state faces when it comes to air quality in the San Joaquin Valley and Los Angeles basin. California’s latest targets — which require all model year 2035 cars sold in the state to be zero emissions — have been adopted by 11 other states, plus Washington D.C.

These increasingly ambitious goals would presumably cause the tax credits market — and thus Tesla’s profits — to heat up as well, as most automakers would struggle to fully electrify in the next 10 years. But the House voted at the beginning of the month to eliminate California’s latest EPA waiver, granted in December of last year. Now, it’s up to the Senate to decide whether they want to follow suit.

To accomplish this task, Republicans have called upon a legislative process known as the Congressional Review Act, which allows Congress to overturn newly implemented federal rules. Senate Majority Whip John Barrasso, for one, has been vocal about using the process to end California’s so-called “EV mandate,” writing in the Wall Street Journal last week that “it’s time for the Senate to finish the job.” And yet other Senate Republicans are reluctant to attempt to roll back California’s waiver. The Government Accountability Office and the Senate Parliamentarian have both determined that the regulatory allowance ought not to be subject to the Congressional Review Act as it’s an EPA “order” rather than a “rule.” Going against this guidance could thus set a precedent that gives Congress a broad ability to gut executive-level rules.

During his first term, Tesla CEO Elon Musk stood in firm opposition to efforts to roll back fuel efficiency standards. But lately, as the administration has started turning its longstanding anti-EV rhetoric into actual policy, Trump’s new best friend has been relatively quiet. Tesla’s stock is down about 25% since Trump took office, as investors worry that Musk’s political preoccupations have kept him from focusing on his company’s performance.

On May 10, 1950, Congress established one of the world’s best value, highest impact, and, frankly, coolest science agencies. The NSF finances federal research in just about anything that’s not health (the National Institutes of Health do that).

It’s been a bit of a rough birthday party. Elon Musk’s “DOGE” has been cutting research funding right and left, including at least 13 grants at MSU at the last count. The director of NSF just resigned as the Trump administration announced plans to dissolve its 37 specialist divisions. Trump’s budget proposes cutting NSF by half. The money that would save? About $5 billion, which isn’t that far from the amount of money that the budget wants to give to SpaceX. And of course they are going especially hard after anything that implies a commitment to equity, diversity, or inclusion, whether it’s the whole NSF equity division or research on environmental justice in Detroit.

Michigan researcher’s work on air pollution and racial inequities caught in funding freeze

NSF, unlike the Trump administration, doesn’t “give” money to anybody for anything. It chooses grants for research on an enormously competitive basis – in the 2024 fiscal year, only 15.4% of NSF grant applications were funded. The government is paying universities to do the best possible research with NSF money, and it’s driving a very hard bargain. When a university, be it Harvard, Grand Valley State, or Albion College, gets a grant, it’s not getting a gift of tax money. It’s competing very hard for the right to do science that barely breaks even.

What does NSF do for us? One measure is direct spending. In Michigan, the NSF spent $262 million in fiscal year 2023. The University of Michigan ($132m), MSU, ($66m), and Michigan Tech ($15m) were the largest recipients, but practically every four-year school in Michigan won NSF support. NSF helps support economic engines for the whole state in the big schools, but equally imagine the seasonal, tourism-dependent economy of the Upper Peninsula without Michigan Tech’s success at winning competitive grants for its year-round scientific work.

Michigan also wins when the US wins. NSF works for all Americans, and often the whole world. Imagine the auto industry, or pretty much any industry, operating as it does today without 3D printing. NSF funded that. Artificial intelligence? NSF. The MRI machines that help doctors diagnose you? NSF. The Doppler radar technology that saves lives in severe weather and makes aviation far safer by conquering wind shear? NSF. Lasik? NSF. Polar or undersea exploration? NSF. Duolingo‘s underlying programming? NSF. The internet itself? NSF. The list is a long one, and in each case it means a crucial sector that thrives because NSF took a bet on the underlying science that others commercialized.

It should be no surprise, then, that Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas economists found that federal science funding has implied returns between 140% and 210%- a fantastic investment by any standard and one that by design accrues to communities, small businesses, and all of us.

What happens when funding is interrupted, or cut? Scientists start to leave science, permanently, after as little as a month of interrupted funding. They certainly can find work, but it will probably be work that underuses their skills.

Meanwhile, what happens to the science that does get done when we take away federal funding? Researchers who lose federal support often get private industry funding, which sounds great until we see that it produces lower quality science that is less influential, contains less basic research that leads to breakthroughs, and is more likely to produce a benefit confined to a single business that paid for the research.

That America, of stagnant science and profiteering businesses, might appeal to real estate developer Donald Trump and technology hype man Elon Musk. It shouldn’t attract the rest of us.

Don’t forget that science is fast-moving, collaborative, and international. The European Union and some Canadian institutions are directly trying to recruit our scientists. China, a fierce scientific competitor, has for a long time seen many of its best minds move to the US, teach our students and work in our companies, because of the science ecology that the NSF supported. Trump and Musk are giving Beijing an opportunity to reverse the flow as our immigration and higher education policies make the United States an impossible option.

Cutting federal funding produces scientific stagnation that benefits only a few, short-termist, businesses. By replacing basic, public research with applied, private, research it makes the rich richer and deprives all of us of breakthroughs that come from basic research. And in a state like Michigan, cutting the NSF makes it all the more likely that we continue our decades-long slide from the technological leaders that we were a century ago.

NSF is 75 years young this month. In a better world, we would be strengthening it so it can make our lives even better in the coming years. Unfortunately, we are fighting to protect it, and if we lose the world, and the United States in particular, will be permanently worse off.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Screenshot-2025-05-12-192101.png,N,,2025-05-13 14:40:36.481448

For model year 2026, the model makes advancements in range, output, charging performance, and vehicle design. Leading the charge is a larger lithium-ion battery with a higher total capacity of up to 74.7-kWh, equipped on a newly available XLE Front-Wheel-Drive Plus (FWD Plus) model, as well as the XLE All-Wheel-Drive (AWD) and Limited (FWD/AWD) grades. Models equipped with the new battery are projected to have a manufacturer-estimated rating of up to 314 miles* of range on a full charge. A 57.7-kWh battery will also be available on a XLE FWD model.

The 2026 bZ will be equipped with a North American Charging System (NACS) charging port, giving it access to thousands of high-speed charging stations nationwide. Under ideal conditions when using DC fast charging* it is capable of charging from 10% to-80% battery capacity in around 30 minutes. The 2026 Toyota bZ also adopts Plug & Charge capability, an industry standard protocol that allows automatic identification, authentication and authorization at selected charging networks, reducing the need for multiple mobile charging applications.

Toyota’s compact, lightweight and energy-efficient eAxles have also been upgraded. They now use silicon carbide (SIC) semiconductors, which help deliver higher power output. For AWD models, output increases by 50% to 338 combined system net horsepower (hp), making it capable of going from 0-60 MPH in 4.9 seconds. Front Wheel Drive models also boost their output, now delivering up-to 221 hp (previously 201 hp).

The model also receives a name change, switching from the Toyota bZ4X to the Toyota bZ, simplifying the name for customers. The 2026 bZ also presents a refreshed exterior design that harmoniously blends form and function. While maintaining its distinctive aesthetic, the updated model incorporates subtle refinements to the front fascia and lighting elements, with slim LED daytime running lights that integrate into a sleek hammerhead front end. Redesigned front overfenders also change the look, with a newly available color-matched moulding that blends into a lower profile front fascia.

Inside, the 2026 bZ will offer a spacious and technologically advanced cabin designed for comfort and connectivity. The console layout is now optimized, with two front wireless chargers and a new, slimmed down dashboard with a larger 14-inch Toyota Audio Multimedia touchscreen and soft touch materials, gives it a premium feel. The 64 color, customizable ambient lighting throughout the cabin further enhances the tactful interior styling.

The 2026 Toyota bZ is expected to start arriving at Toyota dealerships in the second half of 2025. The Manufacturer’s Suggested Retail Price will be announced closer to on-sale date.

*Ranges and charging times will vary depending on weather and other factors.

Two Battery Choices and Faster Charging

The 2026 bZ battery options include a 57.7-kWh and 74.7-kWh unit, manufacturer estimated all-electric drive range ratings are:

314 miles (XLE FWD Plus; 74.7-kWh battery) *

299 miles (Limited FWD; 74.7-kWh battery) *

288 miles (XLE AWD; 74.7-kWh battery) *

278 miles (Limited AWD; 74.7-kWh battery) *

236 miles (XLE FWD, 57.7-kWh battery) *

For 2026, the bZ adopts a NACS charging port, capable of DC fast charging. It will also have Level One and Level Two AC charging with a higher capacity 11-kW on-board AC charger (up from 7-kW capacity on the prior model). The charging port will be located on the front right-side of the vehicle and the model will come with a dual-voltage charging cable.

A new battery pre-conditioning function is also equipped on all models. This system is designed to bring the battery to an optimal temperature for DC fast charging, which can enable faster charging in colder climates. This function can be activated manually or automatically by setting the navigation system destination to a fast-charging station.

The 2026 bZ also adds steering wheel mounted paddle shifters to activate and adjust regenerative braking. These paddles turn the system on and dial the regenerative braking force up or down based on driver preference to capture additional energy and transfer it to the battery.

The Toyota bZ also has a battery thermal management system, which includes a water-to-water heat exchanger and heating adjustment valve to increase battery temperature, to help optimize DC charging speeds in cold weather. The following systems and equipment are designed to reduce energy consumption, especially power used for heating in cold climates:

Heat pump system for both heating and air-conditioning

Standard Front-seat and steering wheel heaters

Available Front-seat radiant foot-and-leg heater

Available heated rear seats and ventilated front seats

In terms of battery safety, Toyota uses many measures to help protect cell integrity, thanks to the design and a multiple monitoring system intended to protect the vehicle’s battery system. This includes:

Redundant monitoring of battery voltage, current and temperature designed to detect signs of abnormal heating to maintain optimal battery temperature and help prevent cell damage

Utilization of a high-resistance coolant circulation system is designed to help prevent a thermal event from short circuits even in high battery load conditions due to repeatedly switching between high-speed driving and rapid charging

Surprising Capability

On AWD bZ models, the surprisingly capable X-MODE system will be equipped. X-MODE is a function that allows the driver to operate a switch to select a mode according to the road conditions, automatically changing to optimize brake control and power delivery at the wheels for enhanced control and traction.

A feature of the system is Grip-Control. When activated and used at low speeds, the system leverages motor drive power modulation to achieve capable off-road performance. This feature was developed as an added function to react to road surface characteristics and maintain a constant speed to prevent slipping on rough roads.

The bZ’s impressive driving performance is due in part to the BEV-dedicated e-TNGA platform. This architecture allows for a low center of gravity and rigid chassis, thanks to the high-capacity lithium-Ion battery pack placed flat under the floor. Its handling prowess is also due in part to the battery cross-framing structure, which adds to overall vehicle rigidity.

The use of a lightweight body structure with sections of high-tensile steel reinforced frame components around the battery pack, coupled with a dynamic suspension, contributes to the bZ driving feel. An intelligent throttle feature provides a smoother feel when accelerating and decelerating, and Vehicle Stability Control helps the driver maintain vehicle control under adverse conditions.

Design Updates and Comfort Improvements

The Toyota bZ comfortably resides in the small SUV segment, with an 8.2-inch ground clearance, 184.6-inch overall length, 73.2-inch overall width, and 65-inch overall height (including antenna). Its 112.2-inch wheelbase provides for a stable, comfortable ride.

The 2026 Toyota bZ’s design has been updated both inside and out. The front presents a sleeker, more elegant look. The interior has been updated with a new center console for easy use of digital devices and a new instrument panel design, with a 14-inch multimedia screen fitted as standard.

On the inside, both the XLE and Limited grades bring high-tech, comfort focused features. New for 2026 is slimmer dashboard design with front and rear ambient lighting with 64 available colors to set the perfect mood. Dual Qi-compatible wireless smartphone chargers also up the tech in the front of the cabin. Additional standard features for both grades include a heated SofTex-trimmed 3-spoke steering wheel with regenerative braking paddle switches, and a top-mount Multi-Information Display for a heads-up view of the road.

Interior dimensions are designed to maximize space for people and cargo alike. The bZ has a comfortable 42.1-inches of legroom for the front seat and 35.3-inches for passengers in the rear seat. Cargo volume is 27.7 cubic feet behind the second row.

The 2026 Toyota bZ offers a variety of exterior color options, including an option for color- matched overfenders on models that wear Wind Chill Pearl, Heavy Metal, or Black paint. Single and two-tone paint treatments and the following interior/exterior combinations are available:

Active Safety & Driver Assist Technology

The 2026 bZ features Toyota Safety Sense 3.0™, Toyota’s suite of active safety and driver assistance features. This system is designed to support driver awareness, decision-making, and vehicle operation. This system uses a combination of millimeter wave radar and monocular camera to monitor various driving conditions. Please note that Toyota Safety Sense 3.0 systems are not a substitute for safe and attentive driving. The safety suite includes:

Pre-Collision System with Pedestrian Detection: Pre-Collision System with Pedestrian Detection (PCS w/PD) is designed to help detect a vehicle, pedestrian, bicyclist, or motorcyclist and provide an audible/visual forward-collision warning under certain circumstances. If you don’t react, the system is designed to provide automatic emergency braking.

Full-Speed Range Dynamic Radar Cruise Control (DRCC): an adaptive cruise control system that is designed to be set at speeds above 20 mph. DRCC uses vehicle-to-vehicle distance control to help maintain a preset distance from the vehicle ahead of you.

Lane Departure Alert with Steering Assist (LDA w/SA): detects lane markings or the road’s edge at speeds above 30 mph. LDA w/SA is designed to provide an audible/visual warning if an inadvertent lane departure is detected. If no corrective action is taken, Steering Assist is designed to provide gentle corrective steering for lane-keeping assistance.

Lane Tracing Assist (LTA): designed to help keep the vehicle in the center of a lane. LTA assists the driver with steering control while DRCC is in use.

Road Sign Assist (RSA): uses the forward-facing camera to recognize specific road signs, such as speed limit, stop, and yield signs. RSA provides sign information to the driver via the Multi-Information Display.

Automatic High Beams (AHB): designed to detect headlights of oncoming vehicles and taillights of preceding vehicles. AHB automatically toggles between high and low beams as appropriate.

Proactive Driving Assist (PDA): uses the vehicle’s camera and radar, when system operating conditions are met, to provide gentle braking and/or steering to support driving tasks such as distance control between your vehicle and a preceding vehicle, pedestrian, or bicyclist. PDA can also provide gentle braking into curves.

Blind Spot Monitor with Rear Cross-Traffic Alert is also standard. The BSM system uses rear side radar sensors installed on the inner side of the rear bumper on the left and right side to assist the driver in confirming safety when changing lanes. The RCTA function uses the same sensors installed behind the rear bumper. This function is intended to assist the driver in checking areas that are not easily visible when backing up.

Safe Exit Alert is also standard on bZ. This system is designed to detect vehicles or cyclists approaching from the rear and judges if there is a possibility of a collision with an opened door or passengers who are exiting. Safe Exit Alert will illuminate an indicator in the outer mirror and provide an audible alert to notify vehicle occupants.

The Toyota bZ is also equipped with Toyota’s Star Safety System, standard. This system includes Vehicle Stability Control (VSC), Traction Control (TRAC), Anti-lock Brake System (ABS), Electronic Brake-force Distribution (EBD), Brake Assist (BA) and Smart Stop Technology® (SST).

Driver assistance features include Traffic Jam Assist, Lane Change Assist, and Front Cross-Traffic Alert, standard on the Limited grade. The Limited grade also includes a standard Panoramic View Monitor with Perimeter Scan including 360-degree Overhead View in low-speed drive and reverse, and Curb View.

The company leading the project, Anfield Energy, also plans to restart a uranium mill to extract uranium from ore.
The Interior Department has said that the United States is “dangerously reliant” on imports of uranium and vanadium to meet its needs.
Fifteen states have sued the Trump administration over the energy emergency declaration.","The Interior Department said it would fast-track the permitting process for a uranium mine in Utah as part of President Trump’s plan to shorten environmental reviews and speed the construction of certain types of energy projects.

An environmental assessment of the Velvet-Wood mine project will be completed in 14 days, the agency announced. Such a review would typically take about one year.

Critics have called the plan to drastically shrink the review time dangerous, and projects that are approved under such a compressed process are likely to face legal challenges.

In a statement, Doug Burgum, the interior secretary, said the expedited process had been established to fix what he called an “alarming energy emergency because of the prior administration’s Climate Extremist policies.” He said that the speedy review “represents exactly the kind of decisive action we need to secure our energy future.”

The Velvet-Wood project, in San Juan County, Utah, aims to produce uranium, which is used as a fuel in nuclear power plants, as well as vanadium, used in the production of steel alloys.

It is being built on the site of an older mine that closed in the 1980s. The company leading the project, Anfield Energy, also plans to restart a uranium mill to extract uranium from ore.

The Interior Department said the project would result in three acres of land “disturbance.” The agency declined to make public the permit application or other documents detailing what it meant by “disturbance.”

Sarah Fields, founder of Uranium Watch, an environmental group based in Utah, said her organization had concerns about effects on water resources, as well as about radioactive waste from mining operations.

Ms. Fields said the expedited approval process also meant “there’s no opportunity for public comment, and the public often brings up issues to the agency that they’re not aware of.”

Corey Dias, Anfield’s chief executive, called the fast-track permits “a game changer for us.”

He said he expected to be able to recover 4 million tons of uranium and nearly 5 million tons of vanadium over the life of the project. “The fact that we’re being recognized as an advanced asset to be put into operation by the government, I think, is a big thing for us,” Mr. Dias said. “It also reflects the nature of the importance of uranium for domestic production.”

The decision to fast-track a uranium project comes as the White House is considering several executive orders aimed at speeding the construction of nuclear power plants to help meet rising electricity demand, according to drafts reviewed by The New York Times.

The Interior Department has said that the United States is “dangerously reliant” on imports of uranium and vanadium to meet its needs. It has argued that, in 2023, U.S. nuclear generators relied 99 percent on imported uranium concentrate, including from Russia.

Mr. Burgum then initiated a process by which environmental reviews that typically take a year to complete would be finished in 14 days. More complicated environmental impact statements, which usually take two years, would be completed in 28 days, the department said.

U.S. energy production has been near record highs.

The Interior Department is condensing the review process by claiming emergency authority under the National Environmental Policy Act, the Endangered Species Act and the National Historic Preservation Act.

Fifteen states have sued the Trump administration over the energy emergency declaration. They have argued that no emergency exists and that the order instructs regulators to illegally bypass reviews of fossil fuel projects, potentially damaging the environment.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/05/12/multimedia/12cli-interior-fvmb/12cli-interior-fvmb-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-05-13 14:36:52.041844

The move has prompted a broader conversation among the Detroit Lakes School Board about the future of the building and the property.

The Lincoln Education Center currently houses Community Education, Early Childhood and Family Education, and preschool programs. While Community Education and ECFE will temporarily move to M State under a multi-year lease, the district plans to work with M State to establish long-term use of space in a designated area of the building.

Preschool programming will be split between Rossman Elementary and Roosevelt Elementary. Roughly 20 staff members will be reassigned to mirror the programming currently offered at Lincoln.

""Both elementary schools are well-equipped with space for student development,"" Community Education Director Andrew Lesch said. ""Moving preschool into these excellent facilities to continue the school readiness program is very exciting.""

Lincoln’s relocation comes after several years of facilities upgrades that began with a 2018 bond referendum. The bond, valued at just over $60 million, funded remodeling and expansions at the elementary schools, the middle school and added two major expansions to the high school. Construction wrapped up in the 2021–22 school year.

“You heard the community say, we want to keep our existing sites, we want to add on, to have enough space,” said Jason Kuehn, Detroit Lakes Public Schools director of finance and operations. “So, adding gyms, adding classrooms, those types of things were done.”

Lincoln has long been a candidate for modernization. The building, one of the district’s oldest, has evolved significantly over the decades and now faces mounting deferred maintenance.

“(Lincoln has) changed and evolved over decades; it's one of our oldest, if not the oldest, properties ... it has a lot of maintenance needs that if we wanted to be in there long term, it's gonna cost a fair amount of money,” Kuehn said.

Immediate repairs — such as roofing and HVAC work — could cost around $2 million in the next few years. After conducting a demographic and space utilization analysis, Kuehn said existing space in the elementary schools and at M State offered a more cost-effective solution.

“I think if we would have been able to pass a $100 million project back in 2018, we would have been able to address some of those needs right then and there,” Kuehn said. “I was the principal over at Rossman, and there were some things that we had to cut out of our project at that time, because ultimately there wasn't enough money for all of the things that were desired.”

Along with new classroom space, enrollment trends have also factored into the decision. The district has seen declining student numbers and an opportunity to reassign early childhood classrooms into available elementary school space.

“We've had a bubble of kids — a bigger group of kids — the last group of them actually are seniors this year,” Kuehn said. “When they were in elementary school, they were always in the 240 to 275 student per grade range — right now, our kindergarten class is currently 175.”

Lesch said the board began transition discussions in February, with families notified of the final decision in early April. Enrollment will be finalized in the coming weeks, and Lesch said communication with families will continue throughout the summer. The conversation, he said, was “ready to happen.”

“It’s going to be really good for families and really good for kids,” Lesch said. “Less transitions to feel comfortable in a building that they’re eventually going to spend their K-5 years in will hopefully help reduce some of those new building jitters.”

Lesch also said he and his staff will keep families updated on social media about the transition timeline.

“There might be a transitional period where we might not be available in person during the move — we will make sure we let the community know how to get hold of us during that state,” Lesch said.

With the decision to cease programming at Lincoln, the School Board is now discussing the future of the building and property. The board began considering its options during a work session on April 22.

“I think the discussion is, do we need that property now or in the future?” Kuehn said during the session.

The board reviewed four options: maintain the building and property as-is, demolish the building and maintain the land, sell the property and building together, or demolish the building and sell the property. If the district chooses to sell the land post-demolition, it must consider how to make it attractive to potential buyers.

“You take on some liability,” Kuehn said about maintaining the building. “You still have to operate it even if you aren't using it — so that kind of gives a framework for all the pieces.”

Dear reader,

As Republicans in the US put forward plans that would end renewable energy subsidies and scrap tax breaks for electric vehicle purchases, clean energy campaigners in the EU are calling for a European competitiveness fund to fill investment gaps.

The House ways and means committee will today discuss “the one, big, beautiful bill”, which Republicans claim will deliver on President Trump’s economic agenda and support pro-family, pro-worker tax provisions.

“Under the economic policies of President Biden and Washington Democrats, the wealthy and well-connected benefited from taxpayer handouts. The ways and means Republican tax bill ends special interest giveaways and will hold the woke elite and entities that benefit from the tax code accountable. It will halt the flow of taxpayer dollars to illegal immigrants and China,” says ways and means committee chair Jason Smith.

Under the section of the bill headed “make America win again” and “working families over elites”, it proposes terminating support for a host of clean energy technologies and actions, including EVs, home energy efficiency improvements, clean electricity, clean fuels, green hydrogen and hydrogen storage.

How to create an EU competitiveness fund for clean tech

Meanwhile, in Brussels, 16 clean tech organisations have written to the European Commission and parliament, backing the creation of a European competitiveness fund.

They highlight four steps they believe can ensure the fund works and keeps the EU on track with its climate action. These include preserving the scope of existing EU programmes for strategic climate and energy investments and increasing the climate mainstreaming target from 30 per cent to 50 per cent under the next multiannual EU budget.

The organisations also underline the importance of simplifying access for small and medium-sized enterprises, co-operatives and households to EU finance and of integrating the efficiency-first principle in investment planning. They likewise warn against reinventing the wheel and advise instead that the EU channels more funding to existing successful programmes like Horizon Europe, the Innovation Fund and InvestEU.

“A more ambitious green industrial policy demands harmonised, targeted EU public funding, which the competitiveness fund promises to provide. But the EU should proceed with caution. If this new architecture comes at the expense of climate action or research excellence, we will be putting our long-term competitiveness at risk,” says Institute for Climate Economics research fellow Ciarán Humphreys.

Reason to stick with biodiversity net gain

Also along the lines of not stopping something that is working, David Hill, former deputy chair of Natural England, urges the UK government not to change the rules on biodiversity net gain, or even scrap the law as some rumours suggest.

Hill says the initiative is beginning to work well. He warns the public purse will never be able to raise the amounts of money needed to protect and restore the UK’s damaged biodiversity. Further, pulling the rug out from the initiative would send the wrong message to investors domestically and abroad, given the high regard in which BNG is held as the first global compliance market for biodiversity, he says.

“If we want markets to work for nature, leveraging far larger amounts of money than a government-run scheme could achieve, we must stop making investors nervous. The government needs to listen,” writes Hill.

ISSB reporting change: ‘a technical cherry on top of a technical cake’

Elizabeth, meanwhile, examines how the proposal by the International Sustainability Standards Board to exclude certain financial sector emissions from Scope 3 reporting has sparked a debate about the extent to which insurers can be held accountable for their indirect emissions.

Ashurst lawyer Becky Clissmann says the ISSB’s move is not a rollback and not analogous to what the EU is trying to achieve with its omnibus proposal. “This is much more nuanced — it’s a technical cherry on top of a very technical cake,” she tells Elizabeth. “The world is definitely realising how difficult it is to do sustainability reporting well, but in that sense it’s very sensible to make sure that what comes out of reporting is decision-useful for investors.”

Ways to rewrite the economy

Finally, today, we dive into the latest report from the Cambridge Institute for Sustainability Leadership, Rewiring Finance — a New Approach to Financing a Sustainable Economy, which argues that attempts to scale up sustainable finance have failed to deliver the necessary change required to transition to a more environmentally and socially just economy.

The authors make three proposals they believe could alter this dynamic.

First, ensuring industrial and financial policies set out transition pathways for all economic sectors, with incentives for the financial system to deliver on them. Second, a mindset shift that moves the financial sector from compliance to value creation by actively engaging with the risks and opportunities the transition poses.

And third, the report urges the financial sector to embed sustainability into financial values by pricing in the financial materiality of climate change, biodiversity loss and inequalities.

Until tomorrow,

Philippa

Their suit in Seattle federal district court argues that there is no actual emergency, just an administration intent to fast-track certain projects through environmental permit reviews.

The order was part of a slate of day-one directives Trump issued on Inauguration Day. It directs federal agency heads to expedite permitting for energy-related projects using “any lawful emergency authorities available to them.” In remarks at the time, he blamed inflation partly on escalating energy rates and said that “We will drill, baby, drill” to bring prices down.

The suit, filed May 9 by the Democrat-run states, also names the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation, as well as several agency leaders. as defendants. State officials in the suit want a judge to declare the order unlawful and to block the agencies from issuing permits on an emergency basis related to the order.

The states argue in their suit that the order is an unlawful reach beyond the president’s legal authority. Historically, the Corps and other agencies have used emergency procedures for projects needed in the aftermath of disasters such as the 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil platform explosion or severe damaging storms.

“The invocation of the country’s emergency authorities is reserved for actual emergencies—not changes in presidential policy or because the president feels like it,” California Attorney General Rob Bonta said in a statement. “These procedures misuse authorities meant for disaster response and bypass important health and environmental protections for the benefit of the fossil fuel industry.”

In his order, Trump stated that expanding national energy infrastructure “is an immediate and pressing priority” to protect national and economic security. Administration officials have not yet formally responded to the suit, but a White House spokesperson told the Associated Press that the president “has authority to determine what is a national emergency, not state attorneys or the courts. {He] Trump recognizes that unleashing American energy is crucial to both our economic and national security.”

By bypassing normal regulatory processes, states say the hastened permitting will result in environmental damage.

“Environmental regulations exist because we’ve seen what happens when they don’t,” said Casey Sixkiller, Washington Dept. of Ecology director, in a statement. “The federal administration is proposing an end-run that ignores the hard lessons of the past. These protections aren’t red tape—they’re guardrails that protect our air, water, land, and keep our families safe.”

States participating in the suit include Arizona, California, Connecticut, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, New Jersey, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington and Wisconsin. Other than Vermont and Wisconsin, the states also are part of a group of 17 states and District of Columbia that just sued the Trump government over his order temporarily halting permitting approvals for wind energy projects.

But federal officials have already taken action to fast track energy project reviews. The Corps identified hundreds of projects to expedite under the directive. Earlier this month, agency officials in Detroit cited the order when they announced an accelerated timeline for review of Enbridge Energy’s proposed Line 5 Tunnel Project to build a replacement the oil and natural gas liquids pipeline tunnel under the Straits of Mackinac in Lake Michigan.

Public comment on the Line 5 project’s environmental impact statement was moved up from sometime next year to 30 days ending June 30, and Corps officials said they anticipate issuing a decision this fall.

But one observer is skeptical that the expedited approval process will work.

""The AI-related national energy emergency declared by Trump has at best only a tenuous relationship with the Army Corps’ emergency regulation,"" Dan Farber, faculty director of the Center for Law, Energy & the Environment at the University of California, Berkeley School of Law, said in a May 13 opinion in Utility Dive.. ""If the Corps does make wide use of this regulation where it doesn’t apply, courts have an obligation to make the Corps start over again. Thus, the process for processing a permit application will take longer than ever.""

Legal Battlefield

The lawsuit is the latest salvo in a series of developing legal battles over energy, pollution and climate change—with parties that include groups of attorneys general organized by political affiliation, oil and gas companies, industry groups and federal and state governments turning to courts to answer questions about climate liability and compensation.

The administration announced May 1 legal action to prevent states from suing or recovering costs from fossil fuel companies related to climate change, with the U.S. Dept. of Justice on April 30 filing lawsuits against Michigan and Hawaii and complaints against New York and Vermont.

The suits filed against Hawaii and Michigan are preemptive, intended to block the states from suing oil and gas companies, measures they were exploring. The planned legal steps are ""unlawful state overreach that would threaten [U.S.] energy independence,"" said Acting Assistant Attorney General Adam Gustafson in the agency's environment and natural resources division. Justice also called “overreach"" Hawaii's suit announced May 1 against fossil fuel companies.

Hawaii Attorney General Anne Lopez termed Justice involvement a “direct attack on Hawaii’s rights as a sovereign state,” and said it would “vigorously oppose this gross federal overreach.”

Hawaii filed against seven oil and gas companies and subsidiaries, as well as the American Petroleum Institute for what it describes as “deceptive conduct leading to the current climate crisis,” in a press release. “Hawaiʻi has spent, and will continue to spend, substantial sums to recover from and adapt to climate change-induced harms,” said the suit. It calls for the firms and lobby group to “abate, directly or through an abatement fund, the harm caused by their conduct.”

The complaints against Vermont and New York pertain to state laws allowing them to recover costs from fossil fuel companies—up to $75 billion over 25 years per New York’s law—to be used for infrastructure and climate adaptation work. Justice wants the laws declared unconstitutional, claiming they are “preempted by the federal Clean Air Act"" and other federal authority.,” according to the press release.

Vermont’s first-in-the-nation Climate Superfund Act and New York’s Climate Change Superfund Act were enacted last year, with several other states considering similar legislation.

The laws are already being challenged by the institute and U.S. Chamber of Commerce in a suit last year, and by attorneys general from 22 states and several industry group in a February suit against New York. West Virginia Attorney General JB McCuskey termed the New York law also ""unconstitutional."" Following the Justice Dept. May 1 announcement, 24 Republican attorneys general asked to join the lawsuit against Vermont.

This board was created to strengthen and expand Kentucky’s agricultural economy through strategic planning, targeted partnerships, and financial incentives. The board will administer programs, such as grants, forgivable loans, and revolving loan funds, to support infrastructure upgrades, market expansion, and value-added agricultural development. The overall goal is to attract private investment, create new economic opportunities, and uplift farming communities throughout Kentucky.

The creation of this board is the result of Commissioner of Agriculture Jonathan Shell’s vision that “Agriculture is Economic Development.” In 2024, Commissioner Shell conducted a statewide listening tour, hosting regional meetings with farmers, business leaders, and community stakeholders. The input gathered during those meetings shaped the priorities and design of this new initiative.

Commissioner Shell will serve as Chairman of the Board and will appoint the following five members to serve on the inaugural Kentucky Agricultural Economic Development Board:

Dr. Kenny Burdine – Dr. Burdine serves on the Kentucky Agricultural Finance Corporation and will represent local economic development. He is an Extension Professor in livestock economics at the University of Kentucky Martin-Gatton College of Agriculture, Food, and Environment.

Lori Noel – Lori Noel serves on the Kentucky Agricultural Finance Corporation and will represent specialty crop producers. She is the Executive Vice President and Chief Lending Officer at FNB Bank in Western Kentucky.

Kevin Fields – Kevin Fields serves on the Kentucky Agricultural Development Board and will represent livestock producers. He owns a cow-calf operation in Madison County and is co-owner of Tri-County Fertilizer and Propane Co.

Neil Denton – Neil Denton serves on the Kentucky Agricultural Development Board and will represent row crop producers. He is a farmer, co-owner of Atlas Media Solutions, owner of Agri-Move LLC and serves as president of the Kentucky Small Grain Association.

Missy Vanderpool- Missy Vanderpool was nominated by the Kentucky Association for Economic Development. She is the Executive Director of the Henderson Regional Industrial Authority.

The Kentucky Agricultural Economic Development Board will operate within the Kentucky Department of Agriculture’s Kentucky Office of Agricultural Policy, under the leadership of Executive Director Brandon Reed. More specifically, it will be housed within the newly created Division of Agricultural Economic Development, led by Director of Economic Development Jacob Estes.

The establishment of the Board comes at a significant moment, as the Kentucky Office of Agricultural Policy celebrates its 25th anniversary in 2025. The Board represents a collaborative effort between the Department of Agriculture, the General Assembly, Kentucky farmers, business leaders, and community stakeholders, all working to strengthen and expand Kentucky’s farm economy.

“As the Kentucky Office of Agricultural Policy marks 25 years of service, it is only fitting that we launch the Division of Agricultural Economic Development,” Executive Director Brandon Reed said. “Commissioner Shell’s vision and passion for advancing Kentucky agriculture are second to none, and I’m proud the General Assembly recognized that by creating this Board. I look forward to working alongside my longtime colleague Jacob Estes to bring that vision to life.”

“The Kentucky Agricultural Economic Development Board is a yearlong collaboration between the Department of Agriculture, farmers, business leaders, community stakeholders, and the General Assembly,” Commissioner Shell said. “I am excited to see the work this board will accomplish to move Kentucky agriculture forward, and I couldn’t ask for a better group of individuals to get this work started.”",https://ae-lane-report.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/13132250/Ky-Ag-Econ-Dev-Board-2025.jpg,N,,2025-05-13 14:45:17.652495

Having a large stable of big power users willing to throttle back usage could give NRG a critical tool for the future.
Grids are designed to withstand the very hottest and coldest days of the year, when power demand peaks.
“That 14% includes zero from data centers,” but these big power users will be a significant part of NRG’s future, Coben said.
LS Power will keep about 10 gigawatts of natural gas, renewable and energy storage capacity.","NRG Energy Inc. agreed to acquire a fleet of natural gas-fired power plants from LS Power Equity Advisors LLC for about $12 billion including debt, betting the fuel will be crucial to meet electricity demand from data centers.

The cash-and-stock deal calls for NRG to buy 18 gas-fired facilities from LS with a combined capacity of about 13 gigawatts, the companies said Monday in a statement. That’s enough to power about 10.4 million homes.

NRG, a Houston-based independent power producer, has already been a key beneficiary of the AI-driven boom that’s upended the US power system, and now it’s vying to take a bigger share of that growth. Electric demand had been mostly flat for a generation before OpenAI unveiled ChatGPT in late 2022, signaling the arrival of artificial intelligence. Now, a surge in data centers to power AI has reignited investor interest in electric providers.

“It’s kind of like finding the Holy Grail,” Chief Executive Officer Larry Coben, an archaeologist, said in an interview. “This portfolio seems to be the perfect fit for us.”

The facilities NRG is buying are spread across nine states, expanding its footprint in the Northeast and Texas. The move gives NRG a larger presence on the grid run by PJM Interconnection LLC, the operator powering the data center capital of the world in northern Virginia.

NRG is also acquiring LS’s CPower business, a 6-gigawatt portfolio of commercial consumers that has agreed to curtail usage to free up supply when the grid is stressed. Having a large stable of big power users willing to throttle back usage could give NRG a critical tool for the future.

Grids are designed to withstand the very hottest and coldest days of the year, when power demand peaks. That means on most days, there’s spare supply. If power producers can coordinate users to conserve energy when the grid needs it, they can connect more homes and businesses without bringing the system to the brink of blackouts during heat waves and deep freezes.

Investors rallied behind the deal, sending NRG shares up as much as 25% on Monday, the most intraday since July 2017. It was a far cry from the reaction to the company’s last big acquisition of Vivint Smart Home Inc. for nearly $3 billion, which caused shares to plunge and drew ire from activist investor Elliott Investment Management LP.

With the LS purchase, NRG said adjusted earnings per share will now expand at 14% on a compound annual growth rate over five years, up from previous guidance of 10%. The company reiterated its previously announced plan to spend $1.3 billion on share repurchases and dividends of about $345 million.

“That 14% includes zero from data centers,” but these big power users will be a significant part of NRG’s future, Coben said. “We are still vigorously, vigorously pushing that.”

NRG increased its order for big gas turbines with GE Vernova Inc. by 1.2 gigawatts to 2.4 gigawatts. These new power plant would most likely support demand from data centers, though other customers may want to lock in new supply too given tightening in power markets, he said. Coben, who declined to discuss details at this time, said that gas and renewables are both needed to feed the super cycle of demand growth.

The deal is expected to close in the first quarter of 2026.

LS Power will keep about 10 gigawatts of natural gas, renewable and energy storage capacity. It will also hold onto its transmission business, LS Power Grid platform, which has more than 780 miles of high-voltage lines in operation and another 350 miles under construction or development.

Citigroup Inc., Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Scotiabank served as NRG’s advisers on the deal. Citi and Goldman are providing financing. White & Case LLP was NRG’s legal counsel.

Evercore was LS Power’s lead financial adviser.

The process allows for a simple majority vote in the Senate provided a reconciliation bill raises revenue or spends it.","Republican leadership in the Ways and Means committee of the U.S. House of Representatives released Monday night a draft of a reconciliation bill that seeks to undo much of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA).

The landmark 2022 law implemented a range of incentives that spurred the production of clean energy, electric vehicles, carbon capture, and battery storage. Since the IRA was enacted, the law has spurred more than $275 billion in private investment in the United States.

House Republicans’ axe has fallen in places both expected and surprising.

Under the “expected” column: Electric vehicle tax credits and the ability to transfer tax credits for clean energy production from one organization to another.

The EV tax credit gives consumers up to a $7,500 tax credit on the purchase of an EV; the bill proposes ending the credit in 2026 and reinstating a cap of 200,000 vehicles per manufacturer. Several companies, including Tesla, GM, and Toyota, hit that cap years ago.

The transferability clause has spurred an entirely new market, with over $30 billion worth of deals happening in 2024 alone. The provision allows companies and other organizations to take advantage of IRA tax credits even if they have no tax liability. A church, for example, can install solar panels and sell the tax credits to companies that can make use of the incentives.

There were more surprising changes, too.

Nuclear power, normally a favorite of GOP lawmakers, would no longer benefit from tax credits for electricity generation. The law would also end tax-exempt status for environmental groups if the government decides that they have “supported terrorist organizations.” Advanced manufacturing would also see incentives cut back, as would tax credits for carbon capture, something that many large oil companies have publicly supported.

Sustainable aviation fuel is among the technologies that might see its incentives spared, as were bonuses for clean energy producers known as “adders.” The House bill also does not seek to claw back funds that have already been spent, contrary to what’s happening at the EPA. The House bill would move up the date for which large projects can qualify for incentives.

None of this is set in stone, of course. This is a first draft at a process that’s certain to be drawn out and messy. Lobbyists and political action committees are already rolling out pressure campaigns to dissuade GOP politicians from voting in favor, and they have a chance at succeeding, given how many Republican districts have benefited from the IRA in just a few years.

Whether such an ambitious repeal of an existing law will pass muster under reconciliation rules also remains an open question. The process allows for a simple majority vote in the Senate provided a reconciliation bill raises revenue or spends it. Repealing the IRA would essentially be doing the opposite.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/GettyImages-950173010.jpg?resize=1200,861",N,,2025-05-13 14:34:35.012512

FRANKFURT, Germany — Ford workers at the U.S. automaker's two plants in Cologne, Germany, will go on strike on Wednesday, their works council head said Monday, as tensions rise over planned job cuts across its European operations.

Ford said in November last year it would cut around 14% of its European workforce, mostly in Germany and Britain, blaming losses due to weak demand for electric vehicles and poor government support for the shift to the new technology.

The company declined to comment, citing ongoing negotiations with trade unions. Union IG Metall did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

American Bitcoin, the mining firm backed by Eric Trump and Donald Trump Jr., said Monday that it would go public on the Nasdaq through a merger with public company Gryphon Digital Mining. The combined company will operate as American Bitcoin, which lists Eric Trump as a co-founder and chief strategy officer.

The merger marks a more aggressive move by the Trump family into the electricity infrastructure that enables its digital currency business. American Bitcoin started out as a subsidiary of the Miami-based energy infrastructure company Hut 8, which has a portfolio of 15 sites in the United States and Canada totaling more than 1,000 megawatts of energy capacity. Hut 8 will act as American Bitcoin’s exclusive infrastructure and operations partner, according to the companies’ announcement, and American Bitcoin previously said it would co-locate miners at Hut 8 sites.

A presentation by American Bitcoin says that the new venture aims to “become a category leader in the Bitcoin ecosystem” and to achieve “mining leadership” through “Hut 8’s energy advantage, rapid execution and proven team.” The company, the presentation says, can also leverage and expand “access to low-cost power, establishing a fundamental operational advantage” to its mining business.

Upon returning to Washington, Trump wasted no time standing behind tech executives pledging hundreds of billions of dollars to build data centers big enough to command the lead over China in developing artificial intelligence. And Trump has said he wants the U.S. to be the crypto capital of the world, including by opening up energy resources to boost digital mining. “If crypto is going to define the future, I want it to be mined, minted and made in the USA,” Trump said at an industry conference last July while running for his second term.

The White House has framed Trump’s “energy abundance” agenda as an economic necessity for America’s powerful tech companies — largely to power an AI boom, but also for energy-hungry crypto mining and high-tech manufacturing. The White House has rolled out executive orders designed to speed permitting and bypass environmental rules to get data centers and power plants built more quickly. And the Energy Department plans to help private companies build data centers on federal land, including at national labs.

Through American Bitcoin — a Hut 8 subsidiary that was briefly called American Data Center — the Trump family business venture is delving deeper into the energy space where federal policies under Trump intersect directly with access to electricity and fuels. And that comes as the energy industry is in some turmoil. On-again, off-again tariffs and the global economic implications are contributing to a slump in oil prices and pushing up costs for energy technology. Trump has put natural gas build-outs and reviving old coal plants at the center of his energy policy, while attacks on wind and solar power are pushing more of that investment to the sideline.

In an April call launching American Bitcoin, Eric Trump said the winner of the bitcoin race will be “whoever can do it best and most efficiently and most pragmatically, in the cheapest energy environments.”

“We’ve got the best energy policy in this country. That policy is only getting better,” he said in April.

The growing web of Trump-affiliated ventures, including a currency firm World Liberty Financial and the $TRUMP memecoin, are attracting greater scrutiny. Senate Democrats pulled support for bipartisan crypto legislation earlier this month after the Trump family business announced it had completed a $2 billion digital coin deal for a transaction led by MGX, a large investment fund backed by United Arab Emirates.

MGX is also an investor in Stargate, a U.S. data center megaproject that Trump rolled out on his first day in office. Stargate investors OpenAI, SoftBank, Oracle and MGX are building its first project in Abilene, Texas, and plan to tap Texas natural gas production for electricity.

Conflicts of interest

The decision to take American Bitcoin public by merging with a Nasdaq-traded firm increases access to technology investors, including those with interests in energy.

The “mining” of digital currency requires massive amounts of computing power. The U.S. Energy Information Administration estimated last year that digital currency mining accounted for as much as 2.3 percent of the nation’s electricity use based on publicly available data. Plans to survey crypto companies about their energy consumption and sources of energy were halted after an industry lawsuit last year and have not been revived under the Trump administration.

American Bitcoin did not detail what sources of energy it planned to use or where it would build new mining sites. The company also did not reply to a request for comment.

Hut 8 currently owns some or all of 15 power and digital infrastructure sites in Canada and the U.S., according to regulatory filings. That includes a site powered by wind and grid connections in the Texas Panhandle; a grid-connected site in Niagara Falls, New York; and a mine partially powered by a gas turbine in Alberta. At the end of 2024, the company said its development pipeline had approximately 12,300 megawatts of energy capacity.

In the April call, Hut 8 CEO Asher Genoot said the company would “focus on developing and monetizing data centers, not Bitcoin mining itself.”

Las Vegas-based Gryphon, meanwhile, has said it entered into an agreement to acquire an Alberta site it could scale up to 4 gigawatts of gas-generating capacity with carbon sequestration. The company said that site could support an expansion into AI and high-performance computing data centers.

Under the deal to go public, the investors in American Bitcoin would control 98 percent of the new company. Gryphon shareholders would hold 2 percent.

Tom Mapes, the president of the Digital Energy Council, said in an interview that the merger shows how “energy and technology are only growing to be more hand in glove and whoever has the access to energy is going to be the leader in technology.” Mapes, whose group represents crypto miners, said the combined company presents some “real opportunities” by representing the energy development and mining businesses.

Erran Carmel, a technology professor at American University who studies digital currency, said the “pay to play” opportunity could enrich the president and his family. The extension to energy-heavy mining of digital assets could also present a conflict of interest for Trump.

“The immensity of the shift on crypto from the Biden administration to the Trump administration is so extreme,” Carmel said. “The Biden administration was understandably hesitant about crypto on a number of levels. Trump has done a complete 180 for the United States.”

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt rebuffed ethics concerns in a statement.

“President Trump is compliant with all conflict-of-interest rules, and only acts in the best interests of the American public — which is why they overwhelmingly re-elected him to this office, despite years of lies and false accusations against him and his businesses from the fake news media,” Leavitt said in an email.",https://static.politico.com/dims4/default/55a1666/2147483647/resize/1200/quality/100/?url=https://static.politico.com/61/6e/92ece20948ec807eb9c63ae17426/emirates-crypto-47920.jpg,N,,2025-05-13 14:37:05.598933

Working-class households would be unable to receive the 30% tax credit for installing rooftop solar if the bill’s language is passed as-is.

It’s just one update to clean energy credits in the Committee’s draft budget bill, which will go through markups today. The bill does not scrap the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) entirely, but does eliminate certain credits and phases out others.

The draft bill removes clean energy credits for individuals, while preserving most of them for large-scale solar developers. It would eliminate the 30% residential ITC (25D) as well as the EV credit (30D) on December 31, 2025.

For large-scale solar, the full value of the ITC (48E) and PTC (45Y) remain intact through 2028 before a phase-down of the total credit to 80% in 2029, 60% in 2030, 40% in 2031 and zero in 2032. That’s earlier than current IRA language, which triggers phase-out at the later of 2032 or when U.S. greenhouse gas emissions from electricity are 25% of 2022 emissions or lower.

ITC adders like the low-income bonus credit and domestic content credit are not mentioned in the bill, so investment banking company Roth Capital Partners said those credits appear to be safe and to follow the same phase-down as the general ITC/PTC. However, transferability of the ITC and PTC would be eliminated two years after bill enactment. The bill also removes the “start of construction” provision and requires projects to be “placed in service” to begin collecting the ITC or PTC.

The advanced manufacturing tax credit (45X) is preserved at full value in the draft bill through 2031 before ending without a phase-down in 2032. Wind products are excluded from the credit starting in 2028.

The bill also adds restrictions to 45X, 48E and 45Y for any involvement with “prohibited foreign entities,” formally known as a “Foreign Entity of Concern,” classified under a 2021 defense bill. For the ITC and PTC, credits can’t be claimed if the facility includes “any material assistance from a prohibited foreign entity.” The bill further defines “material assistance” as “Any component, subcomponent, or critical mineral included in such property is extracted, processed, recycled, manufactured or assembled by a prohibited foreign entity, or any design of such property was based on any copyright or patent held by a prohibited foreign entity or any know-how or trade secret provided by a prohibited foreign entity.”

Solar industry trade organization SEIA said the bill will “effectively dismantle the most successful industrial onshoring effort in U.S. history.”

“This legislation will cause hundreds of American factories to close, eliminate tens of thousands of jobs, force electric bills to skyrocket for everyone, weaken the reliability of our electric grid, and eliminate our capacity to compete with China. This disruption would devastate local, red-state economies, with more than 75% of at-risk factories and investments concentrated in these communities,” said SEIA president and CEO Abigail Ross Hopper in a press statement.

“The solar and storage industry appreciates the many competing interests faced by this Congress and stands ready to work together with our elected officials to ensure that American energy dominance prevails. The current proposals do not achieve that. Our nation’s energy security and national security are on the line,” she continued.

The House Ways and Means Committee will now mark up the bill before voting on it and sending it to the full House of Representatives.",https://www.solarpowerworldonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/congress.jpg,N,,2025-05-13 15:12:45.544806

A multi-phase project of UofL's Christina Lee Brown Envirome Institute, the university said it's the result of more than two years of research, construction and planting, spanning 0.65 acres with 119 new trees and 242 new shrubs.

The forest is much more than a public park, however. UofL said it's a space ""for scientific inquiry into the impact of intense urban greening on human health and the wider urban environment.""

“The vitality of downtown Louisville is inextricably linked to the vitality of the University of Louisville and the entire metropolitan community,” said UofL President Gerry Bradley. “This beautifully renewed green space will benefit not only residents and visitors to the downtown area, it also will serve as a research site for groundbreaking investigations into the connection between trees and health by UofL researchers.”

According to a release, a 30-year lease with Louisville Metro Government allows the Envirome Institute to use Founders Square as an outdoor public laboratory. Researchers can use the park to monitor air and surface temperatures, air quality and how the forest can affect temperature and humidity in the area.

The park has been densely planted with trees, shrubs and ground cover to optimize cooling and reduce urban heat, the university said. The project builds on the university's Green Heart Project, which found trees can lower residents' inflammation levels.

“The Trager MicroForest is part of the wider mission of the Envirome Institute to pursue knowledge about health,” said Aruni Bhatnagar, director of the Christina Lee Brown Institute. “This little forest will not only provide a pleasant space to spend time in downtown Louisville, but it will also help us test how dense urban planting can improve human health. The results of this experiment could inspire and inform the planting of microforests in cities worldwide.”

UofL said the microforest is considered part of its New Vision of Health Campus. Located just across Fifth Street, it will include offices and public spaces to study how environmental factors affect human health.

With phase one now complete, phase two will begin in late 2025, UofL said.",https://s7d2.scene7.com/is/image/TWCNews/uofl_trager_microforest_ky_0513,N,,2025-05-13 14:45:21.277623

WARREN, Mich. — General Motors expects to pioneer a new ""groundbreaking"" EV battery technology that the automaker says will reduce costs and boost profitability of its largest electric SUVs and trucks.

GM is targeting the new batteries and chemistry inside them — called lithium manganese-rich (LMR) prismatic battery cells — to be used in full-size electric vehicles such as its Chevrolet Silverado and Escalade IQ beginning in 2028.

The new batteries use more-prevalent, less-expensive minerals like manganese instead of larger amounts of cobalt and nickel that are currently used in EV batteries from GM and other automakers.

Different EV battery chemistries impact everything from the range and safety of EVs to energy efficiency and charging capabilities, among other needs.

""LMR unlocks the premium range and performance at an affordable cost,"" said Kurt Kelty, GM vice president of battery, propulsion and sustainability, during a media event at the automaker's tech and design campus in suburban Detroit. ""It's a game-changing battery for electric trucks.""

GM's first-to-market expectations come after crosstown rival Ford Motor earlier this month announced its intention to launch what it similarly called ""game-changing"" LMR batteries before 2030.

GM

LMR batteries have been around for decades, but they've historically offered a far shorter lifespan, according to Sam Abuelsamid, vice president of market research at auto advisory firm Telemetry.

It's a problem GM believes it has solved with its LMR batteries, which are being developed in partnership with LG Energy Solution.

Ultium Cells, a GM and LG Energy Solution joint venture, plans to start commercial production of LMR prismatic cells in the U.S. by 2028, with preproduction expected to begin at an LG Energy Solution facility by late 2027.

LMR prismatic cells

Prismatic cells references the form, or shape, of the square battery cells. They've historically been used in hybrid vehicles such as the Toyota Prius, followed more recently by EVs.

GM, for several years, has been using rectangular ""pouch"" cells in the U.S., while also also utilizing cylindric cells in China. GM says it first started researching manganese-rich lithium-ion battery cells in 2015, accelerating the technology development in recent years.

GM expects the new prismatic LMR batteries and supporting technologies to cut hundreds of pounds from its large EVs. The new battery packs will have 50% fewer parts as well as a significant reduction in the number of modules, or cell cases, inside the vehicles' battery packs, GM said.

Photo by Steve Fecht for General Motors

For EVs, battery cells are typically combined into battery modules, which are then installed in battery packs that get integrated into a vehicle.

Kelty said the LMR batteries will be supplemental to GM's current pouch cell batteries, formerly known as Ultium, as well as upcoming LFP — lithium iron phosphate — prismatic battery cells that are expected to be used in smaller, entry-level EVs.

""We're going through a massive growth phase in our EV side of the business,"" Kelty said, noting that GM has surpassed Tesla as the top EV battery manufacturer in North America. ""We're really building a electrification powerhouse.""

GM expects the LMR prismatic battery cells to have 33% higher energy density, providing addition miles of range, compared with the best-performing LFP cells, but at a comparable cost.

Kelty declined to discuss the specific cost of the batteries, commonly measured in dollars per kilowatt-hour, or kWh, but confirmed the company achieved a cost reduction of $60 per kilowatt-hour last year.

Scott Mlyn | CNBC

The average cost of battery packs for EVs dropped 20% to $115 per kilowatt-hour in 2024, according to a BloombergNEF battery price survey released in December.

Abuelsamid, a former engineer turned analyst, estimates GM's packs with LMR prismatic batteries are likely around a cost of $80 to $90 per kWh. That compares with at least $125 per kWh for GM's current batteries, he said.

GM declined to disclose whether vehicles with LMR batteries will be profitable upon launch. The Detroit automaker said nearly 50% of its current EVs in the first quarter were variable profit positive, meaning they generated enough revenue to cover their production costs.

'Next step'

Kelty described LMR as the ""next step"" in GM's EV plans. The automaker has sunk billions of dollars into electrification as part of an ongoing, yet scaled back, plan under GM CEO Mary Barra.

In 2021, Barra said GM would exclusively offer EVs by 2035, investing $35 billion between 2020 and 2025. The company has since said customer demand — which has been slower than expected — will dictate its EV plans. It also has not disclosed its total EV investment thus far.

GM believes the LMR batteries will assist in lowering barriers for consumer adoption of EVs. Most notably, concerns around cost and range. Other hurdles, such as charging infrastructure and consumer education, remain.

CR’s March 2025 nationally-representative survey found overwhelming support for energy efficiency standards among Americans across the political spectrum

WASHINGTON, D.C. — The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is reportedly planning to shutter its long-running Energy Star program.

Sara Enright, senior director of safety and sustainability policy at Consumer Reports, said: “Energy Star empowers consumers, guides businesses, and supports innovation—all while saving Americans a lot of money. It has delivered huge benefits for the economy, public health, and the environment for more than three decades. We urge officials to find a way to keep this program going.”

Shanika Whitehurst, associate director for Consumer Reports’ product sustainability, research and testing team, said: “If this popular program goes away, it would be a big loss for the millions of consumers who’ve come to recognize and trust the label every time they shop for major products and appliances. The loss would hit especially hard at a time when people are dealing with unpredictable energy bills and trying to cut expenses.”

Launched by the EPA in 1992 during the Bush administration, the Energy Star program has become a cornerstone of the U.S. energy efficiency movement. It sets voluntary standards for appliances, electronics, lighting, and HVAC systems—and awards a widely trusted label to products that meet or exceed those standards. The blue Energy Star logo is now widely visible throughout American homes, stores, and workplaces.

By raising awareness of energy-efficient products and helping consumers make informed choices, Energy Star has driven market demand for innovation to drive down home energy costs. Today, more than 40% of Fortune 500 companies participate in the program, and over 800,000 product models have earned Energy Star certification. According to the EPA, every dollar invested in Energy Star has delivered nearly $350 in energy cost savings for U.S. households and businesses. Households using Energy Star certified products save an average of $450 annually on utility bills—real relief for consumers facing rising energy prices.

CR’s March 2025 nationally representative survey of 2,291 U.S. adults found overwhelming support for energy efficiency standards. Eighty-seven percent of Americans—including 94% of Democrats and 82% of Republicans—agree that home appliances for sale in the U.S. should be required to meet minimum levels of energy efficiency.

When asked what an “energy efficient” label means to them, 73% of Americans said it signals cost savings on energy bills compared to an appliance without the “energy efficient” label. A little under half (46%) said such a label indicates a lower environmental impact than an appliance without that label.

How Do We Determine the Best Hybrid Cars for the Money?

Often, a hybrid powertrain comes at a higher cost. To determine if a hybrid vehicle’s added expense is worth the cash for buyers, we devised an efficiency-cost rating, which is simply the EPA’s combined mpg rating divided by the base price (MSRP plus destination charge). We then multiply that result by 1,000. A high mpg rating and low price provide a high efficiency-cost rating. The higher the score, the better it is.

This list is composed of model-year 2025 hybrids without a plug, and we don’t account for vehicle equipment levels, quality judgments, cost of car ownership or any variances from EPA mileage estimates. The goal here is to pay the least for the most mileage, barring all other considerations. We also denote where the vehicle is assembled to account for any tariffs that could affect the price of the car.

The health of Hoosiers and Indiana’s environment may bear some of the costs of massive cuts the Trump administration is calling for at the U.S. EPA, according to a former agency official and local advocates.
“That would be devastating and really eviscerate the people and programs currently serving Hoosiers and others,” Shore said.
The Sierra Club put together an online dashboard to track the effects the Trump administration’s EPA cuts have related to coal pollution.
“Without these rules being enforced there will be thousands and thousands of tons of extra air pollution, extra water pollution,” Anderson said.","President Trump has proposed a 55% cut to the U.S. EPA's budget.

EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin has proposed further cuts to his own agency.

These cuts could create more pollution to Indiana's air and water, advocates say.

The health of Hoosiers and Indiana’s environment may bear some of the costs of massive cuts the Trump administration is calling for at the U.S. EPA, according to a former agency official and local advocates.

Indiana already ranks dead last in a U.S. News and World Report ranking of state's natural environment based examining air and water quality as well as overall pollution. The state also has some of the most polluted waterways in the country and the largest number of toxic coal ash ponds of any other state.

Advocates say the plans announced by President Donald Trump and EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin to slash the agency’s budget and staff could affect Indiana’s water and air quality, leading to poor public health outcomes such as more asthma attacks, lost workdays due to illness, and premature deaths while continuing the state's legacy of environmental degradation from pollution.

Zeldin announced the agency would undergo a reorganization that includes cutting staffing levels to what he said were similar to when former President Ronald Reagan was in the White House. He also said he was reducing EPA’s annual budget by $300 million.

“We are driving a dagger straight into the heart of the climate change religion to drive down cost of living for American families, unleash American energy, bring auto jobs back to the U.S. and more,” Zeldin said in a recorded speech in March announcing his deregulation efforts.

Trump’s recent budget proposal calls for 55% cuts to the agency’s overall budget including nearly $2.5 billion from the Clean Water State Revolving Fund that provides low-cost financing to communities working on water quality projects. This comes after his administration clawed back billions in grant funding for environmental and climate change initiatives in February, resulting in Indiana potentially losing $100 million in federal assistance.

Former EPA official on Indiana’s future

Debra Shore, former administrator for EPA’s Region 5, which oversees Indiana and other Midwest states, told IndyStar cuts to staffing and funding would undermine the agency's ability to respond to emergencies, weaken clean air and water enforcement and reduce monitoring for pollutants like PFAS and lead.

“That would be devastating and really eviscerate the people and programs currently serving Hoosiers and others,” Shore said.

The EPA in 2024 awarded and spent more than $63 billion across the U.S., but the agency only needs 35% of that total to accomplish its mission, the EPA press office said in a written statement to IndyStar.

""We will be exceptional stewards of taxpayer dollars with a laser focus on EPA’s core mission of protecting human health and the environment and Powering the Great American Comeback, which is anchored in providing clean air, land, and water for ALL Americans,"" the statement says.

But Trump’s cuts to the EPA could result in Indiana losing out on another $130 million in grant money meant for safe drinking water, according to data from the Environmental Protection Network, an organization of former EPA staffers. The group also projects the cuts would slash 65% of EPA’s Region 5 workforce — about 700 employees — including from its enforcement, emergency response and drinking water programs.

These employees work directly with Hoosiers on environmental issues.

The full extent of the proposed cuts are still unknown, but whatever they are will also affect communities where some of this money would be headed. Shore, who helped oversee some of EPA’s work in Indiana when she was in office during the Biden presidency, said the federal money was a boon for Indiana communities.

“Those were direct injections into local economies, because the contractors doing that work were going to be hired locally,” Shore said. “Many of the goods and supplies that were going to be used were American made or even locally provided, and the workers live and work in those communities.”

Hoosier advocates react to EPA cuts

David Van Gilder, senior policy and legal director at Hoosier Environmental Council, said the Trump administration's contention that every federal agency is rife with waste, abuse and fraud is a false premise. He added the idea the EPA could do the same heavy-lifting work with half of its people and resources doesn’t make sense.

“When it comes to federal or state agencies doing important work, there is a reason you have scientists and analysts focusing on one specific issue and know it up and down and backward and forward,” Van Gilder said. “When you get rid of those people you not only lose that one person, but that legacy expertise and institutional knowledge, too.”

Looking back at Indiana’s history, Van Gilder said the waterways used to be a horror show. The only reason they’ve been cleaned up in any fashion is because people in agencies like the EPA are doing the work to regulate industries that pollute.

“As much as we love the jobs they produce and the economic engine they have been for Indiana, they do not self-regulate,” Van Gilder said.

Had industry not been adhering to regulations, Shore said events like the Canadian wildfire smoke would be much worse for the health of Hoosiers as they would have been exposed to even more dangerous chemicals.

“If we hadn’t done such a good job of reducing emissions from steel mills and power plants, and so on,"" Shore said, ""people would have died.”

Cuts could worsen coal pollution

While Hoosiers may lose out on federal grant money and assistance from the EPA during disasters, coal could once again get a boost from lax regulations.

The Sierra Club put together an online dashboard to track the effects the Trump administration’s EPA cuts have related to coal pollution. The interactive map gives users any idea on how much pollution could be avoided if air and water rules are upheld.

Rolling back rules like the agency’s Good Neighbor Plan, mercury and air standards and effluent limitations would leave Hoosiers exposed to dangerous pollutants, said Megan Andersson of the Hoosier Chapter of the Sierra Club.

“Without these rules being enforced there will be thousands and thousands of tons of extra air pollution, extra water pollution,” Anderson said. “That means more premature deaths for Hoosiers, more asthma attacks, more lost workdays due to illness, and so on.”

The EPA cuts could also lead to reduced oversight and monitoring of the harmful emissions from coal plants, Shore said. Opening the door for coal to regain some foothold in the energy world is a sort of attack on the clean energy sources that contributed to less pollution and healthier air, she said.

Tony Mendoza, senior attorney with Sierra Club, said all of these cuts and rollbacks undermine the ability of the federal government to regulate industry.

“The destruction of government capacity to regulate creates opportunities for the worst actors to get away with violating emissions standards,” Mendoza said.

Given President Donald Trump’s longtime derision of clean energy and his desire to boost American oil, gas and coal, it’s no surprise LPO would be on the chopping block.
The internet, the moon landing, atomic energy — and the industries built on top of them — were all the product of government investment.
Congress finally has a big idea for AI regulations: It wants to stop states from issuing any at all, for a decade.
POLITICO’s Pieter Haeck reported for Pro subscribers on the visit, which will come as the Trump administration seems to be escalating its trade war with the European Union.","A Department of Energy program beloved by the tech right might become the latest victim of the Trump administration’s war on “woke.”

As part of the House Energy & Commerce Committee’s reconciliation budget text released late Sunday night, the majority of the hundreds of billions of dollars authorized for the Department of Energy’s Loan Programs Office would be rescinded.

The LPO was pumping hundreds of millions, and in some cases billions, of dollars into speculative and future-tech projects under the administration of President Joe Biden, funded by the Inflation Reduction Act. While many of the projects were part of a liberal-friendly clean energy push, the LPO also funded bipartisan or even somewhat GOP-coded projects like the restarting of the Palisades nuclear plant in Covert, Michigan.

Its potential gutting prompted immediate anguish from one conservative wonk, who compared the Republican-controlled Congress to an environmental group: “Who needs the NRDC to wreck nuclear when we have House Energy and Commerce?”, wrote Emmet Penney, a pro-nuclear energy scholar at the right-leaning Foundation for American Innovation, on X.

In one sense it’s obvious why the LPO would be an easy target for Washington Republicans. The office, created in 2005, went largely inactive for a decade starting in 2011 after Republicans made a massive national story out of its investment in the failed solar panel firm Solyndra, which defaulted on a $535 million LPO loan. When Congress revived it and boosted its lending authority to more than $400 billion, the money went largely to fund Biden’s clean-energy goals.

Given President Donald Trump’s longtime derision of clean energy and his desire to boost American oil, gas and coal, it’s no surprise LPO would be on the chopping block. DOGE has already cut 60 percent of the LPO’s staff.

But politically it’s not as simple as that. In the current energy-hungry tech environment, this is actually an issue that splits Republicans. A growing coalition on the right and center-right has been vocal in its support for the program — saying it’s exactly the kind of risk-taking venture the U.S. government should be involved in if it really wants to usher in the shiny, sci-fi future promised by prominent figures on the right like Elon Musk.

Penney, as part of a think tank joint-venture “Techno-Industrial Policy Playbook” published last week, wrote a proposal for “Advancing Nuclear with the Loan Programs Office” which argued that “If America wants to win, it needs to invest in radically expanding its nuclear fleet.”

He lays out a conservative-friendly case that the LPO could revitalize American energy by re-opening currently shuttered nuclear plants, as well as revitalizing the heartland by converting coal plants to nuclear and creating a pipeline to commercialize prototype nuclear systems. (Earlier this year Secretary of Energy Chris Wright played up his approval of the second and third disbursements from the LPO to Michigan’s Palisades plant, launched under the Biden administration last year.)

This is more than just a policy disagreement over who, how, and where new sources of power should be funded — it’s one about whether Republicans should take a stronger policy hand in directing the American state and economy.

“We have the nationalist developmental side [of the GOP], then we have the free marketers, and these people don’t really know how to get along,” Penney told DFD. “The institutional path dependency is towards the more traditional GOP stance, and we’re now watching that play out with the politics of the LPO.”

In large part, this debate is over the role of government support in tech innovation — a policy very much under fire right now, but arguably the bedrock of the whole economy we live in. The internet, the moon landing, atomic energy — and the industries built on top of them — were all the product of government investment.

For a while during the Biden administration it seemed like Washington had found fresh bipartisan enthusiasm for such projects, most notably in the form of the CHIPS and Science Act, which authorized massive subsidies for semiconductor manufacturing and domestic research (although Congressional spending often fell short, especially in the case of the research component). But the all-out war waged by Trump, Office of Management and Budget Director Russell Vought and Elon Musk’s DOGE on non-defense spending has caught that bill and an endless list of similar federal programs in its crosshairs, with Trump even calling in his address to a joint session of Congress in March to end CHIPS and Science.

That’s left voices on the right like Penney’s — and their unexpected allies on the left and center, like The American Prospect’s Ryan Cooper, who called the LPO one of the “hidden gems of American government” in lamenting its planned elimination — largely out in the cold. Sen. Todd Young (R-Ind.), one of CHIPS and Science’s key architects, petitioned the Trump administration in February to save American research funding, and last week re-introduced a bipartisan 2021 bill that would restore much of it, but has failed to gain much traction.

“It feels like we’re at a time of reprisal,” Penney said, making a case that the Trump administration’s aggressive cost-cutting could threaten future innovation.

“This really hurts nuclear, but I also think that it might even threaten the bipartisan consensus … the base of Democratic support for nuclear is premised on faith in the federal government, and when you deteriorate that faith, it will poison the water on Democratic support for nuclear.”

It’s unclear what the LPO’s ultimate fate might be — the Trump administration’s own draft budget left it largely untouched, while Trump issued an executive order on Friday directing a quadrupling of the U.S.’ nuclear power capacity, something that seems unlikely without the LPO given the extent to which it allows government to take on much of the inherent risk in investing in nuclear.

So far, however, the burgeoning tech right has hoped Trump’s alliance with prominent tech figures, stated commitment to revitalizing American industry, and thirst to dominate China would win out over his revanchist obsession with tearing down the modern administrative state.

But if the steamroller approach the Trump administration and the GOP-controlled Congress have taken to experimental programs like the LPO is any indicator, they might find themselves in the same boat as other parts of his coalition like pro-Palestinian activists, strict pro-life Catholics, and even right-leaning immigrants, burned on key issues after lending Trump their political capital.

an ai moratorium?

Congress finally has a big idea for AI regulations: It wants to stop states from issuing any at all, for a decade.

Last night, Republicans added a surprise piece of language to the budget reconciliation bill that would put a 10-year moratorium on state and local AI laws. POLITICO’s Mohar Chatterjee and Anthony Adragna reported for Pro subscribers on how the move by the House Energy & Commerce Committee would re-set the terms of AI regulation for the rest of the country.

It’s far from clear whether this is politically viable, or even legal. But it comes as tech giants are pushing Washington in the same direction.

POLITICO’s Brendan Bordelon and Chase DiFeliciantonio reported today on a campaign by companies including OpenAI, Meta, Google, IBM and venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz to convince Congress to pass AI rules before the states — in particular California — do the same.

California lawmakers responded to the latest moves in Congress with harsh criticism. Democratic state Sen. Scott Wiener called it “illegal and bad,” telling POLITICO’s Sacramento tech reporter Tyler Katzenberger, “This latest power play to try to broadly ban states from protecting the public — it’s a gold rush,” adding, “We need to say no.”

an eu envoy

The EU’s tech chief Henna Virkkunen will visit the U.S. this week. POLITICO’s Pieter Haeck reported for Pro subscribers on the visit, which will come as the Trump administration seems to be escalating its trade war with the European Union. A representative told Pieter that Virkkunen’s agenda is “still being finalized.”

Last Thursday Virkkunen said she spoke with Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg about “compliance” with the European Union’s Digital Services Act and Digital Markets Act. The EU stuck Meta with a €200 million fine in April for violating the DMA.

It's still early in what could be a lengthy and contentious process for the federal budget. The big issue is how President Donald Trump and Republican lawmakers will find enough spending to cut to continue the tax cuts first passed in 2017.

Several tax credits created or expanded in the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act that focus on clean energy are on the chopping block in draft amendments to be considered Tuesday by the House Ways and Means Committee.

Clean energy industry groups and others are already gearing up to fight the proposal, and some Congressional Republicans have previously expressed a desire not to terminate the tax credits.

What energy and electric vehicle credits would change

The proposal would essentially nix tax credits for home energy and electric vehicles in the IRA.

According to the plan, the residential clean energy credit, which provides a 30% tax credit for home solar panels, batteries, geothermal heat pumps and more, would expire at the end of 2025. The credit is currently set to expire at the end of 2034. The tax credit for rooftop solar panels has existed, in some form or another, since 2005.

The clean vehicle credit, which provides up to $7,500 for new electric vehicles, would also expire at the end of the year, instead of 2032. An exception would allow buyers to claim the credit during 2026 on vehicles that haven't sold 200,000 units as of the end of 2025.

The energy efficient home improvement credit, which covers items like home energy audits, heat pumps, air conditioners and water heaters, would also be cut at the end of 2025, instead of its current expiration date of 2033.

These changes, if they pass, wouldn't affect vehicles or projects purchased in 2025 -- including any purchases you may have already made with the tax benefits in mind.

Taxpayers claimed more than $6 billion under the clean energy credit and $2 billion under the energy efficient home improvement credit in 2023, the first full year they were available at the IRA's rates, according to IRS data. More than 750,000 tax returns claimed a credit for rooftop solar panels that year.

Nothing is final yet

The federal budget process is a bit more complicated than the I'm Just a Bill song in Schoolhouse Rock, but the important note at this point is that the process is only beginning.

Groups backing clean energy have already started to oppose the proposal. Abigail Ross Hopper, president of the Solar Energy Industries Association, said in a statement Monday that the changes would be devastating to efforts to build domestic manufacturing of solar technology. She also criticized the proposed cut of the residential credit for undermining ""our individual liberties and freedom to choose how we power our homes.""

More clean energy also means cleaner air and water—outcomes that improve Hoosier’s quality of life, the local environment, and people’s health.","The benefits of federal clean energy tax credits are clear. Adding diverse energy resources to Indiana’s grid increases reliability, decreases consumer costs, creates jobs, and has the potential to foster massive economic growth — to the tune of $565.7 million annually.

That is why, in 2022, the federal government created this set of tax credits to incentivize the development of clean energy infrastructure and technologies. In the first two years, $9 billion has been invested in projects across Indiana. An added $20 billion in outstanding investment for projects has been announced but not implemented. Through these tax credits, Indiana has expanded the sector and fostered economic growth to the benefit of all Hoosiers, and there should be more to come.

A new study commissioned by The Nature Conservancy shows that between now and 2032, these credits will annually generate $300.8 million through household income, $59.3 million in local, state, and federal tax revenue, and support 6,300 jobs. Further, these benefits are not isolated to only one industry but span construction, manufacturing, professional services, and the supply chain.

Despite the incredible results and the promise for future growth, these tax credits are at risk of being eliminated. The current budget talks make tax credits an easy target for federal cuts looking to reduce the debt fast. In response, 21 Republican members of the House of Representatives signed a letter showing their support for these credits. But this may not be enough to save them from being cut. That is why we urge the entire Indiana Congressional delegation to use their influence while serving on key committees to protect this potential growth engine for our state.

We can keep Indiana competitive in the national market and support local businesses. However, we must take full advantage of all the available tools, including clean energy tax credits. As the new administration works to encourage industries to return to the U.S., it is imperative to keep Indiana a desirable environment to retain and attract strong economic potential. Indiana, with its clear advantage due to a diverse energy portfolio—both in infrastructure and land—is set to benefit.

Hoosier businesses make decisions based on economic potential. The clean energy tax credits offer a proven way to foster economic growth, bolster manufacturing, lower energy costs, and attract more companies to Indiana—all while diversifying energy sources and promoting clean energy. More clean energy also means cleaner air and water—outcomes that improve Hoosier’s quality of life, the local environment, and people’s health.

In fact, of the 28 cities studied — all with a population of 600,000 and up — each one of them was experiencing what’s called land subsidence.
In all, about 80% of the sinking across the cities studied was attributed to groundwater withdrawal.
Jeremy Bricker, an associate professor of engineering at the University of Michigan, said even though Detroit is subsiding, Michigan, more broadly, is actually rising.
But 596,307 people live in parts of the city that are sinking by a rate of up to three millimeters per year.","Research published last week in the scientific journal Nature Cities also shows that Detroit is not alone. In fact, of the 28 cities studied — all with a population of 600,000 and up — each one of them was experiencing what’s called land subsidence.

That is to say: they are sinking.

Some far more than others, but Detroit’s subsidence was eighth highest among the cities studied, trailing Houston (5.22 millimeters per year); Fort Worth (4.37 millimeters per year); Dallas (3.85 millimeters per year); New York City (2.43 millimeters per year); Chicago (2.32 millimeters per year); Columbus (1.93 millimeters per year); and Seattle (1.85 millimeters per year).

Researchers concluded that groundwater extraction more broadly was a primary culprit for the subsidence in most cities, along with other factors.

See, for example, the three cities with by far the greatest amount of decline: Houston, Fort Worth and Dallas, all in a state that relies heavily on groundwater extraction for things like agriculture and other uses. In all, about 80% of the sinking across the cities studied was attributed to groundwater withdrawal.

That’s not quite the case in Detroit, however.

The slow sinking of the city is primarily due to glacial isostatic adjustment, or what the researchers shorthand to “GIA.” Basically, that’s the lingering effects of the last Ice Age some 16,000 years ago.

Although the thick ice that once covered huge chunks of the country has long since melted, the land is still reacting. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration likens it to when a soft mattress slowly returns to its original form after the person lying in gets up.

Other cities that fit into that category include New York, Philadelphia, Washington, D.C., Denver, Indianapolis, Columbus, Nashville, Chicago and Portland.

Jeremy Bricker, an associate professor of engineering at the University of Michigan, said even though Detroit is subsiding, Michigan, more broadly, is actually rising.

That’s because the state was once covered by the 5 million square mile North American Laurentide ice sheet, which in some areas was up to two miles thick.

""If you think of the whole continent in general, the places that had the glaciers, they were pushed down,"" Bricker said. ""They are gradually rebounding upwards. Most of Michigan was covered, but it's certainly possible that there are some pockets that are behaving otherwise.""

Just 0.3% of Detroit’s land area had no observed subsidence, while 97.5% had subsidence between zero and three millimeters per year. The remainder of the land had subsidence between five and 10 millimeters per year.

That doesn’t just affect roads and bridges and buildings. It affects people, as well.

The research team determined that just 32 Detroiters live in a portion of the city where there was no observed subsidence. But 596,307 people live in parts of the city that are sinking by a rate of up to three millimeters per year. The researchers found that 1,416 people are living in parts of Detroit where the subsidence is between three and five millimeters per year, and 292 live in areas where the subsidence is between five and 10 millimeters per year. Ten millimeters is about the same size as a pencil eraser.

The threat to buildings is generally low, the researchers said, but it’s definitely not a non-zero number.

Of Detroit’s stock of some 453,500 buildings, 362 were high risk and another 39 were very high risk. Put another way, that’s one of every 1,131 Detroit buildings were at high or very high risk — far fewer than San Antonio (one in every 45), Fort Worth (one in every 143) and Memphis (one in every 167).

Researchers described subsidence’s potential damage to buildings as “one of the most harmful yet less visible effects” because it “can occur even with minor changes in land motion,” essentially meaning that “infrastructure can be silently compromised over time, with damage only becoming evident when it is severe or potentially catastrophic.”

Bricker said that if subsidence occurs non-uniformly, it can present problems for the built environment.

""If you have a given site that's subsiding two millimeters on one part of a site and not on the other part, over time that's going to cause your foundation to crack, dams to crack, roadways to crack,"" Bricker said. ""Differential subsidence is a major problem ... But as far as I know, it's not as much of a concern as freeze-thaw and other things. Michigan's ground is pretty stable.""

Mike Kozak, president and partner of the engineering firm Giffels Webster, said the impact of the ground movement is difficult to determine precisely, but it should be kept in mind.

""The differential settlement is really when things matter,” Kozak said. “If you think of a building downtown, and it’s got a sidewalk out in front of it and a road next to it, if the building moves two inches down and then everything else stays at the same spot, you’re going to have visual impacts of that. You’re literally going to trip as you step out of the building, or the doors aren’t going to function.

But he also noted: ""If everything’s moving at the same time at almost unnoticeable levels, a couple millimeters a year, it’s probably less of an impact because your whole system is moving up and down, including the soils below.""

Infrastructure, such as roads, with a shorter life expectancy may see a more muted impact due to subsidence, Kozak said, because they are more frequently redesigned and reconstructed than, say, water mains or buildings that are expected to last far longer.

""I don't know that anybody on paper right now has a plan in place to worry about a whole city that's going to be three inches lower 10 years from now,"" Kozak said. ""That's certainly something that could impact a lot of properties.""",https://s3-rd-prod.crainsdetroit.com/styles/1200x630/s3/Main%20Image%20-%20Detroit_Skyline_from_River.jpg,N,,2025-05-13 14:40:48.737436

GM has deployed lithium manganese batteries in the past, including in first-generation Chevrolet Volt.

General Motors said May 13 that it will be the first automaker to deploy a new battery chemistry slated to increase range and affordability for electric vehicles.

GM and its partner LG Energy Solution plan to launch production of the technology, called lithium manganese-rich batteries, in the U.S. by 2028.

GM’s cross-town competitor Ford Motor Co. said late last month it also plans to roll out the same technology by the end of the decade.

The new “prismatic” battery cell, meaning it is stored in a more efficient rectangular shape instead of a pouch, performs at a 33% higher energy density than the best-performing lithium iron phosphate-based cell, which is currently the industry standard. The current battery pack requires a lot more nickel, which GM said comes at a comparably high cost. Batteries represent at least a third of the cost of an EV.

GM said in a statement that for longer than a decade, it had been working toward launching LMR batteries, which avoid two main hurdles of the technology: a short battery life and voltage decay.

The chemical composition of a high-nickel battery includes roughly 85% nickel, 10% manganese and 5% cobalt. The composition of LMR cells is only 35% nickel, 65% manganese, and virtually no cobalt.

The new system also integrates with GM’s current North American battery production of lithium, graphite and manganese. GM recently invested in a Norwegian synthetic graphite producer for battery technology.

GM has deployed lithium manganese batteries in the past. The first-generation Chevrolet Volt used cells with manganese spinel cathodes, according to Sam Abuelsamid, vice president of market research at Telemetry Insights.

Abuelsamid told the Detroit Free Press that the close announcements by Ford and GM reflect the competitive environment of the industry seeking to construct more durable, affordable electric vehicles with decent range.

“It's hard to say who will get LMR into volume production first, but GM seems perhaps more likely. They've already committed to 2028 with LG in one of the Ultium Cells plants and have assigned a vehicle program to use these cells,” he said, referencing the company's mention the technology will be likely suited for larger trucks and utilities. “As far as the density and cost, manganese cells have long been a known quantity and they should have no issues with the performance claims.”

In this case, it looked at the impact of climate change on racing and raising Thoroughbreds.
""During flooding, horses can become injured or stranded.
The report's analysis seems to be in line with Kentucky Derby weather patterns.","As Sovereignty splashed to victory in this year's Kentucky Derby (G1) in Louisville, Ky., it marked the seventh time in the past 17 editions of the Churchill Downs classic that it's been contested on either a sloppy or wet-fast track.

In April, Keeneland had to push back its opening weekend from Friday and Saturday, April 4 and 5 to Monday and Tuesday, April 7 and 8 after heavy rains brought flooding to the area.

Based on a United States Environmental Protection Agency report posted to its website in January, Kentucky tracks would be wise to continue to be prepare for increased wet weather. That report predicts climate change will bring increased extreme precipitation events and flooding in Kentucky, which can affect communities and economies across the state.

Unfortunately, that prediction would play out this spring when multiple rounds of heavy rain and thunderstorms impacted the area April 1-6. Flooding led to three fatalities in Central Kentucky and seven fatalities across the state. The report noted that since tracking began in 1980, all four of the billion-dollar flooding disasters to affect Kentucky occurred in 2010 or later. This spring's flooding figures to be a fifth in that category.

The report, titled ""Climate Change Connections: Kentucky (Thoroughbred Horses),"" was part of a series that highlighted climate change connections to culturally, ecologically, or economically important features of each state and territory. In this case, it looked at the impact of climate change on racing and raising Thoroughbreds.

The report noted that racing can expect a higher percentage of off-tracks in Kentucky as the trend is expected to continue. It also noted added concerns for horse farms.

""Flooding also presents challenges for horses and other livestock,"" the report said. ""During flooding, horses can become injured or stranded. Flooding can also create conditions, such as standing water, that can attract pests, such as mosquitos, which can lay eggs and spread diseases, including eastern and western equine encephalomyelitis and West Nile virus that can be harmful to humans and horses.

""In July 2023, nearly 11 inches of rain over a two-day period in Kentucky broke some local rainfall records and resulted in flash flooding that destroyed homes and displaced residents. The aftermath of the storm also created a myriad of issues for farms and horse operations. Grass fields were flooded and animals did not have anything to graze on, and fences were washed away, making it hard to keep animals contained.""

The report's analysis seems to be in line with Kentucky Derby weather patterns. The National Weather Service lists the longest stretch of wet Derby days (based on the full 24 hours) in the race's 151-year history as 2007-13 with precipitation surpassing a half-inch in four of those years. Rainfall on Derby day has surpassed an inch of rain just six times overall but half of those occasions have occurred since 2010, including the 3.15 inches that fell in 2018—a Derby day record.

This year saw 0.37 inches of rain. While fans had to deal with wet weather, on the track the Churchill crew delivered a surface that was fair to competitors.

The bigger concern this spring were the multiple rounds of heavy rain, thunderstorms, and tornadoes that impacted Kentucky April 1-6. That brought flash flooding and areal flooding, including historic and near-record river flooding along many river basins; as well as mudslides and landslides.

Forecasters predict periods of extreme weather in the Northwest will only bring more trouble in the future: the threat of rolling blackouts within the decade if the region’s current energy trends continue.
The biggest owner of these transmission lines, the federal Bonneville Power Administration, has been slow to spend on upgrades — and slow to approve new green projects until upgrades are made.
Bonneville’s parent agency, the Energy Department, declined to make officials available for an interview, but Bonneville answered written questions.
Those plants would still have to contend with transmission lines that have no room for their power.","Electric companies in Oregon and Washington are hurtling toward deadlines to stop using power generated by coal, gas and other fuels that contribute to global warming. Yet the states are nowhere near achieving their goals, and the dramatic consequences are already being felt.

During a winter storm in January 2024, for example, the Northwest barely had enough power to meet demand as homeowners cranked up electric heaters and energy prices surged to more than $1,000 per megawatt-hour, or 18 times higher than the usual price. Power lines were so congested that owners of the transmission network made an extra $100 million selling access to the highest bidder.

Multiple utilities were operating in states of emergency during the storm, preparing for rotating power outages.

The storm “highlighted a tipping point and demonstrated how close the region is to a resource adequacy crisis,” the Western Power Pool, a regionwide organization of utilities, wrote in its assessment of the event.

Price spikes like this are one reason customers of major utilities in Oregon are paying 50% more on their power bills than they were in 2019. The number of utility customers disconnected last year for failure to pay soared to 70,000, the highest number on record.

Forecasters predict periods of extreme weather in the Northwest will only bring more trouble in the future: the threat of rolling blackouts within the decade if the region’s current energy trends continue.

Wind, solar and other renewables are the only forms of power that can be added to solve the problem, thanks to Oregon’s and Washington’s green energy mandates. Yet better transmission lines are needed to carry new energy sources in the windy and sunny eastern parts of the region to big cities west of the Cascade Mountain Range.

Experts say adding transmission lines in corridors that currently lack them would also enable utilities to keep power flowing when ice storms or wildfires threaten other parts of the grid.

The biggest owner of these transmission lines, the federal Bonneville Power Administration, has been slow to spend on upgrades — and slow to approve new green projects until upgrades are made.

Bonneville’s parent agency, the Energy Department, declined to make officials available for an interview, but Bonneville answered written questions.

“The potential for blackouts in the Pacific Northwest is incredibly low,” the agency said. “Grid planners and operators will continue to ensure reliability.”

Washington and Oregon lawmakers failed to address the Bonneville bottleneck when they approved clean energy mandates in 2019 and 2021, as ProPublica and OPB reported recently.

Oregon Rep. Ken Helm, a Portland-area Democrat who was a sponsor of the 2021 legislation, said the failure to prioritize transmission lines wasn’t the only flaw with the legislation. He said the bill failed to provide accountability, having no penalties for when a utility did not reach certain deadlines for acquiring either solar or wind energy. Helm said now, House Bill 2021 is “dead letter law.”

“Senators and representatives like me, we cannot continue to believe our own PR, that we have been successful in promoting a renewable electricity future,” said Helm, a member of the House Committee on Climate, Energy and Environment. “We are not heading in that direction, and we’re going to have to take action to change that or nothing will happen.”

Some lawmakers tried to play catch-up this year. Legislators in each state drew up plans for state transmission authorities that could finance improvements independent of utilities and Bonneville. Those efforts failed.

“Oregon desperately needs to take some leadership here,” said Nicole Hughes, executive director of the group Renewable Northwest, which advocates for weaning the region off of fossil fuels.

The Northwest’s situation is only expected to get worse. The region’s electrical demand is forecast to double over the next 20 years, in large part because data centers, rewarded with tax breaks in both Oregon and Washington, are driving an increase in power use the region hasn’t experienced since the early 1980s.

Abandoning Oregon’s and Washington’s renewable energy laws wouldn’t help, Oregon’s Citizens’ Utility Board says, because new fossil fuel power plants would cost ratepayers more than wind or solar. Those plants would still have to contend with transmission lines that have no room for their power.

The region’s utilities, meanwhile, say they’d like to add 29,000 megawatts of generating capacity over the next 10 years — an unprecedented addition that would be roughly equivalent to all the electricity that the Northwest currently consumes at any given time. The projects on their to-do list are powered entirely by renewable energy.

Yet the utilities added only a little over half the power to their systems that they planned for last year. In fact, of the 469 projects that applied to connect to Bonneville’s grid in the past decade, the only one to win the agency’s approval was in 2022. Growth in green energy in 2024 came from projects that began seeking a connection to Bonneville’s grid prior to 2015 or that connected to smaller transmission networks owned by private utilities.

If the utilities continue to fall as short of their goals as they did in 2024, then projections from the Western Electricity Coordinating Council suggest residents will spend the equivalent of nearly a month annually under the threat of brownouts — the inability to power all the circuits in a household — or blackouts.

“In the next few years, we may start having to make some tough choices about the availability of electricity,” Hughes said.

Hughes has spent 20 years in the renewables industry.

“A fully funded Energy Star program is particularly important for meeting the Trump administration’s goal of reducing Americans’ energy bills,” the letter said.
Energy Star is so ubiquitous, nearly 90% of American consumers recognize it, the New York Times said, citing the government.
“Eliminating the Energy Star program would directly contradict this administration’s promise to reduce household energy costs,” Paula Glover, president of the nonprofit coalition Alliance to Save Energy, told CNN.
“For just $32 million a year, Energy Star helps American families save over $40 billion in annual energy costs.","Any budget-aware, environmentally conscious consumer scouting out new appliances knows to look for the Energy Star label.

The familiar blue-and-white logo – stuck on refrigerators, stoves, dishwashers, heat pumps, washers, dryers, water heaters and air conditioners – signifies cost savings and efficiency.

But the program, run by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, could be in jeopardy, according to major media outlets.

CNN broke the news last week about the Trump Administration’s plans to shut down Energy Star as part of an EPA reorganization.

President Donald Trump is looking to do away not only with the EPA’s Energy Star division but also with a division focused on climate change, CNN reported.

Shutting down Energy Star would be bad for the public, according to New York Times “Your Money” columnist Ron Lieber.

“It’s a useful seal of approval, a signal of outsize efficiency and the lower utility bills that you’ll pay over time,” Lieber wrote.

Pointing to a document on the EPA website, Lieber says the government claims $500 billion in savings for homes and businesses over the past three decades.

The Associated Press brought the savings closer to home for readers, noting the program says a household with Energy Star products can save $450 a year through lower energy costs.

According to Sarah Gleeson, climate solutions research manager at the climate action nonprofit Project Drawdown, if Energy Star disappears, it will be more difficult for consumers to have trustworthy information about products’ energy use, the AP reported.

Details about the proposed overhaul of the EPA are skimpy.

“The EPA did not confirm directly it was ending the program…” the AP reported, “but said the reorganization ‘is delivering organizational improvements to the personnel structure that will directly benefit the American people and better advance the agency’s core mission, while Powering the Great American Comeback.’”

The New York Times also reported the planned cuts, citing agency documents and a recording of an internal meeting.

“EPA managers announced during a staff meeting on Monday that divisions that oversee climate change and energy efficiency would be eliminated as part of an agency reorganization,” the newspaper reported on May 6. “That includes the EPA’s climate change office as well as the division that oversees Energy Star.”

The Washington Post similarly reported on the Trump team’s intentions, citing three people briefed on the matter as well as slide presentations obtained by Democrats on the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee.

The Post reported that the fate is unknown of federal tax credits for home builders who build to Energy Star standards and homeowners who make energy efficient upgrades, such as installing certain kinds of doors, windows and skylights.

Outlier in the White House

The idea of doing away with Energy Star isn’t a new one for Trump, according to CNN.

He floated the idea during his first administration, the network said.

Trump appears to be an outlier among occupants of the Oval Office.

“It’s had widespread support from all presidents except for Trump,” Steve Nadel, executive director of the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy, told the New York Times.

The program has also enjoyed bipartisan support, and with good reason.

CNN described Energy Star as “a longstanding public-private partnership certifying energy efficient appliances and helping consumers find products and tax credits to bring down the cost of energy efficient appliances.”

More than 1,000 companies, organizations and cities – including Philadelphia – last month wrote to EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin in support of the program, according to Politico’s E&E News publication.

“A fully funded Energy Star program is particularly important for meeting the Trump administration’s goal of reducing Americans’ energy bills,” the letter said. “Our companies have devoted considerable time and resources to partnering with Energy Star because it works for business. We respectfully urge you to stand with us in support of Energy Star by ensuring that it remains well-funded and expertly staffed at EPA.”

The Sierra Club, one of the nation’s foremost environmental groups, issued a less diplomatic statement to the AP.

“For an administration who keeps claiming the country is facing an ‘energy emergency,’ Trump continues to attack any and all efforts aimed at saving energy through efficiency,” Xavier Boatright, deputy legislative director for clean energy and electrification at Sierra Club, said in a statement to the news agency.

Santa Claus-level recognition

Energy Star launched in 1992 under President George H.W. Bush. Its label “provides simple, credible, and unbiased information that consumers and businesses rely on to make well-informed decisions,” according to the Energy Star website.

Energy Star is so ubiquitous, nearly 90% of American consumers recognize it, the New York Times said, citing the government.

“It’s an easy way for them to identify high energy-efficiency equipment,” Nadel told the newspaper.

“It has brand recognition and consumer trust that only Santa Claus can compete with,” Christine Egan, head of Collaborative Labeling and Appliance Standards Program, an international nonprofit dedicated to energy-efficient appliances, told the Washington Post.

The EPA and its private-sector partners – including almost 40 of Fortune 500 companies – “deliver cost-saving energy efficiency solutions that protect the environment, improve air quality and protect public health,” the program said.

“Eliminating the Energy Star program would directly contradict this administration’s promise to reduce household energy costs,” Paula Glover, president of the nonprofit coalition Alliance to Save Energy, told CNN. “For just $32 million a year, Energy Star helps American families save over $40 billion in annual energy costs. That’s a return of $350 for every federal dollar invested.”

The program has powerful allies on Capitol Hill.

CNN reported that U.S. Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, chair of the Senate Appropriations Committee, said the Trump administration’s decision to eliminate Energy Star left her “baffled.”

“I know that my constituents like knowing what the energy usage is of a particular appliance so that they can factor that into their buying decisions,” Collins told CNN.

If Energy Star evaporates, consumers can still find some appliance efficiency guidance in the bright yellow EnergyGuide stickers overseen by the Federal Trade Commission, according to the Washington Post.

There are downsides, however.

Nadel told the Post EnergyGuide is not as “clear or effective” as Energy Star. It covers fewer appliances and its information is outdated, he told the newspaper.

That said, according to the Post, “you can use the label to guide you toward appliances on the more efficient end of the spectrum.”",https://assets-varnish.triblive.com/2025/05/8497393_web1_8482113-624b249d8f2d45b5bda6dc408275ea8a.jpg,N,,2025-05-13 14:46:42.342949

If the Clean School Bus Program lives on, one electric vehicle insider told School Transportation News funding could be funneled toward more propane school buses.
This left the bus unusable during Montana’s harsh winter.” Last July, the World Resources Institute’s Electric School Bus Initiative reported that while the EPA had by that point funded more than 8,000 electric school buses through the EPA Clean School Bus Program, demand for ESBs is outpacing funding.
“School districts across the country continue to grow their electric school bus fleets,” she added.","School districts are contemplating how to best move forward with the cleanest-emitting school bus that best meets their individual needs, be that an electric school bus (ESB), one fueled by propane, or a cleaner diesel variety.

Several factors lead to the uncertainty over more widespread adoption of ESBs. Pricing, infrastructure and range remain concerns, and Lion Electric customers are still figuring out their next moves amid the company’s auction following financial trouble. But none are bigger than the the fate of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) five-year, $5 billion Clean School Bus Program.

Some anxiety eased in late February, after the Trump administration a month earlier put a temporary pause on award distribution, despite a memo from the EPA CFO that all program funds appropriated by the IIJA and IRA should continue to flow. Last month, the National Association for Pupil Transportation (NAPT) announced funding through the 2023 grant competition awards is now accessible.

By the end of 2024, the EPA made three rounds of awards to 1,344 school districts, totaling some $2.8 billion. Over 98 percent of those funds have gone toward purchasing ESBs.

NAPT noted it is not clear whether the EPA plans to award the remaining $2.2 billion as was authorized by Congress or to let its authorization run out, adding the program has received some strong support from senators in states where electric buses were being purchased and in at least one state where they are being manufactured.

The EPA did not respond to questions for this article. If the Clean School Bus Program lives on, one electric vehicle insider told School Transportation News funding could be funneled toward more propane school buses.

Meanwhile, Blue Bird used its first quarter results to address the impact of the federal funding pause on ESB deliveries through the Clean School Bus Program. Some

750 ESBs were sold or scheduled for production and delivery, whereas 250 were awarded with funding paused. Blue Bird initiated a reprioritized production plan to build fully funded buses earlier and push back build dates for ordered buses where EPA and federal funding was paused.

The company said it is processing new ESB orders attached to state and local funding and has confirmed political support for the Clean School Bus Program from elected officials in Washington, D.C. Blue Bird also indicated it has lowered its range of annual forecasted ESB deliveries from 1,300 to 1,000 buses.

The company noted uncertainty over the impact of tariffs means it will explore sourcing and other options with suppliers. All applicable government tariffs will be passed through to the end customer, with a potential five percent increase on all Blue Bird non-ESB buses expected by the end of February, should the tariffs on components be applied as originally proposed. School districts are exploring available options.

The non-profit Vermont Energy Investment Corp. (VEIC) has a clean transportation team specializing in programs and projects supporting electric vehicle fleet adoption and alternative fuel vehicle technology.

VEIC published a report last September for the Montana Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ) on ESB performance, summarizing evaluation activities and results associated with ES deployments in the program over the 2023-2024 academic school year.

The report found ESBs performed well in all weather conditions and route types. In extremely cold conditions, vehicle efficiency was reduced by up to 40 percent. However, ESBs were found to start up more consistently and reliably than diesel buses. ESBs also had better acceleration and quieter operation than diesel buses, but a lower top speed. Each ESB averaged $1,575 in annual fuel savings compared to diesel buses.

The report indicated primary vehicle downtime causes were related to components outside of the electric drivetrain. Resolving these issues proved more challenging with some vendors than others.

Incorporating feedback from interviews with 15 school transportation managers, school bus drivers and mechanics who engaged the most with ESBs in this program, the final section of the report offers key guidance for future ESB deployments in Montana, including in the areas of training and support, charge management, regenerative braking, and charging strategies.

Dan Rispens, superintendent of East Helena (Montana) Public Schools, noted his district received a grant through Montana’s Department of Environmental Quality that was derived from the Volkswagen settlement of 2016-2017.

“Grant funds offset approximately 80 percent of the purchase price of our bus,” said Rispens. “We were motivated by the prospect of new technology and reduced operating costs, but the primary force in our decision was grant funding.”

Its Lion Electric C bus was ordered in 2021 and delivery was accepted last August. Rispens said the district received EPA rebates to supply three additional Lion Electric buses, but East Helena passed on purchasing them given Lion Electric’s current financial status.

Speaking to the challenges East Helena Public Schools has encountered with its electric bus, “delivery timelines are challenging due to backlog in manufacturing and supply chain disruptions,” Rispens said.

“Our vendor does not have a nationwide network of dealers, so any technical assistance or warranty work is done by remote consult or sending technicians out on the road, making it cumbersome and complicated.”

Local mechanics do not know how to fix or repair the bus and do not have service manuals for it, Rispens added.

“Our bus has been here since last summer and has only been used for about a month on an actual route,” he said. “The heat system was found to be non-functional.

We are still waiting on repairs. This left the bus unusable during Montana’s harsh winter.” Last July, the World Resources Institute’s Electric School Bus Initiative reported that while the EPA had by that point funded more than 8,000 electric school buses through the EPA Clean School Bus Program, demand for ESBs is outpacing funding.

States, financing entities and utilities continue driving momentum for ESBs, noted WRI spokeswoman Katherine Roboff. “The Maryland Energy Administration recently launched a new funding program in support of school bus electrification,” she said. “We are tracking $2.3 billion in state-level funding for which ESBs are eligible. California and New York are good examples of robust state-level funding.

“We have also been in conversation with a wide range of green banks and financial institutions across the country who are also exploring the topic of financing electric school buses,” Roboff continued. “The Connecticut Green Bank, for example, has developed a new ESB financial product.”

However, the EPA is revoking $20 billion in contracts the Biden administration approved with at least eight green banks. Many Republican leaders call green banks “slush funds,” the Associated Press reported last month. At press time, the Connecticut Green Bank was one of seven green banks still listed on the EPA website.

States Continue Funding Work

The Public Service Commission of Maryland recently approved an electric school bus utility pilot program, Roboff added. The program is one of a dozen nationwide that recently closed or soon will close applications for funding. Districts also continue to explore electrification through transportation-as-a-service providers and other innovative business models built around subscription fees, Roboff said.

“School districts across the country continue to grow their electric school bus fleets,” she added. For example, the Beaverton School District in Oregon has been adding ESBs on an annual basis, leveraging a range of funding sources. In 2021, Beaverton was the first school district in Oregon to acquire an ESB and has added them yearly for a current total of 15 electric buses and 31 charging stations. Among the funding sources was a voter-approved $723 million bond, a portion of which is designated for replacement of diesel-powered buses with propane and electric buses.

Other funding sources include the Oregon Department of Energy’s Public Purpose Charge Program, Portland General Electric’s Electric School Bus Fund—funded through the Oregon Department of Environmental Quality’s Clean Fuels Program—and the EPA.

Beaverton also has 65 clean-burning propane buses using renewable propane. While the district plans to replace 225 diesel-powered buses with ESBs and propane-powered buses, some will be retained for long-distance field trips and athletic events. The district uses renewable diesel fuel, noting its higher cost is expected to drop as its supply expands.

That plan may be revisited if future battery technology improves to extend the distances ESBs can travel on a single charge. Molly Hale, marketing communications manager for Cummins’ Accelera zero-emissions business, noted Blue Bird has the company’s integrated powertrain, the PowerDrive 7000, that includes the BP97E battery, assembled in Columbus, Indiana, at its main manufacturing facility.

“Additionally, Thomas Built Buses recently announced the launch of their new Jouley Gen 2 bus with the new addition of our 14Xe eAxle and ELFA inverter,” she said. “We are pleased to be partnering with two major school bus OEMs and are excited to see the success of these buses gaining momentum and adoption. Blue Bird has delivered more than 2,000 ESBs with our powertrain.”

As speed bumps increase on the path to school districts incorporating more ESBs into their fleets, districts are pursuing a variety of approaches, such as this pilot project in New Mexico, which signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with ESB manufacturer GreenPower Motor Company. The state will seek an appropriation of $5 million to conduct a pilot program funding the purchase of ESBs, charging station installations and management costs.

Rolling with the Punches

Uncertainty over the future of ESB funding has affected many school districts, including the Ritenour School District in Overland, Missouri. The district on Feb. 4 announced the arrival of the first three Thomas Built Buses Jouleys of a 24-ESB fleet funded by a nearly $9.5 million EPA Clean School Bus Program grant sought to replace 24 diesel buses.

The district announced 24 new charging stations as well. However, the district indicated uncertainty over receiving the remaining 21 ESBs from the Clean School Bus Program due to its funding pauses. Brooks McQuinn, transportation director for the Malone Central School District in Malone, New York, noted the district has four ESBs and had received the EPA grant. The district received $1.4 million dollars for the purchase of the buses and chargers, covering most of the project cost. McQuinn pointed out existing infrastructure accommodated the chargers. The district also has its own lot and inside storage space for the buses.

The district’s fleet includes 43 65-passenger buses fueled by propane, gas, diesel and now the four ESBs. “We cover 386 square miles in this district, with a lot of different terrain,” said McQuinn. “We have used propane buses for years because it was a cleaner source of fuel, and we get tax credit for that fuel type. We have geared to gasoline engines due to the size of our district and sporting events. We have phased out our diesels and only have three left.” McQuinn noted the district is surprised the power capability of the ESBs is limited to about 75 miles a day.

“We have also not had a very cold winter here since we received these buses last March,” he added. “Our winters here can hit 30 degrees below [zero]. Overall, [ESBs] have a place in this district, but we certainly cannot meet the [state of New York] deadlines of 2035 for a complete EV bus world.” McQuinn said the cost of a propane or gasoline bus is about $185,000, including added options. The ESB costs about $465,000 and has limited options.

“The New York State [Department of Transportation] is very strict about what has to be on a school bus,” he said. “If the federal grants go away, it would put our district in a very vulnerable state. We are currently maxed out with our energy output, and if we were to add anymore [electric] buses we would have to put all new infrastructure here that would cost the district and local taxpayers millions of dollars.

“We would also have to look for alternative means for sporting events, field trips and any other trips outside of to and from school transportation,” he continued. The Electrification Coalition notes ESB procurement can take up to 18 months. This includes installing the charging infrastructure and getting enough power from the local utility. The organization noted Climate Mayors Electric Vehicle Purchasing Collaborative offers cooperative purchasing contracts for Blue Bird, IC Bus, Lion Electric, and Thomas Built Buses. The Collaborative also includes resources for the procurement process, policy guidance and a variety of other informative resources.

The Coalition advises districts to identify the appropriate type of EV charging stations, determine their locations and explore charging software to help achieve electricity cost savings.

Three types of charging stations include Level 1 (120V), Level 2 (240V), and direct current fast charging (DCFC). Engagement with the local utility is critical to assist

with the connection process for EV charging equipment, determine whether infrastructure upgrades are needed, determine charging rates and best charging times, and available software platforms.

Other Options

A video interview conducted by Steven Whaley, Blue Bird’s alternative fuels manager for eastern North America, and Anthony Jackson, executive director of transportation at Bibb County School District in Georgia, highlights operational benefits of propane school buses, including the elimination of diesel regeneration issues, reduced maintenance costs due to fewer parts and quieter operation. Bibb County School District purchased 31 propane buses in 2014, with the driving factor being issues with regeneration on the diesel engines. Benefits derived included no need for NOx sensors or having to replace particulate matter filters.

Bus drivers love that the bus is much quieter compared to diesel buses, Jackson said.

Now, most of the district’s fleet is comprised of propane-fueled buses, with propane fuel provided by Bobtail loads to the district’s four 1,000-gallon tanks. There also are diesel buses and those running on unleaded gasoline are used for field trips.

The district spent $790,599 to run over 2 million miles at a cost of 39 cents a mile, a 27 cents per-mile cost savings with more than a $500,000 in annual fuel savings. The Alternative Fuel Excise Tax Credit for propane vehicles is 36 cents a gallon for even more cost savings.

“The fate of the Alternative Fuel Tax Credit for propane vehicles is tenuous at best,” Whaley noted. “But the value proposition for propane without any incentives stands impressively on its own.” Clean diesel has also become a more attractive option, especially when using renewable diesel. But incentives for RD only currently exist in California, Oregon, Washington and New Mexico, the only states that have passed the

Low Carbon Fuel Standard.

Still, tougher EPA emissions standards have been a driving factor in diesel being more

than 90 percent cleaner today than a decade ago. Those emissions are expected to only get cleaner starting in 2027, when EPA’s Phase III GHG standard is scheduled to go into effect. But at this report, EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin signaled the rule and others are under reconsideration. If rolled back, diesel school buses could be easier and less expensive to obtain, especially in states that were previously forecasting limited availability.

As the industry awaits word on Phase III , Cummins announced last month its much-anticipated B7.2 diesel engine on the company’s HELM or fuel-agnostic platform. The emissions reduction to less than 0.035 grams of NOx per horsepower/hour, as required by EPA Phase III represents, an approximately 83-percent-cleaner engine than 2010 engines with 50-percent fewer particulate matter.

These are achieved by using a “clean sheet base engine,” a culmination of all the components, a Cummins spokesperson said.

The emissions warranty and useful life requirements also increase, with automatic engine shutdown and stop-start that can further lower emissions and GHG. Meanwhile, in anticipation of the Trump administration, the California Air Resources Board ceased seeking the additional federal waivers it needed to fully implement its Advanced Clean Fleet rule that about a dozen states were set to adopt. Many of those states are now not implementing it, which set out to reduce the number of diesel heavy-duty trucks that could be sold in California and the other so-called CARB states.

Diesel Emissions Reduction Act reauthorization was also introduced in Congress last month. That program, which ran through fiscal year 2024, had been marked for review by the Trump administration. It has been responsible for replacing over 5,100 high emissions school buses since 2010.

President Donald Trump has previously promised to kill the EV tax credit as more of a social statement, aiming to reverse course on the so-called EV mandates under the Biden administration.
That said, not all Republicans are on board with the end of clean energy tax incentives.
Former President Joe Biden's environment-focused charge on electric vehicles was projected to cost the federal government over $200 billion over 10 years, according to Capital Alpha Partners.
With over $2 billion in EV tax credits doled out last year, lawmakers are moving quickly to appease President Trump ahead of a looming tax cut package.","Government subsidies have been one of the major factors helping to encourage Americans into buying electric vehicles over the last five years, but as of Tuesday, Republicans in the House of Representatives are officially trying to kill the federal EV incentives.

Specifically, a proposal introduced to the House Ways and Means Committee asks the fiscal-focused group to repeal the $7500 new-vehicle-tax-credit as well as a $4000 used-vehicle credit on December 31, 2025. However, automakers that have yet to sell 200,000 EVs would be given another year to dole out new vehicle credits. The economic proposals will be subject to a Ways and Means Committee hearing on May 13.

In adition, a new provision added to a battery production tax credit for automakers specifies that credits would be withheld from vehicles produced by Chinese companies or through licensing agreements with Chinese firms. This change would significantly impact companies like Ford and Tesla, as both companies regularly outsource battery technology duties to Chinese manufacturers.

""I think there is a better chance we kill it than save it,"" speaker of the House Mike Johnson said about the EV tax credits to Bloomberg last week. ""But we’ll see how it comes out.

Speaker of the House Mike Johnson (R-LA).

A loan program intended to fund the creation of alternative fuels is also on the chopping block alongside the corporate average fuel economy standards and emission rules for 2027 and beyond. The proposed emissions changes will be reviewed by the Energy and Commerce Committee.

President Donald Trump has previously promised to kill the EV tax credit as more of a social statement, aiming to reverse course on the so-called EV mandates under the Biden administration. Similarly, Senate Republicans have floated taxing all EVs $1000 annually in an effort to drive revenue for road repairs, insinuating that EV owners aren't paying their fair share of road use fees.

That said, not all Republicans are on board with the end of clean energy tax incentives. Documents from ClearView Energy Partners indicate that 38 House Republicans have voiced support for keeping the Inflation Reduction Act's clean energy incentives, including the ones focused on electric vehicles. Former President Joe Biden's environment-focused charge on electric vehicles was projected to cost the federal government over $200 billion over 10 years, according to Capital Alpha Partners. With over $2 billion in EV tax credits doled out last year, lawmakers are moving quickly to appease President Trump ahead of a looming tax cut package.

Partisanship is clearly part of the package here, but the federal government would not be alone in altering its EV subsidy mechanism. States like California, Washington, and Oregon were quick to offer EV incentives and saw a massive spike in adoption as a result, but the economic realities of such rapid EV adoption have set in: all three states have shifted their EV incentives and have even imposed additional registration fees on electric models in an effort to make up for the lost gas tax revenue. That tax revenue is almost always used to fund roadway repair; without a consistent flow of gas-guzzling vehicles, states are trying to find new ways to pay for road maintenance. Either way, it seems likely to be a new era for EV owners and buyers in the not-so-distant future.","https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/row-of-electric-vehicles-is-plugged-in-and-charging-at-news-photo-1747146885.pjpeg?crop=1.00xw:0.669xh;0,0.269xh&resize=1200:*",N,,2025-05-13 14:34:47.937352

“The company will continue to evaluate the timing and project progression as market conditions change,” Chiu said in a statement Tuesday.

The decision has no impact on current employment at the Honda manufacturing plant in Alliston, Ont., he added.

Honda’s EV project in Canada includes a retooled assembly plant, an electric vehicle battery plant in close proximity, as well as two key battery parts facilities located elsewhere in Ontario.

The project was expected to see the two main plants create 1,000 jobs on top of retaining the existing 4,200 jobs at the assembly plant.

Under the original plan, the plant was set to produce up to 240,000 vehicles per year when fully operational in 2028.

The project was first announced in April 2024 at an event that included then-prime minister Justin Trudeau and Ontario Premier Doug Ford and was to receive support from the federal and Ontario governments.

Ottawa was set to give the Japanese automaker around $2.5 billion through tax credits, while Ontario committed to provide up to $2.5 billion in support, directly and indirectly.

Risk to Canadian auto jobs increases with Trump's new tariff plan

New Trump tariff threats add to uncertainty at Windsor Assembly

5,100 new jobs — Study tallies Windsor economic benefits of NextStar EV battery plant

In reporting its latest financial results Tuesday, Honda Motor Co. said its profit for the financial year through March fell 24.5 per cent from the previous year and warned that U.S. President Donald Trump’s tariffs will worsen its earnings.

The Tokyo-based automaker said its annual profit totalled 835.8 billion yen (US$5.6 billion), down from 1.1 trillion yen in the previous year. Annual sales edged up 6.2 per cent to nearly 21.69 trillion yen (US$147 billion).

Honda executive vice-president Noriya Kaihara acknowledged that Trump’s tariffs would likely hurt, erasing 650 billion yen (US$4.4 billion) from its operating profit for the fiscal year through March 2026. That’s mainly because of U.S. tariffs on vehicles from Canada and Mexico. Honda’s vehicle shipments from Japan to the U.S. are negligible.

Officials stressed major uncertainties remain, but said they felt it was important to give a realistic projection, no matter how pessimistic it might be.

Chief executive Toshihiro Mibe said Honda will do its best to minimize the impact from tariffs. In the long term, Honda will transfer auto production to U.S. plants and rethink its investment plans. All decisions will be made “very carefully,” Mibe told reporters.

Green Umbrella is looking for ways to continue the data collection that is already underway.
To keep the project moving forward, Green Umbrella is looking to community members and businesses for support.
Loss of two grants is ‘very destabilizing’ This is the second grant Green Umbrella has lost since Trump took office.
She says Green Umbrella has started to see an increase in community support.","A project working to reduce energy costs for people living in low-income housing is on hold after the federal government cancelled the grant funding it.

In 2023, Green Umbrella received a $1.1 million award from the Environmental Protection Agency to study energy efficiency and air quality in affordable housing units through a partnership with Over-the-Rhine Community Housing and the city of Cincinnati.

Executive Director Ryan Mooney-Bullock says the initiative also included installing energy-saving technology, like insulation, electric stoves and heat pumps, in about 35 homes.

Now, that work is on pause. Green Umbrella learned last week its grant had been terminated because it is “no longer in alignment with the EPA’s priorities.”

“The loss of these funds means that we have to stop work on projects that were really designed to benefit community members that have been historically underserved, and it's also preventing us from completing a research study that could then be used to inform how this type of energy efficiency work is rolled out in communities across the country,” Mooney-Bullock said.

She says Green Umbrella was about to make a major purchase of heat pumps when they learned about the grant termination.

“It came at a really bad time in the sense that we were about to do a ton of implementation that is really going to benefit the residents living in these buildings and their nonprofit landlord Over-the-Rhine Community Housing that is managing these buildings,” Mooney-Bullock said.

The Cincinnati-based nonprofit is not the only organization seeing its funding cancelled. The Trump administration is clawing back tens of millions of dollars for environmental research across the country, according to The New York Times.

Green Umbrella is looking for ways to continue the data collection that is already underway. It’s working on the study with three research partners: Indiana University, Carnegie Mellon University and the University of Pennsylvania.

“We have a group of residents who are participating in this and are helping us collect data, and we don't want to just drop the ball on them,” Mooney-Bullock said.

The nonprofit also is disputing the grant termination with the EPA and seeking final reimbursements. Mooney-Bullock says she doesn’t know how long it will take to get that money back since the payment system no longer shows the grant.

To keep the project moving forward, Green Umbrella is looking to community members and businesses for support.

Loss of two grants is ‘very destabilizing’

This is the second grant Green Umbrella has lost since Trump took office.

The first was a $500,000 EPA grant helping Greater Cincinnati community members address environmental risks in their neighborhoods.

“It is very destabilizing for a nonprofit to have significant funding pulled out at the last minute or while projects are underway,” Mooney-Bullock said.

She says the organization is not currently in a financial position where it needs to lay people off or make staffing changes.

“That is certainly something that is a concern if grants continue to get frozen and we're not able to raise the support we need from our local partners,” Mooney-Bullock said.

She says Green Umbrella has started to see an increase in community support.

GM has deployed lithium manganese batteries in the past, including in first-generation Chevrolet Volt.

General Motors said May 13 that it will be the first automaker to deploy a new battery chemistry slated to increase range and affordability for electric vehicles.

GM and its partner LG Energy Solution plan to launch production of the technology, called lithium manganese-rich batteries, in the U.S. by 2028.

GM’s cross-town competitor Ford Motor Co. said late last month it also plans to roll out the same technology by the end of the decade.

The new “prismatic” battery cell, meaning it is stored in a more efficient rectangular shape instead of a pouch, performs at a 33% higher energy density than the best-performing lithium iron phosphate-based cell, which is currently the industry standard. The current battery pack requires a lot more nickel, which GM said comes at a comparably high cost. Batteries represent at least a third of the cost of an EV.

GM said in a statement that for longer than a decade, it had been working toward launching LMR batteries, which avoid two main hurdles of the technology: a short battery life and voltage decay.

The chemical composition of a high-nickel battery includes roughly 85% nickel, 10% manganese and 5% cobalt. The composition of LMR cells is only 35% nickel, 65% manganese, and virtually no cobalt.

The new system also integrates with GM’s current North American battery production of lithium, graphite and manganese. GM recently invested in a Norwegian synthetic graphite producer for battery technology.

GM has deployed lithium manganese batteries in the past. The first-generation Chevrolet Volt used cells with manganese spinel cathodes, according to Sam Abuelsamid, vice president of market research at Telemetry Insights.

Abuelsamid told the Detroit Free Press that the close announcements by Ford and GM reflect the competitive environment of the industry seeking to construct more durable, affordable electric vehicles with decent range.

“It's hard to say who will get LMR into volume production first, but GM seems perhaps more likely. They've already committed to 2028 with LG in one of the Ultium Cells plants and have assigned a vehicle program to use these cells,” he said, referencing the company's mention the technology will be likely suited for larger trucks and utilities. “As far as the density and cost, manganese cells have long been a known quantity and they should have no issues with the performance claims.”

Most notably, the Inflation Reduction Act, signed into law by President Biden in 2022, allocated nearly $270 billion through a series of tax credits, loans, grants and subsidies to areas including renewable energy and industrial decarbonization solutions.
The proposal would also eliminate tax credits at the end of 2025 for household energy efficiency improvements and for residential expenditures on renewable energy including solar electric property, solar water heating property, fuel cell property, small wind energy property, geothermal heat pump property, and battery storage property.
In a statement following the release of the tax plan, Rich Powell, CEO of the Clean Energy Buyers Association said: “Preserving the federal technology-neutral energy tax credits is crucial for supplying the energy needed to serve the 21st century industries of the United States and to drive American innovation and energy dominance.
Moreover, some of America’s largest companies are attempting to advance critical new technologies like geothermal and advanced nuclear energy, but those technologies will not move forward if these tax credits are phased out.","Republicans on the Ways and Means Committee in the U.S. Congress released their new tax plan aimed at becoming part of the Trump administration’s proposed “One, Big, Beautiful Bill” tax and spending bill, which includes major cuts to Biden era green energy-focused tax incentives in areas including electric vehicles and clean energy production.

The Biden administration had put in place legislation directing hundreds of billions of dollars to accelerate the energy transition in the U.S. and to help meet climate goals put in place by the administration. Most notably, the Inflation Reduction Act, signed into law by President Biden in 2022, allocated nearly $270 billion through a series of tax credits, loans, grants and subsidies to areas including renewable energy and industrial decarbonization solutions.

President Trump has pledged to reverse Biden’s energy transition policy’s, including announcing the U.S.’ exit from the Paris Agreement on his first day in office, and also referencing plans to “end the Green New Deal,” likely a reference to the Inflation Reduction Act.

Key energy transition focused proposals presented in the Republican tax plan include terminating a $7,500 clean vehicle tax credit at the end of 2025 except for vehicles produced by manufacturers that have not sold 200,000 new clean vehicles, and a $4,000 tax credit for previously-owned clean vehicles, as well as a tax credit for up to $40,000 for large commercial clean vehicles.

The proposal would also eliminate tax credits at the end of 2025 for household energy efficiency improvements and for residential expenditures on renewable energy including solar electric property, solar water heating property, fuel cell property, small wind energy property, geothermal heat pump property, and battery storage property.

Additionally, the package would phase out tax credits for the production of or investment in zero emissions electricity, beginning with a 20% reduction in 2029, and full elimination in 2031, and would also end a tax credit for the production or use of clean hydrogen.

Ways and Means Chairman Jason Smith said:

“Under the economic policies of President Biden and Washington Democrats, the wealthy and well-connected benefitted from taxpayer handouts. The Ways and Means Republican tax bill ends special interest giveaways and will hold the woke elite and entities that benefit from the tax code accountable.”

Sustainability-focused groups criticized the new proposals, warning that the elimination of the tax incentives will increase energy costs for consumers and slow the development of new energy sources.

In a statement following the release of the tax plan, Rich Powell, CEO of the Clean Energy Buyers Association said:

“Preserving the federal technology-neutral energy tax credits is crucial for supplying the energy needed to serve the 21st century industries of the United States and to drive American innovation and energy dominance. As electricity demand rapidly increases now and in the years ahead, we need more options, not less. Moreover, some of America’s largest companies are attempting to advance critical new technologies like geothermal and advanced nuclear energy, but those technologies will not move forward if these tax credits are phased out.",https://www.esgtoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Congress.jpg,N,,2025-05-13 14:34:52.037714

Right now, the wielders of the sledgehammer have won out.
“The Ways and Means bill is at odds with American energy dominance,” said Jason Grumet, CEO of the American Clean Power Association.
While clean energy advocates rang the alarm bells, some conservatives were mad it did not just ax the climate law entirely.
“I’m glad my colleagues on the Ways and Means Committee are advancing this reform to responsibly phase out these tax credits,” she said.","House Republicans’ plan to terminate or phase out clean energy tax credits from the Democrats’ 2022 climate law is even more aggressive than what many K Street lobbyists and renewable energy advocates had been bracing for.

Legislation released Monday by the Ways and Means Committee — up for markup Tuesday afternoon — is one piece of the GOP’s work to extend the 2017 tax cuts, enhance defense and boost domestic energy production.

While far from becoming law, the committee’s product drew quick condemnation from environmentalists, renewable energy industries and other advocates who have been pressing Republicans to protect Inflation Reduction Act incentives in a megabill intended to bypass the Senate filibuster.

“This is what full repeal looks like in practice,” said Adrian Deveny, a former energy staffer to Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.). “It’s just obscured by lots of complicated legislative language to effectuate it.”

The plan would get rid of tax credits for electric vehicles buyers and hydrogen producers by the end of the year. It would phase out incentives for advanced manufacturing and nuclear power production. And it would end the practice known as “transferability,” which allows project sponsors to transfer the credit to a third party and is often used in finance agreements.

Spared from the knife were incentives for biofuels and sustainable aviation fuels; in fact, they were extended by four years with lower emission qualifications.

The legislation also includes new domestic sourcing requirements intended to disqualify companies tied to China and other foreign adversaries from accessing the incentives.

Republican leaders have struggled to appease warring factions within the party and deliver a bill to President Donald Trump’s desk by this summer — indeed one hard-line House Republican said the cuts to green credits didn’t go far enough.

But those leaders have also said they had intended to take a “scalpel” rather than a “sledgehammer” to the IRA. Right now, the wielders of the sledgehammer have won out.

House Ways and Means Chair Jason Smith (R-Mo.) said on social media that his text would take Republicans “one step closer to putting One Big, Beautiful Bill” before Trump.

Most environmental groups were aghast at the proposals. Ben Jealous, CEO of the Sierra Club, pointed to a provision that would strip organizations of their tax-exempt status if the administration determined they supported terrorist organizations.

“Allowing any administration to label an American organization it disagrees with or simply does not like as ‘terrorists’ is not just wrong, it is unamerican,” Jealous said in a statement.

Some renewable energy advocates invoked Republican rhetoric in criticizing the legislation. “The Ways and Means bill is at odds with American energy dominance,” said Jason Grumet, CEO of the American Clean Power Association.

While he argued that the bill would raise energy costs, “force American factories to shut their doors, and threaten American jobs,” he said he stood ready to work with Republicans.

“It is possible to phase out incentives for clean energy investment, production, and manufacturing without harming American consumers or businesses — and we stand ready to help,” he said.

Republicans might need help on a host of issues. A few dozen moderates — though many of whom are not on the Ways and Means Committee — have been signaling their interest in protecting some of the IRA credits.

But it remains to be seen how they will respond should the package clear committee. Complicating matters is the intraparty fight over state and local income tax deductions, or SALT, which could upend the entire effort.

Other hurdles remain in the Senate. Sen. John Curtis (R-Utah), who carved out a climate lane when he was in the House, demurred Monday when asked about the proposal. The same was true for Sen. Bill Cassidy (R-La.), who said he had not seen the text. Neither voted for the IRA in 2022.

Sen. Ed Markey (D-Mass.) was not as quiet. He chided Republicans, saying they were ceding the clean energy economy to China.

“The Inflation Reduction Act is the single largest clean energy and climate investment in our history, and we will not let Trump, Big Oil, and Republicans roll back our gains and deny our communities and young people the chance at a livable future,” he said in a press release.

‘Pulling the rug out’

One piece of the fine print could be a big deal for projects. Moving forward, new projects accessing the technology-neutral credits likely would not get built in time to be “placed in service”— or when they begin selling electricity to the grid — and meet the phase-out deadline. Current law uses phaseout dates based on when construction begins.

“Some projects that have already started development and gotten financing on the basis of a commenced construction tax structure,” Deveny added. “So this is pulling the rug out from under the industry.”

Other advocates noted the credits have spurred more than $400 billion in investment since the IRA passed nearly three years ago — including many in Republican-held congressional districts.

The electric vehicle industry put a finer point on it. “Businesses throughout the auto industry, from critical mineral and material developers to battery manufacturers and automakers, are making investments supported by the certainty offered by our federal government,” said the Zero-Emission Transportation Association’s Executive Director Albert Gore in a press release.

“In turn, these investments are creating new economic opportunities in local communities, from Reno, Nevada, to Casa Grande, Arizona, to Savannah, Georgia.”

New ad push

Tax credit advocates are making an eleventh-hour push to put new pressure on House Republicans who they believe could be convinced to take a tougher stand.

Unlocking Advanced Energy — an initiative run by the energy industry association Advanced Energy United — is rolling out a six-figure ad buy this week targeting five Republican-led districts with tens or hundreds of millions of dollars in planned private-sector investments that would benefit from the IRA.

The digital-only campaign, details of which were shared first with POLITICO’s E&E News, would target constituents in the districts of Reps. Juan Ciscomani (R-Ariz.), Gabe Evans (R-Colo.), Beth Van Duyne (R-Texas), Vern Buchanan (R-Fla.) and Ryan Mackenzie (R-Pa.).

Some of the ads state that advanced energy manufacturing is growing thanks in part to climate law credits, and they assert that those districts’ Republican representatives can help keep that momentum going.

While clean energy advocates rang the alarm bells, some conservatives were mad it did not just ax the climate law entirely.

“Does the bill fully repeal the IRA to stop the devastatingly bad projects being implemented in my district (battery, solar farms, etc..)?” Rep. Chip Roy (R-Texas) wrote in a long post outlining his many concerns with the bill. “NO, it phases those out, which will cause a race to construction (among other problems), and leaves many in place we should not.”

But Rep. Julie Fedorchak (R-N.D.) — who has argued solar and wind energy are no longer nascent industries in need of such generous subsidies from the federal government — applauded the plan.

“I’m glad my colleagues on the Ways and Means Committee are advancing this reform to responsibly phase out these tax credits,” she said. “Retiring these tax credits will save taxpayers billions of dollars, strengthen our grid, and help deliver on the promise of the One Big Beautiful bill to make America stronger, safer, and more competitive.”",https://static.politico.com/dims4/default/55a1666/2147483647/resize/1200/quality/100/?url=https://static.politico.com/67/63/1c48dc744f73aebe1fa305f35048/u-s-congress-37717.jpg,N,,2025-05-13 14:34:55.445244

The hydrogen holdup is the latest GM project in Michigan facing uncertainty.
Some of that funding, which GM has yet to receive and is in question under President Donald Trump, was committed to pay for tooling at the Detroit plant.
Unlike the Piston plant, the one in Brownstown Township produces components in addition to fuel cells.
Piston was awarded $1.5 million performance-based grant from the state in January to support the hydrogen project.","Piston, which counts GM among its top customers, entered into an agreement with the automaker last September to lease and operate a 292,550-square-foot plant, where it expected to create 144 jobs. It is the first standalone plant dedicated to fuel cell production for GM.

GM spokesman Kevin Kelly declined to provide details about the status of the project other than to say it has not been cancelled.

Piston declined to comment.

The reason for GM pausing the project is not clear, but it comes at a challenging time for the automotive industry. Carmakers and suppliers are navigating the impact of tariffs under the Trump administration and at the same time grappling with how to place their bets on future propulsion systems as regulations and consumer demand shift. GM executives said earlier this month they anticipate a $5 billion hit this year from tariffs.

The hydrogen holdup is the latest GM project in Michigan facing uncertainty. The automaker is reassessing product plans for the long-delayed Orion Assembly Plant in Oakland County and the future of the Renaissance Center in downtown Detroit remains unclear as GM prepares to move its headquarters to Dan Gilbert’s Hudson’s Detroit development.

GM has plenty of company when it comes to indecision about new propulsion investments. Michigan saw a wave of hydrogen and battery plant announcements a couple of years ago, but many of them have either been stalled, shrunk or scrapped. Economic development officials say that most of the projects will pay off, but it will just take longer than expected.

GM was among several manufacturers to be awarded a chunk of $750 million by the U.S. Energy Department a year ago under then-President Joe Biden to boost hydrogen fuel cell production. Some of that funding, which GM has yet to receive and is in question under President Donald Trump, was committed to pay for tooling at the Detroit plant.

The plant was intended for low-volume production, but GM declined to say how it would use the fuel cells. It is likely they would be used in nonautomotive applications before going into trucks. In addition to the Piston supply deal, GM has a joint venture with Honda producing fuel cell systems at a 70,000-square-foot plant in Brownstown Township downriver. Unlike the Piston plant, the one in Brownstown Township produces components in addition to fuel cells.

Piston was awarded $1.5 million performance-based grant from the state in January to support the hydrogen project. Michigan Economic Development Corp. spokesman Otie McKinley said none of that money has been disbursed.

Piston, owned by former Detroit Pistons guard Vinnie Johnson, a Crain's 2024 Newsmaker of the Year, has a large chunk of business tied to GM projects in a holding pattern. The supplier was tapped by GM to operate a $278 million, 960-job plant at the former Palace of Auburn Hills site to supply Orion Assembly.

At the old State Fairgrounds site, Piston was tasked with making the investment and creating the jobs under a nine-year contract, though the exact financial structure of the deal is unclear, as is the amount of money that has been invested so far.

The building occupied by the hydrogen program is part of a massive speculative redevelopment project completed by Sterling Group and Hillwood. Greg Scovitch, vice president of development for Hillwood, told Crain’s earlier this month he was unaware of any changes with the user’s plans.",https://s3-rd-prod.crainsdetroit.com/styles/1200x630/s3/Piston%20plant_0.jpg,N,,2025-05-13 14:42:25.071383

The Chamber’s Business Impact Awards honor organizations that drive innovation and economic growth in the Northern Kentucky. SD1 was recognized for its groundbreaking Clean H2O40 program — a 20-year strategic plan that is transforming how the region manages sewer overflows, protecting waterways, and safeguarding community health.

“We are grateful to be recognized by the NKY Chamber and our peers in the business community,” said SD1 Executive Director Adam Chaney. “Our team works around the clock, often behind the scenes, to protect our rivers, our neighborhoods and our future. This award affirms that our efforts are making a real difference in the lives of Northern Kentuckians.”

SD1 manages more than 2,200 miles of sanitary and stormwater infrastructure across Boone, Campbell and Kenton counties, serving over 347,000 residents. The agency treats approximately 35 million gallons of wastewater daily and prevents about 105,000 pounds of waste from entering the Ohio River each day.

At the heart of SD1’s environmental efforts is Clean H2O40, a federally negotiated agreement with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the Commonwealth of Kentucky. The program aims to eliminate all typical-year sanitary sewer overflows (SSOs) and capture at least 85% of typical-year combined system flow (CSO) by 2040.

During Phase 1 of the program, completed in 2023, SD1 significantly outperformed its regulatory targets—eliminating more than 60% of SSOs and capturing nearly 71% of CSOs. Key projects included a double siphon beneath the Licking River that removed 42 million gallons of typical-year SSOs and multiple equalization tanks that mitigated millions more.

SD1’s controlled storage approach—using detention basins and equalization tanks to hold and gradually release stormwater—has proven to be both environmentally and economically effective. This strategy is expected to save ratepayers hundreds of millions of dollars over the life of the program.

“SD1’s commitment to environmental stewardship is rooted in the belief that clean water is fundamental to quality of life,” said Chaney. “Northern Kentucky has always been a river town. Clean H2O40 is our pledge to future generations that we will keep those rivers clean, healthy and flowing with possibility.”

Rapid Analysis: House GOP’s Clean Energy Repeal and What it Means for the Affordability Crisis

The GOP’s proposed budget reconciliation bill kills jobs and raises household energy costs. Here’s our latest analysis.

Share:

After weeks of working behind closed doors on their budget reconciliation bill, House Republicans are finally releasing draft legislative text ahead of the committee markup process. These proposals, across various committees, are not only expected to make devastating cuts to Medicaid and food assistance, but would also gut clean energy, climate, and environmental justice programs that are reducing costs, creating jobs, and improving public health across the country.

Let’s not mince words: Republicans are trying to raise your energy bills and destroy thousands of American jobs—simply to pad the pockets of billionaires, fossil fuel executives, and their top corporate backers with massive tax cuts.

We’ve compiled our policy analysis of the Republicans’ proposed Energy and Commerce (E&C) Committee bill text and Ways and Means (W&M) Committee bill text below to explain how these sweeping cuts will harm your pocketbooks, health, and planet.

Conclusion and Opportunity to Take Action

Background

First, some context: Back in 2022, Congress passed transformational clean energy investments as part of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). These investments were strategically designed to make energy bills more affordable, revitalize American manufacturing, and create millions of good jobs for working Americans, while cutting pollution. But House Republicans are now unleashing a full-scale attack on these historic investments, even though the lion’s share of the benefits from these investments flow to GOP districts. They’re targeting critical programs like clean energy tax credits, advanced manufacturing tax credits, Environmental Justice Block Grants, and the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund (GGRF).

Simply put, these bills are an affront to American communities struggling with a cost-of-living crisis, working people trying to support their families, and those living in sacrifice zones with polluted air and water. Let’s take a closer look at the devastating cuts proposed by these Republican committees.

Toplines

Ways and Means

The House W&M Committee covers the tax-writing elements of the reconciliation bill, meaning this part of the Republican-proposed bill includes major cuts to the federal energy tax credits that are already delivering enormous benefits, particularly in Republican districts. These benefits include affordable clean energy and historic climate pollution reductions. Here’s what the GOP is proposing:

Republicans are gutting or outright repealing tax credits for clean energy, clean vehicles, home efficiency, and clean manufacturing. The W&M Committee proposal would effectively repeal IRA tax incentives — raising Americans’ energy costs, killing jobs, and freezing new investments, especially in domestic manufacturing. House Republicans are using a sledgehammer and pretending it is a scalpel.

Under the W&M Committee proposal, most credits are eliminated at the end of 2025. Others have unworkable “placed in service” provisions or overly-complex and burdensome “foreign entity of concern” requirements that make them difficult to use, before they are then phased out. The GOP has also proposed terminating the “transferability” provision for the tax credits, which would strangle the growing clean energy market.

Here are the specific critical clean energy tax credits affected by the bill (this list is not exhaustive):

Clean Energy Investment and Production Tax Credits (45Y and 48E) are changed to begin phasing out in 2029, and are fully eliminated at the end of 2031. Additionally, the specified calendar years no longer refer to the date of “commencement of construction” but instead to the date “placed in service,” which will effectively kill most new projects and jeopardize the financing of many projects already underway. This is a radical shift in U.S. energy tax law.

All of the Electric Vehicle Credits (45W, 30D, 30C, 25E), including for new and used EVs, are functionally eliminated.

Advanced Manufacturing Credits (45X) are subjected to unworkable new “foreign entity of concern” provisions that will freeze new investment and reverse America’s manufacturing renaissance. The credits are phased out at the end of 2031, with wind energy components no longer eligible after 2027.

Home Energy Efficiency Credits (25C) are eliminated at the end of 2025.

New Energy Efficient Home Credits (45L) are eliminated at the end of 2025.

Residential Solar Credits and other home energy systems credits (25D) are eliminated at the end of 2025.

Energy and Commerce

The House E&C Committee covers, among other things, any elements of the reconciliation bill related to the Department of Energy and the Environmental Protection Agency. This part of the reconciliation bill attempts to repeal most of the federal grant programs created by the IRA, as well as setting up rubber stamp permitting for fossil fuel infrastructure.

Republicans claim to be cutting at least $6.5 billion in funding for climate and clean energy programs that benefit American households, alongside proposing devastating and shameful cuts to critical health programs.

House Republicans are severely stretching the limits of the rules of reconciliation that prohibit making non-budgetary policy changes as they attempt to repeal vehicle emissions standards required by the Clean Air Act.

The GOP has proposed repealing sections of the Clean Air Act and other laws created in the IRA.

Under this proposal, key programs are completely repealed, and any unobligated funding is rescinded. (‘Unobligated funding’ means approved money that has yet to be legally committed for a specific purpose).. Many of these programs have most of their money obligated but could still be impacted by repeal, including this non-exhaustive list:

Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund

Environmental Justice Block Grants

Vehicle Efficiency and Emission Standards

Methane Emissions and Waste Reduction Incentive Program

Climate Pollution Reduction Grants

Department of Energy Loan Programs Office

Transmission Planning, Siting, and Financing

Clean Ports Program

Advanced Industrial Facilities Deployment Program

The bill allows natural gas pipeline projects to pay a fee of $10 million to bypass the normal permitting process and then guts the normal judicial review process by severely limiting who can bring forward lawsuits. Similarly, the bill says applicants should pay $1 million for the Department of Energy to deem a liquefied natural gas (LNG) export permit in the “public interest”, essentially allowing the fossil fuel industry to buy one of the necessary approvals. This makes a farce of our permitting process and essentially legalizes corruption with a pay-to-play privilege for gas pipelines.

1. Clean Energy Tax Credits (45Y and 48E)

Let’s start with one of the most powerful tools supporting rapid deployment of new energy generation and a modern, reliable, and affordable electricity grid for American homes and businesses: the IRA’s clean electricity tax credits. The Production Tax Credit (PTC) (45Y) is a technology-neutral tax credit that subsidizes the production of zero-emission sources like solar, wind, nuclear, hydropower, and geothermal. For every kilowatt hour (kWh) of clean energy generated, the producer gets a base credit of 2.6¢/kWh if they meet certain criteria. Similarly, the Investment Tax Credit (ITC) (48E) provides a credit of 30 percent (or more) of the investment into these same zero-emission energy generation technology projects, including energy storage.

Changes in the Reconciliation Bill:

The tech-neutral tax credits are phased out and have many new restrictions placed on them.Tax credits begin to phase out for projects placed in service in2029 (eligible for 80 percent of credits in 2029, 60 percent in 2030, 40 percent in 2031, and full repeal after that).

All date cut-offs are now when projects are “placed in service” instead of when they begin construction, which jeopardizes new and existing investments.

Transferability of the credit from project sponsors to third-party buyers with tax liability is no longer allowed. This would further undermine investment in new projects.

The GOP’s proposal applies a new, unworkable Foreign Entity of Concern (FEOC) requirement to the credit, restricting it for any entities that are deemed by the Trump administration to be ""foreign-influenced entities"" or that make substantial payments (≥ percent per transaction or ≥15 percent in aggregate) to businesses overseas. These provisions take effect two years after enactment and would strangle investment in new energy generation.

Key Impacts:

Repealing the clean energy tax credits would worsen the affordability crisis, raise energy bills, harm grid reliability, kill jobs, and inflame the climate crisis.

Skyrocketing energy prices: Full repeal of the clean energy tax credits would raise American household energy bills. It could increase annual energy bills up to $140-$220 per household across the country in 2040, and over $500 per year in some states. The W&M proposal, which guts the tax credits, would approach those levels.

Kill good-paying jobs: Full repeal of the 45Y and 48E clean energy tax credits alone would result in roughly 100,000 fewer full-time jobs across the country by 2040. The W&M proposal would approach those levels.

Repealing the clean energy tax credits would harm grid reliability. These tax credits are enhancing grid reliability in the face of increased electricity demand and extreme weather. Clean energy is the fastest, cheapest way to add new power to the grid. In fact, clean energy accounted for 93% of the new energy capacity added to the U.S. grid last year.

These changes jeopardize billions of dollars of existing investments, including any project underway now that won’t be fully operational until 2028 or later.

Slashing the clean energy tax credits would worsen the climate crisis. Saving the 45Y and 48E tax credits would cut climate pollution by 300 to 400 million tons compared to no tax credits in 2035. That’s 29-46 percent lower than a scenario without clean energy tax credits. After a year marked by devastating, billion-dollar climate disasters, floods, and fires, it’s more important than ever that we address climate head-on.

2. Electric Vehicle Credits (45W, 30D, 30C, 25E)

The IRA’s electric vehicle (EV) tax credits have been rapidly accelerating America’s clean auto industry and jobs, while making EVs more financially accessible for some families. Households and commercial companies can receive tax credits for purchasing new electric vehicles (up to $7,500) and used electric vehicles (up to $4,000), as well as for chargers and installation.

Changes in the Reconciliation Bill:

The GOP’s bill eliminates the IRA’s 30D clean vehicle credit for most vehicles at the end of 2025 with a one-year extension for a limited number of vehicles, which means that households will no longer be able to receive a tax credit of $7,500 for a new qualifying EV.

The bill also guts the used clean vehicle credit 25E(g) at the end of the 2025 calendar year, meaning households can no longer receive a tax credit of $4,000 for purchasing a previously-owned electric vehicle.

The bill further eliminates the qualified commercial clean vehicles credit 45W(g), with an exception carved out for vehicles placed in service before 2033 and under a binding contract entered into before May 2025.

The GOP terminates the alternative fuel vehicle refueling property credit 30C(i) at the end of 2025.

Key Impacts:

Fully repealing the IRA’s EV tax credits would drive a wrecking ball through the American-made EV industry, leading to the potential cancellation of as much as 100 percent of all planned construction and expansion of American EV assembly capacity. That’s according to the latest analysis from Princeton University’s ZERO Lab, assuming that the EPA’s tailpipe emissions regulations are repealed alongside the 30D and 45W tax credits. The same analysis finds that roughly 8.3 million fewer EVs and plug-in hybrids could be driving on American roads in 2030.

For households, new and used electric vehicles would become less financially accessible, meaning consumers would have fewer transportation options.

Repealing the EV tax credits would cause major job losses, according to the CEO of the Ford Motor Company, and benefit China, according to General Motors.

3. Manufacturing Credits (45X)

The Advanced Energy Manufacturing Credit (45X) provides an incentive to manufacturing facilities that produce clean energy components or systems in the U.S. Facilities that produce solar, wind, advanced batteries, and certain critical minerals are rewarded for re-shoring supply chains in America.

Changes in the Reconciliation Bill:

This bill eliminates the manufacturing tax credit at the end of 2031, and terminates tax credits for wind energy components sold after 2027. Importantly the proposed bill applies a new unworkable Foreign Entity of Concern (FEOC) requirement to the credit, restricting it for any entities that are deemed by the Trump administration to be ""foreign-influenced entities"" or that make substantial payments (≥5% per transaction or ≥15% in aggregate) to businesses overseas. This provision will make the 45X credit fundamentally unusable, even before the credit is sunsetted.

Key Impacts:

The 45X Advanced Energy Manufacturing Credit has sparked a renaissance in U.S. manufacturing, especially for electric vehicles, advanced batteries, and solar energy and their supply chains The credits have helped incentivize over $200 billion in new investment in the U.S. and positioned the U.S. to be competitive in critical 21st century global industries. This incentive has contributed to job and manufacturing growth in districts that Republicans represent. The GOP’s call for repeal would directly harm jobs and livelihoods of their constituents, and send American manufacturing jobs overseas.

4. Home Energy Efficiency Credits (25C, 45L)

Thanks to the IRA, households can take tax credits of 30 percent off, up to $2,000, for installing a heat pump or heat pump water heater, plus $1,200 for weatherization and insulation via the Energy Efficient Home Improvement Credit (25C). The 25C tax credit helped 2.3 million American families improve their homes and reduce their monthly energy bills in 2023. Families are saving an average of $130 a year in energy costs. By 2032 homeowners are expected to use the credit enough to cut peak electric demand by 3,400 MW.

The New Energy Efficient Home Credit (45L) provides incentives to builders of homes that meet Energy Star or Zero-Energy Ready Home standards. This credit has assisted with the construction of nearly 350,000 efficient new homes in 2024 and cut homeowner energy bills by about $450 per year.

Changes in the Reconciliation Bill:

The Energy Efficient Home Improvement Credit (25C) is eliminated as of the end of 2025. The New Energy Efficient Home Credit (45L) is eliminated for homes acquired after the end of 2025, unless the home construction began before May 12, 2025.

Key Impacts:

Cutting building energy efficiency credits takes money out of people’s pockets by making home energy upgrades more expensive and raises everyone’s utility bills by reducing efficiency and putting more pressure on the electric grid. Households can currently save $990 per year on utility bills if they utilize the 25C tax credit and these credits create 240,000 jobs. By effectively terminating the Energy Efficient Home Credit for new buildings starting TODAY, this is a major gut punch to any builders trying to provide new homes to address the housing crisis.

5. Residential Clean Energy Tax Credits (25D)

Dating back to 2005, the Residential Clean Energy Tax Credit provides households with a 30 percent tax credit for rooftop solar, wind power, geothermal heating systems, and battery systems. In 2023, 1.2 million American families took advantage of the residential clean energy tax credit, and now 5 percent of US households have solar. And all of that small-scale solar adds up, with over 66GW installed, amounting to more than one-third of US solar capacity.

Changes in the Reconciliation Bill:

The Residential Clean Energy Tax Credit is eliminated as of the end of 2025.

Key Impacts:

Households would see higher costs for home energy upgrades and lose access to $1,250 in savings per year on utility bills. At the same time, we would be cutting a huge source of new energy capacity just as demand on the grid is increasing, which will raise energy costs for everyone. Plus, cutting the residential clean energy tax credits would kill hundreds of thousands of jobs in the home energy and rooftop solar sector.

6. Transferability

The transferability provisions for various energy tax credits included in the IRA makes it possible for more companies and communities to access tax credits for their cost-cutting, job-creating energy projects. Through transferability, a project sponsor that may not have tax liability can sell their energy tax credit to a third party that does. This reduces the cost of the project and expands the universe of entities that can benefit from these important incentives. Furthermore, transferability has been used to benefit new clean energy technologies and manufacturing facilities, helping to grow new industries that are not reliant upon complex tax equity financing deals.

Changes in the Reconciliation Bill:

Transferability is repealed for all applicable tax credits effective for construction beginning two years after the enactment of this bill, and applies to any fuel production-related credits after December 31, 2027.

Key Impacts:

Transferability broadens capital access, particularly for more local project developers, manufacturers, and fuel producers that have traditionally lacked access to this investment market. In fact, it’s already catalyzed more than $500 billion in private capital since 2022. Without this tool, significant chunks of the clean energy tax credits will be cannibalized by large banks and complex tax equity deals, which is an unnecessary waste of taxpayer money. Some clean energy developers will be shut out from this critical market, significantly diminishing our ability to meet the growing energy demand driven by artificial intelligence (A.I.) and data centers. This repeal will strangle the booming clean energy market — driving up costs for households and limiting investments in energy production at a critical moment.

7. Other IRA Programs Affected by the W&M Proposal

Direct Pay (aka Elective Pay) allows states and local governments and non-profit organizations to access 12 of the IRA tax credits and is not impacted by the Ways & Means proposal—however, the policy would be rendered fundamentally useless if the underlying tax incentives are repealed, especially those supporting clean electricity, electric vehicles, and charging infrastructure.

Clean Fuels Production Credits (45Z) are extended to 2031 with increased generosity for fuels with land use impacts and ""renewable natural gas.”

Carbon Capture Credits (45Q) are amended so that credits cannot flow to a specified foreign entity. Transferability is repealed.

Hydrogen Production Tax Credit (45V) is eliminated at the end of 2025.

Nuclear Tax Credit (45U) is phased out beginning in 2029 (80 percent in 2029, 60 percent in 2030, 40 percent in 2031, and 0 percent after 2031).

8. Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund

The $27 billion Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund (GGRF) is the largest grant program within the IRA. This $27 billion is divided into three programs: the National Clean Investment Fund (NCIF), the Clean Communities Investment Accelerator (CCIA), and Solar for All. Not only does this program provide a significant investment in pollution-reducing clean energy technology, but it also benefits communities that have been historically overlooked and underserved, bringing greater equity to the clean energy transition. For months, the Trump administration has waged an unsubstantiated assault on this fund. At every turn, the administration has been unable to justify its attacks to undermine this program, failing to offer evidence to support its bogus claims of fraud, waste, or abuse.

Changes in the Reconciliation Bill:

Republicans have proposed repealing section 134 of the Clean Air Act and rescinding all unobligated balances in the GGRF program.

Key Impacts:

The GGRF is unlocking a historic wave of public and private investment, delivering local economic development opportunities that would not have materialized without this program, especially in disadvantaged communities. But the Trump administration has already been attacking the GGRF through an illegal funding freeze, and a court battle is currently raging with program awardees, in particular the NCIF and CCIA programs. The GGRF funding has technically been obligated, and only minimal GGRF funds remain unobligated and available for rescission. But the E&C proposal would harm program implementation and oversight at EPA. It may also represent an attempt by Congress and the administration to block or claw back funds that have been legally obligated.

9. Environmental Justice Block Grants

This first-of-its-kind $3 billion federal program aims to empower disadvantaged communities to determine and design their own visions of pollution reduction and clean energy investment. The Environmental Justice (EJ) Block Grants, also known as the Community Change Grants, provide highly flexible funding that goes directly to nonprofit organizations serving these communities. This means projects are designed by and for communities to address their unique needs and build resilience to extreme weather events and environmental risks.

Changes in the Reconciliation Bill:

Republicans propose completely repealing section 138 of the Clean Air Act, eliminating the Environmental Justice (EJ) Block Grants program, and rescinding any unobligated funding, which would deprive disadvantaged communities of hundreds of millions of grant dollars.

Key Impacts:

Without EJ Block Grants, there will be less financial support for on-the-ground, community-led organizations that provide life-changing services to households based in disadvantaged communities or living near sacrifice zones. Examples of critical services include community-led pollution monitoring, prevention, and remediation; projects that reduce indoor air pollution; projects to counter health risks from urban heat islands, extreme heat, and wildfires; improved community engagement in public processes; and technical assistance.

10. Vehicle Efficiency and Emission Standards

The Department of Transportation (DOT) and Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) set corporate average fuel economy (CAFE) standards for efficiency and greenhouse gas emissions from cars and trucks. These standards have saved drivers trillions of dollars and drastically reduced harmful pollution from vehicles—reducing smog and health impacts like asthma and heart disease. Rescinding these standards is not allowed by the rules of budget reconciliation, but Republicans are trying to repeal them anyway.

Changes in the Reconciliation Bill:

Republicans propose repealing the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) efficiency standards and the EPA’s greenhouse gas emissions standards for passenger and light trucks starting in model year 2027 and efficiency standards for heavy-duty trucks starting in 2030. This action is plainly inadmissible under congressional budget reconciliation rules. The bill also rescinds any unobligated funding for the clean heavy-duty vehicles program and loans to support vehicle and vehicle supply chain manufacturing facilities.

Key Impacts:

If Republicans successfully gut these vehicle standards, we would end up with less efficient and more polluting vehicles, burning 70 billion extra gallons of gasoline through 2050 and increasing climate pollution by more than 710 million metric tons. Eliminating these standards would increase costs by $600 over the lifetime of new vehicles. Increased pollution would lead to greater health risks (asthma, heart disease, cancer) from toxic air pollution. Attempting to repeal these rules via reconciliation would seriously stretch the limits of reconciliation by trying to set regulations via this budgetary process.

11. Natural Gas Expedited Permitting

As it currently stands, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) reviews applications for the construction and operation of interstate natural gas pipelines under the authority of section 7 of the Natural Gas Act. FERC review ensures that applicants certify that they will comply with Department of Transportation safety standards.

Changes in the Reconciliation Bill:

This bill allows natural gas pipeline projects to pay a fee of $10 million to bypass the normal permitting process and then guts the normal judicial review process by severely limiting who can bring forward lawsuits.

Key Impacts:

This makes a farce of our permitting process and essentially legalizes corruption with a pay-to-play privilege for gas pipelines. Americans will be severely impacted by gas pipelines built through their communities. Medical professionals and frontline leaders have long documented the devastating health, economic, and local environmental harms from this fossil fuel infrastructure.

12. Rubberstamping Liquefied Natural Gas Exports

Under the Natural Gas Act, the Department of Energy (DOE) has the authority to determine whether proposed liquefied natural gas (LNG) exports to non-Free Trade Agreement countries are in the “public interest” or not. This is part of a wider review process when considering proposed LNG export facilities.

Changes in the Reconciliation Bill:

Republicans are proposing that the DOE would be allowed to determine that a proposed liquefied natural gas (LNG) export facility is in the “public interest” if the applicant pays $1 million.

Key Impacts:

Similar to the natural gas pipeline permitting above, this normalizes a pay-to-play privilege for LNG export infrastructure, potentially expediting the build-out of these mega-polluting projects. As DOE’s own studies show, unfettered U.S. LNG exports will hurt Americans with higher electricity and gas prices and drastically worsen climate pollution. Medical professionals and frontline leaders have long documented the devastating health, economic, climate, and local environmental harms from this kind of fossil fuel infrastructure, particularly in the Gulf South.

13. Methane Emissions and Waste Reduction Incentive Program

Methane is a potent, planet-heating greenhouse gas that oil and gas operators often flare or leak into the atmosphere. That’s why Congress passed the Waste Emissions Charge (WEC) through the IRA in 2022, requiring oil and gas operators to pay a penalty fee if they exceed a certain level of methane pollution. Soon after, the Biden-led EPA introduced a rule implementing the WEC. But at the beginning of 2025, the Republican-controlled Congress voted to eliminate that rule. Now, Congress is trying to get rid of the fee outright via the budget reconciliation bill.

Changes in the Reconciliation Bill:

The bill attempts to completely repeal subsections (a) and (b) of section 136 of the Clean Air Act and rescinds any unobligated funding. The methane fee is retained, but the language is altered so that the fee is not collected until ten years from now.

Key Impacts:

By cutting methane pollution and other harmful pollutants, the WEC would have helped prevent asthma attacks and other health-harming impacts. The program would have reduced an extremely harmful greenhouse gas superpollutant. Altering the WEC will disproportionately impact communities of color and disadvantaged communities. The methane fee is also a revenue raiser, so its alteration would necessitate even deeper cuts to other vital programs to comply with the GOP’s self-imposed spending cut targets.

14. Climate Pollution Reduction Grants

The Climate Pollution Reduction Grants (CPRG) are an EPA program established as part of a new Clean Air Act Section 137 created in the IRA, which provides grants to state, local, and Tribal governments to create and implement programs that reduce emissions and support jobs and communities. It was funded with $5 billion, including $250 million in planning grants, $4.6 billion for implementation grants, and the remaining balance for technical assistance and program implementation. These grants have been used to support state, local, and Tribal governments in nearly all 50 states.

Changes in the Reconciliation Bill:

The E&C Committee proposes to repeal and rescind unobligated balances in the CPRG program account. At the start of the Trump administration, the CPRG program had approximately $90 million in unobligated funding.

Key Impacts:

Rescinding funding for the CPRG program would dramatically harm program implementation at the agency. Without these dollars, EPA staff may also be unable to process grant funding disbursements to states, cities, and Tribal nations who have received obligated funding awards.

15. Department of Energy Loan Programs Office

The Department of Energy Loan Programs Office (LPO) was created with strong bipartisan support during the George W. Bush administration, and for the last two decades, it has provided critical financing for American energy, manufacturing, mining, and other industrial projects that reduce emissions and support American leadership in the fast-growing clean energy economy. To date, the LPO has financed approximately $90 billion in innovative energy and manufacturing projects, including a $465 million loan to Elon Musk’s Tesla Motors in 2010. And at the conclusion of 2024, the LPO had collected over $5 billion in interest payments from its loans, meaning that it has made a profit for American taxpayers.

Changes in the Reconciliation Bill:

The bill would rescind unobligated balances in the LPO, which currently holds billions in unspent funds used to support loans under the 1703 program that supports clean energy and industrial transformation. These changes would also impact the Advanced Technology Vehicle Manufacturing Loan Program, which supports the global competitiveness of American automakers; the Energy Infrastructure Financing Reinvestment Program, which supports new clean energy generation and community revitalization for legacy energy communities; and the Tribal Energy Loan Program.

Key Impacts:

The E&C proposal would essentially eliminate the LPO. This would be a devastating move, especially amidst rising energy demand and a competitive global race to build and manufacture the energy technologies that will power the 21st century. Slashing the LPO would undermine American businesses and U.S. technology leadership. Not only that, over the long term, eliminating the LPO would cost American taxpayers money, as the successful program has already returned $5 billion in profit to the American taxpayer via interest on its loans.

16. Transmission Planning, Siting, and Financing

There are several IRA programs at DOE that support the expansion of electricity transmission infrastructure in the U.S, critical to providing affordable and reliable power for Americans. These include the Transmission Facility Financing program; Offshore Wind Electricity Transmission Planning, Modeling, and Analysis program; and Grants to Facilitate the Siting of Interstate Electricity Transmission Lines. These programs are especially important at a time of rising electricity demand, fueled by data centers to power the race for artificial intelligence (AI), increasing electrification of vehicles and buildings, and an American manufacturing renaissance.

Changes in the Reconciliation Bill:

The bill rescinds any unobligated amounts for Transmission Facility Financing; Interregional and Offshore Wind Electricity Transmission Planning, Modelling, and Analysis; and Grants to Facilitate the Siting of Interstate Electricity Transmission Lines. Together, these programs held nearly $2.5 billion in unobligated funding at the beginning of 2025.

Key Impacts:

Republicans claim to care about energy dominance and cheap energy, but this nonsensical action would sabotage efforts to make our grid more affordable, reliable, and resilient.

17. Clean Ports Program

The EPA’s Clean Ports Program provides $3 billion in grants to fund zero-emission port equipment and technology and to assist U.S. ports in developing climate action plans to reduce air pollutants. Grants were awarded in 2024 to 55 projects across the country that will eliminate “more than 3 million metric tons of carbon pollution, equivalent to 391,220 homes’ energy use for one year.” The vast majority of those pollution reduction benefits will be felt in frontline and disadvantaged communities in heavily trafficked port corridors.

Changes in the Reconciliation Bill:

The text proposes completely repealing section 133 of the Clean Air Act, the Clean Ports Program, with any unobligated funding rescinded.

Key Impacts:

Any cuts to the Clean Ports Program would mean more pollution at our ports, more harm to the health of our communities from toxic air pollution especially in frontline communities already burdened with higher rates of pollution-driven health impacts like asthma, and job losses from cutting these important projects already underway in states all across the U.S.

18. Advanced Industrial Facilities Deployment Program

The Advanced Industrial Facilities Deployment Program (AIFDP) was created in the IRA and funded with over $5.8 billion to advance industrial decarbonization and support American manufacturing’s global economic competitiveness. The program has provided funds for innovative low-carbon cement manufacturing projects in Indiana, Georgia, Texas, and Virginia, for next-generation aluminum manufacturing in Colorado, for low-carbon steel production in multiple states, and much more.

Changes in the Reconciliation Bill:

The E&C Committee proposes to rescind unobligated balances from the AIFDP, which is estimated to be hundreds of millions of dollars.

Key Impacts:

Rescinding unobligated balances from the AIFDP program would deal a major blow to U.S. global economic competitiveness as American businesses fight for market share in increasingly decarbonized steel, cement, aluminum, and other heavy industries.

19. Other IRA Programs Affected by the E&C Proposal

The Republican E&C Committee also repealed and/or rescinded any unobligated funds from the following IRA programs.

Air pollution monitoring program for schools in low-income and disadvantaged communities at EPA.

American Innovation Manufacturing (AIM) Act that aims to phase down hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs)—potent greenhouse pollutants used in refrigeration, air conditioning, and other applications. The E&C proposes to eliminate funding that helps implement this important bipartisan law.

Conclusion

Let’s be clear-eyed about what’s happening here: Congressional Republicans are attempting to take money out of everyday people’s pockets to give tax breaks to billionaires. In the process, they’re taking a wrecking ball to dozens of programs that make energy affordable for households, reduce toxic pollution, combat the climate crisis, provide life-changing healthcare, and nourish families with food assistance.

Though this analysis has focused on Evergreen’s priority IRA climate programs found in the E&C and W&M draft bills, other life-changing federal programs are on the line. Evergreen will continue to track the House Committee markup and passage process for both W&M and E&C in the coming days. There’s still time to let Congress know that they must not attack these vital programs. Call your representatives now and tell them they cannot vote for a budget bill that repeals climate and clean energy programs, which protect our health, our pocketbooks, and our communities.

The technology builds on a partnership between the two companies to develop prismatic battery cell technology and related chemistries.

GM says it seeks to become the first automaker to deploy LMR batteries in EVs. Ultium Cells, a GM and LG Energy Solution joint venture, says it’s planning to start commercial production of LMR prismatic cells in the United States by 2028, with pre-production expected to begin at an LG Energy Solution facility by late 2027.

The final production-design of these LMR battery cells will be validated at GM’s Battery Cell Development Center in Warren, which is expected to open earlier that year, as well as LG Energy Solution’s facility.

Battery cathodes require materials like cobalt, nickel, and manganese, with cobalt being the most expensive. LMR battery cells use a higher proportion of more affordable manganese, while also delivering greater capacity and energy density, according to the companies.

Battery engineers at GM and LG Energy Solution say they have developed a new LMR prismatic battery cell that unlocks 33 percent higher energy density compared to the best-performing lithium iron phosphate (LFP) based cells — at a comparable cost.

“We’re pioneering manganese-rich battery technology to unlock premium range and performance at an affordable cost, especially in electric trucks,” says Kurt Kelty, vice president of of battery, propulsion, and sustainability at GM.

“As we look to engineer the ideal battery for each vehicle in our diverse EV portfolio, LMR will complement our high-nickel and iron-phosphate solutions to expand customer choice in the truck and full-size SUV markets, advance American battery innovation, and create jobs well into the future.”

GM claims its electric truck platform has segment-leading range using high-nickel chemistry today. By integrating LMR battery technology and the manufacturing and space efficiency benefits of prismatic cells, GM says it aims to offer more than 400 miles of range in an electric truck while achieving “significant” battery pack cost savings compared to today’s high-nickel pack.

“We’re excited to introduce the first-ever LMR prismatic cells for EVs, the culmination of our decades-long research and investment in the technology,” says Wonjoon Suh, executive vice president and head of the Advanced Automotive Battery division at LG Energy Solution. “GM’s future trucks powered by this new chemistry are a strong example of our shared commitment to offering diverse EV options to consumers.”

GM began researching manganese-rich lithium-ion battery cells in 2015, accelerating the technology development by prototyping LMR cells at its Wallace Battery Cell Innovation Center in Warren. In collaboration with partners, GM engineers advanced cathode materials, electrolytes, additives, form factors, and cell assembly processes to overcome LMR’s legacy challenges in performance and durability.",https://cdn.dbusiness.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/33/2025/05/GM-LG800.jpg,N,,2025-05-13 14:42:27.870576

The measure is likely to end up as one of hundreds of clauses in a single large bill meant to reform the nation’s tax and immigration systems. A bill can change significantly between introduction and passage, so we can’t be certain the tax credit will end. However, the measure has the support of House leadership and President Trump.

Reuters reports, “The proposal, set for a House Ways and Means Committee hearing on May 13, would repeal a $7,500 new-vehicle tax credit and a $4,000 used-vehicle credit on December 31, although it would maintain the new-vehicle credit for an additional year for automakers that have not yet sold 200,000 EVs.”

How the Credit Works Today

Today, car shoppers can use the credit as a down payment on a new EV or include it when they file their taxes after buying a new car.

Related: How Do Electric Car Tax Credits Work?

Not every buyer qualifies — certain income limits apply, depending on filing status.

Not every car qualifies. Automakers must build a certain percentage of the vehicle and its battery in the U.S. to qualify for half the credit. They must use a certain percentage of minerals from the U.S. or its major trade partners to be eligible for the other half.

Those percentages increase yearly, a measure meant to encourage automakers to build EVs and supply chains domestically.

Some Dealers Already Stopping

The law has not changed, and the proposal could fail. But some car dealers are already minimizing use of the credit. The Detroit Free Press reports that some “have held back by not offering the credit to buyers who want it up front in the form of a rebate at the point of sale.”

Dealers must apply to obtain the money from the federal government in order to accept it as a down payment. Some may be reluctant to assume they’ll be paid on time if the credit is endangered.

Others, however, say they are still actively offering the credit. An IRS spokesperson said, “taxpayers should take advantage of all lawful credits that are available to them that make economic sense for them.”

Some Credits Would Continue Into 2026 Even if Bill Passes

As currently written, the proposal would continue the credit for an additional year for automakers that have not yet sold at least 200,000 EVs. That would mean EV startups like Rivian and Lucid, as well as large automakers that have been late to the EV game, could still offer the credit into 2026.

Proposal Could Fail in the Senate

Bills supported by House leadership tend to pass the House. The Senate, however, is a tougher prospect.

There, Republicans hold a slim majority. A few defections in states that benefit from the tax credit could kill the proposal. Ironically, the states that gain the most from the EV industry tend to have Republican senators.

The automotive industry has concentrated new EV and battery factories in Republican-led states, mainly because the United Auto Workers union has limited influence there. However, that results in many “red state” senators who know that killing the tax credit could cost their constituents jobs.

Industry Concerned About Chinese Dominance

The EV industry, meanwhile, objects that ending the tax credit could cede a growing sector to China.

Tragedy in Southwest Detroit

On Monday, Feb. 17., residents in a heavily Spanish-speaking community woke up to a river flowing outside their homes. With temperatures in the single digits, icy water covered cars and flooded residential streets and basements. More than 400 homes lost access to heat and water.

The city quickly sent out the emergency resources that it had on hand, which were police. There was a swift backlash.

After Trump’s inauguration, community members had organized Know Your Rights training sessions to inform our immigrant neighbors of their constitutional right to not open their door to police or ICE without a signed warrant from a judge.

My office had to quickly send out videos and graphics in Spanish for non-English-speaking residents: if you’re in the flood zone, the police are there to help you get to safety.

Once residents knew it was safe to leave their homes, I began calling on community members and organizations. Nonprofit leaders and organizations started to collect resources and set up processes for regular wellness checks as we waited for coordinated response plans from the city.

Impacted residents needed us to unite, and Southwest Detroit mobilized.

Amidst confusion, questions, and frustrations, residents called on their neighbors and friends to confirm their safety. People donated items, made meals, helped translate and interpret, provided transportation, helped wash clothes, and so much more. Our community was at the frontline of emergency response.

The mayor promised that impacted residents would be able to return home within six weeks. For those six weeks, families were scattered across metro Detroit. Some stayed with family or friends; others were provided temporary housing in hotels by the city. Ensuring the safety and protection of those impacted was everyone’s top priority.

While the city wasn’t adequately prepared, it and the Great Lakes Water Authority responded promptly, using every tool to clean basements, remove debris, and repair residents’ hot water tanks and furnaces. However, it was not enough. Many Detroiters lost precious items that held memories, or had their vehicles and basements destroyed. Some lost their housing altogether and will never be made whole.

Unprecedented, but unexpected?

What happened in Southwest Detroit was unprecedented and never should have happened. Unfortunately, though, it will so long as glaring challenges go unaddressed.

The federal government’s disinvestment in our communities has a detrimental impact on our day-to-day lives. Failing to fund infrastructure maintenance and improvements creates unsafe neighborhoods and feelings of insecurity.

How can this happen to 400 occupied residential homes in a city in the wealthiest country in the world? Who is at fault?

Every level of government is. Our local government lacked appropriate emergency response processes with local leaders and partners. Our state government does not adequately invest in our infrastructure. Our federal government is slashing budgets, taking our resources away from the working class, and padding the pockets of billionaires.

Detroiters – a resilient people – have been forced to adapt. After experiencing flood event after flood event, they are growing deep roots in mutual aid and emergency response. Why? Because as long as our government serves the wealthy few over the many, only mutual aid will save us.

Coordination and a culture of care

The question then becomes: how do we create these systems of care?

We need to start with trust and clear communication from trusted messengers.

During the mayor’s address to the city after six weeks of recovery, he mentioned that he wished the city had worked with community members sooner. I could not agree more. From the first day this incident happened, my office organized a daily call with nonprofit leaders and community organizers to discuss issues that impacted residents were dealing with.

Collectively, we also met with residents and conducted needs assessments. We then shared this documentation with the city to increase coordination and ensure a timely response to issues as they arose. We asked the city for accessible, bilingual communications.

On a call with the mayor, after a few weeks of frustrating discoordination between the city and community leaders, I told him we all had the same goal and needed to work together to meet the immense need and build trust with our residents. We could not let politics get in the way of serving people. People were scared and felt lost and in the dark. We needed to increase transparency, communicate in more than just English, and meet people where they were. The administration accepted our invitation to join our collaborative efforts in the second or third week of our daily meetings.

Lessons Learned

Relationships are foundational. We must build relationships during calm times, not only in crisis and chaos. Our relationships need to overcome our politics in times of emergencies. When we know our neighbors, we are invested in their safety and well-being.

Beyond your neighbors, get to know the nonprofits and businesses in your community. Do you know who they are and what services they provide? Do some research and make a list with names and numbers. Begin to get to know them and build meaningful relationships. Our relationships with our neighbors could save our lives one day.

Get information from trusted, verified sources. Timely, factual information is key in emergencies. One challenge during the flood in Southwest Detroit was social media. While powerful in that it can spread messages quickly and hold powers-that-be accountable, be sure the source is trusted and verified. (Misinformation will only create more chaos!)

Looking forward

While the city was not fully prepared, I witnessed city staff working long hours, going above and beyond to meet the public’s needs. New systems were created that will aid response efforts in a future emergency. Building the system in real-time is no easy feat. Amid all the challenges, they rose to the occasion, and for that, I am grateful. We must continue to learn from our emergencies, build relationships, and prepare for the next emergency. Council Member Latisha Johnson, Mary Waters, and I have established a Climate and Disaster Recovery task force to continue to learn from our crises and create community emergency response plans.

I plan to continue investing in and encouraging a culture of mutual aid. I invite you to join me on Wednesday, May 14, from 6-8 p.m. at St. Stephen AME for a Mutual Aid 101 training I am hosting with Detroit Hispanic Development Corporation, Urban Neighborhood Initiatives, Detroit Southwest Pride, and Unity In Our Community Timebank. We will share our experience responding to crises on the ground and our vision for a community centered on care. Register at bit.ly/bpts-register.

Those cuts were first fleshed out in a House budget blueprint earlier this year and are part of the budget bill from the House Energy and Commerce Committee, the text of which was unveiled on Sunday. But Medicaid cuts are not the only aspect of the bill drawing scrutiny.

""Giving giant tax breaks to billionaires while increasing electric bills for American families is wrong.

Kathy Castor (D-Fla.) on Monday. ""Dismantling our landmark Inflation Reduction Act will kill jobs, hurt businesses, and drive-up Americans' energy costs.""

The legislation includes a provision that would allow energy developers to access an expedited permitting review if they pay $10 million or one percent of the anticipated cost of the construction of the project.

Another provision would have companies applying to export or import natural gas pay a nonrefundable $1 million fee and in return have their project ""deemed to be in the public interest.""

""The idea that corporate polluters can pay a fee to freely pollute our communities is beyond the pale,"" said Mahyar Sorour, a director of the Beyond Fossil Fuels Policy at the Sierra Club, on Monday.

""While it slashes much-needed support for clean energy and climate resilience, it would allow fossil fuel companies to pay to get their project approved. That's not just wrong, it's un-American,"" said Alexandra Adams, chief policy advocacy officer at the Natural Resources Defense Council.

According to E&E News, the legislation aims to rescind ""the unobligated balance"" of IRA funds for multiple Department of Energy programs, such as money meant for the Tribal Energy Loan Guarantee Program.

""Republicans just proposed cutting thousands of jobs, billions of dollars in clean energy funding, and billions of dollars in healthcare funding from their own districts. Why?

Republicans are also planning to rescind the unobligated balances from the Environmental Protection Agency's Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund, an IRA program that is supposed to support clean energy projects primarily for historically marginalized and low-income communities, per E&E.

Republicans in the House Ways and Means Committee on Monday released their own proposal to repeal clean energy tax credits.","WASHINGTON (AP) — House Republicans are calling for billions of dollars in funding cuts for Biden-era climate and environmental programs, including clean energy tax credits, as lawmakers seek to reverse what one GOP leader called “the most reckless parts of the engorged climate spending"" approved under former President Joe Biden.

Environmental groups warned the proposals would pave the way for more oil and gas industry activity on public lands and increase planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions in the United States.

The House committees on Energy and Commerce and Ways and Means are set to discuss the plans Tuesday as part of the so-called budget reconciliation process. Several moves are aimed at clawing back billions in spending authorized by the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, a Democratic measure intended to slow climate change and boost clean energy such as wind and solar power.

House Speaker Mike Johnson has set a Memorial Day deadline to pass President Donald Trump’s big bill of tax breaks and spending cuts, and the GOP has scheduled round-the-clock hearings this week on various sections of the bill before they are stitched together in what will become a massive package.

Republican Rep. Brett Guthrie of Kentucky, chairman of the House Energy and Commerce panel, said his committee’s bill, unveiled Sunday, would return $6.5 billion in unspent funds intended for climate programs included in the 2022 law. In an op-ed in The Wall Street Journal, he said the plan “ends spending on Green New Deal-style waste"" and claws back money ""headed for green boondoggles'' such as grants for environmental and climate justice.

“The legislation would reverse the most reckless parts of the engorged climate spending in the misnamed Inflation Reduction Act,” Guthrie wrote.

The cuts to climate programs are part of a larger $880 billion in savings by 2034 proposed in the draft legislation that also covers communication and health-related policy, largely targeting Medicaid.

The cuts fit with Trump’s 2026 budget proposal, which looks to slash federal spending through a sweeping reorganization of federal agencies as well as steep cuts to disease research and, especially, clean energy and policies intended to address climate change. Congress ultimately decides the spending and tax plans.

In Trump’s first few months back in the White House, the administration has broadly gone after environmental and climate initiatives, many of which were put into place under the Biden administration, pledging to dismantle what Trump calls the Democrats’ “green new scam.”

Groups decry the proposals

READ:

The 10 Oldest U.S. Presidents

The GOP proposal “guts investments that are cutting energy costs"" for families, “powering a domestic manufacturing boom and delivering essential health care to the communities that need it most,'' said Lena Moffitt, executive director of the environmental group Evergreen Action.

The Republican move to loosen pollution standards “would mean more smog in our streets,” while cuts to environmental justice block grants “would force low-income communities to pay more for dirtier energy,"" she added. “Republicans are sacrificing clean energy on the altar of Big Oil to bankroll another round of tax cuts for the ultra-wealthy.""

Alexandra Adams, chief policy advocacy officer at the Natural Resources Defense Council, said the Energy and Commerce bill “gives polluters free rein to foul the air and water.” Cleaning up U.S. ports and reducing dangerous methane spewing from oil and gas wells have traditionally received bipartisan support, she said.

Albert Gore, executive director of the Zero Emission Transportation Association, said the moves would impact federal investments in domestic battery and mineral supply chain jobs.

“At a moment when our industry needs certainty more than ever, this legislation could slam the brakes on America’s progress towards global competitiveness in manufacturing, while ceding leadership to other countries,” he said.

The National Ocean Industries Association, which represents the offshore oil and wind industries, warned against what it called “premature repeal or phase-out of current tax credits.”

“Sudden changes to the tax code could inject significant uncertainty, jeopardizing capital allocation, project planning and job creation” in offshore energy and the broader economy, said Erik Milito, the group’s president.

Climate programs targeted

The draft text from the Energy and Commerce committee would reclaim unused billions from several Inflation Reduction Act programs, repeal sections of the Clean Air Act and emphasize support for oil and gas drilling.

The plan also pulls back money for the Energy Department's multi-billion dollar loan program for clean energy, the Environmental Protection Agency's Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund — commonly known as the “green bank” — and certain multistate and offshore wind development.

It would rescind funding for clean vehicles, loosen vehicle emissions standards and cut money for zero-emission port equipment and air pollution monitoring, while at the same time allow for an expedited permitting process — opposed by environmental groups — for natural gas drilling and increasing supply of the nation's Strategic Petroleum Reserve.

Republicans in the House Ways and Means Committee on Monday released their own proposal to repeal clean energy tax credits.

Proponents, including some Republicans, say credits boost demand for technologies, such as solar or electric vehicles, that reduce harmful emissions and help drive down their cost.

Under Trump, federal government agencies have bolstered fossil fuel investment, blocked renewable energy sources, rolled back landmark water and air regulations, cut support for electric vehicles and reconsidered scientific findings supporting climate action.

On May 12, 2025, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) announced that it is amending the data submission period for the Toxic Substances Control Act’s (TSCA) per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) reporting rule to begin on April 13, 2026, and end on October 13, 2026. Small manufacturers reporting exclusively as article importers will have until April 13, 2027, to complete their reporting.

The interim final rule issued by the EPA states that the “change is necessary because EPA requires more time to prepare the reporting application to collect this data.” The interim rule also states that while the EPA is not making any other changes to the reporting rule at this time, it “is separately considering reopening certain aspects of the rule to public comment,” and the “delayed reporting date ensures that EPA has adequate time to consider the public comments and propose and finalize any modifications to the rule before the submission period begins.”

The interim final rule delaying the data submission period was published in the Federal Register May 13, 2025, and is effective immediately. However, the EPA is still accepting public comments on the interim rule for a period of 30 days.

In order to help parents, the Autism Alliance started a statewide grassroots coalition in 2021 made up of family advocates and attorneys who represent families in special education.","Sharon Kelso tries to do everything she can to help Detroit families navigate the often confusing and complicated world of special education.

The advocate is frequently on the phone, listening to parents complain that their child has yet to receive an individualized education program, or IEP, a plan that spells out what services and accommodations students with disabilities should receive, as required by federal law. Sometimes, families want her guidance for talking to teachers and school administrators.

She also gets calls from parents whose child has an IEP, but they need help.

“A lot of times I call the schools, have the parent come in, give their complaints, sit and look at the IEPs and work through them and try to help them as much as I can,” she said. “But I’m only one person.”

Kelso’s work highlights an issue that education advocates, school employees, and board members say has persisted for years in the Detroit Public Schools Community District and across the state: delays in conducting or complying with evaluations for special education services.

An IEP is a document for students with disabilities ages 3 through 25 that maps out educational needs and goals, as well as any programs and services a student’s school district will provide to help them, according to the Michigan Department of Education.

An initial IEP must be completed by a school and a notice provided to the parent within 30 school days after they provide consent for their child’s evaluation, according to the Michigan Department of Education’s Special Education Office. The timeline may be extended beyond those 30 days. DPSCD Superintendent Nikolai Vitti told BridgeDetroit that the process for Detroit’s district takes an average of 26 days.

James Stacy is among the Detroit parents seeking support. Stacy said he’s struggling to help his 13-year-old son, who is a sixth grader at Marquette Elementary-Middle School. Stacy enrolled his son at the east side school in 2023 and said he has run into issues ever since, particularly with school staff not complying with his son’s IEP and his son getting suspended.

Stacy said his son was a good student at his former school in the Berkley School District, where he received extra support in reading and math. But this school year, he is repeating the sixth grade and may not pass again because he does not have the support he needs for his learning disability, Stacy said.

Beyond the struggles with his schoolwork, Stacy’s son has been suspended three times this school year for behavioral incidents.

Stacy is now working with Kelso to arrange a formal review that addresses whether the behavior is caused by a disability and whether suspensions or an expulsion would be appropriate.

Stacy said he may pursue legal action against DPSCD if things do not improve for his son.

“I want to fight them (the district) holding him back because he didn’t have the support in place for him to succeed, and it’s done a number on him,” he said. “I hate to see my son hurting like this; he’s depressed. If I have to get a lawyer to bring a lot of things to light, that’s the next step for me.”

The district did not respond to questions about Stacy’s son or his IEP.

A statewide issue

Detroit school board member Sherry Gay-Dagnogo said delays with IEPs are mainly tied to staffing shortages. Students with disabilities make up nearly 14% of the population in DPSCD, and like many school districts across the nation, the Detroit district struggles to hire qualified special education staff.

DPSCD’s special education department is called the Exceptional Student Education Department. Staffing shortages came up during a January board meeting whereVitti reported that the district had 15 psychologist vacancies. In a recent email to BridgeDetroit, Vitti said the district has 31 full-time psychologists, 35 contracted psychologists and 17 vacancies.

While the district approved a teacher contract last year that provides an annual $15,000 bonus to new and current employees who support students with IEPs, Vitti said that it’s difficult to hire enough psychologists. The superintendent added that he has a plan to adjust the IEP process, but said details won’t be announced until sometime this spring.

“We’ve seen a bit of an increase in hiring by going up to $15,000 but I don’t know if a $15,000 bonus is even enough because the average psychologist can demand a very high wage, not only in the K-12 sector, but even more so the private sector,” Vitti said at the January meeting. “We have worked with universities to try to create pathways and internship opportunities, but the reality is that the IEP process requires a psychologist that’s mandated by federal and state law, and there’s no way around them.”

Heather Eckner, the director of statewide education for the Autism Alliance of Michigan, said IEP delays are a problem in school districts statewide and nationwide. The advocacy organization has a navigator program, which fields thousands of calls yearly from individuals with autism, parents and educators. Education issues are among those people call in about the most, Eckner said.

“A lot of times, it is questions and concerns in the education system around (the IEP) process and the steps in the process and the delays with it,” she said.

In addition, the Autism Alliance released its Special Education Experience Survey Report last October, which showed that the state’s special education system isn’t meeting the needs of students and families. Some of the top findings revealed that the workforce shortage is affecting students and that schools are not identifying disabilities early enough.

Eckner said she empathizes with school districts that are experiencing staffing shortages in special education, but she’s also seeing schools avoiding the IEP process by using “delay tactics.”

“For a lot of families, they report back to us that it almost feels like the evaluation plan was set up to not find the child eligible, like they don’t do as comprehensive of an evaluation as they could or should,” she said.

The evaluation delays persist amid President Donald Trump’s recent executive order aimed at shutting down the Department of Education, continuing a campaign promise to return education oversight to the states. Trump said that the Department of Health and Human Services would handle services for the 7.5 million students with disabilities in the nation. But many legal experts and advocates for children with disabilities say the president does not have the authority to shift oversight to another agency.

While Trump promised to preserve federal Pell grants for college students, funding for students with disabilities and Title I funding for schools in high-poverty communities, the firing of roughly 1,400 DOE employees could ultimately harm vulnerable children. This includes students with disabilities, children in poverty, children experiencing homelessness and English language learners, state superintendent Michael Rice, who is retiring later this year, told Bridge Michigan.

Special education advocate Marcie Lipsitt agrees that DOE cuts will impact students with disabilities, including the closing in March of the department’s seven regional Office for Civil Rights locations. The closings included the Cleveland office, which investigated violations of gender, race and disability-based discrimination in Ohio and Michigan.

Lipsitt has been an advocate for families across the country for 21 years and even longer for her family and friends, she said.

“I’ve had complaints sitting; parents haven’t heard from an attorney in months,” she said. “I’ve had mediations that were canceled with hours’ notice that have not been rescheduled. It’s (the federal changes) going to gut public education.”

Here’s what the IEP process look like

When it comes to an IEP request in DPSCD, a parent or district staff member may request an initial evaluation when a student is suspected of having a disability, according to district documents. When the request is made verbally, the school will support the parent in documenting it. Requests are then submitted to the school principal.

Within 10 school days of the request being submitted, the district’s school-based evaluation team must complete a review of the student’s educational record and other relevant information. When the review is completed, the team will evaluate if the request can move forward or if it will be denied. If it is denied, the parent will be notified in writing and receive an explanation.

When a request moves forward, the team will conduct a Review of Existing Evaluation Data (REED), and the parent is invited to participate. The REED is used to determine which evaluations are needed to diagnose the student with the correct disability.

Evaluations can include examining a student’s health, hearing, vision and communication skills. The evaluation team has 30 school days to complete the evaluation and create the IEP. The plan is reviewed at least once a year but can be adjusted when necessary.

Kelso said in her more than 30 years of being an education advocate in metro Detroit, she has seen kids receive the wrong IEPs, accommodations deviating from what was originally discussed or accommodations not being implemented at all.

“Some teachers’ reasons for why they don’t do them is because they feel it gives special ed kids an advantage over the other kids,” Kelso said. “…You’re trying to make them as equal as you can to the other kids to succeed.”

Lipsitt is also seeing Michigan districts not following IEPs, as well as children not receiving certain services like speech and occupational therapy.

One of the parents Lipsitt is helping includes Sheri King, who filed an Office of Civil Rights (OCR) complaint against DPSCD in September 2024. She said school staff repeatedly messed up the accommodations for her son, who’s a seventh grader at Mackenzie Elementary-Middle School.

King’s son, George Finley Jr., started having epileptic seizures a couple of years ago and experienced memory loss. Seizures can impact short and long-term memory, attention and multi-tasking as well as create language problems. Finley began receiving an IEP around the third grade and has had issues with schools complying with his plan, she said. King has made multiple complaints to DPSCD with Lipsett’s assistance over the years.

King and Lipsitt reached out to an attorney at OCR’s Cleveland office, and the attorney arranged a mediation between King and DPSCD last year. During the meeting, the district said they would provide outside tutoring aid for reading, Lipsitt said. However, King said that never happened, so her son is now seeing a tutor in Farmington.

Since the Cleveland office has shut down, Lipsett will have to refile the complaint with the OCR.

“The school’s not trying to do nothing,” King said. “They’re hoping that I forget. I keep asking them over and over, ‘When are you guys going to call these people so I can set up my son’s tutoring? When are you guys going to do this?’ If I didn’t have Marcie, I don’t know where I would be because she helps me out a lot.”

DPSCD officials said in response to King’s case that they “respect the challenges that all parents with students” with IEPs have.

The district said it will continue to “problem solve through the challenges they are facing to ensure their children succeed in school with the limited resources the District receives to educate each child with an IEP.”

Seeking solutions in Detroit

Gay-Dagnogo, the school board member, said some possible solutions the district should consider include seeking outside resources from the Merrill Palmer Skillman Institute at Wayne State University, which collaborates with families, children, and community partners to promote the healthy development and well-being of individuals. She also mentioned Michigan Rehabilitation Services, which develops customized workforce solutions for businesses and people with disabilities, and Wayne RESA, an agency that offers a wide range of services like special education to the school districts and public school academies in Wayne County.

“I’m not suggesting that these are all easy fixes or even possible, but I just think we have to explore ways that we might be able to share some level of services,” Gay-Dagnogo added.

Monique Bryant, another Detroit school board member, said the district should provide training for parents and guardians on navigating the assessment process so that they will have a clearer understanding of how the ESE department works. She added that there should be clearer communication between the district and parents on the timeline for an IEP.

“We need to better articulate what the expectations are, knowing that we have a shortage and then working with parents to navigate so that their students still receive the best possible classroom and educational experience that we can offer them,” Bryant said.

Another possible solution is making the special education space more equitable when it comes to parents advocating for their children, Eckner said. Many parents, like King and Stacy, face barriers within the school system because they are unaware of their rights or don’t have the “privilege, access, or money to really invest time into advocacy,” she said.

In order to help parents, the Autism Alliance started a statewide grassroots coalition in 2021 made up of family advocates and attorneys who represent families in special education. The group has almost 400 members, Eckner said.

“We’re trying to channel this collective advocacy movement to try to remove some of these barriers so that it doesn’t matter what your ZIP code is or what your household income is,” she said, “because that shouldn’t dictate whether or not a child gets access to the right kind of education support and services.”",https://i0.wp.com/www.bridgedetroit.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/bridge-detroit-logo-small.jpg?fit=768%2C240&ssl=1,N,,2025-05-13 14:40:57.221546

Several moves are aimed at clawing back billions in spending authorized by the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, a Democratic measure intended to slow climate change and boost clean energy such as wind and solar power.

House Speaker Mike Johnson has set a Memorial Day deadline to pass President Donald Trump’s big bill of tax breaks and spending cuts, and the GOP has scheduled round-the-clock hearings this week on various sections of the bill before they are stitched together in what will become a massive package.

Republican Rep. Brett Guthrie of Kentucky, chairman of the House Energy and Commerce panel, said his committee’s bill, unveiled Sunday, would return $6.5 billion in unspent funds intended for climate programs included in the 2022 law. In an op-ed in The Wall Street Journal, he said the plan “ends spending on Green New Deal-style waste” and claws back money “headed for green boondoggles” such as grants for environmental and climate justice.

“The legislation would reverse the most reckless parts of the engorged climate spending in the misnamed Inflation Reduction Act,” Guthrie wrote.

The cuts to climate programs are part of a larger $880 billion in savings by 2034 proposed in the draft legislation that also covers communication and health-related policy, largely targeting Medicaid.

The cuts fit with Trump’s 2026 budget proposal, which looks to slash federal spending through a sweeping reorganization of federal agencies as well as steep cuts to disease research and, especially, clean energy and policies intended to address climate change. Congress ultimately decides the spending and tax plans.

In Trump’s first few months back in the White House, the administration has broadly gone after environmental and climate initiatives, many of which were put into place under the Biden administration, pledging to dismantle what Trump calls the Democrats’ “green new scam.”",http://d14e0irai0gcaa.cloudfront.net/www.tribtoday.com/images/2016/10/11191558/fblike.jpg,N,,2025-05-13 15:12:55.461278

Because of the exceptionally wide Republican majority on the Ways and Means Committee, and because many of the IRA’s more vocal Republican backers don’t sit on it, the draft that will go up for a vote today is probably in its most conservative iteration. It advances the phaseout of the wind and solar credits by three years relative to the IRA, and requires that they be operational by 2032, rather than merely under construction, to be eligible. Compared to the outright, immediate repeal a group of 38 House Republicans demanded this month, that’s not so bad.

The political animus many Republicans felt toward the IRA, as a manifestation of Biden’s “green new scam,” has been tempered by all the alarm bells that are now ringing about electricity shortages, which even US President Donald Trump has framed as a national “emergency.” Against that background, it’s less palatable to reflexively vote against tax incentives that put more electrons on the grid. Still, negotiations going forward will likely focus on the timing and the degree to which use of the credits should be constrained if the hardware contains parts from China or other problematic countries. It’s hard to imagine a bill reaching Trump’s desk in which the credits go unblemished.

“The goal for [Ways and Means committee chairman] Rep. Jason Smith (R-Mo.) is to cut enough from the IRA for conservatives, but still create a product that can potentially survive in the Senate. I think he’s gotten really close to the mark on that goal,” said Emily Domenech, senior vice president at the consulting firm Boundary Stone and former adviser to House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.).

Congressional Republicans, Domenech said, are more interested in solving the country’s energy problems through permitting reform than through spending taxpayers’ money. But it’s clear that if the solar and wind credits disappeared overnight, US power prices would jump up, because for most utilities renewables are the cheapest and fastest way to add power.

WASHINGTON — U.S. House Republicans plan to debate and approve the three final pieces of their “big, beautiful bill” in committee this week, including the tax measure, major spending cuts to Medicaid that will change how states run the program, and an agriculture bill.

The U.S. House will begin debate in committee this week on a bill that would cut Medicaid spending.

At least $880 billion over the next 10 years would be slashed under the piece of the bill that covers energy and health care, including from Medicaid. Republicans would add new Medicaid work requirements for some able-bodied adults; seek to penalize the dozen states that allow immigrants living in the U.S. without legal status in the program; and require states to more frequently check Medicaid enrollees’ eligibility, among other changes.

An estimate was not yet available for exactly how much that would save in Medicaid spending or how many people enrolled might lose coverage. Earlier projections of various other scenarios by the Congressional Budget Office had placed the number of displaced enrollees in the millions, and Democrats predicted the same effect from the newest plan.

House panels have already signed off on eight of the 11 bills that will make up the sweeping reconciliation legislation. And if all goes according to plan, that chamber should approve the entire package before the end of the month.

Debate is expected to begin Tuesday in each of the panels and last hours, possibly into Wednesday. Democrats will offer dozens of amendments seeking to change the bills and highlighting their disagreement with GOP policy goals.

Internal Republican disputes between centrists and far-right lawmakers over numerous tax proposals and funding changes to Medicaid will also likely lead to debate on GOP amendments.

With paper-thin majorities in the House and Senate, nearly every Republican needs to support the overall package for it to move through both chambers and to President Donald Trump.

If Republicans fail to reach agreement during the next couple months, it would put nearly every aspect of their agenda in jeopardy. GOP leaders would also need to negotiate a bipartisan debt limit agreement before the August recess, should the reconciliation package fall apart, since they plan to include debt limit language as well.

GOP divided over Medicaid cuts

Kentucky Republican Rep. Brett Guthrie, chairman of the committee that oversees energy and Medicaid, wrote in a statement last week announcing the markup that his panel’s measure would “end wasteful government spending, unleash American energy and innovation, and strengthen Medicaid for mothers, children, individuals with disabilities, and the elderly.”

But the bill released this weekend might not have support from far-right members in the House and seems to be running into opposition from some GOP senators as well.

Texas Republican Rep. Chip Roy, of the hard right, wrote on social media that he hoped “House & Senate leadership are coming up with a backup plan…. ….. because I’m not here to rack up an additional $20 trillion in debt over 10 years or to subsidize healthy, able-bodied adults, corrupt blue states, and monopoly hospital ceos…”

Missouri Republican Sen. Josh Hawley, who has voiced concern for months about potential cuts to Medicaid, wrote an op-ed published in The New York Times on Monday highly critical of a “contingent of corporatist Republicans” who support lower federal spending on the program.”

“This wing of the party wants Republicans to build our big, beautiful bill around slashing health insurance for the working poor,” Hawley wrote. “But that argument is both morally wrong and politically suicidal.”

The entire House package will be open to amendment if the legislation makes it to the Senate, where several GOP lawmakers are expected to rework or even eliminate entire sections.

Work requirements

The Energy and Commerce Committee’s bill is the one that would cut federal spending by at least $880 billion during the next decade including on Medicaid, the state-federal health program for lower income people.

The legislation would institute work requirements nationwide for able-bodied adults between the ages of 19 and 65, with several exceptions, including for pregnant people, enrollees with certain disabilities or serious medical conditions, and parents of dependent children.

People not exempted from the requirements would need to work, engage in community service, or enroll in an education program for at least 80 hours a month.

A staffer on the panel told reporters during a background briefing Monday that Republicans tried to learn from challenges certain states had in the past when they implemented work requirements.

After discussions with current and former state Medicaid directors, the staffer said the committee wrote a bill that they are confident “states will be able to implement effectively.”

The work requirements take into account various unexpected circumstances, like if someone were to be hit by a bus and unable to complete the 80-hours-per-month requirement on time because they were hospitalized, the staffer said.

“We did try to be very thoughtful about any kind of circumstance that could happen,” they said.

Immigrant coverage, eligibility checks

The Medicaid legislation also seeks to encourage states that include undocumented immigrants in their program to stop doing so or lose some federal funding.

The federal government currently pays 90% of the cost of covering enrollees who are eligible for Medicaid under the 2010 Affordable Care Act expansion. That would decrease to 80% for the expanded population if states choose to keep covering undocumented immigrants.

The committee staffer said this would impact California, Colorado, Connecticut, the District of Columbia, Illinois, Maine, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, Oregon, Utah, Vermon,t and Washington states if they don’t change their policies regarding undocumented immigrants.

Additionally, states would need to check eligibility for all of their Medicaid enrollees every six months, instead of once a year for the expanded population. This likely would lead to some people being kicked out of the program.

Committee staff members were unable to share exactly how each of the Medicaid provisions would affect the federal budget or how many people could lose access to the program if Congress were to implement the legislation as written.

But the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office wrote in a letter Monday that it estimates the Energy and Commerce Committee met its target of cutting at least $880 billion in spending “over the 2025-2034 period and would not increase on-budget deficits in any year after 2034.”

Staff on the committee said they don’t expect to have the full CBO score before the markup begins Tuesday and didn’t have an estimate for when that information will be out.

Energy and Commerce Committee Ranking Member Frank Pallone, D-N.J., wrote in a statement the GOP bill would lead to millions of people losing access to Medicaid.

“This is not trimming fat from around the edges, it’s cutting to the bone,” Pallone wrote. “The overwhelming majority of the savings in this bill will come from taking health care away from millions of Americans. Nowhere in the bill are they cutting ‘waste, fraud, and abuse’—they’re cutting people’s health care and using that money to give tax breaks to billionaires.”

Repealing clean-energy funds

The Republican proposal would repeal more than a dozen sections of Democrats’ 2022 reconciliation law related to energy and environment programs.

The law, known as the Inflation Reduction Act, included hundreds of billions in tax credits for renewable energy and energy-efficiency measures. It was considered the largest investment by the United States in tackling climate change.

The House bill would repeal sections including the $27 billion Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund, which helps finance clean-energy projects, and a $40 billion Department of Energy loan program meant to stimulate production of clean-energy infrastructure.

Sections targeting carbon emissions, air pollution, offshore wind transmission, and other programs would also rescind any unspent funds for those purposes appropriated in the Biden-era law.

The measure would allow pipeline builders to pay fees to bypass environmental review. Natural gas pipelines could pay $10 million to access an expedited approval process, and liquified natural gas exports could pay $1 million for the Energy Department to deem them “in the public interest.”

Rep. Kathy Castor, the ranking member on the Energy and Commerce Energy Subcommittee, said the proposal would sabotage efforts to drive down prices for consumers.

“Cleaner, cheaper energy for consumers gets left behind,” the Florida Democrat wrote in a statement. “Dismantling our landmark Inflation Reduction Act will kill jobs, hurt businesses, and drive up Americans’ energy costs.”

Tax cuts

The Ways and Means Committee released its 28-page starter bill late last week and the full 389-page version Monday afternoon, but Republicans on the panel could add to it during the Tuesday markup.

House GOP tax writers propose making the underlying 2017 tax law provisions permanent while temporarily expanding several of them, including the child tax credit and standard deduction.

The child tax credit would increase to $2,500, up from $2,000, until 2028. The refundable amount of the tax credit per child — meaning how much taxpayers could get back — would now reach up to $1,400. Taxpayers claiming the credit would now have to provide a Social Security number, as well as the SSN of a spouse.

The standard deduction for single and married joint filers would temporarily increase until 2029 up to $2,000, depending on filing status.

Trump’s campaign promises, including no tax on tips, also made it into the proposal, though only until 2028. Those claiming the tax break on tips will also need to provide a Social Security number as well as the SSN of their spouse, if married.

Trump’s promise to eliminate taxes on car loan interest, also set to expire in 2028, would not apply to any vehicle that was not finally assembled in the U.S.

Tax writers increased but ultimately left a cap on the amount of state and local taxes, commonly referred to as SALT, that households can deduct, an incredibly contentious issue for lawmakers with constituents in high tax areas like New York and California. GOP lawmakers increased the SALT cap to $30,000, up from $10,000.

That level, however, might not have the support needed among Republicans’ extremely thin majorities and will likely lead to heated debate during markup or on the floor.

Republicans from higher-tax states have repeatedly said they will not vote for the entire package unless they feel their constituents will benefit from raising the SALT cap.

The dispute has spilled over several times already, including in a statement last week from four New York Republicans, who wrote, “The Speaker and the House Ways and Means Committee unilaterally proposed a flat $30,000 SALT cap — an amount they already knew would fall short of earning our support.”

“It’s not just insulting—it risks derailing President Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill,” they wrote. “New Yorkers already send far more to Washington than we get back—unlike many so-called ‘low-tax’ states that depend heavily on federal largesse.

“A higher SALT cap isn’t a luxury. It’s a matter of fairness.”

New York Republican Rep. Nick LaLota wrote on social media Monday afternoon: “Still a hell no.”

How much the tax proposal will cost has not yet been released, but government deficit watchdogs estimated a wholesale extension of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, without the enhancements, would cost north of $4 trillion over the next decade.

Erica York, vice president of federal tax policy at the Tax Foundation, said the proposal provides some certainty to individual taxpayers but it also adds complexity in many areas.

“You can clearly see the thinking here was probably just a straight-up extension (of the 2017 law), people wouldn’t feel like they got a tax cut because it’s just continuing. So they had to do something to make it feel like there’s a larger tax cut,” York said.

Ag cuts remain a mystery

The House Agriculture Committee, led by Pennsylvania Republican Glenn ‘GT’ Thompson, hadn’t released its bill as of Monday afternoon but was scheduled to begin the markup on Tuesday evening.

That panel is supposed to cut at least $230 billion in federal spending during the next decade, some of which will likely come from reworking elements of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP.

Committee leaders are also planning to include elements of the much overdue farm bill, though those provisions could run into issues in the Senate if they don’t have a significant impact on federal revenue or spending.

Republicans are using the complex reconciliation process to move the package through Congress with simple majority votes in each chamber, avoiding the Senate’s 60-vote legislative filibuster, which would otherwise require bipartisanship.

Reconciliation measures must address federal revenue, spending, or the debt limit in a way not deemed “merely incidental” by the Senate parliamentarian. That means the GOP proposals must carry some sort of price tag and cannot focus simply on changing federal policy.

The project is the company’s first large-scale installation in North America and is being conducted in partnership with FirstLight Power, which owns the plant.

The project follows earlier testing in spring 2024 at the Santee Cooper Hydroelectric Project in South Carolina. Both efforts aim to support migratory fish species such as American Shad and river herring, which are part of state and federal restoration programs.

For the first two to three years, the Fishheart system will operate at the Tunnel Hydropower Plant. If it performs successfully, the system may be moved to the Stevenson Hydropower Plant in Monroe, Connecticut, for permanent installation.

The purpose of the project is to test the Fishheart system’s ability to attract and guide fish safely past the hydropower facility. The system includes a floating fishway below the dam and a pipeline over the dam. It uses a siphon mechanism to create upstream attraction water that encourages fish to enter. According to Fishheart Ltd., this design reduces the need for permanent infrastructure and is more cost-effective and flexible than traditional fishways.

Fishheart systems have been in use at four river sites in Finland for several years. The company is also running a separate test project in Menindee, Australia.

The Connecticut project is being observed by agencies including NOAA’s National Marine Fisheries Service, the US Fish and Wildlife Service, and the Connecticut Department of Energy and Environmental Protection. Approval from these agencies is necessary for the system’s future use in North America.

“For FirstLight, the long-term goal of the trial is to develop a successful, cost-effective solution for fish passage where it is required at its hydropower plants in North America,” the company said. It chose the Tunnel Hydropower Plant for initial testing because it is located on a small river with the presence of the target fish species, allowing for controlled testing conditions.

The incentives put in place by former President Joe Biden’s signature climate law have been ripe targets for lawmakers looking for trillions of dollars to help pay for extending Trump’s tax cuts. The president himself has had a bullseye on them, deriding them as part of the “green new scam.”

Under the Republicans’ proposal, a popular consumer tax credit of up to $7,500 for the purchase of an electric vehicle would be fully eliminated by the end of 2026, and only manufacturers that have sold fewer than 200,000 electric vehicles by the end of this year would would be eligible to receive it in 2026, according to bill text. Tax incentives for the purchase of commercial electric vehicles and used electric vehicles would also be repealed, as well as a clean energy credit for homeowners that has benefited the residential solar market.

The electric vehicle incentive was expanded in Democrats’ Inflation Reduction Act. Its cost is projected to balloon from an initial estimate of $12.5 billion made by the Congressional Budget Office in 2022. An analysis by consulting firm Capital Alpha Partners in March said the credit’s 10-year cost could total more than $200 billion.

Republicans are also proposing to eliminate a tax credit that provides as much as $3-per-kilogram for the production of hydrogen, a clean-burning fuel seen as critical for decarbonizing steel, cement and heavy transportation. Companies such as FuelCell Energy Inc. and hydrogen producer Plug Power Inc. have been closely watching the credits.

In addition, Republicans proposed repealing tax credit “transferability,” which allows a project sponsor to sell tax credits to a third party, for several of the credits, starting two years after the legislation becomes law.

But the draft legislation released Monday by House tax writers may not be as bad for producers of clean electricity from sources such as solar and wind, who feared a more aggressive phase out. First Solar Inc., the largest U.S. solar manufacturer, rose 11% on Monday. Sunrun Inc., the largest U.S. residential solar company, rose nearly 17%.

“The proposal is mostly a win for U.S. solar manufacturers and developers,” said Rob Barnett, senior analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence. “The fear is that the investment and production tax credits could have been gutted sooner.”

In the Republicans’ proposal, popular production and investment tax credits for clean electricity would be phased out by the end of 2031 and new requirements against using materials from certain foreign nations would be added.

Under the climate bill passed by Democrats in 2022, those credits weren’t set to expire until the later part of 2032 or until until carbon emissions from the U.S. electricity sector decline to at least 75% below 2022 levels, which analysts said would take decades. A tax credit for the production of nuclear energy would also be phased out by 2031 in the Republican plan.

House Republicans opted to keep other credits, such as an incentive for carbon capture that provides as much as $85 a ton and extended by four years an incentive that provides a per-gallon credit for makers of biofuels and other so-called clean transportation fuels based on the intensity of carbon production.

The legislation, which is set to receive a key vote by the House Ways and Means Committee later this week, is likely to be changed in the Senate.

Federal tax credits that benefit energy developers, manufacturers and utilities face an early phaseout in a budget proposal released Monday by a key GOP-controlled House committee.

The House Ways and Means Committee’s draft reconciliation package steps down the investment and production tax credits for nuclear power, wind, solar, batteries, geothermal and other clean energy technologies after 2028, and eliminates them completely after 2031. It preserves a comparatively generous credit for carbon sequestration and extends the clean fuels production credit.

Energy industry groups and customers slammed the proposal, saying it would raise electricity prices, quash a manufacturing boom spurred by the Inflation Reduction Act and erode the United States’ competitive advantage on artificial intelligence.

Dive Insight:

The Ways and Means budget gives clean energy developers and producers until 2028 to claim the full 45Y and 48E tax credits for clean energy investment and production. The credit values step down to 80% in 2029, 60% in 2030 and 40% in 2031 before zeroing out in 2032. A separate credit for nuclear power production would phase out on the same schedule.

As originally passed, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 allowed taxpayers to claim the full value of all three credits into 2032.

“While our industry is ready to engage constructively and find a workable path forward, the Committee’s approach simply goes too far too fast,” American Clean Power Association CEO Jason Grumet said in a statement. “With energy demand surging, this is not the time for disruption.”

The Ways and Means proposal also tightens eligibility for 45Y and 48E by requiring projects to be “placed in service” to qualify for the credit. The Inflation Reduction Act based eligibility on the year projects began construction, a more generous framework in a world where the timeline for grid interconnection and long-lead electrical equipment can stretch for years.

The placed-in-service requirement “severely crimps utility scale renewables” to the point that “the only projects that will get the full ITC and PTC are those already in the queue,” Advait Arun, senior associate for energy finance at the Center for Public Enterprise, said in an interview.

Clean energy advocates warned that the Ways and Means budget could disproportionately harm the “clean firm” technologies President Trump and House Republicans seem to favor, like advanced nuclear and geothermal.

“Some of America’s largest companies are attempting to advance critical new technologies like geothermal and advanced nuclear energy, but those technologies will not move forward if these tax credits are phased out,” Clean Energy Buyers Association CEO Rich Powell said in a statement. Powell’s organization represents major technology and industrial firms driving demand for clean electricity, such as Microsoft and Amazon.

A key nuclear power trade group whose April 30 plea to preserve key IRA tax credits attracted more than 100 signatories earlier this month said the Ways and Means budget would set back an industry critical to U.S. national security.

“Underlying conditions in the market have not changed and nuclear energy is not appropriately valued for its ability to provide reliable, secure, and affordable energy to an increasingly clean electric grid,” Michael Flannigan, vice president of governmental affairs at the Nuclear Energy Institute, said in a statement.

An early end to clean energy tax credits would compound the impacts of downsizing at the Department of Energy, particularly in the DOE Loan Programs Office and Office of Clean Energy Demonstrations, Arun said.

“If those [programs] are all going in the can, it will have just as much of an impact on the emerging technology landscape” as any changes to the tax code, he said.

A proposed two-year sunset of the IRA’s tax credit transferability mechanism could further curtail clean energy investment, Arun said. The IRA created a new pathway for project developers and asset owners with limited tax liability to raise capital by transferring tax credits — at a discount dependent in part on the deal’s perceived risk — to third-party buyers with greater tax liability.

The change would affect small and midsize clean energy developers the most, putting them at a disadvantage to incumbents closer to the big banks that dominate the more complex, gated world of traditional tax equity finance and have limited capacity to take on new clients, Arun said.

“Transferability is the biggest new development in clean energy markets … to shut that down will dry up a lot of the liquidity clean energy developers have been counting on,” he said.

On an earnings call last week, before Ways and Means released its draft budget, Sunrun Chief Financial Officer Danny Abajian said his distributed energy company would have to temporarily “[shift] how we source capital” were transferability repealed. But he said Sunrun could eventually benefit from a “flight to quality” in a tighter tax credit market.

Crux, an energy capital markets platform that has emerged as a key player in the nascent transferability industry, said in a subscriber email Monday that the Ways and Means proposal “is just the starting point and we anticipate that the final bill will take a more favorable stance on transferability and tax credits.”

Though both are subject to new restrictions on transferability and foreign ownership, the Ways and Means proposal treats the 45Q tax credit for carbon capture and sequestration and the 45Z credit for clean fuels production more favorably than the technology-neutral credits. The proposal maintains 45Q through 2032 and extends the 45Z credit through 2031, giving producers of biofuels like ethanol and sustainable aviation fuel four more years to claim it.

Hydrogen producers are not so lucky. The Ways and Means proposal eliminates the 45V credit for clean hydrogen production after this year, less than 12 months after the Treasury Department released final guidance.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/6sfGF4OzQ-ZaCl6Wt8X2lvf99GqpB5OUwVDdwg5FM00/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9HZXR0eUltYWdlcy0xNzU0OTA3MjU3LmpwZw==.webp,N,,2025-05-13 14:35:07.857529

I've driven both the Blazer EV and the Equinox EV, and I found the Equinox EV to be a more compelling choice.
The cheapest Blazer EV you can buy starts at $44,600 before destination, and the Equinox EV starts at $33,600.
Alternatives like the Hyundai Ioniq 5, Chevrolet Equinox EV, Blazer EV, Ford F-150 Lightning, and Kia EV9 are all great choices that don't put money into the pockets of the richest man on the planet.","Despite very publicly promoting one specific brand's electric vehicles, President Donald Trump's ""Unleashing American Energy"" executive order states that federal policy is, ""considering the elimination of unfair subsidies and other ill-conceived government-imposed market distortions that favor EVs over other technologies."" This is, of course, in reference to the $7,500 tax credit that has been available to buyers of new EVs as laid out by the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022. The incentive helps close the cost gap between gas-powered vehicles and comparable electric vehicles, thus promoting the transition to more environmentally friendly EVs that don't produce any tailpipe emissions.

Some EVs are more compelling vehicles than their fossil fuel-powered, internal combustion engine (ICE) counterparts, but making Americans transition away from the only fuel source that most have ever used is a tough proposition. The tax credit can be the determining factor that makes consumers decide to go EV, but even with the tax credit, buying a brand-new EV might not be the smartest financial decision. EVs generally cost more than ICE cars upfront, but face steeper rates of depreciation than gas cars, so the prices of used electric vehicles are quite favorable. If the Trump administration revokes the EV tax credit, will it still be worthwhile to buy a new EV? In some cases yes, and some cases no. Here are some of the EVs that we think won't be worth buying new if the tax credit goes away.

If your budget is tight enough that you're concerned that the tax credit going away will put the Blazer EV above your price range, simply skip it. Chevrolet put itself in the unique position with the Blazer. The Equinox EV is a cheaper, slightly smaller but still family-sized electric crossover that will be a smarter choice for buyers who are concerned that the demise of the federal tax incentive will move the Blazer EV above their price range. I've driven both the Blazer EV and the Equinox EV, and I found the Equinox EV to be a more compelling choice.

The Equinox EV is only two-inches shorter than the Blazer EV, but it provides almost one cubic-foot more cargo capacity behind the second row of seats, and it provides less than one inch less rear legroom. Going for the cheaper Equinox doesn't mean sacrificing range, either. Equinox EV has a maximum estimated range of 319 miles, and Blazer EV's longest maximum range estimate is 334, so there's not a massive difference there, either. The cheapest Blazer EV you can buy starts at $44,600 before destination, and the Equinox EV starts at $33,600.

It's no secret that the various antics of the richest man on Earth and Tesla's CEO Elon Musk has single-handedly ruined his company's public image in recent months. If you must buy a Tesla, and you're concerned about losing the $7,500 federal tax incentive, you'll be happy to know that Teslas have some of the worst resale values of any vehicles on the used market. That means you can find killer deals on used Teslas. Alternatively, if you're in the market for a new electric vehicle, other automakers produce vehicles that are on this list that offer superior alternatives to a Musk mobile. Alternatives like the Hyundai Ioniq 5, Chevrolet Equinox EV, Blazer EV, Ford F-150 Lightning, and Kia EV9 are all great choices that don't put money into the pockets of the richest man on the planet. Some new EVs, like the Ioniq 5, even come from the factory with a NACS port, which means they have direct access to the Tesla Supercharger network. If you're concerned that the disappearance of the federal EV tax credit will make a new Tesla too expensive, either buy a used one and save big time, or buy from a different, less problematic brand.

If you're in the market for a General Motors-produced full-sized electric pickup truck and you're concerned about losing the help of the $7,500 federal tax incentive, then you should skip over the GMC Sierra EV. For the same reason as we recommend skipping the Blazer EV and going for the cheaper Equinox EV, if budget is your primary concern, skip the GMC Sierra EV and go for the cheaper Chevrolet Silverado EV.

For the 2026 model year, GMC introduced a new base Sierra EV Elevation that starts at $64,495. The federal tax incentive only applies to vehicles with manufacturer suggested retail prices (MSRPs) below $80,000, so no 2025 GMC Sierra EVs qualify since the truck is only offered in its extra fancy and expensive Denali top trim. If you're budget-focused and are worried about losing the $7,500 federal tax incentive, then you should consider the Chevrolet Silverado EV. The Silverado EV Work Truck trim starts at $57,095 including a $2,095 destination charge, so it's $7,400 cheaper than its GMC sibling. The numbers align almost perfectly; if you're worried about the $7,500 tax incentive on a GMC Sierra EV Elevation, buying a Silverado EV Work Truck saves you $7,400.",https://www.jalopnik.com/img/gallery/these-cars-wont-be-worth-buying-if-the-ev-tax-credit-goes-away/l-intro-1747078137.jpg,N,,2025-05-13 14:42:35.589782

Stevenson said that she believes the seat is within reach for Democrats despite GOP Rep. Andy Barr’s recent landslide victories.
“I know how to win in a red seat,” Stevenson said in an interview with the Herald-Leader about the race.
Stevenson’s political calling card has been education.
The way she won her seat and flipped it in 2018 is that she knocked every single door,” Roberts said.","Former Lexington state representative Cherlynn Stevenson is running to flip the 6th Congressional District from red to blue in 2026, she announced Tuesday.

Stevenson said that she believes the seat is within reach for Democrats despite GOP Rep. Andy Barr’s recent landslide victories.

“I know how to win in a red seat,” Stevenson said in an interview with the Herald-Leader about the race.

So, how is it done? Stevenson said she’ll focus on aggressive in-person campaigning and hammering home the “meat and potatoes” issues of prices, education and health care.

A predicted backlash to the policies of President Donald Trump, whose undulating tariff strategy has stirred uncertainty and even discontent on Wall Street, is central to her argument. The available polling on Trump’s approval rating has been declining steadily.

“I think people are really scared by the chaos that they’re seeing in Washington right now,” she said.

“You know, we see tariffs that are hurting our local economies and threatening a lot of jobs. We see people that are worried that the Social Security benefits aren’t going to be there, that Medicaid and Medicare are in danger. You know, a carton of eggs cost more, and people’s nest eggs have gone down.”

Stevenson added: “I think that the environment is going to be right for somebody who’s out there not trying to talk about the things that divide us, but about the real issues that Kentucky families and working families are facing right now.”

But while Stevenson, 48, won her seat three times, she lost on the fourth effort to Rep. Vanessa Grossl, R-Georgetown, last year.

Grossl flipped the seat — which stretches across much of suburban and rural Fayette County as well a slice of Scott County — winning by about half a percentage point two years after Stevenson won reelection by an even slimmer margin.

Republican Party of Kentucky Communications Director Andy Westberry pointed the loss out in a statement on Stevenson’s candidacy.

“Cherlynn Stevenson must be a glutton for punishment. After getting rejected by voters in her own backyard, she’s now aiming higher—only to fall harder. Her entry into this race isn’t a serious campaign; it’s a one-way ticket to political career-ending humiliation.

“Let’s be clear: the 6th District is Trump Country —rock-solid Republican ground where liberal pipe dreams go to die,” Westberry wrote.

Indeed, Trump won the district by about 15 percentage points. Ever since a close three-point victory over Democrat Amy McGrath in 2018, Barr has won his last three elections by an average of 24 percentage points.

But Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear, albeit with a different off-year electorate, won the district by about 20.

And Stevenson’s pledge to focus on the “real issues” over the divisive ones sounds a lot like Beshear’s classic pitch to voters, both in Kentucky and more recently on the national stage.

So where does Beshear stand on Stevenson’s run? She said she spoke to the governor before making her announcement, and he was “encouraging,”

“He was encouraging. We talked about the fact that I have been able to win in difficult districts. You know, he has endorsed me in every other race that I’ve ever been in, and I look forward to earning his endorsement this time,” Stevenson said.

She did not say whether she believed his endorsement would come during the primary for the seat.

A handful of other Kentucky Democrats have been mentioned as possibilities for the seat, especially since the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee listed the Central Kentucky-based district as one of their 35 Republican-held “Districts in Play” for the 2026 cycle.

Federal prosecutor Zach Dembo and former Lexington councilman David Kloiber are two names to watch; former secretary of state Allison Lundergan Grimes is also mentioned as a potential candidate.

Fayette County makes up about 44% of the district.

The other counties in the 6th Congressional District, in order of population, are Madison, Scott, Jessamine, Montgomery, Woodford, Mercer, Bourbon, Garrard, Fleming, Estill, Powell and Nicholas. Aside from Fayette, the other counties in the district generally lean Republican.

Stevenson’s background

When asked about her elevator pitch to voters, Stevenson gave a glimpse of how she feels her background – moving to the Lexington area from Eastern Kentucky, as many residents have – might help her.

“I was raised in Eastern Kentucky by a mom who was a teacher and a daddy who worked in coal and I know the values of hard work, and I know you know the struggles that everyday Kentuckians face, that I am not someone who Is there to represent a political party, but I am there to represent the people and take their hopes, their dreams and their worst fears to Washington and to fight for them,” Stevenson said.

Stevenson was raised in Knott County but has lived in Lexington for several years. She first ran for office and flipped the 88th House District in 2018. She won a close race in 2020, then won again by just 37 votes in a tight race to Republican Jim Coleman.

In Frankfort, Stevenson rose the ranks quickly to become House Democratic caucus chair four years into her time there. She was widely seen as a strong candidate for floor leader, the highest position in the caucus, before her loss.

Stevenson was the subject of a short-lived controversy last year due to an ethics complaint filed against her. The complaint centered around her co-purchasing a Frankfort condo with a lobbyist. It was swiftly dismissed by the Legislative Ethics Commission.

Stevenson’s political calling card has been education. She pushed back strongly against 2024’s pro-school choice amendment, which would have allowed the state legislature to fund charter and non-public K-12 schooling.

Stevenson represented the “anti” side on the amendment question at Fancy Farm, the state’s biggest political speaking event, in 2024.

The amendment ended up losing by a whopping 30 percentage points.

At the event

On Tuesday morning, Stevenson made her announcement public in front of television cameras and more than 50 supporters in Midway.

The setting was intentional. Stevenson held the event at Bluegrass Distillers, a bourbon distillery just off the I-64 exit. Tariffs have been top of mind for the industry, as bourbon has previously been in the crosshairs of retaliatory tariffs levied by other countries against the United States.

Her podium was set up inside the distillery with a row of bourbon barrels lined up behind her. Open garage bay doors behind Stevenson revealed a landscape of verdant Kentucky fields.

“We need economic policies that put working people first and take on billionaires rigging the system, not tariffs that risk sending us into another Great Depression. It’s time for trade policies that benefit Kentucky workers, families and our country,” Stevenson said. “We all want more American jobs, but these tariffs are hurting us right here at home. Bourbon is being taken off the shelves around the world.”

Stevenson’s speech covered a lot of territory, but some of the top items hammered on were GOP-backed health care spending cuts, tariffs and opposition to tax breaks benefiting the wealthy.

After her speech, she said she was against one of the GOP’s top priorities this year: extending the tax cuts implemented by the Trump-backed Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.

“We should not be giving billionaires a tax cut at the expense of veterans (and) families who depend on Medicaid and Medicare for their health care,” Stevenson said.

On foreign policy, Stevenson offered a glimpse of where she stands on some of the biggest issues of the day, like the conflicts in Ukraine and Gaza.

“I support Ukraine and their ability to be able to defend themselves, and I think the United States has a role to play in trying to keep peace and protect democracy around the world,” Stevenson said.

While Democrats have been generally in agreement about Ukraine, the party line is less clear on the conflict in Israel and Palestine, which was kicked off by the Hamas attacks on Oct. 7, 2023, that ended in nearly 1,200 people killed in Israel, many of them civilians. Israel’s response has led to tens of thousands of Palestinian deaths, with the Palestinian Health Authority estimating more than 50,000 dead.

“What happened back in October was horrendous, and the atrocities happening in the region need to stop. There are a ton of innocent people and children dying and starving to death, and and that really needs to come to an end,” Stevenson said. “We need peace in the Middle East and innocent lives have to be protected. Israel has the right to defend itself, but not at the expense of starving people and killing children.”

Stevenson supporters included a handful of Frankfort colleagues alongside community members.

Former state representative Rachel Roberts, a Northern Kentuckian who served in leadership alongside Stevenson, said that Stevenson was “absolutely the person” to flip the district because of her work ethic and the current political environment.

“Nobody worked harder than her. The way she won her seat and flipped it in 2018 is that she knocked every single door,” Roberts said. “As someone who ran as a Democrat in the state several times, she was always the high bar that the rest of Democrats running would try to meet as far as every door knocked and voter outreach. She will do the work.”

Rep. Adrielle Camuel, D-Lexington, a close ally of Stevenson, agreed. She said that one of Stevenson’s biggest assets was her personality.

“Anybody who has had a minute to talk with Cherlynn knows that she is as genuine as they come. She’s the real deal,” Camuel said. “Her passion for Kentucky, for the 6th District, but also everyone in Kentucky to try and improve life — when you talk to her, you know that’s who she is.”

,EVs,2025-05-13 15:27:46+00:00,www.nytimes.com,Is Slate Auto's Electric Truck the Answer to Expensive Cars? - The New York Times,"Lawrence Ulrich, www.nytimes.com, lawrence-ulrich",,,,,https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/13/business/slate-auto-electric-truck.html,"When Slate Auto, a start-up, unveiled a roughly $25,000 electric pickup truck last month, social media lit up with comments.
Chris Barman, a former Fiat Chrysler engineer and Slate’s chief executive, said the Slate Truck was expressly designed to ease sticker shock, although it won’t be available until late 2026.
That message appealed to Liv Leigh, 41, who hopped inside a Slate Truck during its public debut at the Long Beach Airport in California in April.
That all depends on Slate’s successfully navigating a treacherous path for electric vehicle start-ups.
All are small cars or S.U.V.s, including the market’s lowest-price car, the $18,300 Nissan Versa.","When Slate Auto, a start-up, unveiled a roughly $25,000 electric pickup truck last month, social media lit up with comments. Many people saw the no-frills vehicle, with an easy-to-repair body and nostalgic hand crank windows, as a refreshing antidote to today’s overstuffed and increasingly unaffordable cars.

How unaffordable? Average monthly payments on new cars have soared to $739 in March from $537 in January 2019, according to Cox Automotive. The average new car costs $47,400, with electric models around $59,200. High interest rates, now around 9.4 percent for a 72-month loan, have made cars even more of a financial stretch.

“Prices and interest rates are both high and stuck,” said Mark Schirmer, director of industry insights for Cox Automotive. “If you haven’t been in the market since 2018, it’s got to be shocking what a car costs.”

President Trump’s tariffs of 25 percent on imported cars and parts have consumers scrambling to buy before prices rise even more. Cars that cost less than $30,000 are especially vulnerable — nearly 80 percent of those are subject to tariffs. They include consumer staples like the American-made Honda Civic and Toyota Corolla, which rely on imported parts. Supplies of budget models are expected to shrink, and automakers may stop importing certain models entirely.

Enter Slate, a company based in the Detroit suburbs backed by venture capital firms and Jeff Bezos, the Amazon founder.

Chris Barman, a former Fiat Chrysler engineer and Slate’s chief executive, said the Slate Truck was expressly designed to ease sticker shock, although it won’t be available until late 2026. The company plans to produce the pint-size truck at a retrofitted printing plant in Indiana, with a capacity for 150,000 a year.

True to its name, the truck is designed to be a blank slate to which buyers can add more than 100 accessories, like power windows and heated seats, as their budgets allow or needs change. There is no built-in stereo or touch-screen display, but there are docks for phones or tablets, saving money and avoiding the digital obsolescence that often plagues auto entertainment and navigation systems.

“We think hardworking Americans are looking for good value for the money,” Ms. Barman said in a recent interview.

That message appealed to Liv Leigh, 41, who hopped inside a Slate Truck during its public debut at the Long Beach Airport in California in April. Ms. Leigh, a biomedical designer and electric-car enthusiast, paid $50 to reserve a Slate.

She watched the company’s employees transform the two-seat pickup into a five-passenger sport utility vehicle in about one hour, with a clever conversion kit aimed at do-it-yourself owners. Ms. Leigh appreciated the truck’s tidy size, shorter than a Civic, and its modest 150-mile range.

“I love the idea of an absolute base, beater truck, where I can stick a dog or muddy bikes or plywood in back,” Ms. Leigh said. “I don’t need a giant vehicle to haul stuff.”

Ms. Barman said efficient design and production were key to the company’s promised low prices. The truck’s gray plastic-composite body panels eliminate any need for a steel body-stamping plant or paint shop, which can cost automakers many millions of dollars.

“That all keeps costs down, but also feeds into giving customers freedom of choice,” Ms. Barman said. “They can outfit the vehicle the way they want it, not the way a manufacturer has designed it.”

Slate hopes that a U.S.-based supply chain, including batteries made by SK On, a South Korean company, will make the pickup eligible for a $7,500 federal tax credit. Republican lawmakers on Monday released a budget bill that would eliminate that incentive and dismantle other Biden-era climate and energy policies.

That all depends on Slate’s successfully navigating a treacherous path for electric vehicle start-ups. Several young automakers, including Fisker, Nikola and Canoo, have sought bankruptcy protection and shut down.

With or without subsidies, Slate has a viable business plan, Ms. Barman said.

The company hopes to price its truck in the mid-$20,000s before government incentives, which would undercut the Nissan Leaf, which is the most affordable electric car at $29,300 but no longer eligible for tax credits. Chevrolet plans to offer a redesigned Bolt S.U.V. by year end for roughly $30,000. The General Motors brand intends the Bolt to qualify for the tax credit, dropping its effective price to roughly $22,500.

Erin Keating, the executive analyst of Cox Automotive, praised the Slate Truck’s ingenuity. But she said a pickup with two seats, short range and a bare-bones interior might not appeal to American car buyers who have grown accustom to having many tech and creature comforts.

“There’s nothing wrong with trying to crack the affordability crisis, but I don’t see this as a massive volume seller,” Ms. Keating said. “Ultimately, this is an extremely small E.V. with almost nothing in it, in a market with a growing number of affordable choices with much longer range.”

The Ford Maverick is a potential rival that may argue for or against Slate’s prospects. That compact pickup is two feet longer than the Slate. It seats five passengers and offers many more features. A hybrid version can reach 40 miles per gallon and travel more than 500 miles on a full tank.

Ford sold 131,000 Mavericks last year, suggesting there is strong demand for small, energy-efficient trucks. The company has raised the starting price of the hybrid version of the truck by $4,200 since 2024, to $28,150, including an increase last week that Ford Motor acknowledged was partly a response to tariffs on the truck, which is assembled in Mexico. The company said it was not passing on the full cost of the tariffs to customers and would offer all of its cars for the same price it sells them to employees until early July.

As much as any vehicle category, America’s pickup trucks epitomize how cars have changed over the last several decades, mostly by becoming bigger, more powerful and a lot more expensive. Some lavish pickups can cost as much as large European luxury sedans. Electric trucks from Tesla, Rivian and Ford range from $70,000 to more than $100,000.

One big challenge for Slate, or other companies hoping to sell more affordable cars, is that despite what they say they want, many Americans don’t seem to buy such cars.

Ms. Keating noted that roughly two dozen models on the market start at less than $25,000. All are small cars or S.U.V.s, including the market’s lowest-price car, the $18,300 Nissan Versa.

Nearly every midsize family sedan starts at less than $30,000, including the Honda Accord, Toyota Camry and Hyundai Sonata. But many Americans have rejected those cars in favor of bigger vehicles. S.U.V.s, pickups and minivans now account for more than 80 percent of the market.

Mr. Trump’s trade policies remain a wild card. Analysts expect tariffs will add thousands of dollars to the prices of new cars and drive up the demand and prices for used cars.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/05/06/multimedia/00biz-affordable-cars-01-fpqg/00biz-affordable-cars-01-fpqg-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-05-13 14:35:50.196265

The company said it would put the plan to build the EV supply chain in Alliston, Ont. — first announced with great fanfare by Canadian politicians in April 2024 — on hold for about two years.

""Due to the recent slowdown of the EV market, Honda Motor has announced an approximate two-year postponement of the comprehensive value chain investment project in Canada. The company will continue to evaluate the timing and project progression as market conditions change,"" Honda Canada spokesperson Ken Chiu told CBC News in an email statement Tuesday.

Honda also said the decision ""has no impact"" on current employment or production at the Alliston manufacturing facility.

Honda's EV project in Canada includes a retooled assembly plant, an electric vehicle battery plant in close proximity, as well as two key battery parts facilities located elsewhere in Ontario.

The project was expected to see the two main plants create 1,000 jobs on top of retaining the existing 4,200 jobs at the assembly plant.

Under the original plan, the plant was set to produce up to 240,000 vehicles per year when fully operational in 2028.

The project was first announced in April 2024 at an event that included then-prime minister Justin Trudeau and Ontario Premier Doug Ford and was to receive support from the federal and Ontario governments.

Ottawa was set to give the Japanese automaker around $2.5 billion through tax credits, while Ontario committed to provide up to $2.5 billion in support directly and indirectly.

Ford told reporters at a news conference that he was confident Honda would continue making cars in the province.

""When I talked to Honda, they promised us they're going to continue on with that expansion,"" Ford said of the pause. ""So we'll just see how that moves forward. But we're very confident that we'll continue producing Honda vehicles here in Ontario.""

The premier also said he would hold automakers that pull out of Ontario ""accountable,"" should that happen.

Flavio Volpe, president of the Automotive Parts Manufacturers' Association, said Tuesday's decision shows how U.S. tariffs continue to be felt in the auto industry.

""We hope to find a solution for Canada soon that restores the confidence Honda had when it made its historic EV expansion decision here,"" Volpe wrote in an email statement.

Tariffs and smaller appetite for EVs having an impact

In reporting its latest financial results Tuesday, Honda Motor Co. said its profit for the financial year through March fell 24.5 per cent from the previous year and warned that U.S. President Donald Trump's tariffs will worsen its earnings.

The Tokyo-based automaker said its annual profit totalled 835.8 billion yen (around $8 billion Cdn), down from 1.1 trillion yen in the previous year. Annual sales edged up 6.2 per cent to nearly 21.69 trillion yen (around $205 billion Cdn).

Officials stressed major uncertainties remain, but said they felt it was important to give a realistic projection, no matter how pessimistic it might be.

Chief executive Toshihiro Mibe said Honda will do its best to minimize the impact from tariffs. In the long term, Honda will transfer auto production to U.S. plants and rethink its investment plans. All decisions will be made ""very carefully,"" Mibe told reporters.

David Adams, president and CEO of Global Automakers of Canada, says that while tariffs were a factor in today's announcement, the slower than expected uptake of EVs also likely played a big role.

""Is electrification moving forward? Sure, it is. Are consumers continuing to buy EVs? Yes,"" Adams said. ""But we're not seeing the sort of [rapid] uptake of EVs that ... environmentalists and some in government anticipated.""

Despite that, Adams says EVs are still the way of the future — he says trillions have been spent globally to transition from traditional internal combustion engines to battery electric instead, and carmakers won't simply walk away from those commitments. ""But those investments might not just come to fruition as quickly as maybe originally anticipated.""",https://i.cbc.ca/1.7533439.1747140984!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/16x9_1180/canada-economy.JPG?im=Resize%3D620,N,,2025-05-13 14:35:53.079236

“What inspires me most about working at the Detroit Zoo and the Nature Center is the opportunity to witness those ‘aha’ moments.","Detroit Zoo in Royal Oak, Michigan, is known for its forward-looking methods in animal care, engaging visitor experiences, and commitment to worldwide conservation efforts.

Visited by 1.3 million people annually, the AZA-accredited facility is operated by the Detroit Zoological Society, which also oversees the Belle Isle Nature Center.

Blooloop speaks to Randi Hamilton, chief experience officer at Detroit Zoo, about how the attraction is helping guests connect with nature, understand environmental issues, and make positive changes to protect the world around us – all while enjoying a fun day out.

Detroit Zoo’s mission

Speaking about what drives the Detroit Zoo team, Hamilton says:

“Our mission, vision, and values speak to the heart of who we are. Our purpose is to ignite positive change for animals and nature, and our mission is to do that by creating meaningful connections for people, animals, and the natural world. It all ties together, and we use that as our guiding principle, our filter for decision-making.

“We put a lot of intentionality into the decisions we make, the programmes we produce, and the experiences we work to develop.”

The team cares for over 2,000 animals representing over 200 species on a 125-acre campus at the zoo.

“It’s a big, beautiful space for our community to connect, not only with nature but with each other. On top of that, we focus heavily on animal well-being and educational initiatives, tying all that together to create unique connections that build empathy. That contributes to how people see us as a credible, mission-driven organisation.”

The zoo is also known for its transparency and fiscal responsibility, she adds:

“We’re well rated with our GuideStar participation as far as our charitable organisation status is concerned. Another exciting aspect is our economic impact. More than $167 million annually is contributed to the local economy through our operations. We also have a huge membership base, which contributes to why we’re so special and have such a loyal following, with more than 42,000 member households.

“Those individuals are the ones that keep us going and are a big part of why we’re here.”

A meaningful guest experience

When it comes to curating the guest experience, Hamilton says that, for a modern zoo, this work should be about shaping something intentional and meaningful for visitors.

“With such a broad audience, there are many ways to do that, and that’s what makes it exciting. I see my role as an absolute privilege, especially getting to work with our team’s incredible talent and passion. We approach things from every angle, thinking about members, long-term giving audiences, the next generation, and how they view the zoo.”

Creating experiences that are meaningful and genuinely immersive, allowing people to connect in a way that works best for them and that can inspire while still being inclusive, is critical for the Detroit Zoo team, she adds:

“It doesn’t matter whether someone is attending a keeper talk or a fundraising event; if they feel welcome and connected, we’ve done a good job.

“What we hope is that the experiences we create now can ignite action, whether that’s someone taking what they’ve learned and sharing it, changing something in their own home, starting to compost, building a rain garden, or contributing to a global animal relief fund.

“Anything we can do that creates a connection for someone, in a way that’s meaningful to them, is really what brings joy to my day.”

Education and entertainment go hand in hand at Detroit Zoo

Yet, there can be a challenge in balancing this educational element of the experience with the need to entertain.

“It’s tricky, but on the other hand, for us, it’s a very welcome challenge,” says Hamilton. “Because in our minds, it doesn’t have to be either fun or education. To us, they’re all intertwined.

“We’re very mindful of our audiences. We get a lot of input from them and lean on their feedback. Also, we rely on studies to better understand how people learn and what will make things stick, so to speak.”

For Detroit Zoo, it’s about designing hands-on experiences that elevate the stories; storytelling is critical. “That’s the stuff people remember. Those are the things they take away.

“Maybe it’s connecting someone to a memory they’ve had or a story that was important to them and then relating it to a story we’re sharing. The more we can create those kinds of opportunities, ones that are meaningful and approachable, the more I think people will take away about what they can do to support the natural world.”

Storytelling meets conservation

Recent examples of the zoo’s programming include initiatives that combine outdoor play with storytelling around wildlife conservation. “This past season, we had Wildlife Rescue [pictured, top], which was a climbing experience featuring small animal climbers spread throughout our campus,” says Hamilton.

“It was tactile and fun for kids, a great photo opportunity for families and visiting groups. But it also shared important stories about each animal, whether it was an orangutan or a red panda.”

These stories weren’t just displayed; there was an in-person encounter aspect, too, she adds: “We partnered with our education team and our volunteers to host pop-up interactions throughout the zoo. Guests could walk up during their visit and learn directly from our team.

“We also shared these stories online, allowing people who couldn’t visit in person to engage with the content and understand its conservation messages.”

This year, the zoo is launching Dragon Forest, an immersive, three-acre experience trail centred around dragons and mythical creatures.

“It’s a fun, imaginative way to connect people with nature. The idea is that nature has long influenced myth and storytelling, and this space lets guests explore that relationship. There are opportunities to climb, touch, smell, and listen to sounds within the space. There will be storytelling flowers, fairy gardens, and other elements that link to the flora and fauna of the area.

“It’s another creative way to inspire curiosity and connection.”

Accessibility at Detroit Zoo

Other guest experience innovations that Detroit Zoo is introducing include ReBokeh, an assistive technology tool designed for guests with visual impairments.

“It’s often used in museums, but we’re one of the first zoos to use it this way,” says Hamilton. “It enhances engagement with our interpretive signage and natural spaces, helping guests experience the zoo in a more accessible and meaningful way. We’re excited to roll that out.”

“We’ve also developed new mobile apps and are incorporating augmented reality on campus in different ways. We’re also expanding our engagement schedules at the zoo and the Nature Center so guests can plan for a more elevated experience, whether learning from our keepers, participating in special activations, or engaging beyond the traditional daytime visit.”

Conservation at home and abroad

Conservation is at the heart of everything that Detroit Zoo does.

“One of the things we continuously focus on is how we tell those stories because there is just so much happening, and we’re always looking for ways to elevate that,” says Hamilton.

“We have many programmes, not only in our backyard but also on all seven continents, all of which are critical. From a local perspective, we’re very active in rescuing and releasing piping plovers. Just recently, in 2024, we reached a milestone. I believe the total is now 17 piping plovers successfully hatched and released back into the wild, which is exciting.”

“We have team members who travel to Peru to support planting fruit trees, building connections with local communities, providing science education, delivering supplies, and helping with access to clean water resources.

“In the Falkland Islands, we’ve contributed to important penguin research — work that also informs what we do here at home in our Polk Penguin Conservation Center.”

“We’ve also made strides with our Partula snail conservation efforts. We recently did another release, and to date, we’ve helped return around 1,000 Partula snails to the wild in partnership with other zoos and organisations. We’re very proud to be part of that collaborative effort.”

Overall, Detroit Zoo participates in 12 AZA SAFE programmes. This stands for Saving Animals From Extinction and is an initiative spearheaded by AZA, the Association of Zoos and Aquariums. The zoo has numerous team members actively engaged, whether through boots-on-the-ground fieldwork, research support, or both.

Engaging the local community

Closer to home, the zoo team also works hard to engage its local community. With a strong membership base, it is a beloved institution for many who live nearby.

“Not only do we host opportunities here on the zoo grounds and at the Nature Center, but we also find ways to invite people to join us in other programmes out in the community,” says Hamilton.

“We’ve done everything from volunteering to community support. For example, we have a programme with The Greening of Detroit, where we participate in tree plantings throughout the city. We share those opportunities with our member base and invite them to join us.”

“We also take part in a number of community engagement events with other local organisations, where we can celebrate and elevate their mission alongside ours.”

Each year, Detroit Zoo hosts more than 72 ticketed and non-ticketed events that align with its mission. Member perks are tied to many of those events, from early access to exclusive experiences.

“From a membership standpoint, not only are they informed about opportunities in advance, but there are also many ways to get involved. We take their feedback seriously and always look for ways to continue enriching that relationship with our members.”

Sustainability

Sustainability is increasingly important for all types of visitor attractions, but at Detroit Zoo, it is embedded into operations, says Hamilton:

“Just like conservation and animal well-being are part of our planning process, sustainability is another essential element. We’re always asking: what are the sustainable factors we must consider? How will this impact the animals around us? If it’s a physical product being installed, what are the implications, and what are the stories or explanations we need to share with our guests?

A perfect example is Discovery Trails, which is opening in 2026.

“It’s a seven-acre site, and within that space, we’ll have 12 rain gardens, all planted with native species. We’ve put much thought into ensuring that our stormwater management process complements the new infrastructure, particularly because we’re part of a significant watershed area.”

“That watershed is critical to our region, so we feel it’s crucial to walk the walk, not just talk the talk when it comes to sustainability.”

The zoo also invests in the minds of the future, she adds:

“Our Tri-County Green Schools programme supports student-driven green initiatives in local school districts as part of our Green Prize programme. We help support their innovation and ideas for the future, and each year, we celebrate the winning schools here at the zoo.

“It’s a great way to infuse our practices into the broader community, from what we do on-site to how we support renewable energy. We’ve worked hard to reach 100% renewable electricity for our operations.

These efforts reflect the zoo’s commitment to being more than just a destination: “We aim to be a hub for the community and a catalyst for collective action around sustainability and the protection of the natural world.”

Inspiring the next generation at Detroit Zoo

One of the key responsibilities of a good modern zoo is to inspire the next generation to care about the planet around them.

“What we do know, especially with how people are receiving information today, is that the stories we tell need to be authentic, transparent, and purposeful,” says Hamilton. “They need to spark thought and, hopefully, inspire action.”

For Detroit Zoo, it’s about ensuring it tells stories with a long-term impact.

“We want to go deep enough to create real understanding, the “why” behind what we do. That also means pulling back the curtain. When we share all the exciting aspects of working with animals or highlight innovations, we also need to show how we got there. What’s the journey, and what insights did we gain along the way?”

It’s also important to consider where and how to share those stories, she adds: “Are we using the right platforms? Are we reaching people where they are in a way that resonates? Because that’s how we’ll make the greatest impact.

“It’s about creating open, welcoming conversations. Yes, there’s scepticism. Some people question the relevance of zoos today. But for us, it’s really about our responsibility to help people understand nature, why it matters and what role we play in ensuring it thrives into the future.”

The team tries to meet scepticism not with defensiveness but with honest dialogue. “We want to understand why someone might think a certain way and then meet them there in conversation.

“These are complex issues. How do we distil all that complexity into something palatable and understandable? Because it’s easy to feel overwhelmed. We don’t want people to feel defeated before they even get started. Instead, it’s about helping people take one step at a time.”

Discovery Trails

Looking to the future, Detroit Zoo will launch Discovery Trails in 2026.

“We’re very excited for Discovery Trails,” says Hamilton. “It’s the most expansive new experience in the history of the Detroit Zoo.

“Last year, we launched a new visual identity and brand in May 2024, which aligned with a refresh of our key commitments and core values. It brought our mission back to the forefront, and Discovery Trails will be the first significant expression of the future we’re working toward.”

“Every team here has played a critical role in creating environments that are not only innovative but deeply mission-driven. This space will feature new species we’ve never had before and the return of some species that haven’t been part of the zoo for a long time.

“There’s a lot of innovation in how visitors will experience these habitats, not just through animal encounters but also through meaningful connections to actions they can take to make a difference.”

The project also includes new amenities, entertainment features, and accessible experiences designed to be welcoming to all. This includes a wheelchair-accessible tree trail, an interactive goat yard, and opportunities to engage with stingrays and bamboo sharks.

“There will also be a strong art component, with installations by local artists and our team members. Overall, Discovery Trails will be a versatile, immersive experience that reflects the heart of who we are and where we’re headed.”

A passionate team

Finally, reflecting on her role and what inspires her about the work, Hamilton says:

“One thing people don’t realise about the zoo and aquarium world is the incredible talent and passion that runs through the entire organisation. So many different disciplines and career paths can be realised here, beyond what most people might expect.

“When I first joined, I was amazed by everything that contributes to achieving our exceptional goals, from storytelling to funding to care services. It’s a unique and special environment filled with people deeply committed to our mission.

“There are also many opportunities here, not just in traditional roles but also in science and hospitality fields, making zoos and aquariums a great place for a wide range of careers.

“What inspires me most about working at the Detroit Zoo and the Nature Center is the opportunity to witness those ‘aha’ moments. Whether it’s a group connecting, a child bonding with an animal, or an engaging interaction with a keeper, seeing the joy on people’s faces fills my heart.

“Those moments, whether it’s a realisation or laughter, mean we’re doing our job. They leave with a meaningful memory, potentially even creating a core memory that they’ll carry with them.

“We know that visitors find a sense of tradition here, and the legacy I hope to help build is one of authentic connection and shared purpose. I want our legacy to foster empathy alongside innovation, ensuring that people always feel welcome, included, and enriched, no matter the size of their experience.

“Above all, I hope they leave with a more profound compassion for nature.”

A powerful ridge of high pressure has built up over the continent, with a strong southerly flow amplifying high temperatures this week as it drags up a hot, dry, air mass. Environment and Climate Change Canada and the National Weather Service in the US have both issued heat alerts across their respective countries due to how extreme the temperatures are for the time of year.

Temperatures are set to soar nearly 19C above the seasonal average in southern Manitoba, with some models suggesting daytime maxima in Winnipeg could reach 36C on Tuesday. Tropical nights – those where temperatures do not fall below 20C – are likely for the city, with the overnight lows currently forecast to stay around 21C.

Remarkably, just three days later, on Friday, daytime maxima are set to plummet nearly 30C, with daytime temperatures expected not to exceed 7C.

In Texas, the heat is forecast to peak on Wednesday, with widespread record-breaking temperatures above 40C (104F), 11-13C above the average for the time of year.

Austin, the state capital, has a climate record spanning back to 1891, of which the record high temperature in May was recorded in 1925, at 104F (40C); some forecast models are hinting that the record is likely to be broken on Tuesday and Wednesday, when temperatures could hit 108F (42.4C).

San Antonio also looks likely to smash its current record of 104F (40C). While this record was set more recently, in 2004, temperatures are forecast to extend the record by a large margin, potentially reaching 109F (43C).

Fort Worth, in the north-east of the state, could experience 106F (41C) on Wednesday too, but this would be just shy of the 1927 May record of 107F (41.6C). It will however, beat the date record for 14 May, which currently stands at 95F (35C) set in 1955.

Central and north-western Europe are unlikely to have significant rainfall this week, edging closer to widespread drought conditions after such dry and warm weather through the late winter and spring so far.

Soil moisture indices are showing that many places are currently at the “permanent wilting point”, meaning available water in the soil has been exhausted leading to plants permanently wilting. It is not only widespread at the surface, but also seeping through the deeper layers of the soil, meaning that those plants with tap-root systems and trees will begin experiencing drought stress as the deeper soil moisture reserves dwindle.

High pressure is expected to remain dominant over the next couple of weeks, blocking the arrival of frontal systems from the Atlantic that would give much-needed rainfall.",https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b8b331c3af3394d4fdd6a0a81de76622f726a818/314_0_4593_3675/master/4593.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=bc7f65c1574a474fc4577e1e43229698,N,,2025-05-13 14:45:51.765146

Republican Rep. Brett Guthrie of Kentucky, chairman of the House Energy and Commerce panel, said his committee’s bill, unveiled Sunday, would return $6.5 billion in unspent funds intended for climate programs included in the 2022 law.
“The legislation would reverse the most reckless parts of the engorged climate spending in the misnamed Inflation Reduction Act,” Guthrie wrote.

Republicans in the House Ways and Means Committee on Monday released their own proposal to repeal clean energy tax credits.","WASHINGTON (AP) — House Republicans are calling for billions of dollars in funding cuts for Biden-era climate and environmental programs, including clean energy tax credits, as lawmakers seek to reverse what one GOP leader called “the most reckless parts of the engorged climate spending” approved under former President Joe Biden.

Environmental groups warned the proposals would pave the way for more oil and gas industry activity on public lands and increase planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions in the United States.

The House committees on Energy and Commerce and Ways and Means are set to discuss the plans Tuesday as part of the so-called budget reconciliation process. Several moves are aimed at clawing back billions in spending authorized by the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, a Democratic measure intended to slow climate change and boost clean energy such as wind and solar power.

House Speaker Mike Johnson has set a Memorial Day deadline to pass President Donald Trump’s big bill of tax breaks and spending cuts, and the GOP has scheduled round-the-clock hearings this week on various sections of the bill before they are stitched together in what will become a massive package.

Republican Rep. Brett Guthrie of Kentucky, chairman of the House Energy and Commerce panel, said his committee’s bill, unveiled Sunday, would return $6.5 billion in unspent funds intended for climate programs included in the 2022 law. In an op-ed in The Wall Street Journal, he said the plan “ends spending on Green New Deal-style waste” and claws back money “headed for green boondoggles” such as grants for environmental and climate justice.

“The legislation would reverse the most reckless parts of the engorged climate spending in the misnamed Inflation Reduction Act,” Guthrie wrote.

The cuts to climate programs are part of a larger $880 billion in savings by 2034 proposed in the draft legislation that also covers communication and health-related policy, largely targeting Medicaid.

The cuts fit with Trump’s 2026 budget proposal, which looks to slash federal spending through a sweeping reorganization of federal agencies as well as steep cuts to disease research and, especially, clean energy and policies intended to address climate change. Congress ultimately decides the spending and tax plans.

In Trump’s first few months back in the White House, the administration has broadly gone after environmental and climate initiatives, many of which were put into place under the Biden administration, pledging to dismantle what Trump calls the Democrats’ “green new scam.”

Groups decry the proposals

The GOP proposal “guts investments that are cutting energy costs” for families, “powering a domestic manufacturing boom and delivering essential health care to the communities that need it most,” said Lena Moffitt, executive director of the environmental group Evergreen Action.

The Republican move to loosen pollution standards “would mean more smog in our streets,” while cuts to environmental justice block grants “would force low-income communities to pay more for dirtier energy,” she added. “Republicans are sacrificing clean energy on the altar of Big Oil to bankroll another round of tax cuts for the ultra-wealthy.”

Alexandra Adams, chief policy advocacy officer at the Natural Resources Defense Council, said the Energy and Commerce bill “gives polluters free rein to foul the air and water.” Cleaning up U.S. ports and reducing dangerous methane spewing from oil and gas wells have traditionally received bipartisan support, she said.

Albert Gore, executive director of the Zero Emission Transportation Association, said the moves would impact federal investments in domestic battery and mineral supply chain jobs.

“At a moment when our industry needs certainty more than ever, this legislation could slam the brakes on America’s progress towards global competitiveness in manufacturing, while ceding leadership to other countries,” he said.

The National Ocean Industries Association, which represents the offshore oil and wind industries, warned against what it called “premature repeal or phase-out of current tax credits.”

“Sudden changes to the tax code could inject significant uncertainty, jeopardizing capital allocation, project planning and job creation” in offshore energy and the broader economy, said Erik Milito, the group’s president.

Climate programs targeted

The draft text from the Energy and Commerce committee would reclaim unused billions from several Inflation Reduction Act programs, repeal sections of the Clean Air Act and emphasize support for oil and gas drilling.

The plan also pulls back money for the Energy Department’s multi-billion dollar loan program for clean energy, the Environmental Protection Agency’s Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund — commonly known as the “green bank” — and certain multistate and offshore wind development.

It would rescind funding for clean vehicles, loosen vehicle emissions standards and cut money for zero-emission port equipment and air pollution monitoring, while at the same time allow for an expedited permitting process — opposed by environmental groups — for natural gas drilling and increasing supply of the nation’s Strategic Petroleum Reserve.

Republicans in the House Ways and Means Committee on Monday released their own proposal to repeal clean energy tax credits.

Proponents, including some Republicans, say credits boost demand for technologies, such as solar or electric vehicles, that reduce harmful emissions and help drive down their cost.

Under Trump, federal government agencies have bolstered fossil fuel investment, blocked renewable energy sources, rolled back landmark water and air regulations, cut support for electric vehicles and reconsidered scientific findings supporting climate action.

Then, as now, the Trump administration’s plan was to repeal rules whose repeal would deliver the greatest cost savings.

Amending or repealing regulations that do not provide a net benefit to the American people is a laudable goal, but informing the decisionmaking process will require careful analysis that uses transparent methodology.

During an analogous deregulatory push during the first Trump administration, researchers at Resources for the Future developed a methodology, based on transparent economic analysis, for what we can call regulatory repeal impact assessment (RRIA). This analysis of a proposed repeal would differ from a regulatory impact assessment (RIA), which happens before a regulation goes into effect and aims to evaluate whether that new regulation is likely to produce benefits greater than its costs. The purpose of RRIAs would be to inform EPA’s decisions about which rules are not delivering net benefits to the American people and therefore should be repealed (other things equal), and which rules are delivering net benefits and should be kept on the books (other things equal). We applied this methodology across multiple regulations, described in our full Should It Stay or Should It Go series of studies back in 2018. This type of approach is relevant as more repeals are on the table in the second Trump administration, which prompts a summary of this approach for evaluating repeals along with some key lessons learned.

If: EPA wants to repeal regulations that do not benefit the American people on net,

Then: the agency must implement a structured analysis to identify and assess the regulations that are being considered for repeal.

Methods

In our prior work, we showed a critical distinction between considering the net benefits of a regulation versus only considering its costs, as the administration wants to do. Depending on which criterion gets used in RIAs, prioritizing regulations for reconsideration can lead to completely different recommendations for which rules to repeal.

In 2018, we completed six full RRIAs on energy regulations that we thought could be considered for repeal by the first Trump administration. Then, as now, the Trump administration’s plan was to repeal rules whose repeal would deliver the greatest cost savings. As noted, cost savings alone is not a proper criterion for repealing rules, which requires looking at both cost savings and forgone benefits. The more comprehensive approach of considering both cost savings and lost benefits even follows Circular A-4 as put forward by the Office of Management and Budget in 2003—guidance on regulatory analysis which has been endorsed by the second Trump administration. In our analysis of the six energy rules, we addressed the discrepancy in methodology by assessing the cost savings across the six rules compared to their net benefits.

The figures below, reproduced from our 2018 report, show how big a difference these two metrics would make in prioritizing which rules to repeal. (Note that differing assumptions for two of the rules led us to consider eight rules in total.) Figure 1 from the report shows that every rule ranks in a different order of priority for repeal, depending on which criteria are used in an RRIA.",https://media.rff.org/images/shutterstock_2605378245.width-600.png,N,,2025-05-13 14:38:37.346370

Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries is expected to hold a news briefing at 12:45 p.m. EDT. Watch live in the video below.

The House Ways and Means Committee named its package “THE ONE, BIG, BEAUTIFUL BILL” in all capital letters, a nod to Trump himself. It seeks to extend the tax breaks approved during Trump’s first term — and boost the standard deduction, child tax credit and estate tax exemption — while adding new tax breaks on tipped wages, overtime pay, Social Security benefits and auto loans that Trump promised during his campaign for the White House.

There’s also a tripling of the state and local tax deduction, called SALT, from $10,000 up to $30,000 for couples, which certain high-tax state GOP lawmakers from New York and California already rejected as too meager. Private universities would be hit with hefty a new tax on their endowments, as much as 21 percent, as the Trump administration goes after the Ivy League and other campuses. And one unusual provision would terminate the tax-exempt status of groups the State Department says support “terrorists,” which civil society advocates warn is a way to potentially punish those at odds with the Trump administration.

Overall, the package is touching off the biggest political debate over taxes, spending and the nation’s priorities in nearly a decade. Not since 2017 has Congress wrestled with legislation as this, when Republicans approved the Trump tax cuts but also failed to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare. The cost assessments are only preliminary, and expected to soar.

“Republicans need to UNIFY,” Trump posted on social media before departing for a trip to the Middle East.

Trump said when he returns to Washington, “we will work together on any and all outstanding issues, but there shouldn’t be many — The Bill is GREAT. We have no alternative, WE MUST WIN!”

READ MORE: White House to reveal Trump’s 2026 budget, expected to reduce or eliminate many federal programs

But one key Republican, Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri, implored his party not to impair Medicaid, arguing that cutting health care to pay for tax breaks is both “morally wrong and politically suicidal.”

“If Republicans want to be a working-class party — if we want to be a majority party — we must ignore calls to cut Medicaid and start delivering on America’s promise for America’s working people,” Hawley wrote in The New York Times.

Late Monday, the House Agriculture Committee released its proposals — cutting $290 billion from federal nutrition programs, in part by shifting costs to the states and requiring able-bodied adults without dependents to fulfill work requirements until they are 64 years old, rather than 54, to qualify for food aid.

Round-the-clock work ahead

As Republicans race toward House Speaker Mike Johnson’s Memorial Day deadline to pass Trump’s big bill, they are preparing to flood the zone with round-the-clock public hearings starting Tuesday and stitch the various sections together in what will become a massive package.

The politics ahead are uncertain. The bipartisan Joint Committee on Taxation said Monday that tax breaks would reduce revenue by $4.9 trillion over the decade — and that was before Trump’s new tax breaks were included.

Texas Rep. Chip Roy, a member of the conservative House Freedom Caucus, warned the price tag could climb to $20 trillion, piling onto the deficits and debt.

WATCH: Rep. Chip Roy says GOP leaders need to ‘show us the math’ in tax cut, Medicaid talks

“I sure hope House & Senate leadership are coming up with a backup plan,” Roy posted on social media, “…. because I’m not here to rack up an additional $20 trillion in debt over 10 years.”

House Republicans have been huddling behind closed doors, working out final provisions in the 389-page tax portion of the package.

The legislation proposes to boost the standard deduction many Americans use by $2,000, to $32,000 per household, and increase the child tax credit from $2,000 to $2,500 for four years. It adds a new requirement focused on preventing undocumented immigrants from benefiting from the credit even if the children are U.S. citizens, which the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a liberal think tank, estimates would affect 4.5 million children who are U.S. citizens or lawful residents.

It would also increase the estate tax exemption, which is now $14 million, to $15 million and index future increases to inflation.

WATCH: People with disabilities explain how Medicaid cuts could impact their lives

As for the president’s promises, the legislation includes Trump’s “no taxes on tips” pledge, providing a deduction for those workers in service industry and other jobs that have traditionally relied on tips. It directs the Treasury secretary to issue guidance to avoid businesses gaming the system.

The package also provides tax relief for automobile shoppers with a temporary deduction of up to $10,000 on car loan interest, applying the benefit only for those vehicles where the final assembly occurred in the United States. The tax break would expire at the end of Trump’s term.

For seniors, there would be a bolstered $4,000 deduction on Social Security wages for those with adjusted incomes no higher than $75,000 for individuals and $150,000 for couples.

But one hard-fought provision, the deduction for state and local taxes known as SALT, appears to be a work in progress. The legislation proposes lifting the cap to $15,000 for single filers and $30,000 for couples, but with a reduction at higher incomes — about $200,000 for singles and $400,000 for couples.

“Still a hell no,” wrote Rep. Nick LaLota, R-N.Y., on social media.

Battle over Medicaid, food aid

Meanwhile, dozens of House Republicans have told Johnson and GOP leaders they will not support cuts to Medicaid, which provides some 70 million Americans with health care, nor to green energy tax breaks that businesses back home have been relying on to invest in new wind, solar and renewable projects.

All told, 11 committees in the House have been compiling their sections of the package as Republicans seek at least $1.5 trillion in savings to help cover the cost of preserving the 2017 tax breaks, which are expiring at the end of the year.

The final section from the Agriculture Committee proposed cutting the Supplemental Nutrition and Assistance Program, known as SNAP, by expanding work requirements, limiting future expansions of the program and forcing states to shoulder more of the cost.

WATCH: People with disabilities explain how Medicaid cuts could impact their lives

Along with new work requirements for older Americans, it would also require some parents of children older than 7 to work to qualify, down from 18 years old. Only areas with unemployment rates over 10 percent would be eligible for waivers.

Some Republicans have already balked at the increased costs to the states, which be required to contribute at least 5 percent of the cost of SNAP allotments beginning in 2028.

At the same time, the legislation would invest $60 billion in new money for agriculture programs, sending aid to farmers.

On Sunday, House Republicans on the Energy and Commerce Committee unveiled the cost-saving centerpiece of the package, with at least $880 billion in cuts largely to Medicaid to help cover the cost of the tax breaks.

While Republicans insist they are simply rooting out “waste, fraud and abuse” to generate savings with new work and eligibility requirements, Democrats warn that millions of Americans will lose coverage. In the 15 years since Obamacare became law, Medicaid has only expanded as most states have tapped into federal funds.

A preliminary estimate from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office said the proposals would reduce the number of people with health care by 8.6 million.

To be eligible for Medicaid, there would be new “community engagement requirements” of at least 80 hours per month of work, education or service for able-bodied adults without dependents. People would also have to verify their eligibility to be in the program twice a year, rather than just once.

There are substantial cuts proposed for green energy programs and tax breaks, rolling back climate-change strategies from the Biden-era Inflation Reduction Act.

The project is being pushed through as a ""utility"" despite not meeting the state's legal definition, bypassing public comment and zoning approvals.

Residents are protesting the project's potential strain on resources, including water consumption and energy usage, and its impact on agricultural land.

In the final days of the legislative session, language was added to a bill and passed before anyone in the public could look at it and learn more. That bill provides a massive tax incentive package to create a 267-acre data center in our county. No one asked us if we wanted such a noisy, environmentally destructive monstrosity. They knew not to ask. We would have told them no. And now, we are.

Through a series of open records requests we have obtained, we have learned that the powers that be have made the unilateral decision that a data center is a “utility,” which means they think the project can proceed without public comment or planning and zoning approval. Unfortunately, this blatant attempt at bending the law is being exercised on land that is zoned for agricultural use. The attorney on the case at a high-powered law firm is single-handedly making this assumption. She doesn’t live here. And she’s not one of us, but she’s gathering billable hours at our expense every day.

Data centers are springing up all over the country, and in almost every case, they are being shoved down the people’s throats with the same playbook they’re using here. No community wants a data center on prime agricultural land that can never return to its state once they start pouring concrete all over the county. They are associated with devastating environmental impacts, including alterations to important ecosystems as a result of the noise and light pollution and emissions they chug out. Further, they use vast amounts of water to cool their systems, because, well, they use a lot of energy. LG&E would love to sell it to them with their local monopoly. And a large data center can gobble up to 5 million gallons of water each day.

A data center is not a public utility

State law (KRS 278.010) makes absolutely no allowances for “data centers” as utilities, and as they provide nothing to the public, that makes sense. To be considered a utility, per state law, the project would have to generate energy “to or for the public.” We find that a stretch.

We, the people, have told our elected leaders we are opposed to the project. We have raised our voices at fiscal court meetings, at coffee shops and at community meetings. They think they can slide this under the rug and get it done before anyone notices.

We’ve noticed. We are unhappy with the lack of concern from the people elected by us to represent our interests. We call on them to speak up on our behalf now, before it’s too late.

Trump calls on Fed to cut rates, saying prices of 'practically everything' are down

Donald Trump has repeated his call for the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates, saying prices for gas, groceries and “practically everything else” are down, while also repeating his criticism of Fed chair Jerome Powell.

He wrote on Truth Social:

No Inflation, and Prices of Gasoline, Energy, Groceries, and practically everything else, are DOWN!!! THE FED must lower the RATE, like Europe and China have done.

What is wrong with Too Late Powell? Not fair to America, which is ready to blossom? Just let it all happen, it will be a beautiful thing!

As my colleague Lauren Aratani reported earlier, officials at the Fed feel that while the pace of inflation has slowed, they expect Trump’s tariffs to have an impact on prices, even if only temporary. Economists also expect price increases to get worse this year. Many companies have not had to increase prices yet, as many of the goods being sold now were imported before the new tariffs were implemented.

“Certainly the risks to higher inflation [and] higher unemployment have increased,” Powell said at a press conference last week, adding that tariffs could delay inflation from reaching the Fed’s target rate of 2% by at least a year. “We would, at least for the next, say, year, not be making progress toward those goals if that’s the way tariffs shake out.”

This is contrary to what Trump has been saying about tariffs and the impact they have had on prices. Trump insists that any inflation is a holdover from the Biden administration, though Trump has been in the White House for over three months.

Trump to 'say hello' to Syrian president Ahmed al-Sharaa in Riyadh on Wednesday - Axios

Donald Trump is expected to greet with Syrian president Ahmed al-Sharaa in Riyadh on Wednesday, Axios is reporting, citing two sources familiar with the plan.

Earlier in a pivotal announcement, Trump said he was lifting all sanctions on Syria to “give them a chance at greatness”, less than six months after the brutal regime of Bashar al-Assad was rapidly toppled.

Axios reports that, asked by journalists earlier if he expects to meet with al-Sharaa during his visit to Saudi Arabia, Trump replied: “Yes, I think so.” A White House official later told Axios:

The president agreed to say hello to the Syrian president while in Saudi Arabia tomorrow.

But this makes it no less significant. Per Politico:

It’s nonetheless a striking encounter with a man who’s still on the US terrorist list — and the first meeting between US and Syrian leaders since 2000. The US sanctions have weighed heavily on the Syrian economy, threatening al-Sharaa’s ability to rebuild the country since the rebel leader ousted the Assad regime five months ago.

Trump said during his speech at the US-Saudi investment forum that he had decided to lift sanctions on Syria following conversations with Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdoğan as well as with Saudi crown prince Mohammed bin Salman. “Oh, what I do for the crown prince,” Trump said in reference to MBS before making the announcement.

The “brutal and crippling” sanctions had served their purpose at the time but were no longer needed, said Trump, adding:

Now it is their time to shine. We are taking them all off. Good luck Syria. Show us something very special.

In a further sign of normalizing US-Syria relations, Trump said his secretary of state Marco Rubio will meet with the Syrian foreign minister on Thursday in Turkey.

Trump pledged to remove all sanctions against Syria, saying they had served an important function, but it was now time for the country to move forward. He said: “I will be ordering the cessation of sanctions against Syria in order to give them a chance at greatness. It’s their time to shine. We’re taking them all off. Good luck Syria, show us something very special.” His secretary of state Marco Rubio will meet with the Syrian foreign minister in Turkey on Thursday, Trump said.

Rubio will be going to Turkey on Thursday to attend the Ukraine-Russia talks, Trump said, adding: “The talks could produce some good results.”

Trump called Iran the “most destructive force” in the Middle East and threatened that if the US’s “olive branch” to reach a nuclear deal is rejected “and [Iran] continues to attack their neighbors then we’ll have no choice but to inflict massive maximum pressure”. He reiterated that Iran can’t have a nuclear weapon. “The choice is theirs to make,” Trump said, adding: “This is not an offer that will last forever.”

Trump announced that his Middle East tour will add $1tn in investment to the US. In addition to the Saudi purchase of $142bn of US military equipment announced earlier, Trump said there will also be this week multibillion dollar commercial deals with Amazon, Oracle, AMD, Uber, Johnson & Johnson and others.

Trump said he hopes Saudi Arabia will “soon” join the Abraham Accords, a series of normalization agreements between Israel and Arab countries, but said they would do it in their own time.

US tech firms secure AI deals as Trump tours Gulf states

A swath of US technology firms announced artificial intelligence deals in the Middle East as Donald Trump announced $600bn in commitments from Saudi Arabia to American companies during a tour of Gulf states.

Reuters reports that among the biggest deals was a set signed by Nvidia, which said it will sell hundreds of thousands of AI chips in Saudi Arabia, with a first tranche of 18,000 of its newest “Blackwell” chips going to Saudi Arabia’s sovereign wealth fund-owned AI startup Humain. Cisco on Tuesday said it had signed a deal with G42, the AI firm based in the UAE, to help the company develop that country’s AI sector. The deals will flow both ways.

The White House said Saudi Arabian firm DataVolt will invest $20bn in AI data centers and energy infrastructure in the US. Alphabet’s Google, DataVolt, Oracle, Salesforce, Advanced Micro Devices and Uber will invest $80bn in cutting-edge transformative technologies in both countries, the White House said, without giving further details. Cisco said it had reached an agreement with UAE’s G42 “to assess the potential” to work together on cybersecurity technologies that use US AI as well as AI data centre technologies.

Trump plans to visit the UAE on Thursday. The New York Times on Monday reported that the Trump administration is nearing a deal to allow UAE to buy large volumes of Nvidia’s AI chips.

Saudi Arabia, which is seeking to make its economy less dependent on oil revenue, aims to position itself as a hub for AI and a leading centre for AI activity outside the United States. Crown prince Mohammed bin Salman on Monday launched Humain, a company to develop and manage AI technologies in Saudi Arabia.

The two companies said they will leverage Nvidia’s platforms to establish Saudi Arabia as a global leader in AI, GPU cloud computing and digital transformation.

Superior had a 61% decrease in net loss from $32.7 million in the first quarter 2024, the company said Monday in a statement. The supplier generated $321.6 million in net sales, a 1.7% increase from the first quarter of 2024.

Superior said the loss of contracts from “larger North American OEM customers"" following the end of the quarter, after President Donald Trump announced 25% tariffs on steel and aluminum Feb. 10.

“We will not give up and we will continue to pursue recovery of these customers given the recent tariff dynamics,” Superior CEO Majdi Abulaban said on an investors call Monday.

The company also said it is withdrawing its 2025 fiscal year guidance ""due to the uncertainties related to the current macroeconomic environment as well as the lost volume from certain customers.""

Despite tariffs challenging the automotive industry, Superior sees them as an opportunity for growth, Abulaban said in the statement.

“As the broader industry trends towards supply chain localization, global tariff dynamics have exacerbated the urgency from OEMs to localize production in region and seek more cost-effective manufacturing partners in both North America and Europe,” he said. “More than ever, our competitively advantaged local for local manufacturing footprint in Mexico and Poland is creating opportunity.”

Abulaban said Superior has seen “unprecedented” requests for quotes levels in the last four months “driven by accelerating localization momentum by our OEM customers in response to tariffs.”

The contract losses resulted in a liquidity restraint, according to the statement. Superior made an agreement with its term loan lenders in which it will gain access to up to $70 million of additional loans under its existing agreement, assuming it meets milestones and implements governance changes.

Abulaban said in the statement that the measures “are designed to enable the company to mitigate the impact of the abrupt loss of volumes while supporting continued growth with existing customers and new customers across North America and Europe.”",https://s3-rd-prod.crainsdetroit.com/styles/1200x630/s3/cd20250513-Superior%20Industries-Google-Screenshot.jpg,N,,2025-05-13 14:41:08.056739

At that same forum, Paul also said ""everything has to be looked at"" when it comes to reducing costs — including Medicaid.

U.S. House Republicans put forward a plan this week that would cut spending on Medicaid, though hurdles remain before it is approved.

Increased tariffs will cause prices at stores around the nation to rise, U.S. Sen. Rand Paul warned after a roundtable with Louisville business leaders Monday. But they aren't the only threat to your wallet, he said.

Speaking to reporters at Greater Louisville Inc.'s downtown headquarters, the Kentucky Republican continued his call for President Donald Trump to pump the brakes on his proposed worldwide tariffs, while expressing support for lowering spending on Medicaid and other programs.

The senator's comments on Medicaid came a day after Republicans on the U.S. House Energy and Commerce Committee released a proposal to cut spending on the health care program that covers nearly 1.4 million Kentuckians and more than 70 million people nationally. The plan — touted by committee chair and fellow Kentuckian U.S. Rep. Brett Guthrie in an interview with the Wall Street Journal — would tighten up Medicaid eligibility and add work requirements for many able-bodied recipients, among other changes.

The proposal faces more hurdles ahead of full approval, and Guthrie said negotiations would continue, predicting it will face the most opposition from far-right Republicans seeking deeper cuts.

Democrats on the committee have said the bill would take an estimated 8.6 million people off the Medicaid rolls by 2034, according to a letter published late Sunday night.

The plan aims to save the federal government hundreds of millions of dollars over the course of the next decade, as the Trump administration works to cut costs across the board. And Paul said the proposed cuts are ""not as simple as people want to make it out.""

Medicaid, he said, is one several high-cost entitlement programs — including Medicare and Social Security — that need more scrutiny.

""Everything has to be looked at,"" he said. ""It isn't, 'Oh, you desire to kick people off Medicaid.' No, I want to get people on Medicaid jobs. I want to get them jobs with insurance. The way you do that, though, is you have to have some rules.""

Paul signaled support for work requirements, which were approved in Kentucky by the Republican-dominated state legislature during the most recent legislative session. While the Kentucky Center for Economic Policy has noted just over 50% of Kentuckians on Meidcaid are working but still qualify for the coverage because they don't make enough, the senator said many of those job providers don't want to provide insurance to their employees because the government is offering it.

""I can ensure Kentuckians that if we do not address the entitlement shortfall there will be a massive deficit,"" Paul said. ""The deficit will be financed through printing of money by the federal reserve that buys our debt, and then they will see higher prices at the store.""

Democrats have taken aim at potential cuts to Medicaid, including U.S. Rep. Morgan McGarvey of Louisville, who spoke in support of the program in the House Budget Committee meeting last week and argued cuts at the federal level would require states to increase funding, ultimately leading to ""a massive hole in Kentucky's budget.""

In a Monday social media post, Gov. Andy Beshear called the House committee's plan ""mean, cruel and wrong."" On a call with several other Democratic governors last week, he said significant cuts would be an ""attack on rural America"" that could cause local hospitals to close, affecting both employment and health outcomes across the commonwealth.

Some in the GOP have spoken up as well, including Republican U.S. Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri, who called cutting health insurance for low-income workers ""morally wrong and politically suicidal"" in a May 12 op-ed in the New York Times.

Paul spoke only briefly Monday about Medicaid but had more to say about Trump's tariffs, which have rocked the international stock market.

Like fellow Kentucky U.S. Sen. Mitch McConnell, he's been outspoken against the president's tariff decisions. Paul forced a vote in the Senate on a measure aimed at striking down the tariffs last month, but it ended in a 49-49 tie, with likely supporters McConnell and Democratic U.S. Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island absent.

International trade over the past 70 years has raised the standard of living in the U.S., he said — ""people have nostalgia for the 1950s, but I promise you, life is better than it was in the 1950s. People live longer, people are able to overcome illness better and there is more prosperity, frankly, per person.""

Trump's move Monday to suspend raised tariffs against China for 90 days is a good decision, Paul said, though the senator said he's heard ""various things"" about how far those rates would drop. He added widespread tariffs would affect nearly every industry in the state if they're in effect for lengthy periods, from the bourbon business and other exporters to the real estate and building market, which would be hit hard by rising lumber and steel prices.

""These are the decisions that should be left to the marketplace, to determine prices,"" he said. ""Adding a huge tax in the middle of the system — higher for some countries, lower for others, and then you lobby to try to get an exemption — I don't think it's a good way to run the government.""

Paul spoke downtown following a meeting with local business leaders inside the boardroom for Greater Louisville Inc., the city's chamber of commerce. Sarah Davasher-Wisdom, the board's CEO, said she's spoken to Louisville industry executives who say tariffs have created ""a lot of uncertainty for businesses, and that makes it very difficult to operate"" due to rising prices and questions over how long the rates will remain in place.

""If you get a tariff on five different parts that goes into something, then the overall cost is going to increase a lot,"" she said. ""And then the uncertainty itself creates some some challenges. 'Will my supplier have products for me to sell 90 days from now?' Those are all questions that have arisen.""

“We know what the Great Lakes fishery is like prior to European settlement from very early records from Indigenous fishers,” said Andrew Muir, science director with the Great Lakes Fishery Commission.
Testing that hypothesis is not something the Great Lakes Fishery Commission gave serious consideration because of the damage to the fishery.
There is still hope for funding for a barrier near Chicago to keep invasive carp out of the Great Lakes.
Marc Gaden at the bi-national Great Lakes Fishery Commission is optimistic that the GLRI, the carp barrier, and some programs to protect the Great Lakes fishery ultimately will be approved by Congress.","The Michigan Department of Natural Resources’ Charlevoix Fisheries Research Station is based in a building that was constructed in 1917, originally as a federal fish hatchery. It wasn’t the first on this site. An earlier hatchery was built in 1894.

The U.S. government was trying to replenish the fish population. Lake trout, whitefish, and walleye were not reproducing at rates fast enough to keep up with the demand of commercial fishing.

There were no limits on the number of commercial fishers and no limits on how much they could catch. State licenses were issued, but that was simply to make sure the states got some tax revenue from the fishing industry.

Federal fish stocking only slowed the decline. Then new technology opened up the markets for Great Lakes fish far and wide.

In 1868, a Detroit man developed a refrigerated rail car. It was cooled by an ice and salt mixture. Refrigeration changed everything for shipping food.

Refrigeration helped a little-known brewer named Adolphus Busch of Anheuser-Busch to ship beer across the nation. Refrigeration helped get beef from out West to the big cities in the East. And it gave commercial fishers in the Great Lakes new markets that had been unimaginable before.

“We know what the Great Lakes fishery is like prior to European settlement from very early records from Indigenous fishers,” said Andrew Muir, science director with the Great Lakes Fishery Commission.

“There’s a lot of records from Jesuit missionaries about the bounty of the Great Lakes, the plethora of species,” he added.

The Great Lakes supported some of the largest freshwater fisheries on the planet. For thousands of years, they sustained the native peoples of the region.

In less than a century after European settlements were built on Great Lakes shores, the fishery was in dire straits.

Today, at the Charlevoix Fisheries Research Station, the long pools of water where newborn fish were once raised are now covered up by a floor. The station is now made up of labs and offices on the second floor with equipment and work space on the first floor.

This past February, staff were analyzing the samples of fish they’d caught during the previous year.

“It’s basically counting what we call annuli, which show annual growth rings,” explained Steve Lenart, a fish biologist who manages the station.

It’s like counting tree rings. In this case, it’s counting growth rings on fish ear bones or fin bones, depending on the type of fish.

“This works well in areas like Michigan because growth slows down when the water gets cold. Growth rings squeeze together a little bit and that makes annuli every winter,” said Kris Snyder, a fisheries technician, as he put a new sample from a yellow perch under the microscope.

Snyder said the sampling last year pulled in more perch than he’d seen in a decade. Perch were plentiful in the 1980s, but then the population dropped substantially.

“There’s a nice array of age classes. I’ve got little four-inch perch all the way up to 14-inch perch,” Snyder said, adding, “We seem to be headed in the right direction.”

This kind of research on all kinds of fish is being done in labs around the Great Lakes region. The different state agencies have agreed to a Joint Strategic Plan that compiles their data for a big picture of the fisheries in the lakes. Lenart said this kind of cooperation is critical to understand what’s happening to the fisheries in the Great Lakes.

But the successes and the challenges are different for each of the lakes.

The Charlevoix research station on Lake Michigan is finding results for the fish populations somewhat similar to what the Alpena Fisheries Research Station is finding in Lake Huron. That makes some sense. The two lakes are, hydrologically speaking, one big lake. Some fish even swim back and forth between the lakes.

Lake Superior has seen its top predator fish, the lake trout, make a comeback. Last November, fisheries managers determined that lake trout population had recovered to the point it no longer needed to be stocked. The fish had dropped to extremely low levels and took decades to recover.

Lake Erie, with the least water by volume and being the most shallow of the Great Lakes, is where you’ll find the largest amount of fish.

It’s said that while Lake Superior holds 50% of the Great Lakes water; it has 2% of the fish. Lake Erie only has 2% of the water and 50% of the fish in the lakes.

“I mean, the walleye have been gangbusters,” said Chris Winslow, director for Ohio Sea Grant and Ohio State’s Stone Laboratory.

He noted that there are many variables in play: water levels, when storm events come through to stir up nutrients, what was ice cover like, how bad are the harmful cyanobacterial blooms in the western basin of Lake Erie.

“But, we can say for roughly the last almost decade, the walleye have been doing very, very, very well,” Winslow said.

That’s not the case for perch. In some parts of the lake the yellow perch population is doing well and in others the perch population is declining. Researchers are trying to determine why. Is it the decline of a smaller fish that perch eat, the emerald shiner? Is it dead zones — oxygen depleted areas — in the lake?

Then, there’s the nutrient issue. A vast area of farmland, covering a large portion of Ohio and parts of Michigan and Indiana, drains into Lake Erie, causing an increase in phosphorus. That’s primarily from applied fertilizer, including manure from large livestock farms. Phosphorus feeds the toxic cyanobacterial growth and nitrogen pollution increases the toxicity. Often called harmful algal blooms, they cover large areas of the western basin of the lake. That’s not good for fish, or wildlife, or humans.

Winslow said climate change is also a factor in the very complicated circumstances in Lake Erie.

“Whether it’s a nutrient poor system, or a nutrient moderate system, or an elevated nutrient system, it often goes hand-in-hand with temperature. We are seeing increased air temperatures in this part of the country and that matches with increased water temperatures.”

Hotter summers often mean larger cyanobacterial blooms.

Winslow said it’s important to remember the Lake Erie fishery is an important part of the economy for the states surrounding it — Ohio, Michigan, Pennsylvania, and New York — plus the province of Ontario.

“I mean, when I drive up there, the boats in the parking lot are North Dakota, South Dakota, Tennessee, West Virginia, Virginia, Kentucky. It’s not just Ohio, right? It’s not just you and me walking down our dock, getting in our boat. These are new dollars to the region. It’s absolutely critically important.”

Climate change is affecting all the lakes to one degree or another. Lake Superior is one of the fastest warming large lakes in the world. That’s affecting fish populations. For example, the eggs of whitefish are deposited in rocky coastal areas of the lake. When there’s ice cover, there’s little or no wave action. Without ice, waves crash against the rocks and the eggs crash too, damaging them and contributing to the decline of whitefish populations.

The cycle of lake levels rising and falling over the years has led to higher highs and lower lows, and it’s happening faster which also causes problems for egg survival.

As a Sault Ste. Marie Tribe of Chippewa Indians Fisheries Management Program biologist once explained, the whitefish is not only an important source of protein, but it is also important to Anishinaabe culture. It’s a thread throughout their creation history.

The Little Traverse Bay Bands of Odawa Indians is looking into low reproduction rates for the whitefish. The work is ongoing as they try different approaches to raising whitefish and restoring them to more natural habitats.

Invasive species devastating to some fish

Because of overfishing, the stocks of Great Lakes fish were already declining. But in the 1920s and ‘30s a new threat appeared. New canals connecting the lakes to other waters allowed other kinds of fish such as alewife and sea lamprey to infest the Great Lakes.

“The sea lamprey was really the death blow to the commercial fishery,” said Marc Gaden, executive secretary of the Great Lakes Fishery Commission (GLFC), a binational, treaty-based organization created in 1954. One of its primary efforts is working to suppress the sea lamprey population.

The sea lamprey is a parasitic fish that looks like an eel. It attaches to fish and sucks blood. On average, a single sea lamprey can kill up to 40 pounds (21 kg) of fish during its parasitic juvenile stage.

It was assumed that if the effort to kill sea lamprey was curtailed, the parasite’s population would quickly expand. Testing that hypothesis is not something the Great Lakes Fishery Commission gave serious consideration because of the damage to the fishery.

During the COVID pandemic, however, workers were not always able to get lodging or meals where they would travel to kill larval lamprey. The population increased. The COVID circumstances showed the sea lamprey suppression works.

The alewife infestation was managed by introducing another non-native species in the 1960s: Pacific salmon. Salmon became very popular with recreational anglers. But salmon populations are down, because the alewife population decreased because it was affected by yet another invasive species.

Zebra mussels and quagga mussels made their way to the Great Lakes by hitching a ride in the ballasts of ocean-going freighters entering the lakes. Ships would take up ballast water in eastern European waters as a way to stabilize the ship. Then some of that water and its stowaways would be pumped into the Great Lakes. Both the zebra mussel and the quagga mussel quickly spread throughout the lakes.

The mussels had no predators. While zebra mussels covered more shallow water, quaggas spread into deeper water by the hundreds of trillions if not quadrillions. Estimates are difficult to gauge.

These filter-feeders eat much of the bottom of the food chain, the phytoplankton, leaving little food for fish and other organisms in the Great Lakes. The damage is irreversible.

That lack of food has caused more damage to fish populations than most of the other challenges. It’s believed the primary reason whitefish populations have dropped so significantly is because they cannot find enough food.

More than 100 other invasive species were transported via ocean-going vessels until the U.S. and Canada required ships entering the region to take measures to flush out ballast water. It seems to be effective.

But Marc Gaden said there is an after-effect.

“We have to do something to curtail the inter-lake movements of these species and the U.S. EPA rules have essentially exempted the lakers (freighter ships that remain in the Great Lakes) from that.”

The allegation is that some invasive species might have been established in one Great Lakes port are being spread by Great Lakes freighters — that stay within the lakes — through their ballast water exchanges.

“We have great science that shows the lakers do move these things around,” Gaden said.

The organization representing the ships disagrees.

“There’s no validity to that statement at all,” responded Debbie DiCianna, Director of Environmental & Regulatory Affairs with the Lake Carriers Association.

The science that Gaden mentioned came from two sources:

1. Great Waters Research Collaborative’s study of eight Canadian and United States bulk carriers which participated in the study. It found “laker ballast water from the lower four Great Lakes that was destined to, or directly in, discharge to western Lake Superior ports contained non-indigenous species of aquatic organisms not previously recorded in Lake Superior.”

2. A Fisheries and Oceans Canada analysis found, “The movement of unmanaged ballast water by Lakers within the Great Lakes region is a high-risk pathway for spreading AIS (Alien Invasive Species).”

“The Canadians are always the ones bringing up the idea of spread and what can occur,"" DiCianna said, adding, “there were a lot of actions that were put into place by lakers, the U.S. flagged lakers, by changing how their sea chests were, how uptakes were, all of that to drastically reduce what could be the probability of things.”

DiCianna said nobody has shown her data on where spread has occurred.

She also said the suppliers of treatment systems are not willing to service Great Lakes freighters because there are so few of them compared to the thousands of oceangoing ships that are their customers.

DiCianna believes the spread of invasive species from port to port within the Great Lakes is much more likely to be caused by recreational and sport boating.

To stop the spread of invasive species, state agencies campaign to get recreational boaters to clean their boats after leaving a body of water to keep from fouling the next lake or river they boat in.

“They don’t want to do the little bit that some of the marinas ask them to do,” she said.

A very complicated and intricate web

Back at the Charlevoix Fisheries Research Station, vessel captain Patrick O’Neill is repairing nets that are used to take samples during the warm water season.

He said from his observations over the years, the lakes and the different fish populations are constantly changing.

“We have fish coming in; we have fish going out. We have environmental changes that are happening. And overall, a lot of what we’re seeing change is based on management.”

He said stocking lake trout in Lake Michigan has made a difference. They study the results and decide whether stocking is needed again in the same place or whether to stock where there’s lower abundance.

Fish biologist and station manager Steve Lenart said just stocking fish is not enough. You have to determine what is causing the bottleneck.

“For whitefish, I think we can surmise that it’s probably related to food availability,” he said.

Stocking more whitefish does not fix that problem.

That situation is not limited to whitefish.

Several years ago at a meeting between Michigan DNR personnel and anglers, things got heated. Some of the fishers were angry because the salmon population in Lake Huron had plummeted. They blamed the DNR, arguing that the agency didn’t want to spend the money to stock more salmon.

But the reason salmon populations were down was that their food in Lake Huron was diminished. Many were swimming to Lake Michigan because there was more food there. The DNR personnel explained that releasing more juvenile salmon would do no good. That’s because the small fish would just become a meal for the greater number of walleye that were benefiting from the declining salmon population in Lake Huron. The anglers were not happy with that explanation. They insisted that stocking would solve the problem.

Invasive species, a lack of food, climate change, and many other factors affect different fish species in different ways. Some benefit. Others decline. Because things are changing so fast, learning what is affecting fish populations and how management might help needs more study.

There’s been great collaboration between the Great Lakes states and the federal government. There’s also been cooperation between the U.S. and Canada to do what’s best for the fishery and lakes they share.

The fishery is a $5.5 billion a year benefit to the entire Great Lakes region because of commercial fishing and — especially on the U.S. side — recreational fishing.

But much of that research and the collaborations with Canada have not been a priority of the administration of President Donald Trump.

“The picture is grim. There’s no question that all the signals we’re getting is that we’re going to continue to see cuts that really impact the Great Lakes,” said Laura Rubin, director of the Healing Our Waters-Great Lakes Coalition.

Advocates for the Great Lakes are fond of saying fish don’t know international boundaries. Pollution such as PFAS and plastics can spread across the borders. The nutrient runoff into Lake Erie affects Ohio, Michigan, Ontario, and beyond.

“Our agencies have been told ‘Don’t work with Canada. Don’t work on joint research. Don’t work on joint treaties.’ These are the kinds of things that undermine research and undermine Great Lakes protection and restoration,” Rubin said.

She is optimistic about one project. The Great Lakes Restoration Initiative has strong bipartisan support in Congress. President Trump did approve funding during his last administration. It could mean hundreds of millions of dollars a year to pay for boots-on-the-ground work and the scientific research needed to make the right decisions for the Great Lakes fishery.

However, there’s concern that if the Environmental Protection Agency budget is cut to the degree the administration wants, its capability to administer those grants could be handicapped.

That’s a concern that Michigan U.S. Senator Gary Peters shares.

“The Trump administration seems intent on gutting environmental protections, not just in the Great Lakes, but all across the country.”

Senator Peters said even members of Congress outside of the Great Lakes states understand the importance of protecting the source of 20% of the fresh surface water on Earth.

“But, I am very concerned about what that [EPA cuts] could mean for the administration of GLRI contracts,” Peters said, presuming the GLRI money would be approved.

The Healing Our Waters – Great Lakes Coalition outlined some of the cuts in the proposed budget from the White House:

$2.46 billion cut to Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) programs that help communities fix and update their drinking water and wastewater infrastructure.

$235 million cut to EPA research and development that protects the health of communities.

$100 million cut to EPA initiatives that address pollution concerns in communities facing disproportionate environmental harm.

There is still hope for funding for a barrier near Chicago to keep invasive carp out of the Great Lakes. Last week, President Trump issued a memorandum that instructed several federal agencies to complete work on the barrier. Those four carp species have taken over long stretches of the Mississippi River system. The fear is that the invasive fish could devastate the fragile state of the fishery in the Great Lakes.

Marc Gaden at the bi-national Great Lakes Fishery Commission is optimistic that the GLRI, the carp barrier, and some programs to protect the Great Lakes fishery ultimately will be approved by Congress.

“We have political systems that are notoriously fractured right now. You get almost no agreement on anything. But the Great Lakes have been a notable exception to that.”",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/5401a6a/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3767x1978+0+881/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fa3%2F1c%2F674ff5a748c29e38915cef720397%2Ffnlsalmon-series-photos-1-denoiseai-clear-topaz-upscale-2-7x.jpg,N,,2025-05-13 14:41:35.820150

The Detroit Police Department’s Crisis Intervention team has introduced two new comfort dogs, Atlas and Dequindre, who will assist officers on mental health runs across the city.

Sponsored by Marathon Petroleum’s Detroit refinery, the dogs are part of a broader initiative by the Detroit Public Safety Foundation to enhance community engagement and officer wellness.

Marathon Petroleum employee Whitney Walton, a former Detroit Police Department officer, secured grants for the comfort dogs and mountain bikes, emphasizing the importance of community trust and emotional support during police operations.

The Detroit Police Department’s Crisis Intervention team has welcomed two new comfort dogs, Atlas and Dequindre, who are currently in training. These labradoodles will soon assist officers on mental health runs across the city. Their sponsorship comes from a grant provided by Marathon Petroleum’s Detroit refinery to the Detroit Public Safety Foundation, a nonprofit organization that funds training, equipment, community engagement, and wellness initiatives.

“We are excited to have Atlas and Dequindre as the newest additions to the Detroit Police Department,” said Chief Todd Bettison. “They will assist our officers on follow-up calls and help people, especially children, relax during potentially stressful situations.”

Whitney Walton, Senior Security Specialist at the Detroit refinery, retired from the Detroit Police Department in 2019. With her deep understanding of the department’s culture and community support, Walton emphasized their focus on building community trust and ensuring officer wellness.

“[Atlas and Dequindre] will assist our officers on follow-up calls and help people relax during potentially stressful situations.”

The Detroit refinery has partnered with the foundation for many years, providing funds for various projects and requests. After reviewing a list of needs, Walton secured grants for the comfort dogs and dozens of mountain bikes and helmets for officers to use throughout the community.

“Having officers on bikes increases community engagement, while the comfort dogs provide emotional support to both officers and the community, alleviating stress and reducing anxiety during investigations and responses to incidents,” Walton said.

Once their training is complete, Atlas and Dequindre are expected to be certified comfort dogs.",https://www.3blmedia.com/sites/default/files/styles/carousel_2x/public/images/Comfort-dogs-join-Detroit-Police-Departments-Crisis-Intervention-Team_Marathon-Petroleum_51325.jpg,N,,2025-05-13 14:41:39.603464

""We just want the Governor's help to expedite the permit,"" said the project management director for Grand Haven, Derek Gajdos.

So it would really affect the regional economy, not just Grand Haven,"" Gajdos explained.","GRAND HAVEN, Mich. — Local leaders in the Grand Haven area are losing patience over delayed harbor dredging, sending a letter to Governor Gretchen Whitmer demanding action as concerns grow about economic impacts.

While dredging in Grand Haven's outer harbor begins May 13, dredging in Grand Haven's inner harbor has been put on hold.

Ottawa County Commissioner Josh Brugger drafted a letter calling on the Governor to help speed the process along. The letter was signed by Grand Haven mayor Robert Monetza, Ferrysburg mayor Richard Carlson, as well as the supervisor and president of Spring Lake Township — Jerry Rabideau and Mark Powers.

""We just want the Governor's help to expedite the permit,"" said the project management director for Grand Haven, Derek Gajdos.

The Grand Haven harbor brings in 2 million tons of aggregate every year, supplying road construction materials, gravel, and road salt across Michigan. Gajdos said he's concerned the port's $88.8 million in annual revenue could be in jeopardy and prices could increase, ""just because the harbor's not dredged.""

""[Freighters] don't have a solution to put those [materials] elsewhere. So it would really affect the regional economy, not just Grand Haven,"" Gajdos explained.

Dredging maintains navigable channels and depths for large vessels, but the Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes and Energy (EGLE) found the inner harbor could contain cancer-causing chemicals called PFAS, halting the process to prevent additional environmental impacts.

""We still want to protect the public, just as much as EGLE and the Governor, but we need to do it in a manner where it doesn't bring the harbor's economy to a screeching halt,"" Gajdos said.

As long as the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers gets approval from EGLE, they expect to be able to dredge the full harbor until fall of next year. Meanwhile, they're sending sediment data to EGLE, hoping to identify safe areas that will allow them to begin dredging sooner.

Chief of Environmental Analysis, with the Detroit division of the U.S. Corps of Engineers, Charlie Uhlarik, says sediment data of the upper portion of the inner channel that's already been sent to EGLE was determined to be free of PFAS.

""Below that, EGLE wanted some sediment to determine if there was any PFAS, so we just took that sediment sampling on Thursday,"" Uhlarik explained.

On Thursday, EGLE issued a 30-day public comment period starting May 8 that, when concluded, would allow dredging in certain portions of the harbor. The agency said in a letter, ""Assuming no major issues arise during the public comment period, EGLE expects to issue the certification in June.""

The teen, whose name has not been released, was charged Monday afternoon. Felonious assault is a felony punishable by up to four years in prison, a $2,000 fine or both. It was unclear Monday if the girl is being charged as an adult or juvenile.

The stabbing happened around 6:11 p.m. Saturday in the 1000 block of Woodward Avenue in downtown Detroit.

A verbal altercation between the teens escalated, and the 16-year-old girl used a pocketknife to stab the boy, a Detroit resident, multiple times in the stomach, according to a new release from the Wayne County Prosecutor's Office. An investigation by the Detroit Police Department led to the arrest of the girl a short time later.

Detroit Police Assistant Chief Charles Fitzgerald said there were thousands of people downtown enjoying the pleasant weather when the attack happened. He urged parents to refrain from dropping off their children unattended if they are likely to cause problems.

""If folks think they can come downtown and do silly things you will be apprehended quickly,"" Fitzgerald said. ""There are cameras everywhere ... ""When you have these kids and they're walking around and doing dumb things they're going to draw the attention of the police.""

He said DPD endeavors to have a sizeable, visible police presence downtown during warm-weather months.

""We also have officers you don't see. We have a lot undercover officers working the entire downtown footprint,"" Fitzgerald said. ""It is extremely important for us to make it a nice, safe environment, a fun environment for anyone who wants to come down, go to the restaurants, go to the bars, go to the game ... but you'll have to come down and behave yourself.""

A preliminary hearing was held Monday afternoon at the Juvenile Detention Facility in the Wayne County Criminal Justice Center. Further hearings will be held in Macomb County, according to the Wayne County Prosecutor's Office.

On Sunday, the victim was reported to be in temporary serious condition, the Detroit Police Department said in a statement. His condition wasn't available Monday.

The stabbing was the second violent incident involving teens at Campus Martius in recent years. In 2022, during the Christmas Tree lighting ceremony, two teens were shot in the area.

Leaders from labor unions, the forest products industry, farm organizations and small businesses groups are all hoping to testify at the hearing in support of Line 5.

“The DNR’s permit process was rigorous and included more than 200 environmental safeguards for Enbridge to follow—far exceeding typical regulatory standards. Claims that the project poses environmental risk are not only unfounded, but they are also a deliberate attempt to block energy infrastructure and, by extension, the industries and communities that rely on responsible land use,” said Henry Schienebeck, Executive Director of the Great Lakes Timber Professionals Association.

The hearing is being held in response to a letter sent by the Bad River Band to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and U.S. Army Corps of Engineers claiming construction of the Line 5 relocation project would impact water quality on the Reservation which is over 1 to 12 miles downstream of the project’s actual location. This follows a more than four-year review of the project, and permits issued by the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources that affirm the project can be completed safely and following all environmental laws and regulations. The Wisconsin DNR’s permitting process included multiple public hearings, multiple public comment periods, and resulted in an 898-page environmental impact state.

The Band’s objection letter contends that the construction best practices Enbridge and its contractors will follow are harmful to far downstream water quality. Applying that logic to other projects would virtually shut down development and forestry in the region.

“Sadly, opponents of the project are now not only using the legal process to try and reverse the DNR permits, but they are also trying to get the federal government to stop the project by using absurd arguments that could impact any construction project throughout our region,” stated Neil Sickich, who is a Business Agent with the Steamfitters 601 and a resident of Bayfield County. “I have personally worked on Enbridge projects as well as countless other pipeline projects in and outside of Wisconsin. I have firsthand experience in the practices Enbridge uses to safeguard the environment during construction, and as a resident of the area, I have a vested interest in protecting our environment. I have complete confidence the Line 5 relocation project will be done safely and with minimal impact on the environment.”

“I appreciate and respect the desire of the Bad River Band to remove Line 5 from their reservation. However, it appears you are being asked to substantially alter basic construction practices – which follow environmental guidance from agencies like the EPA and Wisconsin DNR – in a way that would make it nearly impossible for development of any kind to move forward across much of Northern Wisconsin,” Terry McGowan, President and Business Manager of the International Union of Operating Engineers Local 139, plans to tell the Army Corps in his testimony.

Line 5 is unique because it not only moves crude oil that is refined into transportation fuels, but it also transports natural gas liquids that are made into propane. In fact, a public comment submitted to the DNR by major propane supplier Plains Midstream sent a critical warning that a rejection of the Line 5 relocation project would likely send Wisconsin into a propane state of emergency, leading to supply shortages and massive price increases.

In 2014, they overlaid the 364 area code on top of the 270 area code in western Kentucky.

Five public meetings across the region will give residents the chance to weigh in on what happens before a new plan is selected. The Kentucky Public Service Commission (PSC) is holding five public input meetings over the course of June to allow residents the chance to share their thoughts.

The North American Numbering Plan Administrator, the national group that monitors the phone number supply, said the area code will run out of numbers by the end of 2027, and the state needs to come up with a plan before then.

PSC Chair Angie Hatton said in a statement the process of creating the state’s sixth area code will be an open one.

“We want to hear from the telecommunications industry, from businesses that might be affected by the change, and from area code 502 residents,” she said. “We seek public input so that we will have a full understanding of the issues before we make a decision that may have a significant impact on the economy and on people’s daily lives.”

According to the PSC, the group submitted five possible “relief” plans in October 2024; however, they suggested a new overlay area code, which would replace the area code in all new numbers created, leaving old ones in place.

The PSC already recently added a new area code in Kentucky. In 2014, they overlaid the 364 area code on top of the 270 area code in western Kentucky.

There are other ways to solve the phone number shortage. A geographic split would break up the 502 area: one part would keep the 502 code and the other piece would get a new one. The PSC said that was the usual method in Kentucky until 2014.

More than 540 EPA staffers took those deferred resignations, which were open until early February.
“They’re showing that they don’t feel the environmental justice program staff are loyal to this administration.
Bush, a Republican, first created the Environmental Justice Program in 1992.
“Environmental justice communities are young children.","In a statement last month on its first 100 days under President Donald Trump, the Environmental Protection Agency celebrated 100 achievements.

EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin said the agency had taken “significant actions” to protect public health and the environment while working “to Power the Great American Comeback.” The agency said it was also working to fulfill Trump’s promises to revitalize the auto industry, “restore the rule of law,” and give decision-making power back to the states.

The EPA, the bosses were claiming, was succeeding in its mission of protecting human health and the environment.

In practice, the agency has done the opposite, several EPA staffers told The Intercept.

Environmental advocates and experts have criticized the administration for an “all-out assault” on the environment. Now, EPA staffers are speaking out in the wake of staff cuts and the gutting of a spate of programs to remove lead from drinking water, support rural wastewater treatment, and address racial disparities in environmental pollution.

“The mission of the EPA has been shifted,” said Amelia Hertzberg, an environmental protection specialist at the EPA.

“Americans are going to be less healthy. And frankly the EPA is going to be less efficient,” Hertzberg said. “If you’re less efficient, you’re wasting money. It’s working at cross-purposes with their stated goals.”

An EPA spokesperson disputed staffers’ characterization of its efforts to cut staff and weaken programs.

“At EPA, we are doing our part to Power the Great American Comeback, and we are proud of our work to advance the agency’s core mission of protecting human health and the environment every day since January 20,” EPA spokesperson Molly Vaseliou said in a statement to The Intercept.

“Not Our Mission”

Under Zeldin’s leadership, the EPA announced a set of newcore priorities that includes making the U.S. the artificial intelligence capital of the world and revitalizing the auto industry.

Staffers are concerned that instead of making communities healthier, under Trump the agency is now focused on serving industry, said Ellie Hagen, an environmental scientist at the EPA’s Environmental Justice, Community Health, and Environmental Review division.

It’s not clear how the EPA is supposed to serve those goals, said Hagen said, whose job is being terminated in July and was speaking on behalf of her local union, American Federation of Government Employees Local 704.

“A lot of us are really confused about what our new mission is, when they’re coming out with these pillars of serving the auto industry and bringing back auto industry jobs,” Hagen said. “I don’t know how we fit into that.”

The EPA’s role is not to create jobs; it’s to regulate and protect people from pollution, she said.

“Our mission is not to promote AI or energy dominance,” she said. “That’s not our mission.”

Deep Cuts

The EPA has said it is aiming to cut the agency’s budget by 65 percent and bring staffing levels to Reagan-era levels. As part of Trump’s efforts to gut the federal workforce under the auspices of government efficiency, the Office of Personnel Management sent the first round of deferred resignation offers to federal employees in January. More than 540 EPA staffers took those deferred resignations, which were open until early February.

Nine more employees were subject to a reduction in force as of May 7, according to a statement to The Intercept from the EPA press office; 280 employees in diversity, equity, and inclusion and environmental justice programs were notified last month that they were part of staffing cuts.

As of last week, more than 1,500 staffers applied for deferred resignation and a “voluntary early retirement” program.

The day the resignation offers were sent out, EPA staff also received notice of agency reforms including return to office and “enhanced standards of conduct,” including “loyalty.” The EPAreopened its deferred resignation program last month.

Last week, the agency said it is planning to dissolve the Office of Research and Development, which does life-saving research on toxicity and developing sampling protocols, and helped in emergencies after the East Palestine train derailment in Ohio and the Covid-19 pandemic.

As a result, more than 1,500 scientists will have to compete for 300 jobs, Hagen said.

“It’s essentially like lobotomizing our agency. If we don’t have the brain — the research behind protecting the environment — we can’t do that effectively, and I think that’s exactly what they want,” she said. “They’re doing all this under the guise of efficiency, but what they really are doing is dismantling this agency from doing its job.”

The EPA announced in March that it was ending its Environmental Justice Program and the agency’s “DEI Arms.” A few weeks later, the day before Earth Day, Hagen received notice that her tenured position was being terminated and that she would be removed no later than July 31.

“They did it on the eve of Earth Day to send a message,” she said. “They’re showing that they don’t feel the environmental justice program staff are loyal to this administration. They think what we stand for is different than what this administration stands for. So they’re making an example out of us.”

The agency said the term “environmental justice” had been used to advance left-wing politics.

“As Administrator Zeldin has repeatedly stressed, ‘environmental justice’ has been used primarily as an excuse to fund left-wing activist groups instead of actually spending those dollars on directly remediating the specific environmental issues that need to be addressed,” the EPA press office said.

The staffing cuts and resignation offers have had their intended effect, Hagen said: to scare career federal employees and push them out of the agency.

“They’re creating such an intense culture of fear that I think they’re pushing a lot of people in that direction,” she said.

Fewer people took deferred resignations in the first round because there was confusion around what direction the EPA was headed in. But Hagen expects many more to take the next round after leaders made clear they were completely shifting the agency’s agenda.

“Based on the mood in the office and hearing from my colleagues, I never thought would leave the EPA,” she said, “I think a lot of people are going to take it just because of how scared and traumatized we all have been over the past 100 days.”

Another EPA staffer who spoke on the condition of anonymity to protect their livelihood said they feared for their future after being placed on administrative leave in February for their work in the Environmental Justice Program.

“I’m a military spouse who worked to better protect all including those most vulnerable and least protected from harmful exposures to chemicals and pollution,” they said.

“Our family is having to relocate from our home and community we love. We’ve both served our country and now are afraid for both our livelihoods,” they said. “This is our story and what we’ve been living through. So many of our friends are in similar situations here and across the country.”

“Non-Political”?

Much of the administration’s attack on the EPA is tied up in the politicization of principles that historically had bipartisan support — like environmental justice, which staffers pointed out was until recently not viewed as a political project.

“Environmental justice is supposed to be non-political,” Hertzberg said. “It’s just about identifying the people most in danger of pollution so you can help them first.”

President George H.W. Bush, a Republican, first created the Environmental Justice Program in 1992.

“This is a program that has been standing for decades, has done life-saving work across both sides of the aisle, efficiently and effectively,” Hagen said.

The agency is now cutting other programs that have bipartisan support, she added.

“How can you say this program has bipartisan support or support from the administration when you’re intimidating people into taking this buyout?” she said. “I think a lot of EPA staff will be taking the second round of buyouts, and we have no idea how that’s going to gut these statutory — what they say is bipartisan — support programs.”

In their attacks on “DEI” and “wokeness” — for example, efforts to ensure civil liberties and equal protection under the law for communities that have historically faced institutional discrimination — Trump and his allies have distorted the concept of environmental justice into a political weapon, Hertzberg said.

“Environmental justice communities are young children. They’re pregnant women, the elderly, those with medical conditions, those without access to proper services, which is often rural communities and those living closer to polluters,” Hertzberg said. “This is really supposed to be a non-political part of the EPA, and it’s castigated as though we all have this axe to grind and are suspect in some way.”

Staffers said the government is now leaving communities they’ve built relationships with over the years vulnerable to life-threatening pollution and health hazards.

“The people who are still in the office are feeling worried about their jobs and feeling frustrated and heartbroken about the communities that we’ve served who are not being served anymore,” Hertzberg said.

EPA staff are now put in the position of betraying communities they’ve tried to build trust in, she said.

“Now you just have to let them down,” she said. “It’s the heartbreak of watching these people who you promised you were going to help be let down again, to have your hands tied behind your back, and at the same time being accused of being poor stewards of taxpayer funds.”",https://theintercept.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/GettyImages-2212190309-e1747078145277.jpg?fit=5365%2C2682&w=1200&h=800,N,,2025-05-13 14:38:50.297670

Two programs are kicking off in June with the goal of increasing composting in the community.

""This is like the core principle of our work is composting. This is where we come from and this is where we return to,"" said Jon Kent of Sanctuary Farms on Detroit's east side.

Kent is familiar with closing the food loop through composting. The farm follows a six-month process to turn food waste into valuable compost.

""This is a pile in progress right now. Usually, we turn it two to three times a week for three months, and then we let it cure for another three months just by letting it sit,"" said Kent.

The result is what Kent calls ""Black Gold"" – nutrient-rich compost that helps grow new food and keeps waste out of landfills.

""We have to take care of home, and this is a part of that work in making sure that we continue to have one,"" said Kent.

Sanctuary Farms is part of the Detroit Community Compost Collection Project (DCCP), a coalition of seven Detroit-based food waste and environmental justice organizations. The group is launching a pilot program this summer focused on increasing equitable access to composting.

""We're going to be looking at 200 residents. 100 backyard composters and then another hundred community composters,"" said Kent.

The program will provide materials and financial incentives for participants with support from an Industrious Labs grant.

""There's going to be stipends for folks to participate, and also we'll be giving them the materials to compost,"" said Kent.

DCCPplans to collect data from the pilot to advocate for broader change in the city.

""We look at it as a microcosm. So that if we can at least activate these 200, how can we also activate the 700,000 citizens that are here to compost,"" said Kent.

Simultaneously, the City of Detroit's Office of Sustainability is launching its own community composting program this summer, which will include a free central drop-off location and training for participants.

""Our goal is to get between 100 and 200 people in the first pilot just to see how much food waste we can actually collect,"" said Tepfirah Rushdan, Director of Sustainability for the City of Detroit.

The central drop-off site will use a digester to reduce waste volume by 50-75% on-site. Residents will need to sign up for the program and go through education.

The program received $100,000 in funding from Carhartt. The city will measure success by tracking pounds of food waste diverted from landfills and share the data with the city's solid waste division.

The city's program aligns with the Office of Sustainability's long-term vision to create a citywide composting system with multiple drop-off locations and curbside pickup.

""I think it's gonna take us doing this pilot, and showing people the benefits of it, so that all of our city leadership can get on board with understanding this is something that residents want to do, this is something that is good for the planet and can be done in a healthy and good way for our city,"" said Rushdan.

The program is part of Michigan's broader goal to divert 50% of food waste by 2030.

Long-time Detroit resident Jacqueline Gilmore, who spent her day helping a friend care for hosta plants, says she supports the initiative.

""I just care about the earth and beauty and taking care of your community and it starts from your own property and you go from there,"" said Gilmore.

Gilmore plans to apply for the program this summer.

""I think it's awesome anything they can do,"" said Gilmore.

Brett Guthrie (R-Kentucky) said in the hearing announcement. “We are committed to delivering President Trump’s agenda and eliminating waste, fraud, and abuse, so the most vulnerable Americans can reliably access the care they need.”

Scoring political points

Democratic lawmakers held a press conference on May 12 to discuss looming cuts to Medicaid. The same day, Guthrie issued a statement claiming the Dems have mounted a “fear campaign” with incorrect claims about policies not even in that bill.

“From the moment a budget reconciliation bill was on the table, Democrats began their fear campaign to scare Americans without any of the details,” his statement said,

“This bill refocuses Medicaid on mothers, children, people with disabilities, and the elderly — not illegal immigrants and capable adults who choose not to work,” Guthrie said. “It is reckless that my colleagues on the other side of the aisle claimed an artificially high number in alleged coverage loss just so they can fear monger and score political points.

“This reconciliation is a win for Americans in every part of the country, and it’s a shame Democrats are intentionally reflexively opposing commonsense policies to strengthen the program,” he said.

‘Health care is not a luxury’

Even so, health organizations have been sounding the alarm about drastic changes in store if the nation’s next budget won’t cover health care via Medicaid. As of December 2024, more than 78.5 million people were enrolled in Medicaid and the Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP). The Congressional Budget Office has estimated the spending plan could increase by 13.7 million the number of people without health insurance by 2034, according to an analysis published by Rep. Frank Pallone, (D-New Jersey), the ranking member of the House Energy & Commerce Committee.

The congressional action is a sweeping attempt to dismantle the Affordable Care Act, said Mona Shah, JD, MPH, senior director of policy and strategy at Community Catalyst, a nonprofit health care access advocacy organization based in Boston, Massachusetts.

“Politicians are rushing to terminate coverage for millions of people to pay for tax breaks that only benefit the wealthy and big corporations,” Shah said in a statement. “The end goal is clear: Slash the programs that keep our communities healthy while doing nothing to rein in the corporate profiteering driving up costs. The result? Closed hospitals, more medical debt, and worse health outcomes — especially in communities already facing deep inequities. These consequences will hit red and blue districts alike.

“We won’t let them divide us,” Shah said. “Across the country, people are uniting to defend care, reject corporate greed, and demand a health system that puts people over profit. Now is the time to strengthen Medicaid and the Affordable Care Act — not tear them down. Health care is not a luxury — it’s a right.”

‘People will lose access’

The budget reconciliation will have measurable consequences for access to obstetric and gynecologic care across the country, said Stella Dantas, MD, FACOG, president of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG). OB/GYN physicians are concerned the cuts will threaten the 12 months of postpartum coverage that physicians have advocated for pregnant patients, she said in her official statement.

“Because roughly 40% of births in the United States are covered by Medicaid, it’s natural to associate Medicaid cuts with harm to pregnant people,” Dantas said. “But as physicians who provide care to our patients throughout their lifetimes, we know what will happen if these Medicaid cuts are put into effect: People will lose access to the preventive care that keeps them healthy and facilitates access to treatment when conditions emerge.”

‘A devastating blow’

American Hospital Association President Rick Pollack said the budget will dismantle Medicaid and he urged Congress to reject that.

“The magnitude of the proposals contained in the Energy and Commerce reconciliation text represents a devastating blow to the health and well-being of our nation’s most vulnerable citizens and communities,” Pollack said in a statement. “There is no avoiding the real-life consequences they will create for hospitals serving our most vulnerable and hard-working families.

“These proposed cuts will not make the Medicaid program work better for the 72 million Americans who rely on it,” he said. “Instead, it will lead to millions of hardworking Americans losing access to health care and many of our nation’s hospitals struggling to maintain services and stay open for their communities.”",https://cdn.sanity.io/images/0vv8moc6/medec/59119c32388bd93640ac47342669d2d6688cc72d-1200x858.jpg?fit=crop&auto=format,N,,2025-05-13 14:48:11.930490

House Republicans are calling for billions of dollars in funding cuts for Biden-era climate and environmental programs, including clean energy tax credits, as lawmakers seek to reverse what one GOP leader called “the most reckless parts of the engorged climate spending” approved under former President Joe Biden.

Environmental groups warned the proposals would pave the way for more oil and gas industry activity on public lands and increase planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions in the United States.

The House committees on Energy and Commerce and Ways and Means are set to discuss the plans on Tuesday as part of the so-called budget reconciliation process. Several moves are aimed at clawing back billions in spending authorized by the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, a Democratic measure intended to slow climate change and boost clean energy such as wind and solar power.

House Speaker Mike Johnson has set a Memorial Day deadline to pass President Donald Trump’s big bill of tax breaks and spending cuts, and the GOP has scheduled round-the-clock hearings this week on various sections of the bill before they are stitched together in what will become a massive package.

Republican Rep. Brett Guthrie of Kentucky, chairman of the House Energy and Commerce panel, said his committee’s bill, unveiled Sunday, would return $6.5 billion in unspent funds intended for climate programs included in the 2022 law. In an op-ed in The Wall Street Journal, he said the plan “ends spending on Green New Deal-style waste” and claws back money “headed for green boondoggles’’ such as grants for environmental and climate justice.

“The legislation would reverse the most reckless parts of the engorged climate spending in the misnamed Inflation Reduction Act,” Guthrie wrote.

The cuts to climate programs are part of a larger $880 billion in savings by 2034 proposed in the draft legislation that also covers communication and health-related policy, largely targeting Medicaid.

The cuts fit with Trump’s 2026 budget proposal, which looks to slash federal spending through a sweeping reorganization of federal agencies as well as steep cuts to disease research and, especially, clean energy and policies intended to address climate change. Congress ultimately decides the spending and tax plans.

In Trump’s first few months back in the White House, the administration has broadly gone after environmental and climate initiatives, many of which were put into place under the Biden administration, pledging to dismantle what Trump calls the Democrats’ “green new scam.”

Groups decry the proposals

The GOP proposal “guts investments that are cutting energy costs” for families, “powering a domestic manufacturing boom and delivering essential health care to the communities that need it most,’’ said Lena Moffitt, executive director of the environmental group Evergreen Action.

The Republican move to loosen pollution standards “would mean more smog in our streets,” while cuts to environmental justice block grants “would force low-income communities to pay more for dirtier energy,” she added. “Republicans are sacrificing clean energy on the altar of Big Oil to bankroll another round of tax cuts for the ultra-wealthy.”

Alexandra Adams, chief policy advocacy officer at the Natural Resources Defense Council, said the Energy and Commerce bill “gives polluters free rein to foul the air and water.” Cleaning up U.S. ports and reducing dangerous methane spewing from oil and gas wells have traditionally received bipartisan support, she said.

Albert Gore, executive director of the Zero Emission Transportation Association, said the moves would impact federal investments in domestic battery and mineral supply chain jobs.

“At a moment when our industry needs certainty more than ever, this legislation could slam the brakes on America’s progress towards global competitiveness in manufacturing, while ceding leadership to other countries,” he said.

The National Ocean Industries Association, which represents the offshore oil and wind industries, warned against what it called “premature repeal or phase-out of current tax credits.”

“Sudden changes to the tax code could inject significant uncertainty, jeopardizing capital allocation, project planning and job creation” in offshore energy and the broader economy, said Erik Milito, the group’s president.

Climate programs targeted

The draft text from the Energy and Commerce committee would reclaim unused billions from several Inflation Reduction Act programs, repeal sections of the Clean Air Act, and emphasize support for oil and gas drilling.

The plan also pulls back money for the Energy Department’s multi-billion-dollar loan program for clean energy, the Environmental Protection Agency’s Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund — commonly known as the “green bank” — and certain multistate and offshore wind development.

It would rescind funding for clean vehicles, loosen vehicle emissions standards, and cut money for zero-emission port equipment and air pollution monitoring, while at the same time allowing for an expedited permitting process, opposed by environmental groups, for natural gas drilling and increasing the supply of the nation’s Strategic Petroleum Reserve.

Republicans in the House Ways and Means Committee on Monday released their own proposal to repeal clean energy tax credits.

Proponents, including some Republicans, say credits boost demand for technologies, such as solar or electric vehicles, that reduce harmful emissions and help drive down their cost.",https://www.renewableenergyworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/ChatGPT-Image-May-13-2025-09_41_21-AM.jpg,N,,2025-05-13 14:46:04.182623

Yet, Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) President and CEO Abigail Ross Hopper fears that this legislation will ‘effectively dismantle the most successful industrial onshoring effort’ in the country’s history.","The Republican Party-led US House has introduced a draft reconciliation bill that proposes to accelerate the elimination of clean energy tax credits provided under the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) cleared by US President Donald Trump’s predecessor, Joe Biden.

The US House Committee on Ways and Means has proposed its The One, Big, Beautiful Bill that it says supports pro-worker tax provisions and will help rebuild the economy.

It will impact incentives for solar, wind and electric vehicles (EV) investments; however, the change is not drastic as feared since it proposes to bring forward the elimination of clean energy tax credits for wind, solar and electric vehicles (EV) by one year.

Under current laws, the clean energy tax credits for inverters, solar and wind energy components, and battery components are to be phased out completely by December 31, 2032 (see Inflation Reduction Act 2022 Now A Law).

The draft proposes to accelerate the termination of advanced manufacturing production credit under Section 45X by December 31, 2031, while transferability is repealed for components sold after December 31, 2027. It proposes the complete elimination of wind energy components sold after December 31, 2027.

Additionally, the draft proposes to phase out clean electricity production credit with a 20% credit reduction for facilities placed in service during calendar year 2029, a 40% reduction for those coming online in 2030, a 60% for facilities put in service in 2031, and zero credit available after December 31, 2031.

For the residential solar and storage segment, the value of credit is 30% of the expenditures through December 31, 2032, phased down to 26% in 2033 and 22% in 2034. The draft tax legislation accelerates the expiration of these credits to December 31, 2025.

Analysts at ROTH say the draft shows ‘better than expected outcome for the phase downs’ and that it is an overall positive for several utility-scale as well as residential leasing-scale solar companies. “Our checks post-draft bill release suggest that the IRA adders (domcon, energy community, and low-income) remain intact and would be subject to the same phase down as the ITC,” observes ROTH’s Managing Director, Sr. Research Analyst Philip Shen, who believes this could be a meaningful benefit for several local companies. He adds that since this is only the 1st draft of the proposed legislation, it may undergo changes in the future.

Yet, Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) President and CEO Abigail Ross Hopper fears that this legislation will ‘effectively dismantle the most successful industrial onshoring effort’ in the country’s history.

“This legislation will cause hundreds of American factories to close, eliminate tens of thousands of jobs, force electric bills to skyrocket for everyone, weaken the reliability of our electric grid, and eliminate our capacity to compete with China,” Hopper added. “This disruption would devastate local, red-state economies, with more than 75% of at-risk factories and investments concentrated in these communities.”

According to the President and CEO of the American Council on Renewable Energy (ACORE), Ray Long, the country needs to build the equivalent of adding 12 New York Cities of new power by 2030 to remain competitive with China in the global AI race. To keep up with this demand, it is necessary to maintain certainty around the existing tax policies that have so far mobilized $115 billion in new clean energy generation, he argued.

Nevertheless, in an op-ed for the Wall Street Journal, Congressman and Chairman of the House Committee on Energy and Commerce Brett Guthrie said the proposed draft bill will end spending on ‘Green New Deal-style waste.’

“The legislation would reverse the most reckless parts of the engorged climate spending in the misnamed Inflation Reduction Act, returning $6.5 billion in unspent funds,” wrote Guthrie.

He added, “This bill would claw back money headed for green boondoggles through 'environmental and climate justice block grants' and other spending mechanisms through the Environmental Protection Agency and Energy Department.”",https://media.assettype.com/taiyangnews%2F2025-05-13%2Fhrl4vv1v%2FWhite-House-ST.jpg?w=1200&ar=40%3A21&auto=format%2Ccompress&ogImage=true&mode=crop&enlarge=true&overlay=false&overlay_position=bottom&overlay_width=100,N,,2025-05-14 15:07:45.699667

With the state’s strong commitment to renewable energy, solar is helping shape a cleaner future while delivering measurable economic benefits for communities across Minnesota.

At Centauri Systems, we believe solar energy is a smart investment not only for individual homeowners and businesses but for the broader economy. Let’s explore how solar is driving real impact across the state.

Tax Revenue Benefits

Minnesota’s growing solar market generates substantial tax revenue at both the local and state levels.

Property Taxes: Large-scale solar farms contribute significantly through property taxes, helping fund public services like schools, infrastructure projects, and healthcare programs.

Offsetting Transition Costs: The revenue solar projects produce helps offset the financial costs of transitioning to clean energy, making renewable adoption a more economically sustainable move for the state.

In short, investing in solar isn’t just good for the environment — it builds a stronger fiscal foundation for Minnesota’s future.

Increased Grid Stability

Another major advantage of the solar industry in Minnesota is a more resilient and reliable energy grid.

Diversified Energy Mix: By incorporating solar into the energy portfolio, Minnesota reduces its reliance on single energy sources and strengthens grid stability.

Decentralization: Solar installations, particularly in rural areas, decrease strain on centralized infrastructure, reducing the risk of blackouts during peak periods.

A stable grid means lower costs for utilities, fewer outages for consumers, and greater energy security for the state.

Reduced Dependence on Non-Renewable Energy

Solar is pivotal in helping Minnesota transition away from fossil fuels.

Lower Carbon Footprint: Generating clean, renewable electricity helps reduce harmful emissions and mitigates the impact of climate change.

Economic Protection: Solar shields the state from the price volatility that often comes with coal, oil, and natural gas markets.

Solar adoption in Minnesota ensures energy security and environmental protection for generations to come.

Wildlife Protection and Sustainable Development

The solar industry is proving that economic development and environmental stewardship can go hand-in-hand.

Pollinator-Friendly Projects: Many solar farms integrate native plants and habitats, creating sanctuaries for bees, butterflies, and birds.

Environmental Benefits: Reducing fossil fuel reliance cuts habitat destruction and water contamination risks.

By supporting solar development that respects local ecosystems, Minnesota is setting a national example for truly sustainable energy growth.

Solar Jobs in Minnesota: Direct, Indirect, and Clean Energy Careers

One of the most tangible economic benefits of solar is the creation of new jobs.

Direct Solar Jobs

These include positions like:

Solar panel manufacturing and assembly

System design and engineering

Installation crews

Maintenance and system operations technicians

As solar projects expand across residential, commercial, and utility sectors, the demand for skilled solar workers continues to climb.

Indirect Solar Jobs

The solar boom also stimulates indirect employment across the supply chain:

Materials suppliers

Transportation and logistics firms

Professional services supporting solar businesses

Local economies flourish when businesses providing goods and services to the solar sector see increased demand.

Growth of Clean Energy Jobs

The clean energy sector — including solar, energy storage, grid modernization, and electric vehicle infrastructure — is now one of the fastest-growing industries in the state.

Minnesota’s Leadership: By fostering a highly skilled clean energy workforce, Minnesota strengthens its competitive position nationally.

Economic Resilience: Clean energy careers provide stable, forward-looking job opportunities that support long-term economic health.

According to the American Stroke Association, about one in four people who survive a stroke end up having another one.
Data from the American Stroke Association show more than 53 million Americans serve as caregivers, including those caring for stroke survivors.","A new report from the Commonwealth Fund showed between 8,000 and 12,000 Kentuckians could lose their jobs as a result of the state implementing Medicaid work requirements, which would cause more people to lose health coverage.

Leighton Ku, professor of health policy and management at George Washington University and co-author of the report, said around half of job losses would occur in health care and the other half downstream, in other industries connected to hospitals and doctor's offices. He added many rural health care providers rely heavily on patients with Medicaid to operate, noting without the funds, they will have to make tough choices.

""Health care providers, they have to compensate for that by doing things like laying off staff and by buying less from people who they purchase things from,"" Ku pointed out. ""Whether it's medical equipment or whether that's how they pay the rent for their space.""

Rep. Brett Guthrie, R-Ky., heads the committee spearheading the effort to slash $880 billion in federal funding for Medicaid over the next decade. In a recent op-ed, Guthrie argued, ""Washington can't afford to undermine the program further by subsidizing capable adults who choose not to work.""

The Commonwealth ranks sixth-highest among states in its share of its population covered by Medicaid, according to the Kentucky Center for Economic Policy. Of the 435 congressional districts across the nation, four of Kentucky's rank within the top 100 for the largest share covered by Medicaid.

Ku stressed Kentucky should brace for a billion dollars in economic losses, if health care workers are laid off.

""Relatively speaking, the state of Kentucky gets hurt more than almost any other state in the country,"" Ku added.

This week, the American Association of American Medical Colleges expressed concern the cuts would limit coverage and access to care for many of the 70 million Americans, including those of its member hospitals, who account for 29% of all Medicaid inpatient days.

A new study from Michigan State University researchers revealed lasting PFAS effects in a Michigan community's drinking water near an old paper mill landfill.

PFAS are ""forever chemicals"" which enter the body and do not break down easily, often found in products like nonstick pans and waterproof gear.

The study focused on a southwest Michigan city where PFAS contamination in drinking water was first identified in 2018. It is the first study to examine PFAS in both tap water and blood in a community exposed to the chemicals.

Courtney Carignan, assistant professor of food science and human nutrition at Michigan State University and the study's lead author, shared key findings from the study.

""The levels that we see in blood, being elevated and for some people were above what the national academies have recommended in terms of where you would start to need additional medical screening for certain PFAS related health effects,"" Carignan explained. ""It's good that this community got that intervention.""

The study found PFAS compounds lingered in the body, even three years after switching to clean water. The findings give a starting point for understanding PFAS risks and how well intervention strategies work.

Study participants who drank contaminated water were divided into two groups: those with high exposure from city water and those with lower exposure from private wells. Blood PFAS levels rose with each year of exposure for both groups. Women in the low-exposure group had lower levels than men, likely due to biological factors. Carignan noted a separate study identified key sources of PFAS contamination.

""We found that closer proximity to airports, military fire training cites, wastewater treatment plants, were more likely to have PFAS contamination in those public water systems,"" Carignan pointed out.

Research shows PFAS compounds are found in the blood of most Americans. Those with the highest levels were people exposed at work or via contaminated drinking water.

At least two people have tested positive for measles in Illinois and public health officials are working to combat misinformation surrounding vaccines in an effort to curb the spread.

Health officials said the measles virus is highly infectious and especially concerning for babies and young children, as well as people who are pregnant or have compromised immune systems. It can cause pneumonia, brain damage and even be fatal in some cases.

Dr. Kiran Joshi, interim chief operating officer at the Cook County Department of Public Health, said it is also preventable through vaccination, with two doses of measles-mumps-rubella vaccine providing nearly 100% lifelong protection.

""Ninety-seven percent of people who got measles this year happened to be unvaccinated,"" Joshi pointed out. ""Vaccination is incredibly protective.""

Joshi added over the past 50 years, the measles vaccine has saved more than 150 million lives across the world. He noted the department has launched a campaign to counter some of the misinformation that is circulating.

Public health officials are focusing campaign efforts on unvaccinated people. Joshi explained it includes having multiple conversations with hesitant patients and providing evidence-backed information. He stressed misinformation about preventive measures like taking vitamin A is concerning and not scientifically proven.

""There are a lot of myths out there, such as 'vaccines can cause autism,'"" Joshi pointed out. ""I want to state categorically that is incorrect, that there's no credible evidence to support that, yet these myths continue to perpetuate.""

Joshi added the myths have potentially contributed to more than 900 measles cases reported across the country.

""When you look at the research, when you look at the evidence, all of that has been subjected to pretty rigorous standards,"" Joshi outlined. ""We also go to the nature of science, that you have to be able to repeat studies. You have to look at the research as a whole, instead of sort of cherry-picking.""

He advised anyone with questions to speak with their primary care provider about their vaccine records and ensure they are getting any health information from reputable sources.

May is American Stroke Month and the American Heart Association wants Missourians to know the signs and take action.

Stroke is the sixth leading cause of death in the state, and across the U.S., nearly 800,000 people suffer from one each year. In 2021, heart disease and stroke took more lives in the U.S. than all types of cancer and chronic lung diseases combined.

Lana Wilhelm, a registered nurse and caregiver advocate, was named the 2025 Caregiver Hero by the American Stroke Association after helping her husband recover from a stroke. She shared tips on how people can manage their risk.

""If you're diabetic, making sure that you are well-managed and you're following your physician's orders,"" Wilhelm outlined. ""High blood pressure: Are you taking your medicine? Are you watching your diet? Are you making sure that you're checking your blood pressure on a regular basis? Exercise, good nutrition.""

The Heart Association said to remember the ""FAST"" acronym when looking for warning signs: face drooping, arm weakness, speech trouble, and ""time to call 911."" According to the American Stroke Association, about one in four people who survive a stroke end up having another one.

Wilhelm stressed entire families are affected when a loved one suffers a stroke. She urged caregivers of stroke survivors to seek out support groups and other resources to help them navigate those challenges.

""Sometimes as a caregiver, you just want to throw in the towel,"" Wilhelm acknowledged. ""You're exhausted, you're tired, you're worried, and it's just nice to be able to talk to other men and women that get it, and can kind of help you through that whole process.""

Data from the American Stroke Association show more than 53 million Americans serve as caregivers, including those caring for stroke survivors.

The measure, which passed unanimously out of the Senate last week, would authorize the Department of Natural Resources to seek a search warrant to conduct investigations on otherwise off-limits government land. The bill also removes a $150,000 annual cap on how much the state can spend on an investigation and changes the rules governing the fund so that unspent money is not moved to another fund.

Money transferred to the fund could not be used for clean-up of any contamination found in the investigation. The waste was spread by federal contractors and should be cleaned up by federal authorities, state Sen. Nick Schroer, a Defiance Republican, said during last week’s debate.

“Let’s give them the data. Let’s see where that goes,” Schroer said. “And if they’re not willing to clean the mess up, I think we’re going to have a lot of lawsuits on our hands. But I think we’re gonna be back in this building, talking about it and if they’re not going to do it, we need to step up and protect our people.”

Records reveal 75 years of government downplaying, ignoring risks of St. Louis radioactive waste

St. Louis has struggled for decades with remnant radioactive waste from the World War II-era effort to build the world’s first atomic bomb.

While the presence of radioactive contamination in suburban St. Louis was known for years, an investigation by The Independent, MuckRock and The Associated Press revealed in 2023 that the federal government and companies handling the waste were aware of the threat to the public long before informing residents.

Uranium was refined in downtown St. Louis for use in the development of the bomb. After the war, it was trucked to St. Louis County, often falling off of trucks along the way. It was dumped at the airport, susceptible to the wind and rain, and contaminated the adjacent Coldwater Creek.

As suburban neighborhoods sprung up along Coldwater Creek, generations of children and families were exposed to the radioactive waste, elevating residents’ risk of certain cancers.

The waste was sold and moved to a site in Hazelwood, also along Coldwater Creek, so that a company could extract valuable metals. Eventually, the remnant radioactive material was dumped in the West Lake Landfill where it remains today.

“This has been a long time coming,” state Rep. Raychel Proudie, a Ferguson Democrat, said of the radioactive waste investigative fund legislation passed Monday.

Coldwater Creek is being cleaned up by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers while the Environmental Protection Agency is overseeing the cleanup of the West Lake Landfill.

The EPA announced earlier this year that it expanded the area of the West Lake Landfill that requires remediation by 40 acres after discovering contamination was more widespread than the agency previously thought. The cost of the project is now nearly $400 million, up from $229 million.

State Rep. Doug Clemens, a Democrat from St. Ann, said Monday that his community is ravaged by rare cancers that he attributes to the radioactive contamination left behind by development of the atomic bomb.

“We played our part in World War II,” he said. “This weapons project left waste behind. That waste is incredibly harmful.”

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -Republicans in the U.S. House of Representatives on Monday proposed killing the electric vehicle tax credit and repealing fuel efficiency rules designed to prod automakers into building more zero-emission vehicles as part of a broad-based tax reform bill.

The proposal, which is set for a House Ways and Means Committee hearing on Tuesday, would repeal a $7,500 new-vehicle tax credit and a $4,000 used-vehicle credit on Dec. 31, although it would maintain the new-vehicle credit for an additional year for automakers that have not yet sold 200,000 EVs.

The president of the Electric Drive Transportation Association, Genevieve Cullen, criticized the proposal, saying that plans ""to abandon U.S. leadership in energy innovation by gutting federal investment in electrification are catastrophically short-sighted.""

The proposal, she said, would deliver ""an enormous market advantage"" to competitors like China and threaten U.S. manufacturing and jobs.

The U.S. Treasury in 2024 awarded more than $2 billion in point-of-sale rebates for EVs.

The proposal leaves in place a key battery production tax credit for automakers and battery makers, but a new provision would bar the credit for vehicles produced with components made by some Chinese companies or under a license agreement with Chinese firms.

The provision, which would take effect in 2027, could bar credits for cars powered by Chinese battery technology licensed by American companies such as Ford Motor or Tesla.

House Republicans also propose to kill a loan program that supports the manufacture of certain advanced technology vehicles. It would rescind any unobligated funding and rescind corporate average fuel economy standards and greenhouse gas emission rules for 2027 and beyond. That portion will be taken up by the Energy and Commerce Committee.

Among outstanding loans finalized in President Joe Biden's last weeks in office are $9.63 billion to a joint venture of Ford Motor and South Korean battery maker SK On for construction of three battery manufacturing plants in Tennessee and Kentucky; $7.54 billion to a joint venture of Chrysler-parent Stellantis and Samsung SDI for two EV lithium-ion battery plants in Indiana; and $6.57 billion to Rivian for a plant in Georgia to begin building smaller, less expensive EVs in 2028.

In fact, we have approved numerous contracts for ongoing ORD research dating back to January,” an agency spokesperson said.
“At ORD and throughout the agency, EPA is continuing research and labs to advance the mission of protecting human health and the environment,” the spokesperson continued.
An EPA spokesperson declined to say whether its reorganization efforts will be impacted by that order, saying the agency doesn’t comment on pending litigation.","(The Hill) — Political leaders at the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) have told scientists there to apply for new jobs, implying that those who do not may be fired, according to an official with a union representing the agency’s employees.

“People in ORD [the Office of Research and Development] were told to apply for these positions,” said Joyce Howell, executive vice president of the union.

Howell recalled that the comment came from political officials during a meeting with EPA staffers. Someone asked during the meeting what would happen to those who did not apply to new positions and was told, “These are your opportunities,” she said, adding that the implication was that those who did not apply to or get a new position would be fired.

Howell said that employees were told 155 jobs were opening up in the agency’s chemicals office, 300 were opening up in the administrator’s office, and 50 would open up in the air and radiation office, while an unspecified number would open up in the water office.

But reports have indicated that some 1,500 people work in ORD.

Howell warned that if the rest of these jobs are lost, the agency could be losing not only “independent science” but also the “expertise” of those staffers.

Chris Frey, who led ORD under the Biden administration, raised concerns about the future of the research office — and what it may mean for the American people.

“Without the evolution of the science, …we would see a difference that EPA will do less to protect public health and the environment,” Frey said.

“We’ve seen announcements from the administrator of EPA to roll back basically all of the major standards that were set during the Biden administration for air pollution and water quality, contaminants in land and chemicals in commerce, and all of those decisions are made based on an assessment of what is the harm to public health and the environment,” he added.

Asked about whether employees in the agency’s science arm were instructed to apply for the new job openings, an EPA spokesperson said via email that “All EPA employees were provided this opportunity via an internal hiring authority.”

“The May 2 announcement was the next phase of organizational improvements and part of a larger, comprehensive effort to restructure the entire agency,” the spokesperson said.

“The Office of Research and Development was not part of this announcement. EPA’s Talent Hub went live Friday night (May 2) with new and open positions in offices impacted by this phase of reorganization … All EPA employees are eligible to apply,” continued the email.

The Hill also obtained an internal email, first reported by E&E News, that appears to detail changes to the agency’s Center for Public Health and Environmental Assessment, which conducts studies to examine the impact of exposures to chemicals on people and ecosystems.

An email signed by the director and deputy director of the center says, “Lab research will wind down over the next few weeks as we will no longer have the capability to acquire supplies and materials.”

“We requested for an exemption for journal articles but have not heard if that is approved,” the internal email states. “ORD is shutting down their laboratory activities. We are unsure if these laboratory activities will continue post-reorganization.”

The EPA, however, described this email as “factually inaccurate.”

“No ORD funding requests to [the Office of Mission Support] have been denied. In fact, we have approved numerous contracts for ongoing ORD research dating back to January,” an agency spokesperson said.

“At ORD and throughout the agency, EPA is continuing research and labs to advance the mission of protecting human health and the environment,” the spokesperson continued.

The alleged changes are coming in the wake of a broad reorganization announced by the agency earlier this month, part of sweeping changes enacted by the Trump administration.

EPA said that it would be “shifting its scientific expertise and research efforts” to its program offices, including those that make decisions about whether to protect air and water and how to regulate chemicals.

The agency said at the time that this phase in its reorganization does not include layoffs, but that it hoped to eventually get staffing levels down to where they were in the Reagan era — meaning that around 1,000 to 3,000 of the agency’s 15,000 positions could ultimately go.

Democratic staff of the House Science, Space and Technology Committee reviewed a plan earlier this year indicating that the EPA has considered eliminating ORD entirely.

The Trump administration has indicated that it wants to cut jobs at agencies across the board — and that it intends to carry out mass firings across the federal government. On Friday, a federal judge ordered a temporary pause in the administration’s plans.

BASF disputes what it must do Industrial activities have occurred on the Wyandotte site on the Detroit River site since the late 1800s.","Mercury, PFAS and other harmful pollutants have for years emanated off the BASF Wyandotte plant's property through groundwater into the Detroit River

The company is working with U.S. EPA on a comprehensive fix to stop the problem, but construction isn't slated to start until 2027.

The city of Wyandotte's drinking water intake pipe is very near the site of the venting contamination, but testing over years has shown the water is safe, city officials said.

Toxin-laden groundwater is venting into the Detroit River — at a rate of up to 60 gallons per minute — from a longstanding chemical plant site in Wyandotte, according to state environmental regulators. And the plant's owner is in violation of a nearly 40-year-old federal court consent decree with the State of Michigan that's supposed to stop that from happening, the Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes and Energy alleges.

The plant, at 1609 Biddle Ave. in Wyandotte, is an American subsidiary of German chemical giant BASF. In a May 8 response letter to EGLE, company officials stated they ""respectfully disagree"" with the regulator, and question EGLE's interpretation of what's required of them. ""BASF has been and remains in compliance with the Consent Decree,"" BASF site director Michele Barney stated.

BASF is working with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency on a long-term fix that would include a 1.7-mile barrier between the property's edge and the river, and 300,000 gallons in on-site storage tank capacity to better stop polluted groundwater from leaving the site. But construction on that project isn't expected before 2027.

That frustrates some residents and environmental groups.

""For whatever reason, BASF ... just decided that the city of Wyandotte isn't of enough concern to stop discharging illegally while they do the long-term, elegant engineering solution,"" said Carrie La Seur, legal director for For Love of Water (FLOW), a Traverse City-based environmental nonprofit.

In an emailed statement to the Free Press, BASF spokeswoman Marika Diamond reiterated that the company believes it has been and remains in compliance with its consent decree agreements with the state of Michigan, and that it continues to work on a comprehensive perimeter barrier project with EPA to address groundwater venting into the river.""BASF regards protection of health, safety and the environment as our most important responsibility,"" she said. ""We care about our employees and local communities and operate our facilities in a safe and environmentally responsible manner.

""To that end, BASF has already taken additional steps beyond those required by the Consent Decree to enhance existing measures at the property. These additional steps included installation of additional groundwater extraction wells and a pilot treatment system which began operating in July 2023.""

Mercury venting in groundwater from portions of the BASF Wyandotte site registered as high as 3,800 nanograms per liter in regulator testing in September 2006; up to 1,200 nanograms per liter in August 2012; and up to 1,800 nanograms per liter in June 2021. EPA and EGLE limit mercury in venting groundwater to 1.3 nanograms per liter — meaning the pollution is exceeding the standard to protect public health and the environment by many hundreds of times over.

According to EPA, exposures to some forms of mercury can lead to tremors, headaches, changes in nerve responses and disturbances in sensations, and poor performance on tests of mental function. Higher exposures can cause kidney damage, respiratory failure and death.

Wyandotte drinking water deemed safe

Other contaminants of concern are per- and polyfluroalkyl substances, or PFAS, the nonstick ""forever chemicals""; and volatile organic chemicals.

The groundwater pollution is happening with the city of Wyandotte's drinking water intake pipe downstream and ""about 800 to 1,000 feet east of the southern boundary of the (BASF) facility,"" a November 2021 briefing paper prepared by EGLE supervisor Dale R. Bridgford noted. But Wyandotte Mayor Robert DeSana, at a jointly held EPA and EGLE online meeting April 30, said the city's water system ""remains safe, well-monitored and well-managed.""

""Wyandotte's water intake is not located at the surface, nor is it anywhere near the shoreline,"" he said. ""It sits 1,200 feet offshore — the length of four football fields — and is positioned 30 feet below the surface. The distance and depth play a critical role in protecting our water supply from potential contamination and significantly reduce susceptibility compared to shoreline intakes.""

DeSana noted that water sampling results ""have been consistently non-detect (for harmful pollutants) since testing began, not just recently."" The city's raw water it takes in, and its finished water post-treatment, ""have continuously met or exceeded all water quality standards,"" he said.

FLOW last year helped Wyandotte-area residents secure a joint federal and state public health assessment in the vicinity of the BASF property. Work on that study, looking to see if any potential health concerns are concentrated in that vicinity along the Detroit River, is ongoing, La Seur said.

""There have been a lot of questions about whether people who are in contact with that local water in one way or another need to be concerned about health impacts,"" she said. ""It felt validating that state and federal public health agencies, in cooperation, would say, 'Yes, we are concerned enough to put some public resources into looking at the data available and trying to tell you if you ought to be concerned.'""

BASF disputes what it must do

Industrial activities have occurred on the Wyandotte site on the Detroit River site since the late 1800s. The riverbank and associated wetlands were filled for further industrial expansion over years, using soil, building materials and waste from the production of soda ash and propylene oxide, known as distiller blow off. BASF acquired the plant and its grounds on Biddle Avenue in 1969 from Wyandotte Chemicals Corp.

""Through historic releases to the ground, and the impacts from the made land, groundwater contamination is pervasive across the site,"" Bridgford stated in the November 2021 EGLE briefing paper on BASF Wyandotte North Works.

BASF is subject to two consent decrees, agreements reached with the state in U.S. District Court, from 1980 and 1986, as well as an administrative order on consent with EPA for corrective action. In a March 10 letter to BASF, EGLE officials contended the company is violating the 1986 consent order, intended to require groundwater pumping at three locations on the company property to change the gradient flow of groundwater away from the Detroit River.

The system requires pumping at a rate of 10 to 90 gallons per minute to be effective, EGLE officials stated. Records from an EGLE site visit and the local wastewater authority, however, showed pumping of less than 10 gallons per minute ""from 2019 through the 2nd quarter of 2023, with flows ranging from 0.01 to 1.4"" gallons per minute, EGLE officials stated. EGLE called for BASF to modify its operation of the remedial system, meet the systems design flows, and halt the venting of groundwater into the river from the respective locations.

In its May 8 response, BASF contended it does not have to pump 10 to 90 gallons per minute to meet the requirements of the consent decree, only to show groundwater is moving away from the river in the specified three locations in the decree.

EGLE spokesperson Josef Greenberg said the agency's enforcement and technical staff are reviewing BASF's response.

The comprehensive fix BASF has in the works with EPA is currently on schedule, with mobilization and construction to start in 2027, EPA spokesman David Shark said.

""This is a highly technical design plan that requires EPA review and approval at each design step prior to the commencement of construction,"" he said.

La Seur, however, questioned why BASF isn't required to do more immediately as the longer-term solution is in the works. ""An expert we have worked with told us there are technologies to bring in for extraction and treatment; you can bring these facilities on-site, do the pumping and sometimes take it off-site by tanker,"" she said. ""If they were willing to spend the money, within 30 days they could immediately reverse the gradient (flow of groundwater to the river) and then at least there wouldn't be this discharge happening.""

Shark, however, said there are several challenges to a more aggressive pumping and mobile treatment system as an interim measure.

""Due to the complexity of the soil layers, existing utility infrastructure beneath the property and the extent of contamination across the property, the most effective remedy is one that mitigates groundwater discharge from the entire border of the BASF property along the Detroit River,"" he said.

""EPA believes that the best path forward is to develop the comprehensive groundwater measure and implement a remedy that will effectively mitigate sitewide groundwater discharge from entering the Detroit River.""

Meaning that until such a system is in place, the polluted groundwater discharges into the river will continue.

Who Could Preserve the Program?,"Ron Lieber, www.nytimes.com, ron-lieber",,,,,https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/13/your-money/energy-star-program-savings.html,"Appliance manufacturers do not want Energy Star, in which participation is voluntary, to go away.

Yes, any one company — or all of them together — could vow to restart Energy Star if necessary.
But would there be at least some benefit if different trade groups stepped in to maintain Energy Star?","There’s a good chance you’re part of the nearly 90 percent of American households that are aware of the Energy Star label that shows up on home appliances when you’re shopping for a new dishwasher or refrigerator. It’s a useful seal of approval, a signal of outsize efficiency and the lower utility bills that you’ll pay over time.

And now it’s in jeopardy thanks to the Trump administration’s desire to make cuts at the Environmental Protection Agency and eliminate the agency’s division that oversees the Energy Star program.

When the news emerged last week that there might soon be no more stickers on all sorts of appliances — from air-conditioning units to washing machines — one solution seemed obvious: The companies could pledge to set up their own version of the program, using independent third parties to assess their wares.

Simple, right? But none of the major appliance manufacturers that I approached would promise to do that. Many — including Frigidaire, Samsung and Sub-Zero — didn’t even respond to the multiple requests I made for comment.

Energy Star is a big deal, if you believe the E.P.A. According to a document on its website, the program has contributed to $500 billion — billion, with a “b” — in household and business energy savings since its 1992 launch.

Appliance manufacturers do not want Energy Star, in which participation is voluntary, to go away. They said as much in a March letter to the E.P.A., when they sensed that cuts might be coming.

But they don’t see the end of government support for the program to be a settled matter. A spokesman for Bosch’s home appliance group described the goings-on as “pending,” while an LG representative said any discussion of how it might promote superior efficiency to consumers in the future was premature.

Even if the E.P.A. does not reverse itself, the Department of Energy — which sets minimum efficiency standards for the home appliance industry — could step in to oversee Energy Star. The department did not respond to requests for comment on whether it would commit to doing so.

You can imagine the other conversations going on behind the scenes at each company that relies on the Energy Star label and its blessings.

Would it create consumer good will to be one of the first companies in this industry (or any competitive one) to stand up and say the cuts at the E.P.A. are absurd, given how useful Energy Star is? Sure. But would consumers, who don’t buy big appliances often, even remember who spoke up first? Probably not.

Moreover, this is an environment where silence can pay real dividends. President Trump ran on a platform of using his office to punish people he doesn’t like.

Yes, any one company — or all of them together — could vow to restart Energy Star if necessary. Being defiant about it, however, just makes you vulnerable to a tariff, an executive order or who knows what. And that goes doubly for reasonable people at the Department of Energy who might otherwise publicly and immediately announce their intention to step in to save the program.

All of that can look like cowardice, but it’s probably just prudence if you are steadfast in your commitment to preserving the program or something like it.

Steven Nadel, executive director of the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy, a nonprofit research group, raised his own objection to an industry-sponsored Energy Star replacement: It might not be credible.

“One of the reasons it is so popular is that people see the government as an unbiased source of information,” he said.

But would there be at least some benefit if different trade groups stepped in to maintain Energy Star? Almost certainly, even if they have to spend some money to do it.

There is a world in which someone in the Trump administration wakes up to the sheer lack of logic here. If a regulated industry wants its customers to save another $500 billion in the coming years by using less energy (and to pollute less as a side effect), then maintain the federal testing and rewards system that facilitates it.

One way or another, we’re about to find out whether we get to live in such a world.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/05/12/business/12money/12money-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-05-13 14:39:41.915077

Rep. Jen Kiggans, R-Va., is leading the Republican effort, calling it a step toward protecting U.S. taxpayers and national security.

The Certainty for Our Energy Future Act, introduced May 9, would eliminate certain wind and solar tax incentives while restricting access to clean energy benefits for entities tied to countries like China, Russia, Iran and North Korea.

Kiggans framed the bill as a way to stop U.S. tax dollars from subsidizing rival nations and to push American energy into a more reliant, innovation-driven future. She said saving taxpayer money and boosting homegrown industry is key to maintaining national security.

Supporters say wind and solar have reached commercial maturity and, therefore, no longer need the same level of taxpayer-funded help to stay competitive.

If passed, the bill would pull the plug on new federal tax credits for wind and solar projects starting in 2031. Companies still have until the end of 2030 to begin construction and qualify under current rules. The new restrictions would officially take effect starting in January 2026.

“With electricity demand projected to increase by up to 50% over the next 15 years, we need an all-of-the-above energy strategy,” said Frank Macchiarola, Chief Advocacy Officer for American Clean Power Association.

It would also shut the door on companies with ties to foreign adversaries— specifically to China, Russia, Iran and North Korea — from receiving any U.S. clean energy tax benefits. That includes companies based in those countries or controlled by their governments.

“Right-sizing policies in parallel with offering business and investment certainty is both critical and commonsense. As America seeks to beat China in the global AI race, legislation like this strengthens our nation’s competitive edge while ensuring American energy remains abundant and affordable,” said Citizens for Responsible Energy Solutions.

While this bill is forward-looking, Kiggans’ concerns are backed by years of federal spending data showing foreign-owned companies have already benefited from U.S. tax subsidies.

One of the most frequently cited examples is Iberdrola. This Spanish-owned wind company received over $2.2 billion in U.S. support between 2004 and 2014, according to reports. More recently, Chinese-affiliated firms like Gotion High-Tech and Trina Solar have drawn attention for seeking Inflation Reduction Act tax benefits while maintaining ties to the Chinese Communist Party, which led to the introduction of the federal “NO GOTION Act.”

""This initiative will help diversify New Orleans' role in the global energy sector while creating new opportunities for our people and businesses to lead in the transition to a more sustainable future,"" said Mayor LaToya Cantrell. According to their website, their facilities provide industrial focused workspaces ""to find the tools, space, and community to supercharge their ambition and create a more equitable, resilient, and sustainable world.""

Louisiana Economic Development advances a broader strategy to reform state tax incentives, invest in development-ready sites, and attract high-quality jobs.

David Belt, Newlab's CEO, said that this was the ""best example of a whole of government approach that I've seen.""

Newlab New Orleans is the result of a public-private partnership with LED, the City of New Orleans, Louisiana State University, Greater New Orleans, Inc., Shell, and the NSF-funded FUEL initiative, which supports the future use of energy in Louisiana. The hub will anchor at the former Naval Support Activity site — a 1.5 million square foot logistics center being redeveloped to support industrial innovation.

""We're bringing Newlab to strategic regions like Louisiana that have a competitive advantage for speeding up commercialization of critical technologies,"" Belt said. ""Louisiana's legacy in energy projects and technical workforce create the perfect foundation to build a startup ecosystem that will future-proof the state's economy.""

The New Orleans hub will initially target three sectors: low-carbon industrial power, carbon management and utilization, and maritime shipping innovation. It will feature industrial-scale demonstration spaces, enabling startups to prototype and deploy clean energy technologies across the state.

""Newlab's proven approach to developing deep technology complements our research agenda and industry partnerships,"" said Dr. Robert Twilley, LSU's Vice President for Research and Economic Development. ""Our FUEL award, the largest in NSF history, is a key reason the Newlab project moved so quickly.""

The expansion builds on earlier work Newlab did in Louisiana with U.S. Department of Energy support. Startups like Arculus Solutions and Mantel Capture have piloted technologies in carbon transport and point-source carbon capture through partnerships facilitated by Newlab.

""Where the rubber meets the road is at the state level,"" said Cameron Halliday, Mantel CEO. ""Newlab has been instrumental in getting these projects off the ground by connecting us with key stakeholders, including state and local governments and communities.""

Louisiana officials see this type of innovation as essential to transforming its economy. According to a recent economic roadmap presented by LED, professional, scientific, and technical services could yield the highest job growth — up to 26,000 new jobs — but the state faces a talent drain, with 40% of college graduates leaving Louisiana.

""This in-demand talent feels like it can't find or get opportunities in our state,"" said Ben Safran of McKinsey & Company, who is advising LED. ""But our businesses are saying, 'I can't get the talent I need.'""

To close that gap, LED leaders say innovation must be embedded across every industry. ""Innovation has to be the common thread running through all these identified sectors,"" said Bourgeois.

Widespread, blanket tariffs are new to the mainstream Republican party, which previously championed free and unfettered trade.
Paul and McConnell have joined forces with a couple other Senate Republicans to vote for resolutions aimed at stopping sweeping tariffs.
In early April, four Senate Republicans — including Kentucky’s two senators — voted to end the national emergency that created the Canadian tariffs.
“When you think about the traditional tent pole of the Republican Party in economic freedom and the idea that you would have open free trade that’s going back some decades for a republican party platform stance,” Cizmar said.","Kentucky’s Republican senators have set themselves apart as top conservative voices expressing opposition to President Donald Trump’s tariff announcements.

Sen. Rand Paul has spoken frequently on the airwaves and the Senate floor in recent months, decrying what he calls an “abuse of executive power.”

“I don’t want to live where my representatives cannot speak for me, and have a check and balance on power,” Paul said in the Senate during an April vote to push back on Canadian tariffs. “One person can make a mistake. And guess what? Tariffs are a terrible mistake.”

Paul and Sen. Mitch McConnell have joined Democrats to push back against Trump’s tariff measures. Widespread, blanket tariffs are new to the mainstream Republican party, which previously championed free and unfettered trade. Trump’s shift towards tariff policies creates some alignment between former party leaders like McConnell and the more libertarian-leaning Republicans who are occasional party outsiders on some issues.

Paul and McConnell have joined forces with a couple other Senate Republicans to vote for resolutions aimed at stopping sweeping tariffs. In early April, four Senate Republicans — including Kentucky’s two senators — voted to end the national emergency that created the Canadian tariffs. Canadian goods entering the U.S. are currently levied a 25% tariff, excluding energy products and a few other goods.

McConnell and Paul have found voting partners in Republicans like Alaskan Sen. Lisa Murkowski and Maine Sen. Susan Collins, both of whom are moderate Republicans. In a summit in Alaska last month, Murkowski said, “We are all afraid,” referring to the threat of political retribution for opposing Trump policies.

More recently, another resolution lost in a tie vote while McConnell was absent. Paul was the lone Republican co-sponsor on the resolution to end the national emergency used to impose global tariffs — although two other Republicans joined him in voting for it. In a statement to Kentucky Public Radio, a spokesperson for McConnell said he was “under the weather” and could not attend the vote, but has consistently opposed tariffs otherwise.

Paul says he opposes the misuse of emergency powers — besides taking issue with tariffs as an economic tool. McConnell has frequently spoken out against trade wars, which he says are not in Americans’ best interests.

“As I have always warned, tariffs are bad policy, and trade wars with our partners hurt working people most,” McConnell posted on social media. “With so much at stake globally, the last thing we need is to pick fights with the very friends with whom we should be working with to protect against China’s predatory and unfair trade practices. That includes what we do on trade.”

Kentucky overwhelmingly voted for Trump by a more than 30 point margin, and certainly not all of the state’s congressional delegation is opposed to his hallmark economic policy. Representative Andy Barr, a Lexington-area Republican who announced he would run for McConnell’s Senate seat next year, has expressed his unflinching support for Trump’s tariffs.

“We need the turbulence because in the long run, we’re gonna have access to markets. And we’re gonna have less disruption, and we’re gonna have more free trade,” Barr said at Churchill Downs on Oaks Day to WHAS11. “Thank goodness he’s doing it because it gives us a chance to level the playing field.”

Many of the candidates in the emerging Senate primary are already vying for Trump’s endorsement. Political watchers believe the endorsement could be the deciding factor in the Republican primary.

Political Science Professor Anne Cizmar of Eastern Kentucky University says the state — and the region — have a history of congressional members who aren’t afraid to be party outsiders.

“I do think you see this as a regional story in several different kinds of neighboring states and areas where you might have party members who are in Congress who are kind of toeing the party line,” Cizmar said.

That sort of moniker may have always been applicable to libertarian-leaning politicians like Paul and Representative Thomas Massie, but before the Trump political wave, it wouldn’t have normally applied to former party leaders like McConnell. But Cizmar says it’s not surprising to see McConnell taking up this mantle, especially on his way out of office.

“When you think about the traditional tent pole of the Republican Party in economic freedom and the idea that you would have open free trade that’s going back some decades for a republican party platform stance,” Cizmar said.

Caleb Ragland, the president of the American Soybean Association from Magnolia, Kentucky, said local farmers like himself will be the hardest hit by tariffs, especially with all the other factors already working against agriculture: rising prices, high interest rates and now trade wars.

He’s especially concerned about trade wars with China, which saw a major shift when a temporary deal saw levies from at least 145% to a base 30% on Chinese goods entering the U.S. Chinese levies will fall from 125% to 10% on American goods. China is one of the major exporters of American soybeans, and Ragland said farmers need to know politicians understand the importance of global trade for them.

“Our senators, while both, at times, have very differing political opinions, but I was very glad to see them come together on this issue and to have our backs as farmers,” Ragland said.

In farming, margins are often slim and many small farmers can’t handle the political headwinds blowing against them too, Ragland said.

“Farm economy is in a difficult place, and we don’t have a lot of room for error,” Ragland said.

Charles Aull, the vice president of policy with the Kentucky Chamber of Commerce, said tariffs and trade wars are likely to be felt first by small businesses that don’t have the bargaining power of big chains, especially those that rely on specific overseas goods.

“At the end of the day, we’re talking about families, we’re talking about workers. Those are the ones that are ultimately going to feel the most negative impacts of this,” Aull said.

Aull said he and the chamber are encouraging business owners to communicate with lawmakers about how tariffs are specifically affecting their businesses.

U.S. House leadership has thus far avoided a vote on tariffs via a rules committee resolution. Masie was one of few Republicans to vote against the measures. He wrote on social media, “I want Congress to assert its authority to vote on tariffs.”

Kentucky’s sole democratic representative Morgan McGarvey also opposes Trump’s tariff plan, which he calls “half-baked.” Republican Rep. James Comer told KET that tariffs could be used to help the U.S. combat illegal drugs, creating deals with other governments to take more direct action.",https://hoptownchronicle.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Rand-Paul.webp,N,,2025-05-13 14:48:28.946652

The platform aims to advance the development, demonstration, and scaling of technologies critical to the reindustrialization and diversification of Louisiana’s energy sector.

Newlab New Orleans is catalyzed by a public-private partnership that includes Louisiana Economic Development (LED), the City of New Orleans, Future Use of Energy in Louisiana (“FUEL”, an NSF Engine), Louisiana State University, Greater New Orleans, Inc. and Shell.

The platform will attract leading startups and accelerate technology commercialization across three initial focus areas:

Industrial Power: Advancing low-cost hydrogen production, low-carbon energy generation, and thermal electrification, while enhancing grid resiliency through modernization, energy efficiency, and integration of alternative fuels

Carbon Management & Utilization: Enhancing carbon removal, point-source carbon capture, storage, and utilization such as converting captured carbon into high-value products including chemicals, sustainable aviation fuels and other low-carbon fuels, and clean construction materials

Shipping and Maritime: Accelerating solutions in critical port infrastructure and operations, alternative maritime fuels, energy efficiency, and other emissions-reduction technologies

“The launch of Newlab New Orleans is a milestone for Louisiana’s energy and industrial economy. By transforming a dormant federal site into a living laboratory for next-generation technologies, we are not only creating jobs and attracting new companies, we are building the narrative that Louisiana can lead the world in the global low-carbon economy. I have personally witnessed the positive impact of Newlab in other communities, and am thrilled to welcome their world-class operation to Louisiana,” said Michael Hecht, President and CEO of Greater New Orleans, Inc.

Newlab New Orleans will be anchored in a purpose-built, newly constructed hub at the Naval Support Activity (NSA) site located at the intersection of the Intercoastal Industrial Canal and the Mississippi River. The NSA complex formerly operated as a 1.5 million square foot logistics center for the U.S. Navy, with the last military personnel departing the base in 2011. As part of the master plan by local developers, EMDRC Partners, and the City of New Orleans to reimagine the NSA campus, Newlab New Orleans will help to reactivate the historic site by creating a center of gravity for critical technology startups to drive measurable economic impact in the state.

The hub will feature industrial scale-up spaces, outfitted with specialized equipment and capabilities, allowing startups to fabricate, assemble, and pre-commission demonstration-scale process units for in-field deployments. In addition to the new facility, Newlab is collaborating with key government, industry, and academic partners to align a statewide network of demonstration sites and regulatory sandboxes to enable testing of startup technologies across Newlab’s focus areas.

“We're bringing Newlab to strategic regions like Louisiana that have a competitive advantage for speeding up commercialization of critical technologies. Louisiana's legacy in commercial-scale energy projects, existing industrial infrastructure, and technical workforce create the perfect foundation to build a startup ecosystem that will future-proof the state's economy,"" said David Belt, Co-founder and CEO of Newlab.

“We’re excited to welcome Newlab to Louisiana as the state expands what it means to be an energy leader. By fostering collaboration between startups, industry experts, and policymakers, Louisiana is setting a benchmark for how reindustrialization can drive sustainable economic growth, energy innovation, and technology leadership on a global scale,” said Josh Fleig, Chief Innovation Officer at Louisiana Economic Development.

“Newlab’s expansion into New Orleans and Louisiana signifies to the rest of the nation that with partners like LSU, LED, GNO, Inc., and the City of New Orleans, energy innovation is happening here faster than anywhere else. Newlab’s proven approach to developing deep technology complements our research agenda and industry partnerships. LSU’s Future Use of Energy in Louisiana (FUEL) award, the largest in National Science Foundation history, is a key reason the Newlab project moved so quickly, and we’re excited to keep that pace for energy founders in Louisiana,” said Dr. Robert Twilley, Vice President of Research and Economic Development, Louisiana State University.

“The launch of Newlab New Orleans represents a major step forward in realizing the City’s vision for a vibrant, inclusive, and innovation-driven local economy. By attracting cutting-edge startups and aligning them with our unique industrial and logistical assets, this initiative will help diversify New Orleans’ role in the global energy sector while creating new opportunities for our people and businesses to lead in the transition to a more sustainable future,” said Mayor Latoya Cantrell, City of New Orleans.

Newlab’s work in Louisiana began last year through two U.S. Department of Energy-backed programs focused on accelerating the commercialization of clean hydrogen and carbon management technologies. Through these programs, Newlab structured commercialization projects in Louisiana with nine startups and industry partners including Shell, Battelle, and Carbonvert. Among the participants being supported by Newlab, Arculus Solutions is partnering with N2 Solutions, a Louisiana-based pipeline service provider to retrofit natural gas transmission pipelines for safe and cost-effective transport of CO2 and hydrogen. Another startup, Mantel Capture, is collaborating with Newlab and regional industry partners to deploy their point-source carbon capture technology in Louisiana.

“Where the rubber meets the road is at the state level. Our work with Newlab is our anchor in Louisiana, a state that has long been a center for energy in the U.S. and, as a result, a major hub for CO2 emissions. That makes it a strategic location for carbon capture projects. Newlab has been instrumental in getting these projects off the ground by connecting us with key stakeholders, including state and local governments and communities. It’s crucial we put their needs first and address them throughout the entire technology development and deployment process, and Newlab has been a key part of making that happen,” said Cameron Halliday, Co-founder & CEO at Mantel.

This announcement follows Newlab's recent expansion into the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region through the establishment of Newlab Riyadh, a public-private platform to accelerate the commercialization of critical technologies across mining, logistics, and energy.

About 400 large-scale clean energy projects have been announced since the tax credits were passed, which would create at least 110,000 new permanent jobs across the United States.

The following is a statement from Bob Keefe, executive director of the national nonpartisan business group E2 and author of the 2024 book about federal energy policy, Clean Economy NOW.

“These changes to clean energy tax credits will mean less manufacturing, less energy, less U.S. competitiveness and energy security and more costs for consumers.

“They inject unnecessary uncertainty into a growing sector that is driving the next great economic expansion. Businesses rely on policy stability to plan years in advance. This move would undercut the momentum we’ve built and stall progress just as we’re reaching critical milestones – threatening our ability to meet growing US energy demand and our ability to compete in the energy and auto sector globally.”

The following are statements by business leaders with projects and headquarters in districts represented by Ways and Means House members:

The following is a statement from Erik Lensch, CEO of Durham, N.C.-based Leyline Capital with projects in 15+ states including Texas, Utah, Arizona, and Kansas:

“Investors have mostly moved to the sidelines while Congress is creating so much uncertainty in our industry. At Leyline Capital, the developers that we lend to need market clarity to make decisions about how and where to make long-term capital investments. Weakening clean energy tax credits would send a chilling signal to investors that back solar and battery projects and make it harder to complete projects that are well into development. It’s not just about clean energy—it’s about maintaining America’s leadership in global innovation and energy. Abrupt policy reversals undermine confidence and could lead to job losses, higher costs, and stalled development.”

The following is a statement from Russ Bates, Founder, NXTGEN Clean Energy Solutions based outside Cleveland in Ohio’s 7th Congressional District:

“The proposed changes not only threaten the clean energy sector—they raise taxes on companies committed to building a more sustainable future. At NXTGEN Clean Energy Solutions, we’ve made significant capital investments based on the current framework. If that’s upended, the ripple effect across supply chains, financing, and hiring will be swift and severe.”

The following is a statement from Bill Caesar, President, Generate Upcycle based in upstate New York in the 22ndCongressional District:

“My company and countless others made investment decisions based on the presence of these tax credits. Stripping them away now will risk undermining successful American businesses, the people we employ and the communities where we operate. We need the United States government to be a reliable partner to American business. Tax credits for critical infrastructure have a long history of broad bi-partisan support and effectiveness. Changing that now would be an unforced error.”

The following is a statement from Michelle Knox, CEO, WindSolarUSA based in Springfield, Ill. with projects throughout Illinois’ 16th Congressional District:

“I’ve seen firsthand how the clean energy tax credits fuel local job creation, economic growth and reduce costs for families in central Illinois. These credits provide market certainty that allow businesses like WindSolarUSA to keep growing and serving our communities. We need the clean energy tax credits to continue through 2032 as planned to ensure long-term stability and opportunity in our region.”

The following is a statement from Anne Evens, CEO of Chicago-based Elevate with projects in central Illinois and the 16th Congressional District:

“Hardworking families across Illinois deserve the opportunity to thrive in healthier homes and benefit from reduced energy costs. Programs like the Building Performance Resource Hub, that can leverage critical federal tax credits are key to driving energy efficiency, supporting small contractors, and strengthening local economies across the Midwest. These efforts, whether in urban or rural parts of the country, represent smart, bipartisan investment in our future, delivering tangible benefits to families and businesses alike, while ensuring that no one is left behind.”
