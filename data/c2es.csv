To craft a grounded agenda for clean energy abundance, we can start by taking stock of successes and gaps in implementing the IRA.
While we have a long way to go, early indicators show significant post-IRA progress on all three fronts: a nearly 100-gigawatt boom in clean energy installations, an historic high in clean energy union density, and outsized clean investments flowing to fossil fuel communities.
If we want clean energy abundance for all, not just the wealthy, we need to wield — not withdraw — such incentives.
But in recent years, some liberals have joined them, arguing that the law primarily slows down clean energy infrastructure and encourages NIMBYism.","A critical question demands an actionable answer. To date, many takes on various sides of the debate have focused more on high-level narrative than precise policy prescriptions. If we zoom in to look at the actual sources of delay in clean energy projects, what sorts of solutions would we come up with? What would a data-backed agenda for clean energy abundance look like?

The most glaring threat to clean energy deployment is, of course, the Republican Party’s plan to gut the Inflation Reduction Act. But “abundance” proponents posit that Democrats have imposed their own hurdles, in the form of well-intentioned policies that get in the way of government-backed building projects. According to some broad-brush recommendations, Democrats should adopt an abundance agenda focused on rolling back such policies.

But the reality for clean energy is more nuanced. At least as often, expediting clean energy projects will require more, not less, government intervention. So too will the task of ensuring those projects benefit workers and communities.

To craft a grounded agenda for clean energy abundance, we can start by taking stock of successes and gaps in implementing the IRA. The law’s core strategy was to unite climate, jobs, and justice goals. The IRA aims to use incentives to channel a wave of clean energy investments towards good union jobs and communities that have endured decades of divestment.

Klein and Thompson are wary that such “everything bagel” strategies try to do too much. Other “abundance” advocates explicitly support sidelining the IRA’s labor objectives to expedite clean energy buildout.

But here’s the thing about everything bagels: They taste good.

They taste good because they combine ingredients that go well together. The question — whether for bagels or policies — is, are we using congruent ingredients?

The data suggests that clean energy growth, union jobs, and equitable investments — like garlic, onion, and sesame seeds — can indeed pair well together. While we have a long way to go, early indicators show significant post-IRA progress on all three fronts: a nearly 100-gigawatt boom in clean energy installations, an historic high in clean energy union density, and outsized clean investments flowing to fossil fuel communities. If we can design policy to yield such a win-win-win, why would we choose otherwise?

Klein and Thompson are of course right that to realize the potential of the IRA, we must reduce the long lag time in building clean energy projects. That lag time does not stem from incentives for clean energy companies to provide quality jobs, negotiate Community Benefits Agreements, or invest in low-income communities. Such incentives did not deter clean energy companies from applying for IRA funding in droves. Programs that included all such incentives were typically oversubscribed, with companies applying for up to 10 times the amount of available funding.

If labor and equity incentives are not holding up clean energy deployment, what is? And what are the remedies?

Some of the biggest delays point not to an excess of policymaking — the concern of many “abundance” proponents — but an absence. Such gaps call for more market-shaping policies to expedite the clean energy transition.

Take, for example, the years-long queues for clean energy projects to connect to the electrical grid, which developers rank as one of the largest sources of delay. That wait stems from a piecemeal approach to transmission buildout — the result not of overregulation by progressive lawmakers, but rather the opposite: a hands-off mode of governance that has created vast inefficiencies. For years, grid operators have built transmission lines not according to a strategic plan, but in response to the requests of individual projects to connect to the grid. This reactive, haphazard approach requires a laborious battery of studies to determine the incremental transmission upgrades (and the associated costs) needed to connect each project. As a result, project developers face high cost uncertainty and a nearly five-year median wait time to finish the process, contributing to the withdrawal of about three of every four proposed projects.

The solution, according to clean energy developers, buyers, and analysts alike, is to fill the regulatory void that has enabled such a fragmentary system. Transmission experts have called for rules that require grid operators to proactively plan new transmission lines in anticipation of new clean energy generation and then charge a preestablished fee for projects to connect, yielding more strategic grid expansion, greater cost certainty for developers, fewer studies, and reduced wait times to connect to the grid. Last year, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission took a step in this direction by requiring grid operators to adopt regional transmission planning. Many energy analysts applauded the move and highlighted the need for additional policies to expedite transmission buildout.

Another source of delay that underscores policy gaps is the 137-week lag time to obtain a large power transformer, due to supply chain shortages. The United States imports four of every five large power transformers used on our electric grid. Amid the post-pandemic snarling of global supply chains, such high import dependency has created another bottleneck for building out the new transmission lines that clean energy projects demand. To stimulate domestic transformer production, the National Infrastructure Advisory Council — including representatives from major utilities — has proposed that the federal government establish new transformer manufacturing investments and create a public stockpiling system that stabilizes demand. That is, a clean energy abundance agenda also requires new industrial policies.

While such clean energy delays call for additional policymaking, “abundance” advocates are correct that other delays call for ending problematic policies. Rising local restrictions on clean energy development, for example, pose a major hurdle. However, the map of those restrictions, as tracked in an authoritative Columbia University report, does not support the notion that they stem primarily from Democrats’ penchant for overregulation. Of the 11 states with more than 10 such restrictions, six are red, three are purple, and two are blue — New York and Texas, Virginia and Kansas, Maine and Indiana, etc. To take on such restrictions, we shouldn’t let concern with progressive wish lists eclipse a focused challenge to old-fashioned, transpartisan NIMBYism.

“Abundance” proponents also focus their ire on permitting processes like those required by the National Environmental Policy Act, which the Supreme Court curtailed last week. Permitting needs mending, but with a chisel, not a Musk-esque chainsaw. The Biden administration produced a chisel last year: a NEPA reform to expedite clean energy projectsand support environmental justice. In February, the Trump administration tossed out that reform and nearly five decades of NEPA rules without offering a replacement — a chainsaw maneuver that has created more, not less, uncertainty for project developers. When the wreckage of this administration ends, we’ll need to fill the void with targeted permitting policies that streamline clean energy while protecting communities.

Finally, a clean energy abundance agenda should also welcome pro-worker, pro-equity incentives like those in the IRA “everything bagel.” Despite claims to the contrary, such policies can help to overcome additional sources of delay and facilitatebuildout.

For example, Community Benefits Agreements, which IRA programs encouraged, offer a distinct, pro-building advantage: a way to avoid the community opposition that has become a top-tier reason for delays and cancellations of wind and solar projects. CBAs give community and labor groups a tool to secure locally-defined economic, health, and environmental benefits from clean energy projects. For clean energy firms, they offer an opportunity to obtain explicit project support from community organizations. Three out of four wind and solar developers agree that increased community engagement reduces project cancellations, and more than 80% see it as at least somewhat “feasible” to offer benefits via CBAs. Indeed, developers and communities are increasingly using CBAs, from a wind farm off the coast of Rhode Island to a solar park in California’s central valley, to deliver tangible benefits and completed projects — the ingredients of abundance.

A similar win-win can come from incentives for clean energy companies to pay construction workers decent wages, which the IRA included. Most peer-reviewed studies find that the impact of such standards on infrastructure construction costs is approximately zero. By contrast, wage standards can help to address a key constraint on clean energy buildout: companies’ struggle to recruit a skilled and stable workforce in a tight labor market. More than 80% of solar firms, for example, report difficulties in finding qualified workers. Wage standards offer a proven solution, helping companies attract and retain the workforce needed for on-time project completion.

In addition to labor standards and support for CBAs, a clean energy abundance agenda also should expand on the IRA’s incentives to invest in low-income communities. Such policies spur clean energy deployment in neighborhoods the market would otherwise deem unprofitable. Indeed, since enactment of the IRA, 75% of announced clean energy investments have been in low-income counties. That buildout is a deliberate outcome of the “everything bagel” approach. If we want clean energy abundance for all, not just the wealthy, we need to wield — not withdraw — such incentives.

Crafting an agenda for clean energy abundance requires precision, not abstraction. We need to add industrial policies that offer a foundation for clean energy growth. We need to end parochial policies that deter buildout on behalf of private interests. And we need to build on labor and equity policies that enable workers and communities to reap material rewards from clean energy expansion. Differentiating between those needs will be essential for Democrats to build a clean energy plan that actually delivers abundance.

None of the awardees responded to my colleague Emily Pontecorvo’s inquiries about whether they plan to pursue legal challenges, but she did note in her analysis one critic of the Trump administration’s move who described it as “dismantling” the clean energy economy and “giving away the future of manufacturing.” Emily also observed a notable absence from the DOE’s list of canceled grants: steelmaking company Cleveland Cliffs, which she reported last month was in the process of renegotiating its award under the Industrial Demonstration Program.

2. OPEC members to up oil production for third consecutive month

This weekend, the eight members of OPEC+ announced that they would continue to increase oil production in July, the third straight month in a row. The group’s target is an additional 411,000 barrels a day, or more than three times what it had previously planned, AFP reports, though analysts expect the actual production amount will be less.

The increases have followed a period of low production by Saudi Arabia, though The New York Times notes that the Saudis and other OPEC+ members like the United Arab Emirates “had chafed because some members, including Iraq and Kazakhstan, had exceeded their ceilings. The Saudis are now sending a message that they will not restrain output if others don’t.” Though the prices for Brent crude have fallen this year by around 16%, the Times adds that the Saudis, “who have low costs, can still make money at those levels” even as shale drillers in the U.S. have slowed. OPEC produces approximately 40% of the global crude oil supply, with oil and gas operations accounting for around 15% of total energy-related emissions worldwide.

3. The average energy project costs 40% more for construction, runs 2 years longer than expected: study

The average energy infrastructure project costs 40% more than expected for construction and takes nearly two years longer to complete than initially planned, according to a new study of 662 such projects in 83 countries by the Boston University Institute for Global Sustainability, published in the journal Energy Research & Social Science. Nuclear power plants were the worst offenders, with construction costing 102.5% more on average, or $1.56 billion more than expected. Hydrogen, carbon capture and storage, and thermal power plants that rely on natural gas were also among higher-risk infrastructure projects, the study found. “I’m particularly struck by our findings on the diseconomies of scale, with projects exceeding 1,561 megawatts in capacity demonstrating significantly higher risk of cost escalation,” Hanee Ryu, one of the researchers, said. “This suggests that we may need to reconsider our approach to large-scale energy infrastructure planning, especially as we commit trillions to global decarbonization efforts.”

Solar energy and transmission projects, on the other hand, had the lowest investment risks for construction and time costs, and are often completed ahead of schedule and for less than expected, the research found. Wind, similarly, “performed favorably in the financial risk assessment.” You can read the full report here.

4. IATA warns airline decarbonization is ‘in peril’

Airline industry decarbonization goals are “in peril,” according to comments made by the International Air Transport Association’s senior vice president for sustainability, Marie Owens Thomsen, at a trade conference in India on Sunday. While several major aviation groups have set 2050 as the goal for achieving net-zero carbon emissions for air travel, Owens Thomsen specifically cited the Trump administration’s policies as “obviously a setback,” Barron’s reports.

Programs to support the development of sustainable aviation fuels are also in jeopardy. The European Union requires carriers to include 2% lower-emission biofuel in their fuel mix starting this year, but Owens Thomsen said the cheap cost of oil is still diminishing the “sense of urgency that people have.” She expected a $4.7 trillion investment in SAF would be needed to meet the 2050 emission goals. “It is entirely achievable,” she went on, calling the money involved “very comparable to the money that was involved in creating the previous new energy markets, notably, obviously, wind and solar.”

5. GM kicks Tesla out of top EV spot in Canada

Tesla is no longer the best-selling electric vehicle in Canada. Late last week, GM announced it has officially taken the crown as the “#1 EV seller” in the country, following a surge in sales of 252% in the first three months of the year, led by the Chevy Equinox EV.

Though Tesla’s dethroning is also indicative of the brand’s diminished reputation abroad — Electrek notes Tesla registered just 542 cars in Quebec, the country’s top EV market, in the first quarter of 2025 — the numbers also reflect GM’s successes, with even sales of its GMC Hummer EV Pickup up 232%. Combined Q1 EV sales in Canada were nevertheless still down significantly, to 5,750 from 15,000 EV sales in Q4, Electrek adds, a dip attributable to Quebec’s pause on federal EV incentives between February and April.

THE KICKER

NOAA

Happy second day of meteorological summer! It could be a toasty one: The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s Climate Prediction Center expects hotter-than-average temperatures across much of the Southwest and Northeast this year.

It could reshape the scale of legal challenges that projects could face in the future, giving the Trump administration — and any successive administration — greater leeway to approve energy projects.

Under NEPA, federal agencies must study the environmental impacts of their decisions before they make them. The strictest studies can run into the hundreds of pages, and they can take years to complete.

But in what was essentially an 8-0 decision, the Court ruled that federal agencies almost never need to analyze the second-order environmental effects of their decisions. In other words, an agency need only study the environmental impact of a project itself — be it a pipeline, a solar farm, or, in the case at issue, a railroad — and not its metaphorically downstream consequences. That remains the case even if a given project might indirectly make it much easier to do something with a big environmental footprint, such as drilling for oil or natural gas.

That is the clearest effect of the ruling. But Justice Brett Kavanaugh, writing for the court’s conservative majority, went much further than that summary alone suggests. In a broad and forceful ruling, he told lower courts that they should stop nitpicking the environmental studies that federal agencies must publish under NEPA to justify their own decision-making. Courts should, instead, defer to federal agencies as much as is reasonable when reviewing a NEPA study. “The goal of the law,” he writes, “is to inform agency decision-making, not to paralyze it.” (Justice Neil Gorsuch recused himself from the case because of his connection to an oil magnate who could have benefited from the ruling.)

That suggests a significant change is coming to how the court system interprets NEPA, a law that is little known to the general public but that plays a defining role in how federal agencies make decisions or approve infrastructure projects. NEPA creates a procedural requirement that federal agencies study the environmental impact of any “major decision,” but that category is so broad that it affects virtually everything the federal government does — spend money, write a new regulation, or approve a new project on federal land. The law and the yearslong lawsuits that it spawns have been blamed for delays in building solar farms and transmission lines, but also oil refineries and gas pipelines.

Kavanaugh’s ruling is “pretty striking for just how strident it is, and how assertively it tries to shut the door on further NEPA litigation,” Nicholas Bagley, a University of Michigan law professor who studies the permitting system, told me. Kavanaugh’s message to lower courts is, in essence, “We keep telling you to knock it off. You keep not listening. So knock it the fuck off,” Bagley said.

At the very least, the ruling suggests that a new phase in the effort to reform the country’s permitting laws has arrived. Now that movement has, in essence, been blessed by the Supreme Court.

The case in question — Seven County Infrastructure Coalition v. Eagle County, Colorado — concerns an 88-mile railroad proposed to connect the Uinta Basin in eastern Utah to the national freight rail network. In 2021, the Surface Transportation Board, a federal agency that regulates railroads, approved the project after completing a roughly 3,600-page study of the railroad’s potential environmental impact.

Almost immediately, environmental groups argued that the board’s study did not go far enough. The ground beneath the Uinta Basin is rich in a waxy and particularly carbon-intensive crude oil; right now, very little of that oil is extracted because the only way to get it out is by truck, along windy mountain roads. The railroad, if built, would allow for much larger volumes of crude to be transported out of the basin and sent to Gulf Coast refineries. Building the railroad, in other words, would indirectly increase local oil extraction, and thereby raise global greenhouse gas emissions.

The board argued that its NEPA study did not need to consider these downstream effects because the board itself does not regulate oil extraction — that is, it regulates the building of railroads, not what gets moved on them.

The eight justices agreed that the board was right: It didn’t have to consider the effects of second-order oil drilling when it approved the railroad. (The railroad remains on hold for other reasons, Sambhav Sankar, a senior vice president at Earthjustice, told me.) But by going further in his ruling, Kavanaugh entered into a running debate about the role of NEPA and other permitting laws in the American economy.

NEPA was never meant to play the commanding role that it does today, Kavanaugh writes. When it was first signed into law in 1970, NEPA was meant to act as a “purely procedural” check on federal decision-making. Agencies were supposed to conduct environmental studies, make their decisions, then move on. But in a famous 1971 ruling concerning a proposed nuclear power plant in Maryland, Judge Skelly Wright of the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals transformed the law. He found that agencies had to carry out NEPA’s procedural requirements “to the fullest extent possible,” and crucially that courts could reject agencies’ analysis for lack of completeness.

Over the years, as hundreds of cases following Wright’s have added up, NEPA has turned into a “fearsome project killer,” Bagley said. Agencies spend decades of person-power and hundreds of thousands of dollars to prepare fastidious environmental reviews of their decisions. Any new infrastructure project or new policy change — even New York City’s congestion charge — requires some form of NEPA study.

Many conservatives have long opposed the modern NEPA process. But in recent years, some liberals have joined them, arguing that the law primarily slows down clean energy infrastructure and encourages NIMBYism. In practice, they say, NEPA acts as more of hindrance to the clean economy than the old fossil fuel economy: Because of a 2005 law, most oil and gas drilling has been exempt from the NEPA process, while wind farms, solar plants, and other forms of zero-carbon energy infrastructure still have to face it. Environmental groups rebut that the law is a useful tool to slow down fossil fuel pipelines, which do not generally get a NEPA exemption.

Data supports the idea that NEPA holds back clean energy projects, but that is partly because it holds back so many kinds of projects. The R Street Institute, a center-right think tank, has found that 42% of projects stalled by NEPA involved green infrastructure or conservation. Another analysis from the Center for Growth and Opportunity at Utah State University found that it takes more than two years on average for federal agencies to complete environmental reviews of solar and wind projects. Reviews for new hydroelectric or nuclear power plants take even longer.

Kavanaugh, in essence, rejects all of this. NEPA was never supposed to block or hinder large-scale energy or infrastructure projects, he writes; it was meant to “inform agency decision-making, not to paralyze it.”

“A 1970 legislative acorn has grown over the years into a judicial oak that has hindered infrastructure development ‘under the guise’ of just a little more process,” he says. When federal agencies write environmental studies under NEPA, courts should broadly defer to the decisions that they make. And even if an agency gets something wrong in its study or omits something important, that does not mean the entire study — and the decision that it justifies — should be thrown out. (There’s some irony to Kavanaugh’s call for deference to agencies here, given that the Supreme Court rejected the idea that agency regulations deserve deference last year.)

“What’s notable for me is that they didn’t just rule on the case,” Sankar, the Earthjustice lawyer told me. (Earthjustice participated in the case.) “They decided to take a broad swipe at NEPA itself, really unnecessarily.”

Alexander Mechanick, a senior policy analyst at the Niskanen Center and former White House regulatory official, agreed with Sankar about the scope of the ruling. The court’s decision “does communicate over and over again, with a heavy hand, a real desire to get lower courts out of the business of fly specking the environmental impact assessments,” he told me.

It’s this forthrightness that seems to announce a new era of NEPA jurisprudence — one where the courts will accept a level of environmental review that they may have once rejected. In a way, Kavanaugh’s ruling is a fitting sequel to Wright’s 1971 decision in that both set the tone and capture the overarching environmental concerns of their respective eras, Bagley said.

Half a century ago, Judge Wright wanted to make sure that the American public could slow the wave of infrastructure that threatened to overwhelm the country’s landscape. NEPA represented “the commitment of the government to control, at long last, the destructive engine of material ‘progress,’” he wrote, asserting that judges must make sure the law’s goals are not “lost or misdirected in the vast hallways of the federal bureaucracy.”

Now, Kavanaugh seems to fear that progress itself has been held up. He writes that the modern NEPA process, with its cycles of “speculation and consultation and estimation and litigation,” has slowed down infrastructure projects and driven up their cost. He can sound more like an op-ed writer than a legal scholar as he lays out the law’s consequences in the ruling:

Fewer projects make it to the finish line. Indeed, fewer projects make it to the starting line. Those that survive often end up costing much more than is anticipated or necessary, both for the agency preparing the EIS and for the builder of the project. And that in turn means fewer and more expensive railroads, airports, wind turbines, transmission lines, dams, housing developments, highways, bridges, subways, stadiums, arenas, data centers, and the like. And that also means fewer jobs, as new projects become difficult to finance and build in a timely fashion.

In this declaration, Kavanaugh seems to put himself on the side of a growing and tenuously bipartisan movement to reform NEPA. A 2023 debt ceiling bill, signed by President Biden, included modest reforms to the NEPA process, imposing page limits and deadlines on the strictest forms of environmental studies. A more sweeping bipartisan effort to change the law failed last year. Now, House Republicans are taking their own crack at revising NEPA, creating an optional and more expensive permitting “fast track” for developers in the reconciliation bill.

Sankar, whose organization has championed NEPA, argues that the ruling’s practical upshot will be to allow the Trump administration greater leeway to build fossil fuel infrastructure. Kavanaugh’s ruling exhibits “a shocking disregard for the realpolitik of what's going on with this administration in particular,” he said.

“As we’ve been saying all along, NEPA gets demonized as the problem,” Sankar said. With the law’s role reduced, “I think people will see that there are a lot of other things that are the problem here, and taking federal agency expertise out of the equation is not going to hurry things up.” He added that state and local governments often rely on federal NEPA reports for their own analyses, and now those reviews may be less trustworthy.

Bagley, who has generally supported permitting reform efforts, agreed that NEPA is just one of several laws holding back clean energy projects nationwide. But it is an important one, he said, and reducing its scope will likely allow more projects to happen. He added that by changing it, advocates will learn of additional bottlenecks that are holding back construction — including laws that nobody has noticed yet because they were previously less important than NEPA. Advocates can also now focus their attention on state and local barriers to building.

“If you want to look at the permitting burdens across the United States, probably 80% to 90% of them are state and local. This [ruling] isn’t going to inaugurate a new era of American dynamism,” Bagley said. “It’s a small step in the right direction.”",https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy82MDM1MjMzMi9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc1MTU4NTIyOH0.xEbFhCqvhjZJ8G3WeTct5TcLHHMATgRXXmndWwAVULg/image.jpg?width=1200&height=600&coordinates=0%2C100%2C0%2C100,N,,2025-06-03 08:07:00.216762

Tech giants, including Amazon, Google and Meta, signed a pledge in March led by the World Nuclear Association calling for nuclear energy worldwide to triple by 2050.
""Securing clean, reliable energy is necessary to continue advancing our AI ambitions,"" said Urvi Parekh, head of global energy at Meta.
President Donald Trump recently signed four executive orders aimed at speeding nuclear deployment, setting a target of quadrupling U.S. nuclear energy by 2050.
The industry is hoping that SMRs can be a more cost-effective way to scale up nuclear power.","Meta has signed a 20-year agreement to buy nuclear power from Constellation Energy , continuing the wave of tech giants teaming up with the industry in order to meet the growing power needs of data centers.

Beginning in June 2027, Meta will buy roughly 1.1 gigawatts of energy from Constellation's Clinton Clean Energy Center in Illinois, which is the entire output from the site's one nuclear reactor. The companies said the long-term agreement will support the continuing operation of the plant, as well as its relicensing. Without the commitment from Meta, the plant was in danger of closing when its zero-emission credit, which it's relied on since 2017, expired.

""We are proud to partner with Meta. … They figured out that supporting the relicensing and expansion of existing plants is just as impactful as finding new sources of energy,"" said Joe Dominguez, Constellation's president and CEO. ""Sometimes the most important part of our journey forward is to stop taking steps backwards.""

Terms of the deal, which will also expand Clinton's output by 30 megawatts, were not disclosed. The plant will not power Meta's data centers directly – instead it will continue to provide power to the regional grid, while contributing to the tech giant's goal of 100% clean electricity.

Constellation shares rallied more than 15% on the agreement.

Tuesday's announcement is the latest in a slew of deals between big tech and the nuclear industry. In September, Constellation said it would restart Three Mile Island – the site of the worst nuclear meltdown in U.S. history – and sell the power to Microsoft under a 20-year agreement.

Google recently pledged to fund the development of three new nuclear sites, after last year teaming up with small modular reactor developer Kairos Power. Amazon invested more than $500 million to develop SMRs in October, and bought a data center campus powered by the Susquehanna nuclear plant in March 2024. Tech giants, including Amazon, Google and Meta, signed a pledge in March led by the World Nuclear Association calling for nuclear energy worldwide to triple by 2050.

Still, the deal with Constellation marks Meta's first official foray into nuclear. In December, the company put out a request for proposals to find nuclear energy developers to partner with, saying they wanted to add between one and four gigawatts of new nuclear generation in the U.S. That proposal, which is focused on advanced nuclear, remains in progress, and stands apart from the company's backing of the Clinton facility.

""Securing clean, reliable energy is necessary to continue advancing our AI ambitions,"" said Urvi Parekh, head of global energy at Meta. ""We are proud to help keep the Clinton plant operating for years to come and demonstrate that this plant is an important piece to strengthening American leadership in energy.""

President Donald Trump recently signed four executive orders aimed at speeding nuclear deployment, setting a target of quadrupling U.S. nuclear energy by 2050. The executive orders call for, among other things, an overhaul of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, as well as building out a domestic supply chain for nuclear fuel.

The White House has also called for faster regulatory approval for reactors – including small modular reactors. In the past, nuclear projects have been plagued by high upfront costs and long construction timelines. The industry is hoping that SMRs can be a more cost-effective way to scale up nuclear power. At present, there are no operational SMRs in the U.S.

Constellation said Tuesday that it is considering seeking a new permit from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to possibly build a small modular reactor at the Clinton site.",https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/107389628-17108719542022-11-09t164207z_798327205_rc2eix9j5b73_rtrmadp_0_meta-layoffs.jpeg?v=1737658509&w=1920&h=1080,N,,2025-06-03 07:07:22.019463

Wind power 2023 investment reached only 29% of what would be needed annually while investment in building energy renovation stands at around 34%.","A pivotal moment for the European Union: investment for decarbonisation, strategic autonomy and competitiveness

In a challenging geo-political context, Europe stands at crossroads. The attention in the European Union (EU) has pivoted towards security, strategic autonomy and competitiveness. At the same time, the EU’s climate leadership is needed more than ever. In this context, Europe has an opportunity to lead on both climate action, and industrial competitiveness and strategic autonomy, but this will only happen if ambitions are backed with real investments.

In 2023, climate investments in the EU reached 498 billion euros, well below the 842 billion euros needed on average each year to meet the 2030 EU climate targets, leaving a 344 billion euros gap. Early projections for 2024 suggest that key sectors like wind power, building renovation, and electric vehicles are at risk of decline. Cleantech manufacturing investments are gaining ground, but production of EU cleantech facilities is falling short of demand, putting many of these assets at risk. As the EU recalibrates around competitiveness and resilience, this report offers a stark reminder: climate policy without sufficient investment will not deliver, and the cost of delaying action will only rise.

Climate investments: uneven growth in 2023 and expected slowdown in 2024

In 2023, climate investments in the EU reached 498 billion euros in the energy, buildings, transport and cleantech manufacturing sectors – or 2.9% of EU GDP. After years of significant growth, this represents an increase of only 1.5% compared to the previous year. This overall growth reflects mixed dynamics across sectors. This slowdown in the 2023 growth is mainly due to a contraction in new buildings construction investments. The building sector also suffered from a decline in renovation activity and heat pump sales. In contrast, investment in renewable energy, driven by solar power, and in electricity grids grew by 17% in 2023. The transport sector also saw an 8% rise in investment, driven mainly by the increasing adoption of battery electric vehicles.

Early 2024 investment estimates for some sectors bring a more nuanced picture. Several climate investments are expected to have decreased in 2024, including renewable electricity (-7.2%), buildings energy renovation (-6.3%), heat pumps (-26.9%) and battery electric passenger vehicles (-2.9%).

Investments in wind turbines, solar panels, batteries, electrolysers and heat pumps manufacturing reached 13.9 billion euros in 2023. Battery manufacturing accounted for 90% of these investments. Despite progress in scaling up cleantech manufacturing capacities, underused capacity and factory closures in solar, battery and heat pumps sectors illustrate the strain of global competition and weak local demand. A tendency that is not likely to improve in the short-term as a slowdown in renewables deployment, heat pumps installation and battery electric vehicles are expected in 2024.

Accelerating climate investments to stay on course for the 2030 targets

Reaching the EU’s 2030 climate and industrial policy objectives will require 842 billion euros per year on average between 2025 and 2030, – equivalent to 4.9% of EU GDP. As climate investments reached 498 billion euros in 2023, this leaves a climate investment deficit of 344 billion euros, or 2.0% GDP.

Most of the sectors studied in the scope of this report present a climate investment deficit, in various proportions. Some sectors are particularly far from reaching their 2030 targets. Wind power 2023 investment reached only 29% of what would be needed annually while investment in building energy renovation stands at around 34%. Finally, although investments in power grids have experienced strong growth in recent years, the 19 billion investment deficit needs to be closed as soon as possible as connection to power grids is one of the key enablers of renewables deployment and increased electrification.

On the other hand, 3 sectors present a climate investment surplus for various reason:

the solar power sector shows an investment surplus of 10 billion euros, driven by a recent surge in solar installations that has put the EU on track to meet its sectoral targets.

the energy performance of new buildings sector shows a surplus of 36 billion euros. This is largely structural and reflects the European Commission’s expectations of a slowdown in new construction in the coming years, particularly in the non-residential segment.

the cleantech manufacturing sector has a surplus of 9 billion euros, entirely due to the battery manufacturing segment, where recent investments have aligned the sector with the European Commission’s desired targets set in the Net Zero Industry Act (NZIA) for this specific sector.

The investment surplus in new building construction is structural, driven by an expected decrease in new buildings construction while the surpluses in solar power and battery manufacturing are more conjunctural. These later simply indicate that the EU was investing at the right pace in 2023. Achieving the EU’s climate and industrial targets in these areas will require maintaining this pace over time. However, solar power investments are projected to decline by 5% in 2024, and battery manufacturing by 11%. If these trends persist, the EU may fall short of its targets in both sectors.

Looking ahead: Plan to invest, invest, invest

Overall investments growth in the EU’s climate transition is slowing down in 2023, and early indications suggest a decline in 2024. The EU needs to buck the trend rapidly by increasing annual investments or prepare to miss the 2030 emission reduction and cleantech manufacturing targets, but not only. The EU also risks underinvesting in the modernisation of its infrastructures, as well as in its efforts to achieve greater strategic autonomy and enhance its competitiveness. The impact could be picking up a higher bill further down the road, both in economic and ecological terms.

At the same time, several Member States are under pressure to decrease their public spendings following the implementation of the newly reformed EU fiscal rules. Also, the Recovery and Resilience Facility is set to expire by the end of 2026 and the payback of the grants and loans allocated under the NextGenerationEU should start in 2028, adding a further strain on spending capacity in the EU. Upcoming debates on the next EU multiannual financial framework (MFF) will likely focus on adapting structure and strategic investment to new priorities, increase of the EU’s own resources, and the possibilities for continued joint debt setting. If the MFF is an essential investment budget for Europe, it remains a limited share of total needs. Besides, a renewed and refocused MFF won’t begin until 2028 – just two years before the 2030 deadline.",https://www.i4ce.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/The-State-of-Europes-Climate-Investment-2025-edition_couverture.jpg,N,,2025-06-03 08:07:06.666057

Republicans have long chafed at EV incentives Many Republicans objected to the EV tax incentives passed as part of the IRA, declaring them wasteful spending.
Historically, the tax credits were critiqued for primarily helping wealthier car buyers.
Meanwhile, supporters of the credit say that Republicans have a different reason to eliminate these tax credits: The income tax cuts that Trump has promised are expensive.
The EV tax credit, he says, is ""certainly a ripe target.""","The future of the American auto industry — and what's parked in your driveway — could be shaped by negotiations on Capitol Hill right now.

That's because the version of what President Trump calls the ""big, beautiful bill"" that was passed by the House of Representatives last month includes sharp cuts to the tax credits designed to incentivize EV purchases.

President Joe Biden promoted a suite of policies meant to cut carbon emissions by boosting EV sales. That includes ""sticks,"" like regulations that effectively require companies to build more EVs, as well as ""carrots,"" the federal subsidies that sweetened the deal by providing financial incentives (to both car companies and buyers) to pivot toward battery-powered vehicles.

Trump has long signaled a desire to roll all of them back.

The House version of the bill, if it's embraced by the Senate, would bring a cleaver down on a great big pile of those carrots. That would affect new car buyers as soon as next year — and could reshape which cars are available on the market far into the future.

Consumer tax credits would phase out soon

Under the bill passed by the House, the consumer tax credit for new electric vehicles (worth up to $7,500) would phase out after 2026. But for most vehicles, it would actually become unavailable at the end of 2025, because it would only be available for vehicles made by automakers that have sold fewer than 200,000 EVs. (That's a return to how the tax credit was structured before the Biden administration.)

Meanwhile, the tax credit for used vehicles — which was created as part of the Inflation Reduction Act, Democrats' major climate law during the Biden administration — would be eliminated outright at the end of 2025. That credit was designed to expand the availability of EVs to middle- and lower-income families, addressing a longstanding critique of the tax credit: That it only helped well-off new car buyers. That credit is worth up to $4,000.

Tax credits that incentivize battery manufacturing would not be phased out as swiftly, but companies trying to claim them would face tighter restrictions on Chinese-made components and working with Chinese partner companies, which could make them more challenging to qualify for.

The legislation would also add a new $250 annual fee for EV drivers, imposed by the Federal Highway Administration. Such fees are hypothetically meant to correct for the fact that EV drivers don't pay gas taxes. However, Consumer Reports has calculated that the proposed fee is more than three times what a typical driver of a new gas-powered car pays in gas tax.

Republicans have long chafed at EV incentives

Many Republicans objected to the EV tax incentives passed as part of the IRA, declaring them wasteful spending. They've also argued that markets should determine which vehicles Americans drive, without the government incentivizing electric motors over engines.

Historically, the tax credits were critiqued for primarily helping wealthier car buyers. And that's true: New cars, and especially new EVs, are so expensive that they're out of reach for most Americans. But the IRA attempted to deal with that, both by adding income caps that kept wealthier people from qualifying, and creating the used vehicle credit, which brought cheaper cars into the mix.

Meanwhile, supporters of the credit say that Republicans have a different reason to eliminate these tax credits: The income tax cuts that Trump has promised are expensive. The current version of the bill extends multi-trillion cuts passed in 2017.

""That money's going to come from somewhere,"" says Levi McAllister, a partner at the law firm Morgan Lewis who advises companies on a range of topics related to electric vehicles. The EV tax credit, he says, is ""certainly a ripe target.""

Democrats in Congress have critiqued the Republican tax and spending package as being designed to benefit billionaires. The package overall helps the richest Americans and hurts the poorest, according to an analysis by the Congressional Budget Office.

Automakers brace for policy upheaval

Automakers knew that Trump's election would bring huge changes to EV policy. And many major carmakers support the push to pause or weaken regulations, pointing to weaker-than-expected consumer demand for zero-emission vehicles. But at the same time, they have warned that pulling subsidies and tax credits would only exacerbate a vehicle affordability problem, and put some manufacturing investments at risk.

It's easier to say goodbye to a stick than a carrot.

In a letter to Trump last fall, the U.S. trade group representing major automakers urged the incoming White House to ""preserve auto-related provisions in the current tax code,"" arguing they ""have fueled investment in domestic EV and battery manufacturing and increased good-paying jobs in automotive communities.""

It's also challenging for the auto industry to make a rapid U-turn on EV production, when decisions about factories and vehicle designs have to be made years in advance.

U.S. jobs on the line

Some advocacy groups are still holding out hope that senators will preserve at least some of the IRA clean energy credits to bolster U.S. jobs — if not for the sake of climate change.

Those credits have incentivized billions of dollars' worth of new manufacturing projects, and most of the money, projects and jobs have gone to Republican-leaning districts. That's true for clean energy projects overall, and for EV-related jobs specifically.

Companies and advocacy groups alike have leaned heavily on the job implications when lobbying to keep these credits. ""It's now up to the Senate to fix this big, ugly mess of a bill,"" Bob Keefe, the executive director of the nonpartisan, pro-environment business group E2, wrote in a statement in May. ""With more than 400 major clean energy projects and our energy future hanging in the balance, we hope they'll put their constituents ahead of politics and make America great through action, not words.""

McAllister says that while many EV makers and related companies had hoped that the jobs argument would protect the credits, they're not counting on it. ""I think companies are finally starting to say, 'Hey, for us to plan, we need to assume all of this, all of it's going away,'"" he says.

A rocky road ahead

Eliminating incentives could dramatically affect the pace of EV adoption.One Princeton study estimated that if the tax credits are repealed and federal emissions regulations are cut, as the White House has signaled it also plans to do, sales of EVs in 2030 could be 40% lower than they would have been if the existing policies stay in place.

From a business perspective, that would slow the timeline for factory expansions and make it more challenging for American automakers to compete with Chinese companies' EV innovations. And it would slow progress toward cutting transportation-related emissions, a key part of plans to reduce the damage caused by climate change.

But nobody expects this bill, if passed, to signal the end of the electric vehicle market in the U.S.

Companies started to invest in EVs before the IRA was passed, and they will keep investing in them. There's a small but committed market for them now, and companies believe better batteries and cheaper vehicles will win over new fans.",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/7164x4030+0+1173/resize/1400/quality/100/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F60%2F61%2F38739d3e4b63bbd9bbadb22d8f97%2Fgettyimages-2215956747.jpg,N,,2025-06-03 07:06:51.298126

We spoke to the Province’s Ministry of Mines and Critical Minerals to find out more.

British Columbia (B.C.) is poised to play a crucial role in the global transition to clean energy through its rich reserves of critical minerals and battery metals. As the demand for sustainable technologies skyrockets, B.C. is strategically enhancing its mining sector to meet global needs while fostering sustainable economic growth.

The recently released B.C. Critical Minerals Strategy outlines a comprehensive approach to bolster exploration and production of vital minerals, strengthening partnerships with First Nations and aligning with international market trends.

The Innovation Platform’s Maddie Hall spoke with British Columbia’s Ministry of Mines and Critical Minerals to gain insights into the province’s critical minerals strategy, and their significant contributions to the global battery metals market, the advantages it offers, and its involvement in international initiatives such as Horizon Europe.

British Columbia’s Critical Minerals Strategy

Critical minerals are a key pillar of B.C.’s competitive mining sector that attracts widespread investment in new exploration, development, and operations and contributes to cleaner, healthier communities for people in British Columbia.

B.C. has the potential to become a strong contributor to the global battery metals market, with 54% of Canada’s copper production and opportunities in other minerals that are used in the battery production sector, like nickel, cobalt and rare earth elements. B.C. is already producing or has the high potential of producing over half of the 34 critical minerals listed by the Government of Canada.

Global demand for critical minerals, including metals that are valued for the battery market, is growing substantially to capitalise on this demand.

In 2024, the Ministry of Mining and Critical Minerals released B.C. Critical Minerals Strategy.

The Strategy includes 11 actions to support critical minerals development, improve sector competitiveness, strengthen partnerships with First Nations and drive sustainable economic growth in the province. Through the Strategy, we have enhanced access to world-class public geoscience and released publications focused on critical minerals, including the BC Critical Minerals Atlas, to support explorers, First Nations, and the mining industry.

We are advancing our Environmental, Social, and Governance performance through the Mines Digital Trust, which has garnered recognition from the United Nations. We have also launched the Critical Minerals Office while introducing a renewed focus to dramatically reduce permitting timelines. This effort involves close collaboration with industry and First Nations to establish fixed timelines for exploration and major mine projects. Building on previous success, such as reducing major project review timelines by over 35%, this work aims to further streamline processes and drive greater efficiency.

British Columbia’s competitive edge in the global battery metals market

In addition to our critical minerals mining and future potential, B.C. is also home to refineries, with the Rio Tinto aluminium smelter in Kitimat and the Teck Resources lead-zinc smelter in Trail, both of which can supply critical minerals needed for clean energy applications, including EV battery manufacturing.

The province has well-established, integrated transportation networks, including rail and ports that support imports and exports, and a robust power grid that enables critical minerals mining and manufacturing. B.C. is home to several world-leading mining and battery metals processing and recycling technology companies, including Minesense, Mangrove Lithium, Saltworks Technologies, pH7 Technologies, NORAM, RecycliCo, and Invinity Energy Systems, which have battery research and engineering plants.

In B.C., we are focused on strengthening the mineral exploration and mining sector to ensure a stable and transparent environment for global partners and investors. With our abundant resources and commitment to responsible resource development, we are taking proactive steps to attract investments that support sustainable growth and benefit both local communities and the global market.

Ministry of Mines and Critical Minerals’ involvement in Horizon Europe initiatives on critical minerals

In January 2025, the European Union, Canada and B.C. co-hosted a critical raw materials dialogue event in Vancouver: EU BC Canada Critical Raw Materials Policy Dialogue workshop as part of the Canada-EU Strategic Partnership on Raw Materials to explore shared goals and opportunities in the critical minerals sector. The event also identified future pathways to strengthen B.C.-EU collaboration in this strategic area.

While the Ministry was not directly involved, we were pleased to note that Vancouver-based junior mining company Capacitor Metals – currently advancing a tantalum & niobium project in B.C. – recently received €178,000 in funding from the Horizon Europe research programme. This support includes testing materials at the Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya-Barcelona Tech in Spain.

Impact of climate policies on critical minerals development in British Columbia

The B.C. Critical Minerals Strategy is being advanced in alignment with other government priorities, including the Province’s CleanBC climate action plan, electrification, reconciliation with Indigenous Peoples, land use planning, nature conservation and other initiatives.

B.C.’s mining sector is also a leader in low-carbon mining:

Accessing clean power from BC’s electricity grid.

increasing industry innovation in low-emission technologies.

Involving local communities: The benefits of growing the battery metals industry

Mining provides approximately 40,000 jobs for people in communities throughout the province and supplies the minerals that are critical to our low-carbon future.

Communities and First Nations in mining areas benefit economically through procurement opportunities and revenue-sharing agreements. In some cases, First Nations also play a direct role in mining and battery value chain projects. Notable examples include the McLeod Lake Indian Band’s partnership with Defense Metals on the Wicheeda rare earth elements project.

The Province is committed to early, continuous engagement and consultation with communities – a key pillar of its responsible mining standards, upheld through the Mines Act and Environmental Assessment permitting processes.

Ministry support for R&D in critical minerals: Technologies and innovations

In the Upstream:

Through public geoscience, mines permitting process improvements and infrastructure investments such as our $36bn announced for electrification and $195m for highway upgrades in northwest BC jointly with Canada, we are unlocking more opportunities for the responsible mining of battery metals including nickel and cobalt in the Turnagain, Baptiste and other deposits, which have attracted the attention of investors such as Mitsubishi and Sumitomo.

B.C. also has strong fiscal incentives for mineral exploration and mining to support upstream development, e.g. the Mining Exploration Tax Credit.

As for the Downstream:

B.C.’s post-secondary institutions produce 14,000 Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) graduates every year, as well as many in the skilled trades needed for the battery supply chain.

The province is a leading hub of technology development in the mining and battery value chain, with many world-class innovators. Government supports these efforts through programmes such as Innovate BC, the Innovative Clean Energy Fund and the Centre for Innovation and Clean Energy.

We have also established the $500m InBC investment fund and Manufacturing Jobs Fund to support manufacturing and value-added opportunities.

These initiatives have invested in the University of British Columbia’s Battery Innovation Centre and in B.C. companies, including Mangrove Lithium and pH7 Technologies.

We are seeing increasing interest in manufacturing in B.C., with NORAM Electrolysis Systems’ new facility in Richmond that will produce components that can be used to produce battery-grade lithium hydroxide.

With strong recycling regulations, B.C. has an opportunity to be a leader in the recovery of battery metals from electric vehicles (EVs).

The response to battery metals supply chain disruptions in BC

We were encouraged to see that in February 2024, BloombergNEF’s annual EV battery supply chain report ranked Canada as the top country overall for our potential to build a secure, reliable and sustainable lithium-ion battery supply chain.

In the face of increasing global economic uncertainty, the Province has been squarely focused on welcoming and accelerating investment that diversifies and strengthens our economy.

We’ve convened senior deputy ministers from across critical sectors with a clear mandate to clear obstacles, drive decisions, and move projects forward quickly.

Targeted, short-term, time-sensitive, project-specific decisions are being expedited for projects that will benefit the province’s economy across energy, natural gas, forestry and mining sectors.

The work will include reducing regulatory complexity with a focus on accelerating specific major projects – and applying improvements across the board. The work also includes systemic change to ensure we are removing unnecessary delays and bottlenecks while maintaining environmental standards and meeting the requirement to consult with First Nations.

Working directly with companies, we will identify and resolve challenges to ensure we are doing everything we can from the government’s side to move projects through to construction.

The medium-term goal is to have clear permitting standards and objectives to make sure the process is effective and boosts confidence in doing business in BC. We will work closely with the federal government to move these projects forward.

An evolving sector: The future of BC’s critical minerals sector

In B.C., we are focused on transitioning to a low-carbon economy by switching away from fossil fuels towards renewable energy sources. This will require six times more critical minerals than current levels, according to the International Energy Agency.

B.C. already has low carbon intensity mines compared to its peers, and our metal mines only contributed 3% to B.C. industrial emissions in 2021. Our Critical Minerals Strategy will ensure that we produce those essential minerals, products and technologies that will contribute to the global low-carbon economy and help to drive BC’s net-zero transition.

Electrification is a key pathway for the decarbonisation of industrial sectors such as mining. Accelerated electrification through energy planning and the BC Hydro Task Force will help us to achieve our climate targets while maintaining a strong economy.

For some proposed critical minerals mines, expansion of power infrastructure will be required, and the government is working closely with BC Hydro to explore options to grow our transmission capacity through projects like the North Coast Transmission Line.",https://www.innovationnewsnetwork.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/shutterstock_eFlexion_2469840501-1024x576.jpg,N,,2025-06-03 08:07:13.686400

Meanwhile, a federally funded program intended to round out Tennessee’s EV charging network — particularly on the state’s major interstates and U.S. 64 — has been halted since February at the instruction of President Donald Trump’s administration.

Tennessee’s Fast Charge TN program aims to position an EV charger every 50 miles along Tennessee interstates and highways. In the roughly 400-mile loop closed in May with the installation of chargers in the small town of Athens, EV drivers can now access chargers every 34 miles.

The state’s $24 million program is funded separately through funds from the Volkswagen Diesel Settlement Environmental Mitigation Trust, electricity revenues from TVA and cost share from grant recipients.

Some U.S. Republicans are pushing to keep energy tax credits. Tennessee lawmakers aren’t among them.

The Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation’s Office of Energy Programs released a Notice of Intent for the Fast Charge program’s second round in February and expects to solicit projects for 13 gap areas throughout the state “in the coming months.”

Fast Charge TN’s federally backed counterpart remains at a standstill.

The National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Program (NEVI) allocated up to $5 billion to support EV charger installation along “Alternative Fuel Corridors” across the nation. Tennessee was set to receive $88 million over a 5-year period to complete a plan created by the Tennessee Department of Transportation (TDOT).

Upon taking office, Trump issued an executive order to pause the disbursement of federal grant money for programs supporting electric vehicles and clean energy initiatives under the Biden-era Inflation Reduction Act and Bipartisan Infrastructure Law.

The U.S. Federal Highway Administration officially suspended NEVI funding in February, despite having already approved states’ program plans.

TDOT awarded $21 million in NEVI funds to 10 applicants in January 2024 to install 30 new charging locations, but none of those contracts have been executed as the pause remains in effect, according to TDOT Community Relations Director Beth Emmons.

Sixteen states, Washington D.C. and multiple environmental and clean energy groups sued the U.S. Department of Transportation and Federal Highway Administration in a Washington federal court in May, arguing the federal agencies had no authority to freeze funds already appropriated by Congress. The Executive Branch, the suit contends, cannot “override or suspend this process based on changing policy priorities.”

EVs in Tennessee: Uncertainty abounds as Trump targets Biden-era electric vehicle funding

Tennessee is not one of the plaintiffs.

Gov. Bill Lee and Tennessee’s Congressional representatives have largely been mum on the tension between the state’s work to grow the EV industry and the Trump administration’s efforts to retract federal support.

Tennessee has poured hundreds of millions of dollars into incentives and grants to entice EV-related businesses to locate their manufacturing plants in the state. Lee and the state’s economic development department have celebrated the hundreds of jobs promised by EV enterprises since 2017, many in rural areas.

All but one of Tennessee’s representatives in the U.S. House voted in favor of an amended version of Trump’s budget reconciliation bill — which would eliminate electric vehicle tax credits for consumers and create new annual taxes for EV and hybrid owners — in May. Lee also celebrated the bill’s passage in the House, and did not respond to a request for comment regarding the potential impact to Tennessee’s EV industry.

U.S. Interior Secretary Doug Burgum, Energy Secretary Chris Wright, and Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin are meeting with Alaska lawmakers and Indigenous leaders to push forward fossil fuel projects previously stalled under the Biden administration.

Trump’s executive order seeks to reinstate canceled leases in the Arctic refuge, while state officials push for greater federal revenue sharing from oil and gas projects.

Asian countries including Japan and South Korea are being pressured to invest in the proposed 810-mile pipeline, though no firm financial commitments have been made.

Key quote:

“I think we should be looking at climate solutions that work for Alaskans, not trying to open up places that industry is taking a pass on, namely the Arctic refuge.”

— Andy Moderow, senior policy director with the Alaska Wilderness League

Why this matters:

The renewed push for oil and gas development in Alaska reflects a broader debate about the economic future of a state dependent on fossil fuels and the global urgency of addressing climate change. Drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge has long been controversial, both for its potential impacts on wildlife and the cultural significance of the land to Indigenous communities. The Trump administration’s visit signals a return to aggressive fossil fuel advocacy, with strategic geopolitical undertones as it seeks foreign investment from energy-hungry nations like Japan and South Korea. The proposed gas pipeline would run more than 800 miles through remote tundra, raising concerns about construction impacts, methane emissions, and long-term viability in a rapidly warming Arctic. Meanwhile, shifting oil prices and unsteady markets cast doubt on the promise of sustained economic gains.

In short:

Spain’s recent mass power outage raised doubts about the reliability of renewable energy alone, with nuclear energy supporters blaming the grid’s heavy dependence on renewables at the time of failure — though Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez dismissed the claim as misinformation.

Countries including Germany, Switzerland, Taiwan, and the U.S. are revisiting or reversing anti-nuclear policies, citing the 24/7 power needs of AI datacenters and concerns about economic and energy security.

Small modular reactors (SMRs), still unproven at commercial scale, are gaining political and corporate interest as a potential path to faster, cheaper nuclear expansion, with backing from tech firms like Google and governments including Canada and the UK.

Key quote:

“There was no problem caused by an excess of renewable energy. Those who link this incident to the lack of nuclear energy are either lying or revealing their ignorance.”

— Pedro Sánchez, prime minister of Spain

Why this matters:

As artificial intelligence tools spread, the electricity demand from data centers is projected to skyrocket — some estimates suggest it could double by the end of the decade. That growth is colliding with ambitious net-zero targets and a grid already under stress from extreme weather, electrification, and aging infrastructure. Nuclear power offers a low-carbon, constant energy supply, but brings longstanding challenges: radioactive waste, high construction costs, and unresolved safety concerns.

In short:

The Standing Rock Sioux Tribe is appealing to the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals after a federal judge dismissed its lawsuit over the Dakota Access Pipeline’s lack of an easement under Lake Oahe.

The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers revoked the pipeline’s easement in 2020 but has yet to complete a required environmental review five years later, despite publishing a draft in 2023.

The tribe contends that allowing the pipeline to operate without proper authorization violates federal law and threatens its water supply and sovereignty.

Key quote:

“The Corps of Engineers has not earned the trust of our Tribe. We cannot rely on the Corps to properly evaluate DAPL, so we are continuing our legal efforts to protect our water and our people from this dangerous pipeline.”

— Janet Alkire, chairwoman of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe

Why this matters:

The Dakota Access Pipeline remains one of the most contentious fossil fuel projects in the United States, threading through tribal lands and under a Missouri River reservoir critical to the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe’s water supply. The battle over its legality underscores deeper questions about tribal sovereignty, environmental justice, and the accountability of federal agencies. Although the pipeline was completed in 2017, its path beneath Lake Oahe lacks a finalized environmental impact review, an issue that’s dragged on for nearly a decade. Tribal leaders and environmental groups say this lapse reflects systemic disregard for Indigenous rights and environmental protections. At the heart of the conflict is not only whether a pipeline should operate without proper permits, but how regulatory delays and court rulings impact frontline communities.

In short:

Trump endorsed Nippon Steel’s $15 billion acquisition of U.S. Steel after initially opposing it, promising tariffs and jobs but offering few details on climate or modernization commitments.

The deal could preserve aging, polluting coal-based blast furnaces in Pennsylvania’s Mon Valley, raising alarm among health and climate advocates who say the decision runs counter to global steel trends.

U.S. Steel has a history of pollution violations, and local residents fear a continued reliance on coke-based steelmaking will worsen air quality and delay a transition to cleaner technologies.

Key quote:

""This administration has such an animus towards anything that fights climate change. That’s terrible for the future competitiveness of our industries.”

— Mike Williams, senior fellow, Center for American Progress

Why this matters:

Steelmaking is one of the world’s most carbon-intensive industries. While much of the global steel sector is pivoting to electric arc furnaces and hydrogen-based processes, blast furnaces — especially those fueled by the concentrated, very polluting form of coal known as coke — emit large amounts of particulate matter and greenhouse gases. These emissions are linked to respiratory illness, cardiovascular disease, and cancer in communities near production sites. Pennsylvania’s Mon Valley, where U.S. Steel runs multiple coal-powered plants, has long suffered from poor air quality and a legacy of broken promises about cleaner operations. Continued investment in coal-based infrastructure, as signaled by this deal and President Trump’s executive support for “clean coal,” could prolong both health and climate damage. Globally, the industry’s decarbonization is accelerating, but entrenching old methods in the U.S. risks falling behind technologically and economically.

In short:

More than 90 out-of-control wildfires in Canada have released thick smoke that has blanketed the Midwest and Great Plains, with evacuation orders issued for about 17,000 people in Manitoba.

States including Minnesota, Wisconsin, North Dakota, and South Dakota have issued air quality alerts, warning that conditions may be dangerous even for healthy individuals, particularly in areas with high pollution readings.

Exposure to wildfire smoke has been linked to short-term health effects like asthma attacks and coughing, as well as long-term risks such as heart disease and lung cancer, with scientists citing climate change as a factor in the growing intensity of these events.

Why this matters:

As wildfires increase in size and frequency, so do the risks for people far removed from the flames. Tiny airborne particles from wildfire smoke — known as PM2.5 — can seep deep into the lungs and bloodstream, worsening asthma, triggering cardiac events, and increasing the risk of strokes. Pregnant people, infants, older adults, and those with respiratory or cardiovascular disease are especially vulnerable. The widespread drift of smoke from Canadian wildfires into the U.S. Midwest, Great Plains, and even parts of the Southeast is a clear reminder of how climate change is reshaping health risks across borders. Regions that rarely dealt with wildfires are now experiencing repeat air quality crises.

In short:

Flash floods swept through Mokwa’s Tiffin Maza and Anguwan Hausawa districts after a powerful rainstorm, displacing residents and destroying homes and businesses.

Rescue operations have stopped, with local officials saying no further survivors are expected to be found; survivors shared stories of losing family members and livelihoods.

Relief efforts are underway as Nigeria’s emergency agency and the Red Cross respond to road damage, economic disruption, and the threat of disease from decomposing bodies.

Key quote:

""I watched helplessly as water washed away my family. I survived because I could swim.""

— Adamu Yusuf, Mokwa resident who lost his wife and newborn baby in the floods

Why this matters:

Flooding has become a recurring nightmare for Nigeria during its rainy season, but the scale and intensity of recent disasters point to deeper environmental and infrastructural problems. Warming temperatures can intensify rainfall, while aging dams, unplanned settlements, and deforestation make communities more vulnerable to catastrophic flash floods. Rural areas like Mokwa often lack the resources for early warnings or adequate drainage systems, turning seasonal rains into lethal events. The resulting deaths, economic losses, and displacement compound long-term social pressures in a country already facing instability. With climate patterns becoming more erratic, events like this could become more frequent and severe, especially in regions where infrastructure fails to keep pace with population growth.

Related: Opinion: Global warming is a crisis of inequality

In short:

The City of Charleston is suing ExxonMobil, Chevron, and others for allegedly misleading the public about climate risks, arguing their actions intensified the impact of global warming on the flood-prone coastal city.

President Trump issued an executive order declaring such lawsuits a threat to national security; federal lawyers have used it to try to stop other states from filing similar suits.

Judge Roger M. Young Sr. appeared skeptical of Charleston’s arguments but has not ruled; the case raises broader questions about whether state courts are appropriate venues for global climate disputes.

Key quote:

“This lawsuit is not seeking to solve climate change, but quite candidly, it’s so the city has the money to survive it.”

— Matt Edling, attorney for the City of Charleston

Why this matters:

As seas rise and storms intensify, local governments across the U.S. face mounting costs to protect communities from climate-driven damage. Charleston, a historic city at the water’s edge, has become a frontline for legal efforts aimed at holding fossil fuel companies financially accountable — not for future emissions, but for past public messaging. If courts side with cities like Charleston, it could set a precedent allowing local jurisdictions to recoup climate-related costs, shifting financial liability from taxpayers to oil and gas companies. But the legal landscape is uneven. Some states have advanced similar claims, while others have seen their lawsuits dismissed. President Trump’s executive order labeling such cases a threat to national security adds a new layer of complexity, turning local litigation into a flashpoint in national policy.

Climate Executive Secretary Simon Stiell, added: “In the great horserace of life … ‘always back self-interest … what’s in it for me.
'” It is not that clean energy backers have not made the case before.
The appeal targets lawmakers who might dismiss climate change but be open to an economic rationale, said Jessie Stolark, executive director of the Carbon Capture Coalition, which spearheaded a letter.
“The messaging with this current administration and with the Republicans is shifting more to that energy piece, the economic piece, the jobs piece.","Messaging from the U.S. renewable energy industry and the United Nations on climate change has typically focused on the urgent need to cut greenhouse gas emissions for the sake of environmental and human health. To bolster the argument, they cite record-shattering heat around the world, the frequent climate disasters costing billions of dollars and the human toll of it all.

But a sharper emphasis on profit potential has become evident as President Donald Trump stormed into office with a flurry of rollbacks to clean energy initiatives and an emphatic declaration of plans to “unleash” oil, gas and mining. In a lobbying blitz in Washington recently, solar, wind, hydropower and other clean-energy interests touted their role in a “robust American energy and manufacturing economy” and sported lapel pins that said “American energy dominance” — a favorite Trump phrase.

Meanwhile, in a major policy speech Thursday in Brazil, the U.N.’s top climate official played up the $2 trillion flowing into clean-energy projects and recalled a friend telling him that appealing to people’s “better angels” only goes so far.

That friend, according to U.N. Climate Executive Secretary Simon Stiell, added: “In the great horserace of life … ‘always back self-interest … what’s in it for me.'”

It is not that clean energy backers have not made the case before. But a different landscape, especially in the U.S., stands to make it more potent.

“It’s a very winning message for outreach to conservatives because it’s really true,” said former U.S. Rep. Bob Inglis, a South Carolina Republican who founded the conservative climate group RepublicEN.org. “If we play our cards right and lead the world to this, we can create a lot of wealth, create a lot of jobs here in America.”

Inglis pointed to Elon Musk’s empire-building on electric cars, solar panels and batteries.

“When right-of-center people hear, ‘you know, you can you make a profit at this’ then it makes sense. Otherwise, it’s like, why are people giving stuff away?” Inglis said.

Jobs especially have long been a big selling point for solar and wind energy and electric cars, but there is a push to not think of self-interest as a dirty word — and instead to harness it, United Nations officials said. When Stiell mentioned the $2 trillion in his speech for clean energy, he called it “unstoppable because of the colossal scale of economic opportunity it presents.”

Princeton University climate scientist Michael Oppenheimer, who is also a professor of international affairs, said climate change is such a difficult problem, “if some people feel the need to cater to narrower self-interests which can be bundled into a solution to the problem, why not?”

In letters and at more than 100 congressional meetings, industry leaders from the Solar Energy Industries Association, Oceantic Network and other organizations appealed to keep crucial tax incentives in place so their projects can be globally competitive.

The appeal targets lawmakers who might dismiss climate change but be open to an economic rationale, said Jessie Stolark, executive director of the Carbon Capture Coalition, which spearheaded a letter.

“In the past administration, obviously, we emphasized the common interest around climate mitigation,” Stolark said. “The messaging with this current administration and with the Republicans is shifting more to that energy piece, the economic piece, the jobs piece.

“I think you want to meet an audience where they are, what’s important to them, what’s going to drive the conversation forward.”

Liz Beardsley, senior policy counsel at the U.S. Green Building Council that was part of the sweeping lobbying effort, said the economy has always been a core component of its messages, and that “doing good is also good for business.”

To Lisa Sachs, director of the Columbia Center on Sustainable Investment, messaging that climate efforts were strictly for the planet was actually disingenuous.

“The honesty and coherence of the business and financial sectors in making the economic case for the transition is refreshing, at least, after years of doublespeak, greenwashing and confusion,” Sachs said. “It’s not a perfect strategy from a climate or social perspective, as the private sector cannot on its own fully decarbonize the economy … But under this administration, it’s probably our best bet for progress.”

President Trump may not be reachable, but his Energy and Interior secretaries are and they have power, said Frank Maisano, a longtime Washington spokesman for energy interests from oil and gas to wind and batteries.

It is time for a change, said Joanna Depledge, a climate historian at Cambridge University in England: “Banging on about the catastrophic climate crisis is obviously doing no good at all.”",http://www.milwaukeeindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/021225_ClimateMakingMoney_01_CharlieRiedel.jpg,N,,2025-06-03 07:07:12.492904
,American Energy,2025-06-03 10:06:07+00:00,Factor This™,The key to making virtual power plants work might be as simple as customer service,Paul Gerke,,,,,https://www.renewableenergyworld.com/power-grid/distribution/the-key-to-making-virtual-power-plants-work-might-be-as-simple-as-customer-service/,"Working with Utilities Octopus, the parent company of Kraken (they’re the ones with the cute plushies at DTECH), is working closely with North American utilities to provide flexibility as a service.
Octopus Energy’s flexibility as a service offering, Octopus Flux, positions the company as less of an aggregator and more of an enabler of the utility.
They already have the customer relationship, and we are trying to empower them with know-how and technology,” Chaset said.
An already heavily cited study out of Duke University recently found significant potential for load integration onto the power grid, should flexibility measures be taken.
But to make that distributed dream a reality… “We just have to engage with the customer,” Chaset reinforced.","Do you recall what we once considered a run-of-the-mill cell phone purchasing experience in the United States? The headaches were seemingly endless, from service provider limitations to charging cable incompatibilities, from long waits to transfer data (if it even worked) to needing to punch in a series of numbers to “update” your service with local towers.

Much of the early cellular friction has since been smoothed out by the accessibility of cloud data storage and various technological advancements, giving way to what one might call “the iPhone experience,” but other industries are still feeling their own versions of those growing pains, like in residential solar and storage.

Bloated contracts conflated with confusing clauses and long-term loans combined with shifting state policies that limit consumer compensation are souring consumer sentiment, but if Octopus Energy US has its way, a smoother customer journey is on the horizon.

Working with Utilities

Octopus, the parent company of Kraken (they’re the ones with the cute plushies at DTECH), is working closely with North American utilities to provide flexibility as a service. The idea is to offer ratepayers a turnkey solution that enables utilities to focus on acquiring and orchestrating flexibility within their customer base and leaves the customer-side stuff to the team with the tentacles in its logo.

“Vertically integrated utilities are working really hard to better engage with customers, but that’s not something that has always been in their DNA,” shared Nick Chaset, the chief executive officer of Octopus Energy US, in an interview with Factor This.

“We partner with utilities to help them engage with and harness consumer flexibility from electric vehicles (EVs), smart thermostats, and batteries, and do it in a way that gives those customers more of a retail-like experience,” he summarized.

According to Chaset, dealing with large commercial and industrial (C&I) clients requires a different sort of consumer engagement strategy than the residential side of the fence.

“In resi, it’s very much about customer experience and managing the friction of onboarding your device and communicating its simplicity and value,” explained Chaset. “That’s something that Octopus is really, really good at.”

Encouraging Adoption

The U.S. virtual power plant (VPP) market is currently being driven by original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), such as Renew Home’s Nest or Tesla’s increasingly popular Powerwall. 20-25% of eligible customers typically participate in flexibility programs under the OEM model, Chaset says, in some cases by default opt-ins, in others by companies embedding the signing-up process into the device installation. But if it’s BYOD (bring your own device) situation, like in the case of EV programs or standalone solar and storage, participation rates plummet to 10% or less.

“Those are just low,” Chaset states frankly. “How do you break through to get to 30-40-50-60-70% participation rate? What we find at Octopus is that when we engage with our retail customers, we’re seeing 50% participation rates.”

Chaset reports that about half of all Octopus customers in Texas have given the VPP wrangler permission to manage their thermostats, and in the United Kingdom, a similar percentage of customers with EVs are participating in the company’s dynamic managed charging program.

“The key to that is just removal of friction participation, clearly communicating the value to the consumer of participating, and also clearly communicating that their preferences come first,” the CEO of the technology agnostic software company posited. “We never override the consumer preference… Now, if they override, there may be some sort of consequence to an incentive, but we really put the customer first.”

“Our thesis is that if you apply that same approach in a vertically integrated utility context, you’re going to see similar participation rates, because that’s what we see all over the world when we apply this methodology.”

The Table Stakes for Flexibility

Chaset believes there are table stakes for capitalizing on flexibility, primarily that both the customer and the utility/grid must benefit. The more intermediaries stacked between the grid and the consumer, the less value remains.

Octopus Energy’s flexibility as a service offering, Octopus Flux, positions the company as less of an aggregator and more of an enabler of the utility.

“Our view is that the retailer, or the utility, should essentially become the aggregator. They already have the customer relationship, and we are trying to empower them with know-how and technology,” Chaset said. “In the beginning, that might mean we’re doing it for them, because they don’t have those capabilities. They haven’t built those muscles. But our intention is to essentially put ourselves out of business on the customer engagement side, because our partner, the utility or retailer, has become so good at it.”

By aggregating millions of EVs and solar and storage systems, utilities can tap into otherwise unharnessed energy, increasing the utilization of the grid and lowering electricity costs for everyone. An already heavily cited study out of Duke University recently found significant potential for load integration onto the power grid, should flexibility measures be taken.

Rethinking Load Growth: Assessing the Potential for Integration of Large Flexible Loads in US Power Systems looked at 22 of the largest balancing authorities (BAs) serving 95% of the country’s peak and discovered that gigawatts of new load could be added to the grid in each BA before total load exceeds what system planners are prepared to serve, so long as the new load can be temporarily curtailed as needed. Relatively small amounts of flexibility made a huge difference.

“And our view is that most of this flexibility is actually free,” ventured Chaset, pointing out that an EV driver doesn’t really care when their car charges during the night, only that there’s at least 80% battery life in the morning.

“It’s the same thing with residential energy storage,” he continued. “From a consumer perspective, I don’t really care if [my battery] dumps at four or five or six or seven, as long as I get the most benefit from time-of-use rates, and that’s where harnessing them to deliver good value that does not diminish consumer utility is the key.”

As Chris Rauscher, the head of grid services and virtual power plants at Sunrun, put it: “Customers don’t care about virtual power plants… Customers just want hot showers and cold beer.” It’s up to companies like Octopus to sort out the messy details.

Millions of consumer devices that have already been deployed are just waiting to make a difference on the grid. But to make that distributed dream a reality…

“We just have to engage with the customer,” Chaset reinforced. “And we have to make it easy and delightful.”",https://www.renewableenergyworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/ChatGPT-Image-May-30-2025-04_23_42-PM.jpg,N,,2025-06-03 07:07:28.996691

Keir Starmer is expected to give the final nod to begin construction of Britain’s second new nuclear power project in a generation, alongside the French nuclear developer EDF, at a Franco-British summit next month.

The final approval for Sizewell C, first reported by the Financial Times, would mark the end of a 15-year journey to secure investment for the plant since the site was first earmarked for new nuclear development in 2010.

The government is understood to be in the final stages of securing billions of pounds of investment from the private sector to back the project, which follows the Hinkley Point C nuclear plant, which is under construction in Somerset.

Ministers are expected to use the government’s spending review, scheduled for 11 June, to set out the UK’s investment in the project, which will ultimately rely on a mix of funding from taxpayers and via energy bills.

The final go-ahead from Starmer and the French president, Emmanuel Macron, will then follow during the Anglo-French summit due to take place in London on 8-10 July, according to the Financial Times.

The UK government’s stake in the project stood at 84% at the end of last year compared with EDF’s 16% share of the project. The French state’s cash-strapped utilities company is understood to be eager to reduce its stake in the project even further.

Potential investors in the project according to the report include Schroders Greencoat, Equitix, the Canadian pension fund CDPQ, Amber Infrastructure Partners, Brookfield Asset Management, the UK pension fund USS and the insurer Rothesay, backed by the Singaporean infrastructure fund GIC.

EDF had originally planned to build the nuclear plant alongside China’s state nuclear developer China General Nuclear Power Corp, which also holds a stake in the Hinkley Point C project, but its partner was forced to step back from the project by the UK government on security grounds.

The project has secured £6.4bn of government funding to support its development to date, of which £2.5bn was granted by the Conservative government under Rishi Sunak and a further £3.9bn has come from the current Labour administration.

The planned financial framework designed to support the project, which is rumoured to cost about £40bn, has angered anti-nuclear campaigners because it would grant EDF support via energy bills from the start of its construction.

The framework differs from the model used to support the Hinkley Point C project, which will earn revenue for EDF only once the plant begins generating electricity. Under the new model billpayers could be on the hook for construction delays and cost overruns at Sizewell C, according to campaigners.

Alison Downes, a campaigner for Stop Sizewell C, said: “We’ll all pay for the £40bn folly that is Sizewell C. By starting construction and ploughing £6.4bn of taxpayers’ money so far into the project the government has undermined its negotiating position and essentially written private investors a blank cheque. Any that came onboard at the 11th hour will have been bribed by generous terms at the expense of consumers, who will be forced to pay a nuclear tax on household energy bills for many years until a single lightbulb is lit.”",https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/af6c7bbf71f448bbe96a1aecd249a6f81008b4a9/185_0_2498_2000/master/2498.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=4763016f3f31d3d34dc14baf4e6592f0,N,,2025-06-03 07:07:33.298113

Powin’s notification to the state listed the roles of all staff affected, including its chief executives. According to the letter, if cessation of business operations occurs, “it is presently contemplated that the affected employees will be permanently terminated.”

Powin announcement comes amid atmosphere of uncertainty for US BESS industry

The system integrator provides BESS hardware based on its modular Powin Pod liquid-cooled 5MWh lithium-ion (Li-ion) solution in a standard 20-foot container, driven by its StackOS energy management system (EMS) platform.

Powin has supplied more than 11GWh of operational projects worldwide and is currently working on more than 6GWh of projects in construction, according to its website.

The company works with a variety of battery vendors and was among the first integrators outside China to launch a BESS solution with 5MWh capacity within the 20-foot container form factor.

,EPA,2025-06-03 09:40:54+00:00,Virginia Mercury,Decades-old paper mill in Covington named nation's top climate polluter in new report,"Markus Schmidt, Graham Moomaw, Charlie Paullin",,,,,https://virginiamercury.com/2025/06/03/decades-old-paper-mill-in-covington-named-nations-top-climate-polluter-in-new-report/,"The report, titled “A Paper Trail of Pollution,” paints a dire portrait of the U.S. pulp and paper industry.
Six of the top 10 emitters of hydrogen sulfide across all industries last year were paper mills, the report said.
The report calls for pulp and paper mills to replace aging boilers with zero-emission industrial heat systems and shift toward cleaner energy sources.
According to the group, manufacturing a ton of cardboard from recycled materials requires half the energy, 32% less water, and produces just a quarter of the climate pollution.
“The American paper industry should modernize these plants to use cleaner and more efficient power systems and increase recycling to reduce climate pollution and protect the health of nearby communities,” Duggan said.","A World War II-era boiler in Virginia is at the center of a growing debate over the paper industry’s role in climate change — and how much pollution goes uncounted due to loopholes in federal reporting rules.

The Smurfit Westrock paper mill in Covington, a 126-year-old facility located north of Roanoke, released more climate-warming pollution in 2023 than any other paper mill in the country, according to a sweeping new report by the Environmental Integrity Project.

The watchdog group found that the facility reported emitting 970,084 metric tons of greenhouse gases last year — but in reality, it released more than 2.5 million tons. The discrepancy stems from an Environmental Protection Agency policy that allows facilities to omit emissions from the burning of wood and wood byproducts, known as “biogenic” fuels.

“This plant is burning dirty fuels using a boiler built in 1940, and the pollution is hitting communities and the climate alike,” said Jen Duggan, executive director of the Environmental Integrity Project. “Even in the digital age, we need paper products. But there is no reason a clean sheet of paper needs to be made with dirty fuels and antiquated methods.”

The Smurfit Westrock press office did not to respond to an email seeking comment Monday.

The report, titled “A Paper Trail of Pollution,” paints a dire portrait of the U.S. pulp and paper industry.

Over a six-month period, researchers reviewed thousands of public records and visited mills across the country, ultimately studying the 185 largest paper and pulp facilities in the United States. Their findings suggest that many of these plants are operating with outdated infrastructure, lax oversight and little accountability for their true environmental impact.

Among the most striking revelations is that nearly three-quarters of the mills rely on outdated boilers, with an average age of 41 years. One of the oldest, built in 1928, remains in use at a mill in Longview, Washington. In contrast, experts recommend replacing industrial boilers after about 15 years. At more than 40% of the facilities studied, at least one boiler was a half-century old or older.

The Covington mill, which employs several hundred people and is a fixture of the local economy, has long drawn criticism from nearby residents for the foul odors, soot and water pollution it produces.

In 2023, it was the nation’s top emitter of methane — a greenhouse gas more than 80 times as potent as carbon dioxide over a 20-year period — releasing more than 214,000 metric tons. The mill also ranked third among U.S. paper facilities for hydrochloric acid emissions, releasing an estimated 170,000 pounds.

The plant’s impact extends beyond the air. State records document at least a dozen incidents over the past five years in which locals reported dark, cloudy, or contaminated discharges — including black liquor, a toxic wood-processing byproduct — flowing into the nearby Jackson River, a tributary of the James River, and ultimately the Chesapeake Bay.

One complaint, filed in November 2022, warned of “polluted water destroying the Upper James River fishery.” The Virginia Department of Environmental Quality dismissed the complaint.

Victoria Higgins, Virginia director of the Chesapeake Climate Action Network, said the Covington facility is a clear example of how outdated equipment and regulatory gaps are allowing the paper industry to skirt accountability.

“Pollution from industrial factories burning trees is an under-counted source of climate-warming pollution,” she said. “In order to deliver on the promise of clean air and a stable climate in Virginia, we need to ensure facilities like the more than century-old Smurfit Westrock mill are moving to cleaner energy sources.”

An industry steeped in tradition

The American paper industry traces its roots to 1690, when the first mill opened in Germantown, Pennsylvania, using discarded cotton rags and waterwheels for power. By 1810, about 185 mills were operating across the country, but a shortage of rags pushed papermakers to experiment with alternative fibers like straw, bark and eventually wood.

With the advent of mechanical wood grinders in the 19th century, wood pulp became the industry standard, and the U.S. quickly rose to become the world’s top paper producer. That growth came at a cost — mill operations contributed to large-scale deforestation, including the cutting of tens of millions of acres of woodland in a single year by some companies.

Today, the U.S. has more trees than it did 50 years ago, thanks in part to replanting efforts by the industry, which now plants over a billion trees annually. The modern paper sector is dominated by a few major corporations and concentrated in states like Wisconsin, Georgia, and Alabama. More than half of paper produced in the U.S. is now used for packaging and wrapping.

Federal law currently allows the paper industry to exclude emissions from the combustion of biogenic materials — such as wood, wood chips, and black liquor — on the theory that trees will regrow and eventually recapture the carbon released during combustion.

But environmental groups and scientists increasingly question that logic, particularly when emissions from burning these fuels are both large and immediate, while regrowth can take decades.

Nationwide, the 185 mills studied reported a total of 33.2 million metric tons of greenhouse gas emissions to the EPA in 2023. But after factoring in emissions from biogenic fuels — which the EPA does not currently require mills to report — the Environmental Integrity Project estimates that the true number is closer to 115 million tons. That’s more than three times the reported total.

Other pollutants are also under-regulated. In 2020, the mills collectively released more than 46,000 tons of sulfur dioxide, a pollutant linked to heart and lung problems, including premature death. Many mills, including some of the worst offenders, lack basic pollution control devices such as scrubbers that can significantly reduce emissions of sulfur dioxide and hydrogen sulfide.

The latter chemical is responsible for the rotten egg-like smell associated with many mills, including the one in Covington, and can trigger nausea, headaches and respiratory issues.

Hydrogen sulfide pollution is especially concentrated. In 2023, 90 of the mills reported emitting a combined total of eight million pounds of the chemical, with nearly half of that coming from just 12 plants. Six of the top 10 emitters of hydrogen sulfide across all industries last year were paper mills, the report said.

The report also found that regulatory enforcement has been inconsistent and often toothless.

A third of the 185 mills studied had an air pollution violation in the last three years. Over the past five years, 95 of them were subject to 267 enforcement actions, which resulted in just $7.4 million in total penalties — a modest sum for an industry with multibillion-dollar revenues.

Pollution not unique to Virginia plants

Beyond Virginia, the report includes case studies of plants in Washington and South Carolina, where local residents have filed thousands of odor complaints, voiced worries about health risks, and called on regulators to tighten enforcement.

In Port Townsend, Washington, a mill has spent 12 consecutive quarters in violation of the Clean Air Act. In Catawba, South Carolina, residents have logged nearly 50,000 odor complaints since 2018 against a mill now owned by a private equity group led by New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft.

Duggan and her colleagues argue that the solution lies in modernization and tougher oversight. The report calls for pulp and paper mills to replace aging boilers with zero-emission industrial heat systems and shift toward cleaner energy sources. It also urges a greater commitment to using recycled paper over virgin wood, which requires more energy and water and generates significantly more emissions.

According to the group, manufacturing a ton of cardboard from recycled materials requires half the energy, 32% less water, and produces just a quarter of the climate pollution.

The study’s authors also demand an end to the biogenic loophole in EPA reporting rules and warn that the issue could worsen if efforts to eliminate or weaken greenhouse gas reporting requirements under President Donald Trump’s administration succeed.

“The American paper industry should modernize these plants to use cleaner and more efficient power systems and increase recycling to reduce climate pollution and protect the health of nearby communities,” Duggan said. “And this industry should not be allowed to hide its climate pollution.”

For residents of Covington and other communities living in the shadow of aging mills, the hope is that attention from this report will bring pressure for long-overdue reforms — before the paper trail of pollution grows any longer.",https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/CC-Westrock-paper-waste-pond-2048x1362.jpg,N,,2025-06-03 07:07:39.554752

And, of course, these are jobs and investments that are not only good for the state’s economy, but for the world as it struggles to end its heroin-like addiction to fossil fuels.

Solar energy companies across the region are reeling at the prospect of rollbacks to the solar energy tax credits included in the budget bill that passed the U.S. House in May.

“It’s terrible,” said Micah Gold-Markel, founder of Solar States, a solar energy installer that employs about 60 people in the region. “Trump really framed this as the ‘green waste of money.’ Well, if you think that people’s jobs and their livelihoods are a waste of money, then you’re missing the story of America.”

Gold-Markel said if President Donald Trump’s stated goal is to create “American energy dominance,” then solar should be a big part of that.

“Solar creates jobs. It doesn’t destroy them,” Gold-Markel said.

The 30% tax credits have helped make solar affordable for many residents and businesses, especially since the up-front costs to install panels are high and can take time to recoup from resulting lower electricity bills. But the House budget passed on May 21 would eliminate the tax credit 60 days after the budget is approved.

“We’re telling clients, let’s get construction started so that we still qualify in the 60-day window for construction starting,” said Gold-Markel. “But residentially, it’s a disaster, and I could see us having to lay off a quarter of the company.”

Gold-Markel said the tax credits helped him build his business, but if the provision gets approved by the U.S. Senate, it’s not clear whether it will survive. The Inflation Reduction Act, which extended the tax credits, also helped nonprofits, including churches and schools, take advantage of solar credits through “direct pay.”

“Direct pay allows for nonprofits, which don’t have tax liability, to get cash instead of the tax benefit,” Gold-Markel said. “That changed everything.”

Thousands of Pa. jobs at stake if solar tax credits disappear

The GOP’s House budget bill would effectively end a surge in Biden-era solar energy projects that proponents say created jobs, boosted manufacturing and tackled climate change. Without the credits, the industry says utility bills will rise, along with job cuts. The Solar Energy Industries Association predicts the loss of more than 4,300 jobs, and the closure of up to 20 current or pending factories in Pennsylvania, if the current version of the rollback makes it into the final budget.

The bill squeaked through by one vote along party lines, but solar installers, manufacturers and building trades unions in the region had hoped that support from Republican Congressman Brian Fitzpatrick would lessen the pain. Fitzpatrick, a moderate whose district includes Bucks and parts of Montgomery counties, voted for the budget bill. More importantly, he sits on the influential House Ways and Means Committee, which drafted the language of the bill, and proponents of the tax credits say he had reassured them he would defend the measures.

“We intentionally met with [Fitzpatrick’s] office,” said Gold-Markel. “We brought workers in his district to show him that there are jobs at stake in his district. We showed him projects. Rep. Fitzpatrick completely abandoned the renewable energy workers in his district.”

Multiple efforts to reach Fitzpatrick for this story went unanswered.

The original language passed by the committee, which had phased out the credits over a number of years, was replaced by language that would eliminate the credits within 60 days, a move that took many by surprise.

“None of [the Republican lawmakers] want to cross President Trump in a GOP that at this point is more of a personality cult than a real political party,” said Jason Walsh, executive director of the BlueGreen Alliance, a coalition of labor and environmental groups. “But we had hoped that members like Mr. Fitzpatrick would use their negotiating leverage and positions on key committees to protect these investments during the process of writing the bill.”

Walsh was particularly irked by the absence of Fitzpatrick during a failed committee vote to keep the clean energy tax credits.

“It’s not clear why he didn’t vote on that amendment, and it’s honestly puzzling,” said Walsh. “I think the question constituents should be asking is why their representative in the U.S. House says all the right things about these job-creating, pollution-reducing investments, but when the rubber hits the road, he’s missing in action on the committee that writes the bill, and he ultimately votes for a bill that screws over workers in his district, and trashes our air and water and climate.”

The Solar Energy Industries Association estimates the solar and manufacturing tax credits, which are part of the Inflation Reduction Act, helped spur about $5.4 billion in private investments in Pennsylvania alone.

“If Congress does not change course, this legislation will upend an economic boom in this country that has delivered an historic American manufacturing renaissance, lower electric bills, hundreds of thousands of good-paying jobs, and tens of billions of dollars of investments primarily to states that voted for President Trump,” said Abigail Ross Hopper, CEO of SEIA, in a statement.

Impact of solar tax credits on manufacturing

Another goal of the Inflation Reduction Act was to use the tax credits to boost investment and bring solar manufacturing back to the U.S. But Kyle Wallace, vice president of public policy at PosiGen, a residential solar installer based in New Orleans with operations in Pennsylvania, said the demise of the solar tax credits would upend growth in manufacturing, especially in red states like Texas, Ohio and Florida, where PosiGen sources much of its supplies.

“We’ve been able to shift our supply chains to where now, all the major equipment is manufactured in the United States, which is amazing,” said Wallace. “And it’s something we’re really proud of. But if those manufacturing facilities don’t have the demand from companies like PosiGen, it’s really questionable whether or not they will stay open, and whether we’ll just kind of lose those manufacturing jobs back overseas.”

PosiGen works with Solarize Philly, which encourages solar panel installations on homes of low-income residents. Since the customers’ income isn’t high enough to take advantage of the tax credits, the company itself takes the credit, and thereby passes on the savings. But without the tax credits, it’s unlikely that business model could work for companies like PosiGen. Wallace said it’s too early to speculate the impact on employees.

Wallace said he too met with Fitzpatrick’s staff and came away hopeful, but is now disappointed the end result is worse than what the committee itself had drafted.

Jack Pratt, associate vice president of the Environmental Defense Fund Action, said in the end, House Speaker Mike Johnson made the decision to side with the hard-liners, which include central Pennsylvania Rep. Scott Perry.

“[Johnson] could have said, ‘Let me try to deliver for the moderates in my caucus, who have said they want to preserve these incentives,’ or, ‘Let me try and make sure that I can hold on to the far right, the Freedom Caucus folks,’” said Pratt. “And, you know, in Pennsylvania, you have both, right? You got the moderate side, you’ve got the Brian Fitzpatricks of the world, and then you’ve also got the Scott Perrys, the Freedom Caucus folks who say that they want to see all these incentives end.”

Pratt, however, doesn’t point the finger at Fitzpatrick.

“What ended up passing through the House was, from our perspective, awful,” said Pratt. “It is essentially, kind of a de facto cut of all the clean energy tax incentives. But if there were 218 Brian Fitzpatricks in the Republican Party, then we’d be a lot better off.”

He also said the game is not over.

“We’re not giving up on this, and we really do want to see the Senate make improvements,” Pratt said.

Gold-Markel said he’s also not giving up, especially since so much is at stake.

“I’m hoping that [Sen. John] Fetterman stands up and says we have a lot of renewable energy jobs in Pennsylvania,” said Gold-Markel. “I’m hoping that [Sen. Dave] McCormick stands up. I’m trying to get a meeting with McCormick as soon as possible.”

He said he wants them to talk straight about what they can and cannot do to hold the line for the solar tax credits.

“I’m encouraged, but skeptical. Are we going to get the Fitzpatrick treatment again? I don’t know,” said Gold-Markel.",https://whyy.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Election_2024_Pennsylvania_House_ap-2024-10-24-05.jpg,N,,2025-06-03 07:07:15.586089

Historically, the tax credits were critiqued for primarily helping wealthier car buyers.
Meanwhile, supporters of the credit say that Republicans have a different reason to eliminate these tax credits: The income tax cuts that Trump has promised are expensive.
The EV tax credit, he says, is ""certainly a ripe target.""","The future of the American auto industry — and what's parked in your driveway — could be shaped by negotiations on Capitol Hill right now.

That's because the version of what President Trump calls the ""big, beautiful bill"" that was passed by the House of Representatives last month includes sharp cuts to the tax credits designed to incentivize EV purchases.

President Joe Biden promoted a suite of policies meant to cut carbon emissions by boosting EV sales. That includes ""sticks,"" like regulations that effectively require companies to build more EVs, as well as ""carrots,"" the federal subsidies that sweetened the deal by providing financial incentives (to both car companies and buyers) to pivot toward battery-powered vehicles.

Trump has long signaled a desire to roll all of them back.

The House version of the bill, if it's embraced by the Senate, would bring a cleaver down on a great big pile of those carrots. That would affect new car buyers as soon as next year — and could reshape which cars are available on the market far into the future.

Consumer tax credits would phase out soon

Under the bill passed by the House, the consumer tax credit for new electric vehicles (worth up to $7,500) would phase out after 2026. But for most vehicles, it would actually become unavailable at the end of 2025, because it would only be available for vehicles made by automakers that have sold fewer than 200,000 EVs. (That's a return to how the tax credit was structured before the Biden administration.)

Meanwhile, the tax credit for used vehicles — which was created as part of the Inflation Reduction Act, Democrats' major climate law during the Biden administration — would be eliminated outright at the end of 2025. That credit was designed to expand the availability of EVs to middle- and lower-income families, addressing a longstanding critique of the tax credit: That it only helped well-off new car buyers. That credit is worth up to $4,000.

Tax credits that incentivize battery manufacturing would not be phased out as swiftly, but companies trying to claim them would face tighter restrictions on Chinese-made components and working with Chinese partner companies, which could make them more challenging to qualify for.

The legislation would also add a new $250 annual fee for EV drivers, imposed by the Federal Highway Administration. Such fees are hypothetically meant to correct for the fact that EV drivers don't pay gas taxes. However, Consumer Reports has calculated that the proposed fee is more than three times what a typical driver of a new gas-powered car pays in gas tax.

Republicans have long chafed at EV incentives

Many Republicans objected to the EV tax incentives passed as part of the IRA, declaring them wasteful spending. They've also argued that markets should determine which vehicles Americans drive, without the government incentivizing electric motors over engines.

Historically, the tax credits were critiqued for primarily helping wealthier car buyers. And that's true: New cars, and especially new EVs, are so expensive that they're out of reach for most Americans. But the IRA attempted to deal with that, both by adding income caps that kept wealthier people from qualifying, and creating the used vehicle credit, which brought cheaper cars into the mix.

Meanwhile, supporters of the credit say that Republicans have a different reason to eliminate these tax credits: The income tax cuts that Trump has promised are expensive. The current version of the bill extends multi-trillion cuts passed in 2017.

""That money's going to come from somewhere,"" says Levi McAllister, a partner at the law firm Morgan Lewis who advises companies on a range of topics related to electric vehicles. The EV tax credit, he says, is ""certainly a ripe target.""

Democrats in Congress have critiqued the Republican tax and spending package as being designed to benefit billionaires. The package overall helps the richest Americans and hurts the poorest, according to an analysis by the Congressional Budget Office.

Automakers brace for policy upheaval

Automakers knew that Trump's election would bring huge changes to EV policy. And many major carmakers support the push to pause or weaken regulations, pointing to weaker-than-expected consumer demand for zero-emission vehicles. But at the same time, they have warned that pulling subsidies and tax credits would only exacerbate a vehicle affordability problem, and put some manufacturing investments at risk.

It's easier to say goodbye to a stick than a carrot.

In a letter to Trump last fall, the U.S. trade group representing major automakers urged the incoming White House to ""preserve auto-related provisions in the current tax code,"" arguing they ""have fueled investment in domestic EV and battery manufacturing and increased good-paying jobs in automotive communities.""

It's also challenging for the auto industry to make a rapid U-turn on EV production, when decisions about factories and vehicle designs have to be made years in advance.

U.S. jobs on the line

Some advocacy groups are still holding out hope that senators will preserve at least some of the IRA clean energy credits to bolster U.S. jobs — if not for the sake of climate change.

Those credits have incentivized billions of dollars' worth of new manufacturing projects, and most of the money, projects and jobs have gone to Republican-leaning districts. That's true for clean energy projects overall, and for EV-related jobs specifically.

Companies and advocacy groups alike have leaned heavily on the job implications when lobbying to keep these credits. ""It's now up to the Senate to fix this big, ugly mess of a bill,"" Bob Keefe, the executive director of the nonpartisan, pro-environment business group E2, wrote in a statement in May. ""With more than 400 major clean energy projects and our energy future hanging in the balance, we hope they'll put their constituents ahead of politics and make America great through action, not words.""

McAllister says that while many EV makers and related companies had hoped that the jobs argument would protect the credits, they're not counting on it. ""I think companies are finally starting to say, 'Hey, for us to plan, we need to assume all of this, all of it's going away,'"" he says.

A rocky road ahead

Eliminating incentives could dramatically affect the pace of EV adoption.One Princeton study estimated that if the tax credits are repealed and federal emissions regulations are cut, as the White House has signaled it also plans to do, sales of EVs in 2030 could be 40% lower than they would have been if the existing policies stay in place.

From a business perspective, that would slow the timeline for factory expansions and make it more challenging for American automakers to compete with Chinese companies' EV innovations. And it would slow progress toward cutting transportation-related emissions, a key part of plans to reduce the damage caused by climate change.

But nobody expects this bill, if passed, to signal the end of the electric vehicle market in the U.S.

Companies started to invest in EVs before the IRA was passed, and they will keep investing in them. There's a small but committed market for them now, and companies believe better batteries and cheaper vehicles will win over new fans.

And even if the U.S. leans away from electric vehicles, the rest of the world is leaning in. Companies don't want to be left behind — at least, not too far behind.

New state-by-state analysis released today by the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) warns that solar and storage jobs in every U.S. state could be axed if the House-passed bill becomes law.

States like California, Texas, Florida, and Illinois would be hit hardest, and the majority of job losses will be in states won by President Trump in 2024. Texas, the fastest-growing solar market in the country, stands to lose 34,100 jobs by 2030. And in Florida, which has enough solar capacity installed to power 2 million homes, nearly 22,000 jobs are on the chopping block.

“Lost jobs in every single state are a recipe for disaster for American families, businesses, and the U.S. economy,” said SEIA president and CEO Abigail Ross Hopper. “From Texas and California to Florida and Illinois, lawmakers will put Americans nationwide out of work if this legislation becomes law, plain and simple. Axing energy jobs means shuttered U.S. factories, canceled local investments, and energy shortfalls nationwide. We hope that U.S. Senators won’t let their constituents lose their livelihoods on their watch.”

The state-by-state analysis follows SEIA’s release of national-level data showing that 330,000 current and future jobs across the country could be at risk if the reconciliation bill is enacted without changes.

The analysis also found that the House-passed tax bill could trigger the closure or cancellation of 331 factories and erase $286 billion in local investment in American communities.

SEIA is urging Congress to revise the legislation to protect solar and storage investments and support American jobs, manufacturing, energy security, and consumer choice.

In addition, Americans deserve a government that works for all people—not just billionaires and fossil fuel executives.
To reduce asthma risks, protect public health, lower health care costs, and reduce productivity losses tied to poor health, Americans need a government that will improve environmental protections.","Introduction and summary

Asthma is a serious chronic lung disease that affects more than 26.8 million adults and 4.5 million children in the United States, harming people’s health and the U.S. economy.1 Asthma attacks can trigger coughing, wheezing, chest tightness, and gasping for breath, which interfere with everyday life, work, and school and may require emergency care.2 For Angela Garcia, a longtime resident of Globeville, a community in Denver, Colorado, that is surrounded by multiple sources of pollution, asthma is a constant worry. Garcia said: “Having to use an inhaler is a scary thing because you can’t breathe. I can walk outside and know I’m going to have to use it because of the smell that’s in the air.”3

Air pollution from fossil fuels, wildfire smoke, and hot days that cause smog to form is a leading trigger for asthma attacks, which is why eliminating fossil fuel combustion in cars and power plants alone could mean more than 2 million fewer asthma attacks by 2050, according to the American Lung Association.4 However, the Trump administration is pursuing policies that will worsen asthma in America, including an aggressive assault on environmental protections; the gutting of public health programs that support lifesaving asthma prevention, research, and care;5 and proposed pharmaceutical tariffs, which could increase the price of asthma medications by 13 percent or higher.6 The administration’s plan to roll back tailpipe and smokestack standards alone will likely cause more than 100 million asthma attacks over the next 25 years—or more than 10,000 asthma attacks daily—in the United States that could be avoided if the standards were left in place.7 Moreover, House Republican plans to drastically cut pollution reduction programs, clean energy incentives, and the Medicaid program—which covers critical health services for more than 71 million Americans—could compound these harms.8

This report analyzes how asthma affects Americans and how increasing pollution will cause people with asthma to experience more asthma attacks and more people to develop asthma. It also assesses the slew of actions by the Trump administration to weaken or eliminate environmental and climate protections that reduce pollution, to reverse the EPA’s scientific finding that planet-warming pollutants endanger Americans’ health and well-being and must be regulated, and to cancel funding to improve and monitor air quality and accelerate the adoption of clean energy and transportation. Lastly, it examines how the administration’s plans to eviscerate the U.S. public health system, including asthma prevention programs; the administration’s proposed pharmaceutical tariffs; and the House Republican plan to slash pollution reduction efforts, clean energy incentives, and essential health care coverage for low-income and working-class families will affect Americans with asthma and other pollution-related health conditions. Together, these actions would partially pay for tax cuts for billionaires and would increase pollution while boosting the profits of corporate polluters at the expense of American’s health.

Methodology

The data for the estimated number of asthma attacks were sourced from an Environmental Protection Network (EPN) analysis of the impacts of the Trump administration’s potential rollback of U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) standards.9 The EPN compiled EPA estimates of avoided asthma attacks from EPA Regulatory Impact Analyses for eight of the 12 EPA pollution standards for which asthma data were available that have been targeted by EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin for reconsideration or rollback. The EPN then tallied the sum of the EPA’s estimates for each of the eight standards and found that together, the standards would prevent 100,657,893 asthma attacks between 2025 and 2050 if left in place. If these standards are rolled back, it is expected that these asthma attacks would not be avoided. To estimate how many asthma attacks would not be avoided per day, the authors and the EPN divided 100,657,893 by 26 (2025 plus all the 25 total years through 2050) to arrive at an estimate of 3,871,457 attacks per year. They then divided this number by 365, the number of days in a year, to arrive at 10,606 attacks per day that could be avoided if the standards were left in place.

Air pollution is a leading cause of asthma

Asthma attacks can be life-threatening, interfere with everyday tasks, and may require emergency care, leading to millions of hospitalizations and averaging more than $50 billion in health care costs in the United States annually.10 Furthermore, children with asthma are more likely to miss school, disrupting their academic performance, and adults may be limited in their work productivity, even when taking medication.11 Asthma in the United States increased by about 10 million cases between 1990 and 2019.12 In 2018, 2.2 million children ages 5 to 17 missed 7.9 million school days due to asthma, and adults missed 10.9 million workdays13 These losses have economic ramifications: From 2008 to 2013, the average costs associated with asthma-related health care, deaths, and missed school and work days totaled $81.9 billion each year.14 While asthma affects millions of Americans, it hits children; older adults; and Black, Hispanic, Native American, and low-income communities the hardest.15

From 2008 to 2013, the average costs associated with asthma-related health care, deaths, and missed school and workdays totaled $81.9 billion each year.

Asthma causes inflamed airways that can flare into asthma attacks when exposed to environmental triggers, such as secondhand smoke, dust mites, and air pollution.16 According to the American Lung Association (ALA), despite decades of improvements in air quality, almost half of Americans—more than 156 million people—live with unhealthy levels of air pollution, an increase of nearly 25 million people in the past year and the highest number of people in roughly the last decade.17 The ALA found that more intense wildfires, extreme heat, and drought fueled by climate change are worsening air pollution throughout the country, putting the health of more Americans at risk. Americans’ exposure to ozone and soot pollution rose between 2021 and 2023, when Canada had its worst wildfire season on record.18 This increase in pollution is a departure from air quality trends that have steadily improved since the passage of the Clean Air Act of 1970—which authorized the federal government and states to limit pollution from industrial and mobile sources—and more recent lifesaving air pollution safeguards.19

Despite decades of improvements in air quality, almost half of Americans—more than 156 million people—live with unhealthy levels of air pollution.

Air pollutants, including ozone (smog or haze) and particle pollution (commonly called soot), can cause asthma and worsen asthma attacks.20 These pollutants also shorten lives and increase the risk of cancer, other lung diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), heart diseases such as heart attacks and strokes, premature birth, and other health conditions.21 When pollution surges, breathing unhealthy air can become a hazard, especially for children whose lungs are still developing.

Power plants, industrial facilities, diesel- and gas-powered vehicles and equipment, and other sources emit soot, nitrogen oxides, and sulfur oxides into the air.22 Soot can travel deep into the lungs and bloodstream, decreasing lung function and damaging heart health. It can harm vital organs such as the heart, brain, and cardiovascular system.23 Even short-term and low-level exposure to soot can worsen asthma attacks.24 Short-term exposure is linked to increased hospital admissions and emergency room visits for heart attacks and strokes, COPD, and increased likelihood of death in infants.25 Exposure to soot is estimated to cause more than 50,000 premature deaths in the United States every year.26

Ozone pollution also seriously affects lung function and can lead to premature death. It is linked to breathing problems, new cases of asthma in children, and increased hospitalizations and emergency department visits for people with asthma and COPD, among other health conditions.27

ALA’s 2025 “State of the Air” report found that more than 638,000 children and more than 3 million adults with asthma live in counties with failing grades on three air pollutants—ozone and two measures of fine particulate matter pollution.28

Air pollution is particularly harmful for working-class, Black, Hispanic, and low-income communities where pollution is often concentrated.29Black Americans are more likely than people of other races and ethnicities to live in areas with unhealthy air quality and be diagnosed with asthma.30 In 2021, the asthma death rate among Black Americans was more than twice as high as that for white Americans.

More than 26 million people of color live in counties that failed on all three measures of air pollution, including more than 15 million Hispanic Americans;31 Hispanic Americans are three times more likely than white Americans to live in a community with failing grades for all three air pollutants.32 According to Angela Garcia of Globeville, Colorado—a predominantly Hispanic and Latino neighborhood in Denver—people originally moved there to work for the railroad and the smelters to make money for their families. Garcia said: “We live here, we pay our taxes, we work hard. We give so much with our different cultures to the community to make it what it is—a good place to grow and exist.” At the same time, Garcia said, “We all have breathing problems. … It could be better if we didn’t have the pollutants that we have in our air.”33

Of those living in counties with a failing grade for at least one pollutant:

34M

are children under age 18

American Lung Association, “State of the Air 2025 Report.”

25M

are age 65 and older

Despite these troubling trends, the Trump administration is dismantling environmental protections at a staggering pace, with steep costs and consequences for Americans and their health.

The Trump administration’s harmful actions

Eliminating environmental protections will increase asthma and other health risks for Americans

Starting on his first day in office in his second term, Trump and his administration have orchestrated an aggressive assault on environmental and public health protections, as outlined in Project 2025 and promised by President Trump on the campaign trail to oil executives to pad their profits in exchange for campaign contributions.34 EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin has committed to strip away air quality standards for ozone, soot, and air toxics—as well as emission requirements for power plants, vehicles, coal waste, and oil refineries, among other safeguards—even though studies show that roughly 75 percent of Americans are worried about air and water pollution.35

Trump and his administration have orchestrated an aggressive assault on environmental and public health protections, as outlined in Project 2025 and promised by President Trump on the campaign trail to oil executives.

In addition, the Trump administration has offered power plants the opportunity to emit more toxic pollution by simply submitting an email request for a temporary exemption from clean air rules, including limits on mercury, which can damage the brain and nervous system and lead to severe developmental problems for children.36 The administration has also offered nearly 70 coal-fired power plants, including some of the nation’s top emitters of toxic air pollutants, two-year exemptions from EPA’s latest mercury and air toxics standards.37 Industry groups representing hundreds of chemical and petrochemical manufacturers have also requested exemptions from these rules.38 The EPA had projected that these standards would reduce asthma attacks and other asthma symptoms; brain, nervous system, and kidney damage; cancer; premature deaths; and other health problems among Americans.39

In another series of radical moves, President Trump issued an avalanche of executive orders (EOs) to eviscerate environmental protections, including an EO that directed agencies to review existing regulations and take immediate steps to repeal any they deem “unlawful.”40 The order also directs agencies to end or slow-walk enforcement of rules that do not align with this administration’s priorities. This unprecedented effort to erase or ignore existing scientifically backed safeguards that were established after years of research and public input could have an alarming effect on the health and safety of people and communities across the country.41 For example, the administration could target clean air and water protections, as detailed in Project 2025.42 Targeted protections could include the tailpipe emissions limits for cars and light-duty trucks and pollution standards for power plants, among other safeguards that protect Americans from the effects of climate change and harmful pollution that causes asthma and other health problems.43

To further accelerate its assault on environmental protections, the Trump administration directed agencies to “sunset” environmental regulations that affect energy production, including safeguards for air quality,44 as soon as October 2026.45 The idea to simply “delete” regulations has been touted by Elon Musk, the former head of the Department of Government Efficiency, whose companies have historically sparred with federal regulators over alleged violations of environmental protections.46 Legal experts predict that efforts to sunset and abruptly repeal regulations will run afoul of the Administrative Procedures Act, which requires a thorough and transparent process and public input for agencies to create, change, or cancel rules.47

The majority of American voters are concerned about climate change and say that it is already affecting weather in the United States, with two-thirds of voters expecting their community to be affected.48 In addition, a majority of American voters want federal agencies to do more than they are already doing to protect people from climate change health risks.49 Despite these concerns, the Trump administration has taken steps to overturn the EPA’s scientific finding that planet-warming pollutants endanger Americans’ health and well-being and must be regulated under the Clean Air Act.50 In April 2025, EPA Administrator Zeldin announced that the agency will reconsider the EPA’s endangerment finding—the backbone and legal foundation for nearly every climate and environmental safeguard enacted to curtail asthma-inducing pollution from power plants, cars, diesel trucks, and oil and gas operations.51 In May, The New York Times reported that internal EPA documents revealed the agency’s plans to eliminate all limits on greenhouse gas emissions from U.S. power plants that burn coal and natural gas.52 Reversing the science-based endangerment finding and emissions limits would boost the bottom line for big polluters while increasing pollution and causing more asthma and other health conditions, particularly in communities where pollution is concentrated.53 Overturning the endangerment finding would also increase the risk of more frequent and dangerous heat waves, more devastating and costly wildfires, and other extreme weather events that increase the pollution that causes asthma.54

The Trump administration has also canceled funding authorized by Congress through the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) and the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA) to reduce and monitor air pollution—despite multiple court orders to reinstate the funds.55 For example, the administration is canceling nearly 800 grants aimed at helping communities across the country improve air and water quality and protect against more extreme weather events.56 The administration has also canceled grants to improve access to trees and green spaces in urban areas, which can help to reduce air pollution and make neighborhoods cooler, healthier, and more resilient to heat waves made worse by climate change.57 As Angela Garcia said: “A community-based organization [in Globeville] had received funds under the Biden administration to put trees and natural grasses on both sides of the highway, to help alleviate the pollution. We found out a month ago that that funding is going to be cut.”58

The Trump Administration’s Cancellation of Funding for Environmental Protections Endangers Americans’ Health While Draining Their Wallets

The Trump Administration’s Cancellation of Funding for Environmental Protections Endangers Americans’ Health While Draining Their Wallets

Cathleen Kelly, Jasia Smith

The House Republicans’ budget plan would take these actions a step further by eliminating funding for key IRA programs designed to monitor and reduce harmful pollution in communities—sacrificing Americans’ health to partially pay for tax cuts that primarily benefit the wealthy.59

The Trump administration has also eliminated the EPA’s environmental justice and science and research offices while instating fossil fuel and chemical industry insiders and lobbyists in leadership positions.60 It additionally committed to ending enforcement action against major polluters in communities of color that are unfairly bombarded with dangerous pollution if the aim of the action is to protect against climate change or if the enforcement could “shut down” energy production.61 To further undermine the EPA, President Trump and Administrator Zeldin plan to slash the agency’s budget by 65 percent, which would make itimpossible for the agency to fulfill its mission to protect public health and the environment.62

All of these actions would increase pollution while boosting the profits of corporate polluters at the expense of Americans’ health. According to the EPN, if implemented, these rapid rollbacks would cause more than 10,000 asthma attacks daily—or more than 100 million asthma attacks over the next 25 years—in communities across the country that could be avoided if the standards were left in place. (see Table 1)63

TABLE 1

Canceling clean energy investments will worsen asthma among Americans and increase energy costs

Alongside its efforts to gut pollution standards and cut funding to monitor and improve air quality, the Trump administration is also working to end federal investments in clean energy, which would otherwise reduce pollution and, thus, asthma.64 Issued on the first day of Trump’s second term as president, Executive Order 14154 directs federal agencies to freeze funding for IRA and IIJA clean energy programs. These include the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund, which would help more than 900,000 working-class and lower-income households access the benefits of solar energy, and the Home Energy Rebates program, which assists families in making home energy efficiency improvements to save money on their electricity bills, improve indoor air quality, and reduce asthma risks in their homes.65 The Trump administration has assembled a list of 300 clean energy projects funded by the U.S. Department of Energy to potentially eliminate.66 Examples include household solar installations and energy efficiency projects that would reduce demand on power plants, decreasing particulate pollution and ground-level ozone concentrations.67

Increasing household electricity costs

Eliminating clean energy and energy efficiency programs would have significant economic ramifications for families. The U.S. Department of Energy estimates that home appliance updates made possible by the Home Energy Rebates program would save families up to $1 billion annually.68 Despite these benefits, the Trump administration’s funding freeze denies families needed support to cut their energy costs and improve their homes’ energy efficiency and indoor air quality, as well as their health and safety.69 In addition, the House Republican budget bill would essentially repeal the IRA’s clean energy incentives and could cause annual home electric bills to jump $110 by 2026.70These moves come on top of a host of other actions taken by the Trump administration that will raise electricity costs for consumers, such as imposing tariffs on key electrical components and encouraging ratepayer subsidization of new data centers.71

Cutting clean energy and energy efficiency programs will compound the financial and health struggles that too many American families face—many of which are deeply interconnected. Across the country, 33 million families experience energy insecurity, 4.9 million lack basic heating, and 6.3 million lack air conditioning.72 As climate change makes extreme weather more common, American families will face higher asthma risks from stifling heat and cold as well as from dry air, which can trigger asthma attacks. They will also face higher energy bills as their heating and cooling needs soar.73In fact, extreme heat causes more death and injury than any other weather phenomena in the United States, creating $1 billion in health care costs every summer.74

Over the past two years, even before the Trump administration attempted to withhold IRA funds that Congress obligated, Republicans in Congress made repeated attempts to overturn the IRA, voting 54 times to do so.75 Recently, House Republicans passed a budget bill that would functionally do the same.76 Repealing the IRA would not only prevent the funding described above from reaching Americans but would also discontinue incentives for clean energy that are essential to lowering energy costs and decreasing asthma-inducing air pollution by reducing reliance on fossil fuels.

Meanwhile, the administration has also taken unprecedented steps that have propped up corporate polluters and promoted fossil fuels.77 For example, President Trump issued an EO mandating agencies to bail out the coal industry, which has been in decline for decades, by opening federal lands to coal leasing and attempting to extend the operating life of coal plants to keep them running as long as possible.78The EO also directs agencies to review and consider weakening or canceling regulations, programs, and incentives that support the transition away from coal use—the dirtiest and most carbon-intensive fossil fuel—to clean renewable energy.79 An Energy Innovation study found that renewable energy, such as wind and solar, would provide cheaper energy than 99 percent of coal plants.80 Coal plants are not only cost inefficient, they are dangerous. Researchers at Harvard University, George Mason University, and the University of Texas, Austin, found that soot pollution from coal plants has killed a ‘’staggering’’ number of Americans—460,000 between 1999 and 2020.81

These actions come at a time when power demand is expected to rapidly increase due to demand from artificial intelligence-focused data centers.82 If cleaner technologies are not available to supply power to these data center projects, it is estimated that existing facilities and new build-outs in the United States could cause an additional 600,000 asthma cases and 1,300 premature deaths in 2030.83

Freezing funds for clean transportation will increase pollution

Eliminating environmental protections and freezing funding for energy efficiency, community solar, and wind projects are not the only Trump administration actions that will increase pollution and, as a result, asthma. The transportation sector is one of the most significant sources of air pollution because combustion engine vehicles emit pollution directly into densely populated environments and therefore have an outsize impact on public health. This is especially true of medium and heavy-duty trucks and buses, which are far more likely to use diesel engines.84 Diesel-powered heavy-duty vehicles make up less than 10 percent of vehicles on U.S. roads but are responsible for 20 percent of vehicle nitrogen oxide and 25 percent of vehicle soot emissions, two major contributors to asthma.85Diesel exhaust is also known to contain at least 40 cancer-causing substances.86 In 2010, roughly 18 percent of all new childhood asthma cases wereestimated to be attributable to nitrogen dioxide pollution, most of which comes from transportation.87 Electrifying transportation is an efficient way to reduce pollution from the sector and therefore decrease the risk of asthma.

Despite these dangers, the Trump administration has wasted no time trying to freeze federal programs to electrify heavy-duty trucks. Executive Order 14154 directed the EPA to freeze funding through the IRA and IIJA’s Clean Ports, Clean School Bus, and Clean Heavy-Duty Vehicles programs.88 These programs supported the electrification of heavy-duty vehicles that have a significant impact, such as school buses that carry kids through communities every school day and port drayage trucks that move thousands of containers around and through port-side communities.89 The ALA estimates that electrifying all new heavy-duty vehicles by 2040, alongside 100 percent clean electricity generation, would prevent 1.75 million asthma attacks by 2050.90

The Trump administration has also attacked efforts to electrify passenger cars and trucks by attempting to pause funding under the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure program.91 While emitting less per vehicle than heavy-duty trucks, passenger vehicles still contribute significantly to asthma. The ALA estimates that moving to 100 percent electrified passenger vehicle sales and 100 percent clean electricity generation by 2035 would prevent 2.2 million asthma attacks by 2050.92

To take these actions even further, House Republicans’ budget plan would rapidly phase out IRA tax credits for clean vehicles; functionally eliminate a critical clean energy manufacturing tax credit; and rescind unspent funding for grants supporting the electrification of heavy-duty trucking, port operations, and school buses.93 In addition, it would add a $250 registration fee for electric vehicles and a $100 registration fee for hybrid vehicles—punishing Americans who switch to vehicles that are less reliant on gasoline.94 The House Republican budget bill would also raise gasoline prices by 25 cents to 37 cents per gallon by 2035 as demand for oil increases due to the bill’s termination of federal electric vehicle affordability programs, fuel economy standards, and tailpipe emission standards. 95

Furthermore, on May 22, Senate Republicans improperly voted through three Congressional Review Act (CRA) resolutions targeting California’s vehicle emission standards, functionally breaking the chamber’s own rules by evading the Senate parliamentarian’s ruling that California’s standards are not subject to the CRA. As noted by more than 100 public health and environmental organizations, overturning California’s standards will lead to “more children suffering asthma attacks and missing school, more grandparents dying prematurely, and more death and destruction from extreme weather.”96

Cutting funds for asthma prevention, education, and treatment will increase asthma complications

Among the programs and staff gutted by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. are programs to address asthma, smoking, and tuberculosis, even though he claims that reducing chronic disease is a priority.97

Housed within the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the National Center for Environmental Health (NCEH) includes a variety of education, research, and prevention programs designed to reduce the harms of asthma.98 Gutting the NCEH—including its support for state and local health departments—will diminish public health protections from environmental hazards such as air pollution, climate change, and chemical exposures. These cuts affect the following programs that reduce asthma risks for Americans:

The National Asthma Control Program and its work to reduce asthma-related deaths, hospitalizations, and emergency department visits by promoting policies to reduce air pollution. This includes supporting communities, schools, and families in identifying asthma triggers, managing asthma, and improving asthma health care by providing health care providers and schools with evidence-based treatment guidelines.99 From 1999 through 2018, this program helped reduce asthma-related death rates by more than 45 percent, saving $71 in health care costs and lost income for every dollar spent.100 Experts predict that cuts will leave schools less prepared to support students with asthma, which could lead to more hospitalizations and emergency department visits, poorer health, preventable deaths, and higher health care costs.101

The Climate and Health Program, which supports state and local health departments in identifying and preparing for climate-related health threats, including wildfires and other extreme weather events that lower air quality and trigger asthma.102 Efforts to help states identify the most at-risk populations and communities have also been cut.

The Office on Smoking and Health, which works to identify trends in tobacco product use, which exacerbates asthma.103 Public education campaigns and support to those who want to quit smoking have also been cut.104 These cuts threaten to unwind progress in reducing smoking rates among adults and teens.

The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, which identifies, prevents, and reduces occupational asthma and respiratory hazards in the workplace.105 Even with some recent staff reinstatements, sweeping layoffs have significantly hampered federal efforts to protect the respiratory health of firefighters, medical providers, and construction workers, among others.106

The Trump administration has also cut and undermined regulation and enforcement of tobacco products, which are known asthma triggers reducing protections against chronic diseases.107

In addition, the administration is expected to slash funding for the Department of Housing and Urban Development—including millions of dollars in funding for projects that improve housing energy efficiency, indoor air quality, and climate resilience—despite evidence that poor housing quality affects asthma.108 The administration’s cuts at the National Institutes of Health threaten research on asthma, translation of research into strategies to reduce disease, support for effective asthma treatments, and education and outreach to help people with asthma stay healthy.109

DOGE Cuts by City, State, and Congressional District

Will Ragland

These cuts come at a time of rising asthma rates and costs. As noted above, asthma in the United States increased by about 10 million cases between 1990 and 2019, with an average annual cost of approximately $82 billion from 2008 to 2013.110 The Trump administration cuts to asthma and tobacco prevention programs and other federal programs focusing on air pollution and worker health and safety are expected to lead to more avoidable hospitalizations and emergency department visits, poorer quality air, higher health care costs, and poorer health outcomes.111

Medicaid cuts could dramatically reduce the ability of working-class families to pay for health care appointments, medicine such as inhalers, and emergency care if needed.

Although asthma can be controlled with proper medical care and other precautions, it cannot be cured,112 and thus access to quality health care is critical. Yet at the same time that the Trump administration is increasing pollution and is cutting asthma-related prevention, outreach, and education programs, House Republicans’ budget bill includes historic cuts to the Medicaid program—threatening access to asthma care for millions of children and adults.113 Medicaid and the Children’s Health Insurance Program cover health care costs for almost half of all children with asthma in the United States, and Medicaid also covers costs for many adults with asthma.114 Adults under age 65 with Medicaid or other public insurance coverage are about twice as likely to have asthma compared with those covered by private insurance.115 Approximately 1 in 10 children and adults covered by the Medicaid program have asthma.116 Therefore, Medicaid cuts could dramatically reduce the ability of working-class families to pay for health care appointments, medicine such as inhalers, and emergency care if needed.

Congressional Republicans’ Proposals To Slash Medicaid Could Cost Tens of Thousands of Lives

Natasha Murphy, Andrea Ducas

These moves are compounded by the Trump administration’s proposed pharmaceutical tariffs, which, if enacted, could drive up the cost of asthma medications, cause medication shortages, and slow research and development of new asthma treatments.117 The Budget Lab at Yale found that a 25 percent tariff would raise prescription medication prices by an average of 15 percent, with increases likely to be passed on to individuals and families.118 Another study commissioned by a U.S. pharmaceutical lobby group predicted an average price increase of roughly 13 percent, not including the impact of potential retaliatory tariffs.119 This could mean that the average retail price of an albuterol inhaler, a commonly used asthma medication, at slightly more than $98 in 2024, would climb by roughly $13 to about $111 or higher.120

Conclusion

The Trump administration is aggressively rolling back environmental protections and cutting funds for asthma research and prevention, even as half of Americans are breathing unhealthy air and climate disasters are worsening air quality.Health experts warn that stripping away environmental safeguards will have dangerous consequences, including increasing harmful air pollution, threatening Americans’ health, and increasing cases of asthma and asthma attacks.121 As President Trump breaks his promise to deliver “the cleanest air and water on the planet” and his administration’s tariffs threaten to increase medication prices and limit availability—alongside House Republicans’ plan to eliminate clean energy incentives and funding for pollution reduction programs and rip away health care coverage for millions—more children and adults will gasp for breath.122 These moves will worsen all Americans’ health and quality of life, but they will have the greatest impact on people with asthma and in places where pollution levels are the highest.123

“Our most vulnerable and our most valuable, our children and our elders, deserve so much better,” said Garcia. “We need and deserve a government that works for everyone, not just large corporate developers, not just polluters, not just the rich.”124

We need and deserve a government that works for everyone, not just large corporate developers, not just polluters, not just the rich. Angela Garcia

Americans need a government that will strengthen and accelerate actions to protect their health, not strip away clean air and public health safeguards. In addition, Americans deserve a government that works for all people—not just billionaires and fossil fuel executives. To reduce asthma risks, protect public health, lower health care costs, and reduce productivity losses tied to poor health, Americans need a government that will improve environmental protections. An administration that truly wants to make America healthy could implement strong pollution standards, expand access to clean renewable energy, incentivize clean energy storage to replace fossil-fueled peaker plants, and prevent the permitting or expansion of fossil fuel projects and polluting industrial facilities in communities already struggling to cope with the health risks tied to pollution.125 An administration committed to protecting Americans’ health and safety could also ensure cool and healthy homes for all by investing in efficient and cost-effective heat pump air conditioning and programs to lower household electricity costs, reduce pollution, and protect low-income and working-class families from dangerous heat.126

These actions—along with adequately and sustainably supporting asthma prevention, education, and treatment—are essential to protect public health; control preventable disease; and safeguard the right of all Americans to breathe clean air, drink clean water, and live in healthy communities. The Trump administration’s agenda to abandon environmental and public health protections would rob everyday Americans of this right and threaten their health, lives, and economic security—all to let big polluters off the hook and boost their own bottom lines.127

The One Big Beautiful Bill, President Donald Trump’s budget wishlist with tax cuts for the wealthy, could have an enormous impact on Virginia’s ability to address the climate crisis, produce renewable energy, and generate economic activity for its communities.

The bill, passed by House congressional Republicans May 22, effectively kills several investment and production tax credits in the Inflation Reduction Act, former President Joe Biden’s signature climate law.

According to an analysis of information from various websites, including the Clean Investment Monitor, E2, and Weseley, almost 70 projects in the districts of Republican representatives from Virginia — worth $18.2 billion in investments and creating almost 11,000 jobs — have used those credits. The U.S. Congress Joint Economic Committee found 21,642 jobs in Virginia had been announced as a result of the IRA.

The One Big Beautiful Bill’s provisions would require projects seeking to use the tax credits to be under construction within 60 days of enactment of the legislation, and be producing electricity for the grid by 2028. Nuclear sources would still be given a timeline of needing to start construction by 2031 in order to receive a production tax credit.

It’s not immediately clear how the bill would impact all those projects in Virginia, since some of them are operating and under construction. But Mike Town, executive director of the Virginia League of Conservation Voters, asked rhetorically: ​“Will this bill, if passed by the Senate and signed into law, absolutely harm clean energy development and manufacturing across the country?”

His answer: ​“Yes. Unquestionably.”

But all, he believes, is not lost. Virginia has a clean energy policy, known as the Virginia Clean Economy Act, to transition to zero-carbon sources by midcentury, Town said, ​“and the clean energy industry existed before the IRA, and it will continue to exist afterwards.”

The One Big Beautiful Bill is the product of what Trump promised and Republicans have long lobbied for — repealing the IRA and cutting back other social services. But, noting goals to have affordable electricity for growing domestic needs, several House Republicans, including U.S. Rep. Jen Kiggans, who represents the Norfolk area, signed a March 9 letter supporting the preservation of IRA tax credits. Any modifications, they wrote, ​“risk sparking an energy crisis in our country, resulting in drastically higher power bills for American families.”

While the IRA spurred development of renewable energy around the country, Kiggans represents Virginia’s coastal area where Dominion Energy is constructing the nation’s largest offshore wind project, called Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind, or CVOW. And the state has spent more than a decade making the region an offshore wind manufacturing hub for the entire East Coast.

LS GreenLink, a Korean company manufacturing subsea cables to connect offshore wind electricity to the grid, is planning on using IRA production tax credits as part of its investment of $680 million in the region, creating jobs and receiving cheers from Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin, a conservative Republican.

“It’s not free money, we have to earn it,” Managing Director Patrick Y. Shim told Inside Climate News during a groundbreaking in April. ​“It’s one of the reasons why we chose … the location.”

Kiggans still voted for the One Big Beautiful Bill, citing support for Trump’s 2017 tax cuts for the wealthy, but said in a statement she ​“remains deeply concerned about other shortsighted provisions.”

“We should be strengthening, not undermining, the clean energy tools that support our economy, power our military, and keep costs down for working families,” Kiggans said.

Conversely, several other congressional Republicans, including U.S. Rep Ben Cline from Virginia’s rural Shenandoah Valley, signed a letter seeking full repeal of the IRA tax credits, stating not doing so could ​“jeopardize” extension of Trump’s tax cuts ​“as well as the President’s other tax priorities.”

Despite tax credits in the IRA shoring up domestic supply chains, including manufacturing of modules for solar panels, Cline, who voted for the One Big Beautiful Bill, said in a statement that Biden’s law ​“promotes projects that increase our dependence on foreign supply chains.”

U.S. Rep. Rob Wittman, a Republican representing the Richmond suburbs, the Hampton Roads area, and the so-called Northern Neck, pointed to an online statement and said ​“he continues to advocate for clean energy through his role as vice chairman of the House Natural Resources Committee,” according to a spokesperson (though the statement makes no specific mention of the investment tax credits). He, too, voted for the One Big Beautiful Bill.

Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill is now in the hands of the Republican-controlled Senate, and members of both sides of the aisle have indicated there could be substantial rewrites before going back to the House and then, Trump hopes, back to his desk for signing. In advance of the May 22 House vote, Virginia’s two Democratic senators, Mark Warner and Tim Kaine, released a statement saying, ​“We must protect the investments that are creating jobs and lowering costs for Virginians.”

According to a state report released in 2024, Virginia received $36 billion in investment from data centers across 2022 and 2023, $24 billion of which was equipment and software that received sales-tax exemptions. And worldwide, the fossil fuel industry received $7 trillion, or 7.1% of GDP in 2022, in subsidies, according to the International Monetary Fund.

Virginia is at the forefront of surging energy demands from the proliferation of data centers. PJM Interconnection, the regional grid serving Virginia, projects summer demand to increase from over 185 gigawatts across its territory to almost 225 GW, said Asim Z. Haque Sr., PJM’s senior vice president of governmental and member services, at a recent Virginia Commission on Electric Utility Regulation meeting.

At a time when more electricity generation is needed for the grid, the ones that are ​“ready to go, the vast majority of those projects are advanced energy. They are solar, they are wind, they are battery storage,” said Harry Godfrey, managing director of Advanced Energy United.

“The answer is unequivocal, if you pull back on these tax policies, it raises costs to consumers,” Godfrey said, referencing a Clean Energy Buyers Association analysis that found removing the tax credits provided under the IRA increases residential electricity costs in Virginia by 5.4%. ​“These are means of helping continue accelerate the development” of the clean energy that’s more affordable than fossil fuels, ​“and lower the costs to consumers.”

Solar and storage stalling out?

Virginia is a net importer of electricity, meaning it relies on other states to generate power and deliver it through transmission lines to meet peak demand at times, which the weekend of June 22 last year reached 21.4 gigawatts in Dominion’s service territory.

But given local pushback against solar and storage projects in Virginia, PJM permitting, and supply chain issues, the One Big Beautiful Bill’s new timelines are a ​“big deal,” said Skyler Zunk, co-founder and CEO of Energy Right, a solar advocacy group rooted in conservative principles.

“This essentially would make them all have to go back and refinance completely. That’s essentially pulling the rug out from under very mature projects that have just not started construction,” said Zunk. ​“This is very important for AI, advanced computing, advanced transportation growth. This bill would be bigger and more beautiful if it truly kept the incentives in place to produce more electrons domestically.”

Zunk pointed to an Energix solar and storage project, and a Dominion Energy solar project, both in Brunswick County, that could generate 200 and 300 megawatts, respectively. The projects had been approved at the local level but still need a state permit, a cultural resource survey, and a geotechnical analysis, meaning ​“it’s going to be probably a year or more before either of those start construction. Those two would be really affected.”

For those who want fossil-fuel forms of energy production, natural-gas turbines are experiencing years of delay from supply chain issues, energy developers have stated. And small modular nuclear reactors aren’t likely to come online until the 2030s and may get hurt by the One Big Beautiful Bill wiping out a provision to allow the transferring, or purchasing, of tax credits to investors who want to wipe out their own tax liability, which allows smaller investors to take more risk on emerging technologies, Godfrey said.

The Virginia Clean Economy Act also has targets for Dominion Energy to build out 16.1 gigawatts of solar and storage and wind generation technologies. The utility and Appalachian Power Company, which operates under American Electric Power Company and serves rural southwest Virginia, must acquire 100% carbon-free generation portfolios by 2050 through a mix of utility and privately-owned resources.

Dominion Energy did not respond to a request for comment, but in a regulatory filing detailed several IRA and bipartisan infrastructure law funding mechanisms it has applied for while stating, ​“any incremental credit that the Company receives as a result of the IRA will be passed on to customers through lower project costs.”

Appalachian Power, which is facing rising energy bills and a dwindling customer base, said in a statement, ​“We are continuing to engage members of the Senate as they consider what has been proposed by the House.”

Offshore wind on track?

President Trump has been critical of offshore wind projects, but Virginia has been bullish on the technology since the creation of the Offshore Wind Development Board in 2010.

Gov. Youngkin has touted Dominion’s Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind project as ​“on-time and on-budget,” when it cost $9.8 billion before any recent increases. CEO Bob Blue reiterated in an earnings call earlier this month that project, which would generate about 2.6 gigawatts of electricity, enough to power about 660,000 homes and avoid the emissions equivalent of about a million cars annually, ​“let me be clear, CVOW remains one of the most affordable sources of energy for our customers.”

But Blue also shared that Trump’s tariffs, if continued through 2026 when the project is expected to fully come online, would have a ​“cumulative tariff impact” of ​“approximately $500 million.”

Following a $900 million increase earlier this year from PJM interconnection costs and actual tariff costs accrued so far and projected through the end of June this year, the project’s cost has risen to $10.8 billion. Because of a settlement agreement between the company and environmental and ratepayer advocates to ensure protections for any shortfalls in electricity production and cost overruns, 50% of the cost increase will be borne by ratepayers.

Dominion initially sought in November to recover $11.23 a month from a residential customer using 1,000 kilowatt-hours for CVOW costs before customers could begin receiving credits from the project in later years after it comes online. The costs include 9.35% and 9.7% profit margins for the last rate period and the current one, respectively. But the PJM and tariff costs increases for the project equate to an additional about $0.48 monthly increase for those residential customers.

“It is worth noting CVOW was not an IRA project; it was in the pipeline well before the IRA was passed. We felt it made economic sense without that,” Bill Murray, Dominion senior vice president of corporate affairs and communications, said during the Virginia commission meeting. The production tax credits, he added, ​“certainly help mitigate customer costs … but our read of what passed the U.S. House … is that the CVOW project itself would not be affected.”

Manufacturing halted?

Farther southwest in the deep red districts of Griffith and McGuire, jobs are hard to come by.

The region, largely beholden to coal, has made efforts to use federal government Abandoned Mine Land Economic Revitalization funds, which sought another round of applications in March for $11 million.

Peter Finocchio, Youngkin’s spokesperson, also touted the Trump administration and Virginia’s efforts on nuclear, including what could be the first nuclear fusion plant in the world and ​“several active Small Modular Reactor projects in the works.” Called SMRs for short, small modular reactors can produce 300 megawatts of electricity and are being looked at as a way to provide carbon-free 24/7 baseload power, though critics question if the technology can be affordable.

Godfrey, with Advanced Energy United, wondered what losing the clean energy purchasing credits may do to the Volvo plant’s sales.

“I think it’s really important for policymakers to take into account the impact of pulling back on some of those demand-side drivers in the form of tax credits, like for clean commercial vehicles,” said Godfrey. ​“I don’t know whether folks in the ninth district are driving those vehicles, but I know they’re making them. If we undercut the clean commercial vehicles incentive, does that continue? I don’t know.”",https://img.canarymedia.com/content/uploads/solar-virginia.jpeg?auto=compress%2Cformat&crop=focalpoint&fit=crop&fp-x=0.5&fp-y=0.5&h=630&q=82&w=1200&s=0431bbe6d080dd936771223ae53169f1,N,,2025-06-03 05:00:06.086534

Yet critics are questioning the law’s definition of ​“base load” generating facilities: It only covers electricity sources that run primarily on nonrenewable fuels such as natural gas or nuclear.
HB 15 will still allow settlements with special deals, as long as terms are part of the public record, there’s no cash payment, and they do not close or limit ​“base load” electricity-generating facilities.
The ​“base load” provisions weren’t part of HB 15 as it originally passed the House, nor were they in the initial versions of the companion Senate bill, SB 2.
Yet electricity from coal and nuclear plants remains relatively expensive, compared to that from renewables or natural gas.","A decade ago, the Sierra Club and other environmental groups, trade organizations, and companies found themselves in a regulatory standoff with American Electric Power over operating costs for six coal-fired power plants in Ohio.

The utility’s opponents objected to letting the company collect more money from customers to keep the unprofitable plants running, while the utility argued the charges were a hedge against even higher costs.

Before state regulators made a decision, the utility and some of its opponents announced a compromise. As part of the deal, the Sierra Club would drop its opposition in exchange for AEP’s commitment to add more solar and wind to its portfolio as well as move up its timeline for closing or converting several coal plants to natural gas.

A Sierra Club representative at the time described it as ​“nowhere near a perfect deal” but as one that would significantly reduce carbon emissions and accelerate the state’s clean energy transition.

Such compromises will now be prohibited in Ohio under a new state law that forbids settlements involving the closure of ​“base load” power plants.

Proponents of House Bill 15, signed by Republican Gov. Mike DeWine in mid-May, say it will support the state’s ever-growing power needs and promote competition within its energy sector.

Yet critics are questioning the law’s definition of ​“base load” generating facilities: It only covers electricity sources that run primarily on nonrenewable fuels such as natural gas or nuclear. The definition excludes wind or solar power, even when combined with battery storage.

Utility settlements have been a part of regulatory process

Negotiating special deals in settlements has long been common in utility regulatory cases. Industry groups or companies have gotten discounts and other benefits in return for dropping opposition to utilities’ added charges. Parties in court cases often settle before trial, too.

For example, the same year that the Sierra Club reached a settlement with AEP, a trade group representing industrial customers negotiated a special rate with FirstEnergy’s Ohio utilities in exchange for dropping opposition to a customer-funded bailout of that company’s unprofitable coal and nuclear plants. (The secret terms of that agreement were part of a criminal case filed last year against Ohio’s former chief utility regulator, Sam Randazzo. They also became part of a House Bill 6-related regulatory case on which regulators will finally hear evidence this month.)

HB 15 will still allow settlements with special deals, as long as terms are part of the public record, there’s no cash payment, and they do not close or limit ​“base load” electricity-generating facilities.

Neil Waggoner, who heads the Sierra Club’s Beyond Coal campaign for the Midwest region, suspects the provision is likely a backlash to the environmental group’s 2015 settlement with AEP.

That deal didn’t end up delivering all of the expected clean energy benefits. State rules requiring wind turbines to be a certain distance from other properties ultimately made it impossible for AEP to add the planned 500 megawatts of wind generation, and the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio refused to allow the utility to charge customers the cost of building 400 MW of solar energy.

The ​“base load” provisions weren’t part of HB 15 as it originally passed the House, nor were they in the initial versions of the companion Senate bill, SB 2. The language appeared in a substitute version of SB 2 introduced on March 11, the same day that Ed Spiker, chair of the Ohio Coal Association, submitted written testimony pleading the state to enact ​“guardrails to ensure current coal power plants are not forced to close.”

The terms used in SB 2 included natural gas and nuclear in the definition of a ​“base load electric generating facility” but not renewables. The Senate then added the provisions to HB 15 before passing it this spring.

Law reflects desire to protect fossil fuels and nuclear

The law suggests Republicans’ continuing willingness to prop up conventional power plants, even when their electricity may cost more than cleaner sources of power.

“How would you replace base load power generation, given the amount of megawatts that they produce that we certainly require?” Sen. Jerry Cirino, R-Kirtland, challenged one witness who spoke against nuclear power plants during a March 11 hearing held by the Senate Energy Committee.

Yet electricity from coal and nuclear plants remains relatively expensive, compared to that from renewables or natural gas.

Ashley Brown, a former state utility regulator, questioned the constitutionality of the new settlement restrictions. ​“I don’t know how they can tell somebody you can’t shut down a plant,” he told Canary Media.

Two weeks ago, the Trump administration ordered a retiring Michigan coal plant to stay open, although it’s unclear whether the mandate will face a court challenge. Separately, regional grid operator PJM Interconnection has sometimes issued orders to keep power-generation facilities running to maintain grid reliability, as it did for former FirstEnergy coal plants. In that case, however, the company was paid to keep the plants open.

Waggoner noted that HB 15’s language only applies to settlements. Its terms wouldn’t stop a company from closing an unprofitable plant on its own accord.

HB 15 also finally revokes subsidies for two 1950s-era coal plants, which had been put in place by HB 6, the 2019 law at the heart of an ongoing public corruption scandal in Ohio. Yet Beth Nagusky, an adjunct law professor at Case Western Reserve University, wonders whether the provision preventing settlements that close ​“base load” power plants is meant to lay the groundwork for new subsidies down the road for nuclear and coal plants, which might become involved in regulatory or judicial cases.

“I don’t think that’s even being hidden,” Waggoner said. Along the same lines, environmental groups have criticized laws from 2023 and 2024 that include natural gas and nuclear power in the state’s definition of ​“green energy.”

As Waggoner sees it, utilities and policymakers who claim to be worried about maintaining enough ​“base load” or ​“dispatchable” electricity are concerned less about real reliability issues and more about minimizing the importance of renewable energy in the face of climate change, even when renewables are paired with storage.

“They’re looking at how do you frame this argument so you’re not just saying, ​‘We don’t want renewables,’” Waggoner said. ​“They’re trying to find a way to justify what they want, as opposed to what the moment demands.”",https://img.canarymedia.com/content/uploads/Kyger-creek-ohio_2025-06-02-200902_bmkw.jpeg?auto=compress%2Cformat&crop=focalpoint&fit=crop&fp-x=0.5&fp-y=0.5&h=630&q=82&w=1200&s=8cf7f0bafaab21026aa72f8639b522d3,N,,2025-06-03 06:08:43.491103

Garrett Royer, political director for the Colorado chapter of the Sierra Club, said the budget reconciliation package would endanger Colorado's clean air and water, fast-track reckless oil and gas development and raise costs on working families, all to give more tax cuts and handouts to billionaires and corporate polluters.

""This is a highly destructive bill that's going to threaten thousands of Colorado's jobs by gutting investments in clean energy, especially in rural and vulnerable parts of the state,"" Royer contended.

One of Trump's central campaign promises was to repeal climate action written into President Joe Biden's Inflation Reduction Act. The bill currently before the Senate would gut clean energy tax credits and investments, expedite drilling and eliminate public health protections from tailpipe, methane and other pollution. The administration said these moves are necessary for the U.S. to achieve energy dominance.

Royer noted since its passage, the Inflation Reduction Act has sparked $560 million in investments in Colorado clean-energy projects and created more than 3,700 jobs. He argued reversing course would blunt efforts to bring less expensive solar and wind power onto the grid and Colorado working families and businesses will be on the hook for the higher costs of oil and gas.

""The best way that we achieve global energy dominance, if that's truly what the goal of the Trump administration is, would be to invest in as many energy solutions as possible, rather than only advocating for the most expensive forms of energy,"" Royer emphasized.

A coalition of nonprofits and 16 states are taking the Trump administration to court for freezing $5 billion in funds already allocated to build out electric vehicle charging stations every 50 miles on major corridors across all 50 states. According to the American Lung Association, a large-scale transition to EVs could save more than $1 trillion in health costs, and result in 110,000 avoided deaths.

Conservation groups are pushing back on a timber industry lawsuit brought against the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, seeking to remove Northern Spotted Owl protections across millions of acres in Oregon, California, and Washington.

The industry aims to reinstate a rollback from President Donald Trump's first term, opening 3.5 million acres of habitat to logging.

Nick Cady, legal director for the advocacy group Cascadia Wildlands, one of the intervening groups, said the owl remains protected under the Endangered Species Act.

""It's a way for them to bypass public processes and processes for designating critical habitat,"" Cady explained. ""It goes through scientific review and public comment, and they're trying to just shortcut that whole thing and just sweep this all under the rug.""

The American Forest Resource Council, a plaintiff in the lawsuit, said barred owls and wildfires pose the biggest threats to Northern Spotted Owls, not logging. Cady argues habitat protections are essential to prevent extinction, adding he is optimistic about the legal challenge.

Joe Liebezeit, statewide conservation director for the Bird Alliance of Oregon, said protecting spotted owl habitat safeguards clean water for millions, as unchecked logging increases sediment, damaging water quality. He added preserving the forests also supports Oregon's economy.

""If we have healthy forests that have trail systems that people want to go to and visit that have these old mature trees, that's going to generate money for tourism,"" Liebezeit pointed out.

Liebezeit argued there is no reason why the timber industry needs to take away from spotted owl habitat, adding they have plenty of other national forest land to log.

""Every year, the industry makes millions and millions of dollars from logging areas that are not critical habitat.""

In 2020 the Forest Service found Northern Spotted Owls should be classified as endangered rather than threatened. Cady emphasized the agency has yet to provide stronger protections for the species.

Minnesota has its own carbon emissions reduction goals in place but under a changing federal Environmental Protection Agency, it is an open question how stalled pollution enforcement will affect the Great Lakes region.

The Trump administration and congressional Republicans are taking steps to limit the reach of the EPA, including loosening regulations for laws like the Clean Air Act, along with staffing cuts. Watchdogs said new federal cases targeting pollution violators have ground to a halt.

Howard Learner, executive director of the Environmental Law and Policy Center and a former environmental crimes prosecutor who worked under both Republican and Democratic leadership, said it is unusual.

""The environmental laws require EPA, working with the states, to protect the environment,"" Learner explained. ""Those laws apply regardless of who the president is.""

States can try to fill gaps but Uhlmann noted history has shown the federal government sets the tone in going after violators. He argued diminished enforcement hurts communities' health and creates a competitive disadvantage for companies complying with federal orders. The agency's new leaders have said overhauls save taxpayers money and align with the President's promise to ""unleash American energy.""

Minnesota is one of six states in the EPA's Region Five, which Uhlmann described as one of the more active parts of the country for enforcement. He pointed out the Great Lakes have come a long way from their reputations as big, polluted waterways in the 1970s.

""Year in and year out, there's more enforcement cases brought in Region 5, and some of the biggest cases are brought in Region 5,"" Uhlmann emphasized. ""Not because Region 5's more polluted than the rest of the United States, but EPA has committed more resources to the area. The population density is significant, the amount of industry is significant.""

The Environmental Law and Policy Center said public polling indicates most Americans want clean air and water. Uhlmann underscored the bipartisan sentiments trace back to the Nixon White House creating the EPA. But with political forces now a factor, he urged private companies to hold firm.

""They need not to take advantage of this moment and put us at even greater risk,"" Uhlmann asserted. ""They need to step up and say, 'You know what? The private sector has a responsibility here, too.' They need to be good stewards of the environment.""

CLARIFICATION: An earlier version of this story did not capture the correct scope of economic benefits identified in the Jacksonville University study. This update more accurately represents the study's findings on job creation and annual savings. (12:20 p.m. MDT, May 28, 2025)

The Florida Legislature's failure to pass a budget before adjourning has left key environmental projects in limbo, including a Senate-approved proposal to restore the Ocklawaha River by dismantling the Rodman Dam.

For residents like Samuel Carr, president of the Bartram Trail Society who fished the river before the dam's 1971 construction, the more than $6 million project represents a chance to revive what he called a ""free-running wild river"" from what he said he believes turned into ""a mud hole.""

""Since they put that dam in, 150 million gallons of fresh water doesn't come into the St. Johns River now per day, as it did before 1971,"" said Carr. ""So, the restoration would literally turn the faucet back on to get that cool, clear water to the St. Johns River.""

Carr noted the dam blocks 20 springs and forces periodic pollution releases into the St. Johns, which he said has suffered catastrophic algae blooms and lost critical eelgrass.

Lawmakers will reconvene sometime after June 2 to resume budget talks. The Senate has already approved the funding, but House approval remains uncertain amid broader disputes over tax cuts.

A study a study commissioned by The Pew Charitable Trusts and authored by a work group of subject matter experts, estimates the project would create hundreds of jobs during construction and ultimately generate nearly $20 million annually in outdoor recreation revenue - from fishing, kayaking, and wildlife tourism.

Former Putnam County Commissioner Linda Myers frames the restoration as an economic imperative for rural Florida.

""This area of northeast Florida has so many rivers that connect to the St. Johns and this specific structure, the dam, has actually eliminated some of that connectedness,"" said Myers. ""So, opening that up would just give the opportunities - and here in Florida, we know the tourism dollars, we know how important they are.""

Ecologically, the study also shows it would reconnect over 200 miles of river habitat and bring back 20 natural springs that have been drowned under the reservoir for decades. Myers believes the project aligns with lawmakers' stated priorities of water quality, conservation and leveraging Florida's tourism industry.

Support for this reporting was provided by The Pew Charitable Trusts.

Utilities discuss smarter rate design, interconnection approaches","Clarion Energy Content Directors, Kevin Clark",,,,,https://www.power-eng.com/business/who-pays-for-the-ai-boom-utilities-discuss-smarter-rate-design-interconnection-approaches/,"“That’s mostly just due to large customer data center load growth.
We’ll probably break it every year for the foreseeable future.” Tillinghast spoke on a DTECH Data Centers and AI panel last week about rate design and interconnection considerations for data centers.
The event underscored that system reliability is at risk not only from large generation loss but also from sudden, unanticipated large load losses.
As a result, utilities are updating interconnection rules as data center loads surge.
That risk, Tillinghast said, is driving a new wave of contractual and rate design, especially in states like Arizona where data center growth is high.","As utilities across the U.S. grapple with the rising electricity demands of AI data centers emerging in their service territories, integrating these large loads into the grid requires clear guiding principles. Utilities aim to avoid shifting unfair costs onto other ratepayers, they’re prioritizing grid reliability, and they want to preserve capacity for broader economic growth.

Arizona Public Service (APS) has committed to serving 4.7 gigawatts (GW) of new large customer load over the next decade, according to Jordan Tillinghast, manager of the utility’s data center strategy. Of that 4.7 GW, two-thirds comes from data centers.

For perspective, the utility’s peak load is 8.2 GW.

“I expect us to break our peak this year,” said Tillinghast. “That’s mostly just due to large customer data center load growth. We’ll probably break it every year for the foreseeable future.”

Tillinghast spoke on a DTECH Data Centers and AI panel last week about rate design and interconnection considerations for data centers. Arizona is arguably the hottest U.S. data center market outside of Northern Virginia. APS currently has at least 10 GW of pending interconnection requests from data centers – and counting, Tillinghast said.

Panelists noted that traditional utility planning frameworks were never designed for the kind of multi-gigawatt, fast-ramping, load-intensive growth now being driven by hyperscale data centers.

“We’re in a fundamentally different planning environment now,” said Tillinghast. “We’ve always had to build ahead of need, but the risk of getting it wrong now is much larger.”

The growing size of data center loads and how they behave on the grid has become a reliability concern for system planners. Panelists referenced a July 2024 incident in the Eastern Interconnection where a transmission line fault led to the unexpected, simultaneous loss of approximately 1,500 MW of data center load—disconnected not by utility action but by customer-side protections.

The event underscored that system reliability is at risk not only from large generation loss but also from sudden, unanticipated large load losses. These events can cause frequency and voltage fluctuations, requiring operational intervention even if they don’t immediately threaten grid stability.

As a result, utilities are updating interconnection rules as data center loads surge. Panelists noted Southern Company’s draft guidelines, which require developers to submit validated load models—critical tools for planners to understand how fast-acting loads respond to grid disturbances.

“Data centers can ramp, as in, change their demand in seconds or less, very quickly,” said Jack Gibfried, Engineer of Power Systems Modeling and Analysis at the North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC). “If you did that in your house, not a big deal. Your refrigerator turns off, not a big deal. But 1000 megawatts, that’s really where it starts to matter.”

One of the main concerns for utilities is stranded costs—when they invest in new generation or transmission assets based on expected load growth, only to find the demand never materializes. That risk, Tillinghast said, is driving a new wave of contractual and rate design, especially in states like Arizona where data center growth is high.

To protect against financial risk and ensure fairness for its ratepayers, Tillinghast said APS introduced “load commitment agreements.” These contracts require data centers to guarantee energy use levels, meet minimum demand and energy thresholds, demonstrate creditworthiness and commit to long-term usage timelines.

“We’re trying to help [data centers] make this work,” said Tillinghast. “But at the minimum, like we do need to make sure that we’re just protected, in case.”",https://www.power-eng.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/image.png,N,,2025-06-03 06:09:19.714492

The manufacturing site has played a central role in advancing clean energy deployment while creating over 1,000 skilled jobs in Texas.
The use of advanced manufacturing technologies, including automation and robotics, has enabled efficient and high-quality production.
Governor Abbott said in a statement, “Texas leads the nation in advanced manufacturing and energy innovation.
The collaboration between SolarEdge and Flex reinforces our state’s position as the energy capital of the world.","SolarEdge Technologies Inc., a global provider of smart energy technology, has announced a significant milestone in its U.S. manufacturing efforts with the production of its 250,000th solar inverter at the Flex facility in Austin, Texas. This development marks an important step in the company’s strategy to strengthen domestic manufacturing, enhance energy resilience, and support job creation across the United States.

In recognition of this achievement, Texas Governor Greg Abbott has officially designated June 2, 2025, as “SolarEdge-Flex Manufacturing Milestone Day,” acknowledging the economic, environmental, and technological contributions of the partnership between SolarEdge and Flex in the state. SolarEdge has focused on localizing its manufacturing operations and has collaborated with Flex, a global manufacturing leader headquartered in Austin, to build a reliable domestic supply chain. The Austin facility has now produced a quarter of a million inverters that are used in rooftop solar installations throughout the country.

These new units will add to the millions of SolarEdge products already in use on more than 3.7 million homes and by over half of the Fortune 100 companies. The manufacturing site has played a central role in advancing clean energy deployment while creating over 1,000 skilled jobs in Texas. It has also helped improve product availability and supply reliability for solar installers nationwide. The use of advanced manufacturing technologies, including automation and robotics, has enabled efficient and high-quality production.

Governor Abbott said in a statement, “Texas leads the nation in advanced manufacturing and energy innovation. The collaboration between SolarEdge and Flex reinforces our state’s position as the energy capital of the world. These innovative companies help create good-paying jobs, drive economic growth, and meet growing energy demands with products proudly made in Texas.”

Marty Rogers, General Manager, SolarEdge, stated, “This milestone is a testament to the power of American manufacturing. Together with Flex, we are expanding industrial capabilities within the region and deploying advanced manufacturing technologies to meet growing demand, all while reinforcing the reliability and resilience of the U.S. energy grid.”

Dennis Kirkpatrick, President of the Lifestyle, Consumer, and Core Industrial Businesses at Flex, mentioned, “Flex’s partnership with SolarEdge highlights our shared commitment to delivering innovation to market with speed, resilience, and quality to support U.S. energy needs. We thank SolarEdge for leveraging Flex’s expansive U.S. footprint and trusting us to rapidly scale domestic production of their solar inverters in Texas.”

Additionally, by reducing dependence on imported components, the facility contributes to a stronger and more resilient U.S. energy infrastructure. As demand for renewable energy continues to rise, the work of SolarEdge and Flex in Austin represents a model for how public-private collaboration and domestic investment can drive innovation in the solar sector.

One of President Donald Trump’s first actions in office was to declare a “national energy emergency” in the U.S. In the executive order outlining this declaration, the White House stated high energy prices are a result of America’s reliance on foreign energy and hostility from outside nations, and that these high prices indicated an energy emergency.

But in reality, are we actually in an energy crisis?

An energy crisis typically involves supply shortages, high prices, or threats to infrastructure. It’s usually driven by grid instability, coal plant closures, fuel shortages, and growing power demand. Both sides of the political aisle have argued for and against the term “energy crisis” with no clear conclusion.

At the very least, Americans agree there is a real and growing demand for electricity that we need to meet to avoid rising electricity rates and destabilized power supply. We need to build energy that is affordable, fast to deploy, and pushes toward energy independence while lowering household expenses for everyday people. So, how do we do that?

Why is my electric bill so high?

The national energy emergency declaration is correct in stating that energy prices are rising. Homeowners (and renters) are seeing record-high electricity bills. Causes of these price spikes include:

Rising fuel costs (especially natural gas).

Rising costs to build energy infrastructure, stemming from inflation, tariffs, and high interest rates.

Increased demand due to extreme weather events, especially heatwaves.

Regional causes are also contributing to high prices. For example, in California, measures to harden against and recover from climate-worsened wildfires are also driving up electricity rates. Frustration from rising prices is driving many people to seek out and consider new energy solutions.

The best solution to encourage energy independence and lower prices? It’s simple: Encourage more clean energy and efficiency upgrades. Clean energy tax credits make green upgrades more affordable while supporting the fight against climate change.

Clean energy is the cheapest source of energy

The cost of clean energy has come down dramatically over the last decade. As clean energy deployment grows, companies learn how to bring down costs through efficiencies and technological advancements.

Solar and wind are now the lowest-cost sources of new electricity generation in many parts of the U.S., even beating out natural gas and coal. These renewable energy sources are good for the climate, air, water, and the health of American citizens. Once installed, they have zero fuel costs, which means zero surprise price hikes.

Federal and state incentives (mainly tax credits) are encouraging people and companies to invest in renewable energies. As a result, the economics of energy now favor clean energy, which can generally be deployed faster than fossil fuel-based energy systems. With these credits in place, grid operators and companies are now incentivized to choose clean energy sources that are cheaper and faster to build.

Clean energy tax credits are critical to getting new clean energy solutions implemented at the speed and scale we need. Implementing these sources of energy benefit us individually and collectively, both economically and climate-wise.

Clean energy solutions that could lower your energy bills

While it’s important that companies invest in clean energy on a larger scale, there are steps individuals can take as well. There are clean energy tax credits available that make it cheaper for people to buy the clean energy upgrades they need (like heat pumps, induction stoves, and electric vehicles). The following options, backed by incentives, help put America on the path to a full transition to clean energy while avoiding future energy emergencies.

Invest in home solar panels

Home solar panels reduce or even eliminate electricity bills over time. And with net energy metering, households have the option to sell excess power back to the grid at a profit.

Install an electric heat pump

Heat pumps use less energy to heat and cool your home. They are an ideal solution for areas with extreme temperatures. Heat pumps do some of their best work in very hot summers and freezing cold winters.

Weatherize your home

“Weatherizing” your home is an umbrella term for small upgrades that can improve your home’s energy efficiency. It includes activities like getting an energy efficiency assessment, improving insulation, upgrading windows and doors, and just adjusting ventilations systems.

For more clean energy incentives available in your state, check out DSIRE’s Database of State Incentives for Renewables & Efficiency®.

Tax credits make clean energy affordable for everyone

Clean electricity tax credits aren’t just for homeowners. While they help everyday people afford energy upgrades, they also promote the supply of clean energy in general.

Recall that, unlike fossil fuels, solar and wind power have no fuel costs. Once they’re built, the energy they produce is much cheaper. Tax credits make it easier for developers to build critical large-scale wind and solar projects, which lower electricity rates.

The more clean energy we build, the less we rely on volatile fossil fuel markets — which means fewer price spikes during global crises or extreme weather. According to energy analysts, regions with more renewables on the grid often experience more stable (and lower) electricity prices over time.

Expanding the supply of clean energy on the grid also helps push down wholesale electricity prices, which can lower the rates utilities charge consumers. Utilities can pass on the savings from cheaper clean electricity to ratepayers, especially in states where regulatory bodies require cost-based pricing.

Saving money while saving the planet

Clean energy is a smart, long-term investment, allowing us to save money while saving the environment. An abundant supply of renewable energy increases supply on the energy grid, reduces air pollution, and creates less of the carbon pollution that is overtaking the planet. At the same time, it increases our energy supply and reduces demand, saving you money on your energy bills.

With the right policies in place, any discussion of a “national energy emergency” can become a thing of the past. America has the potential for plenty of affordable wind, solar, geothermal, and nuclear power—we just need to build the political will to create and deploy this energy.

How to take action on climate change NOW

To move the U.S. to a clean energy economy, individuals, businesses, and policymakers collectively must work together and invest in and support clean energy initiatives.

These long-term solutions are what will truly protect the health of our climate, but you can also take action right now:

The findings were released by investors E2 (Environmental Entrepreneurs), based on data from its Clean Economy Tracker.

April alone saw the cancellation of $4.5 billion worth of clean energy projects, including those in electric vehicles, batteries and wind energy, as the US House of Representatives passed the controversial One Big Beautiful Bill Act. The legislation, if enacted, would significantly scale back tax incentives for clean energy businesses.

E2 also tracked an additional $1.5 billion in cancelled projects from earlier this year that had not previously been recorded. In total, 45 clean energy projects have been cancelled, downsized or closed since August 2022, with the loss of nearly 20,000 planned jobs and $16.7 billion in investment.

E2 has called on lawmakers to reconsider the bill and protect what it describes as a vital and fast-growing sector of the American economy.

The proposed legislation was already having a chilling effect on manufacturing and infrastructure development, warned Michael Timberlake, E2’s communications director. “Now is not the time to raise taxes on clean energy and compound the business uncertainty that is clearly taking a greater and greater toll on US manufacturing and jobs,” he said in a statement.

“If the tax plan passed by the House last week becomes law, expect to see construction and investments stopping in states across the country as more projects and jobs are cancelled,” Timberlake added. “Businesses are now counting on Congress to come to its senses and stop this costly attack on an industry that is essential to meeting America’s growing energy demand and that’s driving unprecedented economic growth in every part of the country.”

Congressional districts represented by Republicans, who had largely benefitted from clean energy incentives under the 2022 legislation, saw the most project cancellations, the report noted. Over $12 billion in investments and 13,000 jobs were scrapped in Republican districts alone.

Despite the uncertainty, some new investments continued. E2 tracked $486 million in clean energy announcements in April, including a $400 million solar wafer factory expansion by Corning in Michigan, which could create at least 400 jobs. A Canadian firm also pledged $9.3 million for a new solar equipment plant in North Carolina.

If completed, the seven new projects announced in April would together create nearly 3,000 permanent jobs across six states. These additions bring the total number of tracked clean energy projects to 390, spanning 42 states and Puerto Rico, with cumulative planned investments nearing $132 billion.

Entities ranging from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to the National Park Service (NPS) would see deep and specific cuts under the less “skinny” version of the administration’s budget that was released late Friday.

The EPA sees a 35 percent cut to the payroll for its science staff and for staff who work on environmental programs and environmental management.

NPS sees a 30 percent cut to its staff in charge of park system operations.

Meanwhile, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) sees a 28 percent cut to its operations, research and facilities staff payroll.

But it’s not just staff that takes a hit. A number of offices related to energy and environmental research, as well as disaster response, are reduced or eliminated under the proposal.

It completely zeroes out NOAA’s office of Oceanic and Atmospheric Research, for example, and also cuts federal assistance at the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) by 32 percent.

Science and technology activities at the EPA would see a 33 percent cut, while environmental programs and environmental management at the agency would see an 18 percent one.

And the Energy Department would also see a 13 cut to its science office. The budget document also proposes to “wind down” the department’s Office of Clean Energy Demonstrations, which was established in the Biden-era bipartisan infrastructure law to to bolster emerging energy technologies including hydrogen power, carbon capture, advanced nuclear reactors, and batteries.

“This sick joke of a budget is a nonstarter,” said Rep. Zoe Lofgren (Calif.), the top Democrat on the House Science, Space and Technology Committee, in a written statement. “In no way can America continue to lead if Trump continues his vendetta against the scientific enterprise. While Trump slashes budgets for American research and innovation, our adversaries, like China, are popping champagne. I will do everything I can to stand in the way of this ridiculous plan.

In previous years, a White House budget request has been taken as more of a signal of an administration’s priorities than a roadmap that’s likely to be realized since it’s Congress, not the administration, that has the power of the purse.

The Trump administration, however, has signaled that it is willing to go further to challenge that authority, already instituting massive layoffs at many agencies and gearing up for more.

And White House budget director Russell Vought said over the weekend that the administration would consider “impoundment” to get its agenda across the finish line.

It’s not entirely clear how the budget would play out politically, as cuts to programs such as NPS have been historically unpopular. The administration’s calls for cuts to FEMA have also been met with mixed reviews even within the GOP, though, the budget proposal stops short of the administration’s broader calls to eliminate FEMA entirely.

The document that was released late Friday gives additional color to a less detailed “skinny budget” previously released by the administration. The skinny budget also proposed big cuts at similar agencies.

The delegation was led by Congressman August Pfluger (R-Texas) and House Energy and Commerce Chairman Brett Guthrie (R-Ky), who brought colleagues from across the country, including representatives from South Carolina, New York, Georgia and Kentucky — many of whom were visiting the Permian Basin for the first time.

“The purpose of this trip — like we’ve done so many times over the past five years and as a campaign promise that I made — is to educate members across the country,” Pfluger said. “It’s all about the energy, health, and the industry that powers our country, that provides the foundation for our economy.”

Chairman Guthrie emphasized that seeing the production process in person helps lawmakers understand the impact of energy policy at the ground level.

“You can understand it intellectually, but until you see it and know that it’s a process we do safely and in an environmentally friendly way, it’s different,” Guthrie said.

The visit comes as the Energy and Commerce Committee pushes legislation aimed at strengthening American energy dominance. Guthrie said key priorities include eliminating electric vehicle mandates, protecting consumer energy choice and replenishing the Strategic Petroleum Reserve.

As for conversations with local producers in the Permian Basin, Pfluger said much of the focus is on reducing red tape and creating a more stable regulatory environment.

“I’ll point to Lee Zeldin, the administrator of the EPA, and his 31-point plan to slash regulations that were cumbersome and didn’t help anybody — actually made it more difficult,” Pfluger said. “Those are in the process of being put into place, and what you’ll see from that — and the ‘one big, beautiful bill’ and other legislative efforts — is a more predictable environment, which we all hope leads to more production.”

Rep. Russell Fry (R-S.C.) said the trip wasn’t just about education but policy planning.

“Part of this is a fact-finding mission,” Fry said. “But it impacts policy. What we’re seeing from the Energy and Commerce Committee is a real focus on the production of energy to make sure we are energy dominant, that we are competitive, and most of all, that we’re focused on the working families we represent — who want their power bills and gas prices just a little bit lower.”

Other lawmakers echoed that sentiment, emphasizing energy independence as a key to national security and economic strength.

“We have to dominate energy. That is economic power. That is military power,” said Rep. Rick Allen (R-Ga).

Rep. Nick Langworthy (R-N.Y.) said restrictive policies in his home state have cost thousands of jobs.

“There’s a war on natural gas going on in the northeastern United States,” Langworthy said. “They’ve stolen opportunity from my district. They’ve killed thousands of good-paying jobs — jobs I saw here in the fields of the Basin today.”

For freshman Congressman Craig Goldman (R-Texas), the message was personal.

“What you do every single day — the men and women of West Texas working 24 hours a day, 365 days a year — helps fund our Texas government,” Goldman said. “Now, as a freshman member of Congress, I see the importance of not only the energy supply for Texas and the U.S., but the pipelines to the Port of Houston and the ports of Texas that help provide energy to people around the world.”",https://media.newswest9.com/assets/KWES/images/c3e620b8-6ef0-451d-97c6-15b0d33a8c36/20250603T033541/c3e620b8-6ef0-451d-97c6-15b0d33a8c36_1140x641.jpg,N,,2025-06-03 04:02:33.815061

The DOE said the projects “failed to advance the energy needs of the American people,” were too expensive and wouldn’t earn a “positive return on investment.” The grants totaled $3.7 billion.

Advocates for decarbonizing heavy industry disagree. They said it would make U.S. industries competitive with other countries and create jobs.

David Perkins is the senior vice president of sustainability and public affairs for Heidelberg Materials North America — which planned to store its carbon emissions underground with the help of a $500 million federal grant.

Perkins said the cement-maker is still figuring out what this means for its carbon storage project and how the company might appeal the decision.

“The cement sector is a really critical part of our overall economic prosperity. So we're hopeful that we can work with the DOE to help them understand that and how this really does align with that mission of supporting domestic manufacturing,"" Perkins said.

Ash Lauth is the senior campaign strategist on cement and concrete for Industrious Labs — a nonprofit that advocates to reduce industrial carbon pollution. She said it's not clear if the DOE’s move to cancel the grants is legal.

Lauth said private companies in the Industrial Demonstrations Program signed agreements with the DOE to match funds.

“Cutting these projects violates all of those contracts and that is — in and of itself — legally unsound,"" she said.

Even where massive public subsidies have been deployed, as was the case with the much-publicized Petra Nova CCS plant in Texas, operations rarely approach their advertised efficiency, reliability, or cost-effectiveness.
The story is equally dire for hydrogen-based energy projects, particularly those involving fossil-derived hydrogen coupled with CCS.
Louisiana’s cancellation of Heidelberg Materials’ massive cement plant CCS project eliminated an opportunity to create high-paying local jobs and bolster the regional economy.
Ultimately, the Trump administration’s cancellation spree is a textbook example of ideology trumping rational economic and political analysis.","Once again, the Trump administration has swung its ideological axe at clean energy initiatives, cutting $3.7 billion in funding previously earmarked by the Department of Energy (DOE) for carbon capture and storage (CCS), hydrogen fuels, synthetic fuels, and a variety of other industrial decarbonization technologies. Predictably, the knee-jerk cancellations were driven more by political signaling than careful analysis.

But in this instance, undoubtedly unintentionally, the administration’s broad-brush approach landed mostly in the right places. Indeed, a surprising majority of the canceled projects should never have seen funding in the first place, given their dubious economics, shaky technological readiness, and fundamentally misguided assumptions. While it’s unfortunate that some genuinely innovative ventures were caught in the ideological crossfire, most of these initiatives were dead on arrival. The administration’s blunt ideological hostility toward Biden-era decarbonization projects, paradoxically, ended up saving taxpayers from throwing good money after bad.

To be clear, the Inflation Reduction Act had mostly good intentions, and often adequate things that it funded. But hydrogen for energy, blue hydrogen, and carbon capture — things the fossil fuel industry loves — featured prominently along with battery factories, EV factories, critical minerals processing, and other actually useful things.

The first category deserving scrutiny — carbon capture at fossil-fueled power plants — has a track record littered with expensive failures and miscalculations. The economic and technological hurdles involved in retrofitting coal and natural gas plants with CCS technology are staggering. Even where massive public subsidies have been deployed, as was the case with the much-publicized Petra Nova CCS plant in Texas, operations rarely approach their advertised efficiency, reliability, or cost-effectiveness. Petra Nova, once celebrated as a flagship CCS project, was ultimately mothballed when oil prices dropped, eliminating its primary revenue stream from selling captured carbon dioxide for enhanced oil recovery.

Canada’s Boundary Dam project similarly suffered endless operational and financial headaches, proving that retrofitting old fossil plants with CCS remains prohibitively expensive and rarely meets performance expectations. As a result, the Trump administration’s cancellation of projects like Calpine’s large-scale CCS retrofits in California and Texas, and PPL’s smaller CCS pilot at its Kentucky gas plant, while clearly ideologically driven, inadvertently spared taxpayers from another costly CCS debacle.

The story is equally dire for hydrogen-based energy projects, particularly those involving fossil-derived hydrogen coupled with CCS. Hydrogen’s appeal as an energy carrier has always been more theoretical than practical. Despite decades of optimism, the reality remains stubbornly resistant to scale, efficiency, and economics. Projects like ExxonMobil’s Baytown, Texas petrochemical plant, where natural gas was set to be replaced with supposedly clean blue hydrogen in industrial furnaces, epitomize the misguided logic underpinning many hydrogen initiatives. Such ventures rarely deliver meaningful net emissions reductions at reasonable costs, due primarily to the inherently energy-intensive nature of hydrogen production and distribution.

Similarly, Ørsted’s proposed e-methanol initiative on the Texas Gulf Coast sought to blend captured carbon dioxide with hydrogen to produce synthetic fuels. This approach, despite its superficially appealing narrative of circular carbon economy, depends heavily on complex, expensive inputs and supply chains that rarely add up to a sustainable or cost-effective business model. Ultimately, these synthetic fuel projects remain far more appealing in PowerPoint presentations than they ever do on balance sheets. Canceling these hydrogen and synthetic fuels projects, though intended as political theater, once again represented an inadvertently correct decision. There’s a reason why the majority of green methanol produced today is made from biomass, and there’s a reason why very little methanol is used as an energy carrier.

Despite the mostly justified nature of the cancellations, several promising technologies and companies were also swept up in the administration’s blanket hostility. Sublime Systems, for example, is developing an innovative electrochemical method of producing cement, a genuinely transformative approach capable of dramatically cutting emissions in one of the hardest-to-abate sectors. It’s a firm I’m keeping an eye on as its approach and target of using concrete from demolition debris to create new cement is strongly aligned with reality, and could provide a significant percentage of US cement requirements.

Brimstone Energy offered another alternative cement process that avoided direct carbon emissions without needing CCS, providing a pathway to cleaner cement production. Though Brimstone’s technology faced more substantial execution risks, mainly because its targeted feedstock has a tenth the quicklime as limestone, it still represented precisely the type of high-risk, high-reward innovation that public investment is meant to encourage.

The cancellation of Diageo’s battery storage installation at its Kentucky distillery plant, a modest yet genuinely beneficial local decarbonization project, was regrettable. These cancellations underscore the administration’s indiscriminate hostility toward decarbonization investments rather than careful analysis or rational prioritization. As is often the case, valuable, innovative ventures paid the price for this blunt approach.

Beyond individual projects, the broader economic impacts of these funding cuts should not be overlooked. Ironically, the majority of canceled projects targeted facilities located in traditionally Republican-leaning states and counties, such as Texas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Wyoming, and Alabama. These areas stood to gain significant local economic boosts from project construction, ongoing operations, and innovation clusters associated with CCS and industrial decarbonization investments. Texas alone lost multiple major industrial decarbonization initiatives, including ExxonMobil’s hydrogen retrofit, Ørsted’s synthetic fuel plant, and Dow Chemical’s project converting carbon dioxide into battery materials.

Louisiana’s cancellation of Heidelberg Materials’ massive cement plant CCS project eliminated an opportunity to create high-paying local jobs and bolster the regional economy. Kentucky saw its local CCS pilot canceled, undermining not just potential decarbonization progress but also local employment opportunities and economic resilience. While some communities may quietly applaud the cancellation of infrastructure they viewed skeptically, the overwhelming impact is negative: these ideological funding cuts primarily harm regions that are traditionally supportive of Trump-era policies, reflecting a short-sightedness that undermines long-term regional economic development.

I’ve often said both that what the USA needs is a Marshall Plan for its red states and counties, and that the Inflation Reduction Act was the closest thing to that Marshall Plan. The majority of IRA money was flowing to the less affluent states and counties where grievance politics is strongest due in large part to decades of wage stagnation. As always with America, the Democratic Party was punished for doing the right thing, the Republicans are now making the lives of members of their base worse, and they will undoubtedly capitalize on it to attack Democrats next time around. Leveraging grievance by pointing it at purported enemies appears to be all that Republicans have to offer these days. It’s a pity, as they really were the Grand Old Party once, however every decade since the 1950s they’ve chose the wide gate and the broad road, with predictable consequences.

You’ll also note how much of this money was flowing to the fossil fuel industry. That’s another group of actors strongly supporting Trump and the Republicans who aren’t going to be getting the largesse they expected. They’ll be harder to sway with Democrat-blaming propaganda in the mid-terms and the next major election, as they are also suffering significant fiscal hits from Trump’s tariffs.

Ultimately, the Trump administration’s cancellation spree is a textbook example of ideology trumping rational economic and political analysis. However, this round of cuts ended up resembling a broken clock, i.e accurate twice a day, despite fundamentally flawed reasoning. While taxpayers were inadvertently spared from subsidizing another round of uneconomic CCS and hydrogen energy projects, the tragedy remains that genuinely innovative ventures like Sublime, Brimstone, and targeted battery-storage initiatives were also lost in the crossfire.

The administration’s ham-fisted approach underscores a persistent problem in U.S. energy policy: policy decisions driven by political theater rather than careful, evidence-based analysis rarely achieve sustainable long-term outcomes. While we acknowledge that, for once, ideology inadvertently got it right, the broader pattern remains troubling. Real innovation—and the communities set to benefit from it—deserve more than accidental correctness.",https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/ChatGPT-Image-Jun-2-2025-04_21_39-PM-800x533.png,N,,2025-06-03 01:03:24.289744

(June 3, 2025) – Despite the wide variety of electric vehicle (EV) models now available—over 75 options introduced in the past four years—AAA’s latest survey highlights buyers’ continued hesitation. Only 16% of U.S. adults report being “very likely” or “likely” to purchase a fully electric vehicle (EV) as their next car, the lowest percentage recorded of EV interest since 2019. The percentage of consumers indicating they would be “unlikely” or “very unlikely” to purchase an EV rose from 51% to 63%, the highest since 2022.

“Since we began tracking interest in fully electric vehicles, we’ve seen some variability,” said Greg Brannon, director of automotive engineering. “While the automotive industry is committed to long-term electrification and providing a diverse range of models, underlying consumer hesitation remains.”

Key Barriers to Go Fully Electric

High battery repair costs (62%) and purchase price (59%) are cited as key barriers to go fully electric. Other top concerns identified in this year’s survey were the perceived unsuitability of EVs for long-distance travel (57%), a lack of convenient public charging stations (56%), and fear of running out of charge while driving (55%). Thirty-one percent of those undecided or unlikely to buy an EV have safety concerns, 27 percent reported challenges installing charging stations at their residences, and 12% cited the potential reduction or elimination of tax credits and rebates. According to AAA’s 2024 Your Driving Cost analysis, EVs had the second-highest total ownership costs due to depreciation, purchase prices, and finance charges.

Reasons for Interests

In 2022, gas prices reached $5, prompting many Americans to consider transitioning to electric vehicles (EVs) as a cost-effective option. In that year’s survey, 77% cited gas savings as their top motivation to purchase. Now, the national average for a gallon of regular ranges from $3.00 – $3.50, or even higher in depending on the state.

In this year’s survey, the primary reasons for buying EVs remain similar, with respondents citing gas savings, environmental concerns, and an appreciation for the lower maintenance costs associated with EVs. According to last year’s Your Driving Cost analysis, EVs had the lowest fuel cost of any vehicle type, based on a national average electricity price of 15.9 cents per kilowatt hour (kWh). EVs also had the lowest maintenance costs among all models.

Future of EVs

Despite advancements in the EV industry and the growing availability of models, public perception regarding the future of EVs remains uncertain. The percentage of U.S. drivers who believe that most cars will be electric within the next ten years has significantly declined from 40% in 2022 to 23% this year. Interest in EVs to take advantage of tax credits and rebates has decreased, dropping from 60% of those saying last year they are likely to buy an EV to 39% this year.

AAA’s Recommendations

Many consumers may find hybrid or plug-in hybrid vehicles more appealing. These vehicles combine the advantages of traditional internal combustion engines with electric power, reducing range anxiety while providing an environmentally friendly alternative. This combination meets today’s diverse needs and preferences for drivers, allowing them to enjoy electric driving without losing the familiarity of conventional gas-powered vehicles.

AAA will continue to monitor the evolving automotive landscape through consumer sentiment surveys and various research efforts to address concerns about EV ownership and provide feedback and insights for all vehicle types.

Despite market disruptions in the global automotive industry — including U.S. tariffs — EV sales remain on an upward trajectory.

That’s according to aMay report from the International Energy Agency, the global energy forum of32 industrialized countries, including the United States. The IEA’s annual Global EV Outlook predicts that more than a quarter of vehicles sold around the world in 2025 will be electric.

In 2024, according to the report, more than 17 million EVs were sold worldwide, comprising more than 20% of all new vehicle sales. The number of sales grew by 25% compared to 2023. And sales only continue to grow: During the first quarter of 2025, global EV sales rose by 35% versus the same period in 2024.

“Our data shows that, despite significant uncertainties, electric cars remain on a strong growth trajectory globally,” IEA Executive Director Fatih Birol said in a statement, adding that EV sales are continuing to set new records. Birol also said that the share of EVs sold is expected to more than double within the next five years, reaching more than 40% of global car sales, thanks in large part to the growing affordability of EVs.

Last year, the average worldwide price of an EV generally fell, according to the report. But pricing varied by country. In China, two-thirds of EVs sold were cheaper than similar gas-powered vehicles — even without discounts and other promotions. At the same time, the report noted that the limited share of affordable EV models in the U.S. has hurt EV take-up. On average, the price of an EV in the U.S. is 30% higher than a similar gas-powered car. In addition, more than 75% of cars sold in the U.S. are SUVs, but only about 20% of electric SUVs are cheaper than their gas-powered counterparts.

The low prices of China’s OEMs have rapidly accelerated EV adoption in China, where more than half of vehicles sold last year were EVs. But EV production in China is also driving increased EV sales around the world — China EV sales were actually responsible for nearly two-thirds of all EV purchases worldwide, per the report.

The report also said that EV growth is accelerating in emerging economies, which include countries such as Brazil, India, Indonesia, Mexico and Thailand. In these regions, EV sales increased by more than 60% in 2024 alone. The increase is largely due to EV affordability, as the report noted the cheapest EVs in Brazil, India, Indonesia, Mexico and Thailand were made by China-based OEMs and were often the least expensive vehicles on the market — cheaper even than gas-powered vehicles, per the report.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/g0MX0_hkuf3D-4gmVZfKvaQwKmo3_IkRkvKAbEPLflg/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9TY3JlZW5zaG90XzIwMjQtMTEtMDRfYXRfMS41OS4yN1BNLnBuZw==.webp,N,,2025-06-02 23:03:14.962018

The electric vehicle giant, long seen as the face of the EV industry, is introducing a raft of incentives and discounts to jumpstart demand.

The Cool Down reported that Tesla posted its weakest sales quarter since mid-2022, prompting the company to offer discounts for various customer groups, including special deals for Lyft drivers and subsidized interest rates. Reports suggest Tesla representatives are even personally reaching out to past leads to encourage test drives.

One commenter summed it up aptly: “They’re truly pulling all demand levers.”

Tesla’s reputation has been hit in recent years, partly due to CEO Elon Musk’s polarizing political commentary, which has made the brand less appealing to some potential buyers. However, improvements in quality and service for the Model 3 and Model Y are earning positive feedback from drivers.

Despite these incentives, such aggressive strategies midway through the quarter may signal deeper challenges. Some experts feel the perks are end-of-quarter level incentives despite it only being about halfway through the quarter.

While Tesla’s U.S. sales are down, global EV sales continue to rise. The company has also benefited from being the sole automaker exempt from a major automotive tariff, thanks to meeting certain compliance criteria. Still, Tesla faces stiff competition from a growing roster of EV makers offering alternatives to consumers.

Tesla owners can still tap into cost savings with EVs, including lower fuel costs, potential solar integration, and tax credits through the Inflation Reduction Act, though these incentives could be threatened by future policy changes.

Almost without fail, the environmental amendments added to the budget resolution gut or weaken protections for our air, public lands, water and imperiled wildlife. Sadly this is exactly what Big Oil, coal, mining and timber companies want. And in the end, the Senate was all too happy to comply, making this budget proposal nothing more than a collection of giveaways to dirty energy companies and other polluting special interests. The American public deserves a Congress that will uphold our nation’s conservation values, not undermine them.”

The following amendments to the Senate budget resolution directly harm our wildlife and public lands:

Amendment 422 which would block, perhaps permanently, a final U.S. Fish and Wildlife (FWS) decision due April 2, 2015 about whether to list the northern long-eared bat under the ESA, in deference to vague and undefined “State conservation plans.” There is no requirement that the State conservation plans adequately or actually protect the bat. The northern long-eared bat has declined by 99 percent and it should be given full protection as an endangered species.

Amendment 659, which would require the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) to perform an unnecessary, costly and time-consuming examination of the “cumulative” economic effects of a critical habitat designation – an approach Congress rejected decades ago as dangerous to the protection of imperiled species. The FWS already analyzes and solicits public comment on the incremental costs and benefits of designating critical habitat.

Amendment 838, which would authorize the sale, transfer or exchange of federal lands to state and local governments, which in turn could sell them off to private interests for oil and gas drilling and other development. This amendment endangers our nation’s most treasured places, such as the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. This devastating amendment could result in the loss of recreational access to all Americans and the destruction of some of our most iconic conservation lands and wildlife habitat.

,Detroit and Evs,2025-06-03 02:06:10+00:00,Hagerty Media,Why BMW M Boss Frank van Meel Is Bullish on the Concept of an Electric M3 - Hagerty,Ronan Glon,,,,,https://www.hagerty.com/media/news/bmw-electric-m3-development-details/,"“We already announced that we’re going to have two M3s, and it’s going to be difficult to say, ‘I still want the combustion one,'” BMW M boss Frank van Meel told me.
In the United States, with the M2 we have a take rate of over 50% for the manual,” van Meel said.
Without it, “you have the feeling that you’re in a sim racer but your television has no sound,” van Meel joked.
There’s another facet to BMW M: Standalone cars not rooted in the BMW range.
Curious, I asked van Meel when we might see the third installment in the series.","With a handful of exceptions, electrified performance has been a tough sell. Maserati canned the electric version of the MC20 due to a lack of demand. Dodge is reportedly rushing the gasoline-burning variant of the new Charger to production as the EV lingers on dealer lots, and even Rimac admitted that demand for electric hypercars has dropped. And yet, BMW confirmed that the next-gen M3 will be offered with gasoline- and battery-powered variants, and it’s confident that it can talk enthusiasts into buying the EV. Here’s why.

“We already announced that we’re going to have two M3s, and it’s going to be difficult to say, ‘I still want the combustion one,'” BMW M boss Frank van Meel told me. “The electric one is going to be something completely new,” he added. He stopped short of providing more details—the next M3 is still a few years away from making its debut, so he’s bound to corporate omertà, but the electric Vision Driving Experience concept unveiled in February 2025 was a clear preview of how BMW M envisions high-performance EVs.

Pictured above, the experimental sedan uses a new, production-bound control unit called Heart of Joy that runs the drivetrain and the driving dynamics management technology. It’s up to 10 times faster than the unit that it replaces, and we’re told that this super-computer will make the driving experience much sharper. BMW said drivers can expect handling that’s more precise and stable than what’s possible with today’s technology. Besides, van Meel opined that going electric is the next step in the M3’s evolution.

“We always had discussions if the next step with, for instance, the M3 would be acceptable or not. We started with a four-cylinder engine in the M3, a very long time ago, because it came from Formula One. When we shifted to six-cylinder engines, everyone said, ‘oh, it’s going to be heavier with six cylinders; It’s not going to work.’ Actually, it did. After that, we changed to a high-revving V-8 engine, and everyone was talking about the weight balance, and worried about us putting more weight on the front. But, everyone loved it. And then we changed to a six-cylinder turbo engine and people said, ‘yes, I know you get more power, but you get turbo lag.’ Actually, it was quicker, it was more emotional, and it was better,” he said.

Regardless of horsepower or cylinder count, every generation of the M3 feels like an M3. This approach to design will permeate all of the electric models in BMW M’s pipeline. Van Meel isn’t forgetting about the enthusiasts who would rather continue to drive a straight-six, however, and he realistically notes that the EV won’t be for everyone. “But, then again, it might also be like the stick-shift, and a lot of people will say, ‘I still want to have [the gas one] because I grew up with a straight-six engine and I want to keep it.'”

Speaking of the manual transmission, M remains committed to offering at least some of its cars with a stick for a long as possible. It’s not because three pedals are quantifiably better than two; it’s just what buyers want.

“There is a traditional discussion about the stick-shift, because for an engineer it’s normally slower and it brings higher fuel consumption. For the customer, however, it’s a passion issue. That’s why it’s still there: We want to offer what the customer wants. In the United States, with the M2 we have a take rate of over 50% for the manual,” van Meel said. He added that the stick will stick around “for as long as possible.”

He ruled out putting a regular manual transmission in an electric car, so don’t expect to see a clutch pedal below the electric M3’s dashboard, but he noted that some of BMW’s upcoming EVs will need to feature a feedback system to compensate for the lack of gears. It won’t necessarily be a copy-and-paste job, either.

“You can try to put a manual gearbox with a clutch [in an EV], but that wouldn’t make sense. The only thing that does make sense, for racing or high-performance cars, is that you need some kind of feedback,” Van Meel explained. “If you just have one gear from zero to 300 [kph] with seven octaves of music behind it, you don’t know how quick you are. Does that mean you have to copy exactly what we have today? No, because today’s system also has disadvantages. But, you need some kind of feedback that tells you exactly how fast you are.” Sound is important. Without it, “you have the feeling that you’re in a sim racer but your television has no sound,” van Meel joked. “But you need some other inputs, too.”

We shouldn’t have to wait long to find out what he has in mind. BMW M’s range already includes EVs, like the i4 M50 and the iX M60, but they’re pretty much stop-gap cars between regular BMWs and full-fat M cars. In a nutshell, they’re the electric equivalent to, say, the M240i. The first battery-powered full-blown M car is widely expected to make its debut before the end of the decade, and it might be the electric M3.

There’s another facet to BMW M: Standalone cars not rooted in the BMW range. We’ve only seen two since M was formed in 1972. One was the M1 released in 1978, and the other is the XM that made its debut for 2023. Curious, I asked van Meel when we might see the third installment in the series.

“We’re always working on that,” he replied with a smile. “That is about the best answer I can give you.”",https://hagerty-media-prod.imgix.net/2025/02/P90584484_highRes_vdx-dynamic.jpg?auto=format%2Ccompress&ixlib=php-3.3.0,N,,2025-06-03 03:03:50.483926

At least two ethanol-related projects are among those impacted by the terminations.

According to the DOE, 16 of the 24 projects were signed between Election Day and Jan. 20. The agency also noted the projects primarily include funding for carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) and decarbonization initiatives.

The rescinded funding includes a $15.12 million award made to Skyven Technologies Inc. on Jan. 14, 2025, to support a project in Medina, New York. The OCED on Jan. 15 announced the approval of funding for a project titled “Steam-Generating Heat Pumps for Cross-Sector Deep Decarbonization.” That project, led by Skyven Technologies, included plans to partner with manufacturing facilities across multiple U.S. manufacturing sectors to pioneer a process-heat-as-a-service-model, with the initial partner expected to be Medina, N.Y.- based Western New York Energy, a 62 MMgy ethanol plant.

According to information previously published by the DOE, Skyven’s approach would electrify steam production to replace natural gas boilers to meet the needs of an energy intensive facility that currently relies on fossil-fired heat. By developing this technology, Skyven would demonstrate expertise and economic viability of this technology solution that can be replicated among diverse heat-using manufacturers. During Phase 1, Skyven was expected to complete initial conceptual and engineering studies for the project, provide documentation and reports necessary to complete the National Environmental Policy Act review, and engage community and labor stakeholders.

The rescinded funding also includes a $200 million award made to Technip on Dec. 16, 2024, to support a project in the Gulf Coast region. That project, titled the “Sustainable Ethyle from CO2 Utilization with Renewable Energy (SECURE)” project, was to be led by Technip Energies USA Inc. in partnership with LanzaTech Inc. The companies planned to demonstrate an integrated process to utilize captured carbon dioxide from ethylene production.

According to information released by the DOE last year, the project was expected to use LanzaTech’s gas fermentation technology, a biotech-based carbon recycling process, and power carbon intensity (CI) hydrogen to create sustainable ethanol and ethylene. Phase 1 included plans to conduct front end engineering design (FEED), develop project plans, provide documentation and reports necessary to complete NEPA review and engage with community and labor stakeholders.

Paris [France], June 2 (ANI): India should prioritize electric vehicle (EV) adoption to reduce its dependence on oil imports and strengthen energy security, International Energy Agency (IEA) Executive Director Fatih Birol said on Monday after a meeting with Commerce and Industry Minister Piyush Goyal.

'India should look at the electrification of mobility very closely because currently we have low oil prices, but the country is definitely at the mercy of some key oil producers,' Birol warned. 'If India wants to have the upper hand in terms of domestic energy trajectories, electric cars are one of the key solutions.'

The IEA chief highlighted the rapid global shift toward electric vehicles, noting that electric car sales have surged from just 3 per cent of total car sales four years ago to 25% this year. 'One out of four cars sold today is electric,' he said. 'This is mainly because electric cars are getting cheaper, slowly but surely.'

In many countries, electric and conventional vehicles now carry similar price tags, while operating costs favour EVs. 'In most countries around the world, driving one kilometre costs less with electricity than with oil, unless oil prices fall below $50,' Birol explained.

He predicted that electric vehicles will eventually dominate global transportation. 'The world is going to see that sooner or later, electric cars will be dominating the streets.'

Birol praised India as 'one of the drivers of the global clean energy transition,' particularly highlighting the country's solar energy achievements. 'India has achieved a huge success story, especially on the solar front, and this is good for India's economy and its energy security,' he noted.

The IEA executive director also commended India's LED bulb program, calling Minister Goyal its architect and describing it as 'one of the most successful programs in the history of energy transition.' The initiative has made India's electrification system more cost-effective and environmentally friendly.

He also praised the Ujjwala program for bringing clean cooking solutions to hundreds of millions of households and for its efforts to provide electricity access to Indian villages.

Addressing concerns about the energy transition's supply chain, Birol warned of growing concentration in critical mineral mining and processing. 'We are seeing major concentration. This is a worry because we at the IEA believe that the best energy security policy is diversification,' he said.

The concentration of critical minerals--essential for energy transition, defense, and chip manufacturing--poses 'serious risk for the years to come,' he warned. Birol urged all countries to diversify mining, refining, and processing of key critical minerals to avoid potential supply disruptions.

For oil-importing nations like India, Birol recommended government incentives to accelerate electric vehicle adoption. 'Countries importing oil should consider giving incentives to electric cars to reduce imports from different parts of the world,' he said.

He emphasized the importance of supporting consumers in purchasing their first electric vehicles, noting that countries must avoid falling behind in the electric car revolution.

Despite concerns about potential trade conflicts affecting the energy transition, Birol maintained that diversification remains the best strategy for ensuring energy security in an increasingly electrified world. (ANI)

Tucker United says it plans to go to the City of Thomas and the Tucker County Commission to make their case to them.","DAVIS, W.Va. (WBOY) — A community group called Tucker United held a public meeting in Davis on Sunday to discuss the ramifications of the proposed power plant between Davis and Thomas, and what can be done to stop the project.

Roughly 100 people filed into St. John’s Lutheran Church for the meeting. In a flier, Tucker United said it is against the development of the data center project anywhere in Tucker County. The group claims the project poses a threat due to possible air pollution, high water use that could further strain water sources, and impact on local tourism.

Several times during the meeting, members of Tucker United said that the company Fundamental Data, who is behind the project, would not be “good neighbors” and that the local area would reap few of the economic benefits of the project. Tucker United said that in its correspondence with Fundamental Data, the company would not discuss if the project would bring long-term jobs to the area. Furthermore, they say that under House Bill 2014, which was signed by Governor Morrisey last legislative session, 70% of the tax revenue would go to the state, leaving 30% to the county.

Among the group’s frustrations with the data center project is the secrecy around it, including a “highly redacted air quality permit” that they have been trying to get more details on. Local leadership and residents were both caught off guard by the proposed power plant, with many learning about the project through a notice posted in the local newspaper.

Tucker United is trying to marshal community support, and various members of the community with relevant expertise spoke or were mentioned during the meeting, including a lawyer, an engineer, and a tech project manager.

Zina Raye, who works as a project manager in northern Virginia and has had a lot of experience with data centers, connections with the Davis area and said she plans on retiring in Canaan Valley. In an interview with 12 News, she said that the data center would be of a massive scale and that its likely use is artificial intelligence (AI). Raye said that while she believes AI will be largely beneficial to society, she also believes in industry working with the local community when it comes to the building of data centers, which is what she said happened in her home in northern Virginia.

“I believe if public and private partnership exists, that’s where you would find that optimal place for this data center. That’s where you would take into consideration that West Virginia has this fledgling, wonderful eco-tourism industry, and you don’t want to kill your existing industry.”

Tucker United is also looking to enlist the support of local leaders and representatives. At the meeting, Mayor of Davis Al Tomson announced that the Davis Town Council adopted a resolution against building the data center next to Davis. Tucker United says it plans to go to the City of Thomas and the Tucker County Commission to make their case to them. Floated during the meeting was advocating for amending House Bill 2014 and creating different zoning ordinances.

House Bill 2014 prohibits any county or municipality from enacting rules, laws, or ordinances that “limit, in any way, the creation of, […] and operation of any certified microgrid district or certified high impact data center project.” Tucker United says that the law has serious implications for not just Davis, but communities throughout West Virginia.

Member of Tucker United Shaena Crossland told 12 News, “I just want to say that if you are a West Virginian, if this is your home, even if it’s not and you come here, what is going on right now is really important. And you need to be informed. You need to be aware of what’s going on and you need to fight back and take control.”

Kentucky Chamber President and CEO Ashli Watts emphasized how federal decisions directly impact Kentucky’s economy. She underscored the Chamber’s role in advocating nationally for policies that support business growth and economic strength.

“In times of uncertainty, one constant remains: the Chamber’s commitment to protecting businesses and building a stronger Kentucky,” said Watts. We will continue to work alongside elected officials, employers, and community leaders to drive solutions, expand opportunity, and ensure the Commonwealth remains a top place to live, work, do business, and raise a family.”

Congressional Overview: A Conversation with U.S. Senator Mitch McConnell

U.S. Senator Mitch McConnell joined Kentucky Chamber President and CEO Ashli Watts for a keynote discussion, reflecting on his decades in public service and sharing insights on critical issues affecting Kentucky.

McConnell highlighted Kentucky’s unique economic position as the most trade-dependent state relative to its GDP, stressing that tariffs are like a tax on businesses and working families. “Trade is not the enemy—it’s a job creator,” he said, emphasizing the need for more trade agreements, not trade wars.

Turning to global security, McConnell, who is now chair of the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Defense, called for increased defense spending, citing growing threats from authoritarian regimes, and affirming support for Ukraine as a strategic ally.

On domestic policy, McConnell expressed hope that the Senate will preserve the individual tax cuts from the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in ongoing negotiations for the “Big Beautiful Bill.”

He also stressed the importance of bipartisan cooperation to address the national debt and safeguard U.S. economic competitiveness.

Overview of Federal Policy Changes

U.S. Chamber of Commerce Executive Vice President, Chief Policy Officer, and Head of Strategic Advocacy Neil Bradley shared an overview of major federal policy issues.

Bradley noted a drastic economic downturn in early 2025, with GDP forecasts falling below 1% and recession risks doubling. He said much of this shift is due to rising tariffs, which have increased costs and uncertainty for businesses.

He emphasized the particularly drastic impact tariffs have on small and mid-sized manufacturers. Noting the impact on Kentucky, he stated that 40,000 Kentucky manufacturers imported $21 billion in goods last year. Bradley said a 10% tariff amounts to a $2 billion tax increase for these businesses.

On taxes, Bradley said he anticipates the passage of a tax package this summer that will extend the 2017 tax reforms from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. With the “Big Beautiful Bill” being negotiated, Bradley raised concerns about raising the debt level and unsustainable federal spending. He stressed that long-term economic stability depends on growing the economy faster than the $36 trillion federal debt.

Bradley said the labor shortage is driven by an aging population and uncertainty around work authorizations for immigrants, noting that three million legal work authorizations were issued in 2024. He also emphasized the potential of domestic energy and artificial intelligence as key drivers of economic growth.

With the right policies, Bradley said the U.S. could achieve 3% annual growth, doubling the economy in 23 years. At 2%, it would take 35 years—a pace he warned would limit opportunity and mobility.

Immigration Policy Changes

Kentucky Chamber Foundation Board Chair Kim Halbauer, region president of Fifth Third Bank, Chamber Board Member Purna Veer, president of V-Soft Consulting Group Inc., Lisa DeJaco Crutcher, CEO of Catholic Charities of Louisville, Inc., and Chelsea Granville Reed, partner at Dentons, addressed recent changes in federal immigration policy and how it is changing Kentucky’s labor force, refugee resettlement, temporary worker programs, and business operations.

Panelists discussed how immigration is important to Kentucky’s workforce and economic needs, especially as the Commonwealth faces widespread labor shortages. They emphasized that outdated immigration policies and changes to programs like H-1B visas hinder access to high-skilled talent.

Speakers also highlighted the contributions of refugees, who often pursue legal pathways to citizenship and launch businesses at higher rates than native-born Americans. The panel advocated for a modernized immigration system that reduces barriers, supports employers, and enhances long-term workforce sustainability.

Impact of Executive Orders on Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion in the Private Sector

Chamber Board Member LaToi Mayo, shareholder at Littler, addressed the implications of recent executive orders focused on diversity, equity, and inclusion in the private sector. She outlined legal and operational considerations for employers navigating this changing landscape.

Mayo explained that recent executive orders have shifted federal DE&I policy, including the repeal of affirmative action requirements for federal contractors. These changes raise legal risks for companies using diversity targets in hiring or promotion.

To adapt, she advised that DE&I efforts be voluntary, legally informed, and focused on broader inclusion strategies rather than specific demographic metrics. She also emphasized the importance of staying informed and adapting policies as the legal environment evolves.

Tariffs and Trade Policies

Focused on shifting U.S. trade policy and its effect on Kentucky industries, Jim Coleman, chairman and CEO of Coleman Crest Farm, Jan de Beer, office partner-in-charge of Frost Brown Todd LLP, Jack Mazurak, director of government and regulatory affairs for the Kentucky Distillers Association, Caleb Ragland, president of the American Soybean Association, and Dr. Charles Aull, vice president of policy of the Chamber explored how tariffs, trade conflict, and supply chain instability are disrupting planning and operations in key sectors.

Panelists from agriculture, distilling, and legal sectors discussed how rising tariffs, now at their highest levels since the 1930s, disrupt Kentucky’s trade-reliant economy.

With bourbon and soybeans as key exports, higher costs on imported ingredients, and restricted international markets limit industry growth, investment, and competitiveness. Panelists emphasized that these trade policies impact producers and have ripple effects through rural communities and the broader state economy.

“Trade has got to be good for both countries when it comes down to it. We’ve got to work where the free market works, and that’s breaking down regulations to reasonable levels, not putting unnecessary barriers in place that make us uncompetitive and make it an advantage just to go to Brazil or go somewhere else to buy our farm products. And that’s the same not just for agricultural products, but for everything,” said Ragland.

Government Grants in the New Administration

With more uncertainty surrounding federal grant funding, nonprofit leaders across the Commonwealth discussed ways to adapt to this new challenge.

Danielle Tharp Clore, executive director and CEO of the Kentucky Nonprofit Network, Jennifer Hancock, president and CEO of Volunteers of America Mid-States, Kentucky Chamber Board Member Amy Luttrell, president and CEO of Goodwill Industries of Kentucky, and Kentucky Chamber Foundation Senior Vice President Beth Davisson discussed how a proposed freeze on grant funding is impacting nonprofit operations and community services across the Commonwealth.

Panelists emphasized that nonprofits are a vital part of Kentucky’s economy, employing one in 10 Kentuckians and providing essential services that support workforce participation, such as housing, child care, and transportation.

They also discussed how federal funding uncertainty is pushing the sector to innovate and do more with less. Despite tight budgets and rising costs, nonprofits adapt by reassessing operations and ensuring every dollar has a measurable impact.

“We have to approach these challenges with creativity and discipline,” said Luttrell. “We can’t afford to waste resources—every decision must be about maximizing our impact on the communities we serve.”

Medicaid Changes

Mark Birdwhistell, senior vice president for health and public policy for the University of Kentucky, James C. Musser, Esq., senior vice president for policy and government relations at the Kentucky Hospital Association, Tom Stephens, president and CEO of the Kentucky Association of Health Plans, and Anne-Tyler Morgan, Esq., member at McBrayer, discussed the future of Medicaid in Kentucky, a program that serves over 1.6 million residents at an annual cost of $17 billion. Describing the system as a “Rubik’s cube,” panelists emphasized the challenge of balancing patient needs, system costs, and provider sustainability.

They examined major provisions in the “Big, Beautiful Bill,” including new oversight requirements for managed care organizations to spend at least 85% of funds on direct care, expanded rural provider reimbursements, and proposed work and community engagement requirements for certain adults, with key exemptions.

Panelists highlighted Kentucky’s focus on access and innovation, pointing to initiatives like “Food is Medicine,” investments in rural health, and stronger partnerships between payers and providers. They also noted the General Assembly’s new Medicaid Oversight Advisory Board as a step toward greater accountability and a more sustainable system.

Regulations in the New Administration

During a discussion on federal deregulation efforts and their implications for Kentucky businesses, Ballard Cassady, Jr., president and CEO of the Kentucky Bankers Association, Charlie Vance, CEO and member at Current HR, LaJuana Wilcher, partner at English Lucas Priest & Owsley, LLP, and Sarah Cameron, partner at Dinsmore & Shohl LLP, reviewed changes in regulations and how industries are adapting to new compliance requirements.

Panelists discussed how the Trump administration is reducing federal rules in areas like labor, the environment, and banking. These changes are meant to reduce red tape for businesses, but panelists said they could also lead to confusion and challenges.

The panel also talked about a recent Supreme Court ruling that ended the Chevron rule, which gave deference to federal agencies in interpreting unclear laws. Now, courts will decide what the laws mean. Panelists said this makes it even more important for Congress to write laws that are clear and easy to understand.

The panelists emphasized the need for businesses to have clear, consistent rules. Without that, planning, following the law, and growing will become more difficult. Panelists stressed the need for innovative policies that reduce confusion and help businesses succeed.

What we do know: The canceled projects would have reduced over 9 million metric tons of carbon dioxide annually—the equivalent of taking 2 million cars off the road.","On Friday, the U.S. Department of Energy announced the cancellation of 24 clean energy and industrial decarbonization projects. The agency claimed this move would save taxpayers $3.6 billion. But the real cost—economic, environmental, and geopolitical—will be far greater.

The decision came just days after the World Meteorological Organization warned that the planet has a chance of breaching 2°C of warming within five years. Around the same time, Norway’s $1.8 trillion sovereign wealth fund—the largest in the world—projected that climate risk could erase 20% of its U.S. equity holdings. While other nations mobilize to confront escalating threats, the United States—the largest economy on Earth—is retreating. This is not simply a policy mistake. It’s a calculated abdication of leadership for a fleeting political win.

We’ve seen this pattern before. From “beautiful, clean coal” to climate denial in congressional hearings to billions in fossil fuel donations, the Republican Party has long treated climate action as a culture war wedge. Clean energy is no longer debated on the merits—it’s dismissed as “woke,” undermined not out of ideological consistency, but political convenience. Market-based climate solutions could align with core conservative values: competition, energy independence, national security. Instead, Congress continues to treat policy as performance—enabling headlines over outcomes, symbolism over strategy.

The consequences are immediate, and they are devastating.

We didn’t just cancel 24 projects. We canceled momentum. We canceled trust. We canceled a framework that had finally begun to reconnect federal capacity with local ambition.

Tens of thousands of potential jobs vanished overnight. The canceled projects spanned over a dozen states—from Alabama and Texas to California and Massachusetts. Cities like Birmingham, Baytown, Toledo, Zanesville, Modesto, and Holyoke had been preparing for long-overdue industrial upgrades: electrified glass furnaces, carbon-captured cement kilns, regional hydrogen hubs. These weren’t theoretical moonshots. They were shovel-ready projects with partners in place. Economic development agencies were mobilized. Union halls were staffing up. Community colleges had launched clean workforce programs. Then came the call: It’s over.

DOE’s rationale? These projects didn’t offer sufficient return on investment. But no cost-benefit analysis has been released. What we do know: The canceled projects would have reduced over 9 million metric tons of carbon dioxide annually—the equivalent of taking 2 million cars off the road. These weren’t speculative technologies. They targeted sectors like steel, cement, chemicals, and paper—industries where emissions can be reduced, but not without public investment.

This wasn’t just climate policy. These were air quality improvements in neighborhoods with decades of industrial pollution. These were middle-class jobs, modernized infrastructure, and new revenue streams for local governments. They signaled that decarbonization could drive renewal—not austerity. That message mattered, especially in regions where federal support has long felt abstract or nonexistent.

So why cancel them?

Because it made for good optics. Many of the projects were located in red or swing districts. Cutting them allowed Republicans to posture against “wasteful” spending and energize their base. It transformed serious infrastructure investments into political theater. And Congress went along—not out of principle, but out of paralysis.

DOE now says it will redirect resources to long-horizon technologies: fusion, quantum computing, and artificial intelligence. These are important pursuits. But they won’t cut emissions at a cement plant in 2028. They won’t lower energy costs at a food processing facility next year. And they won’t create jobs in Modesto or Toledo.

There’s nothing wrong with moonshots—unless they come at the expense of shovel-ready progress.

Because these projects weren’t paper proposals. Local governments had hired staff. Contractors were preparing bids. Manufacturers were retooling supply chains. Students had enrolled in new clean industry training programs. With no warning, that entire ecosystem has been upended.

That decision undermines more than climate credibility. It erodes trust in governance itself. How can communities build long-term economic development strategies if federal support can be revoked without explanation? Why would private investors stay at the table when the public sector walks away midstream?

Meanwhile, other nations are surging forward. The European Union is investing in clean steel and cement. Canada is building out low-carbon supply chains. Norway is doubling down on green industry. And China is scaling solar, electric vehicles, and hydrogen at unprecedented speed—cementing not only energy dominance but geopolitical power.

For an administration that brands itself “America First,” this is anything but. It is a strategic withdrawal—from economic competitiveness, global leadership, and the industrial future itself. We are ceding the next era of manufacturing—not just to allies, but to adversaries.

And none of this should be surprising. The Trump administration has been explicit about its intent: Strip climate out of agency missions, dismantle regulatory capacity, and discredit climate science. But the deeper failure lies in what Congress has allowed. The legislative branch is no longer functioning as a check on executive excess. It has become a bystander to the dismantling of public purpose.

We didn’t just cancel 24 projects. We canceled momentum. We canceled trust. We canceled a framework that had finally begun to reconnect federal capacity with local ambition. We walked away from thousands of jobs, millions of tons in emissions cuts, billions in co-investment—and a fragile sense of possibility.

And we did it for a press cycle. To placate donors. Fully aware of the consequences.

The cost won’t just be measured in carbon. It will be measured in time lost, in broken partnerships, in shuttered training programs and shelved contracts. And in the widening distance between the future we could build—and the one we keep choosing instead.",https://www.commondreams.org/media-library/image.jpg?id=56218698&width=1200&height=600&coordinates=0%2C464%2C0%2C464,N,,2025-06-02 23:03:02.462050

Since the first days of the second Trump administration, federal officials have said that they are prioritizing an effort to eliminate obstacles for companies interested in digging or drilling for natural resources in Alaska.
“Alaska can play such a huge role in this, but we’ve got to get the federal government out of your way.","The Trump administration plans to lift environmental protections on roughly half of the National Petroleum Reserve on Alaska’s North Slope, reopening the area to possible oil and gas drilling.

The new move would reverse actions taken during the Biden administration to restrict development in the 23 million-acre reserve.

The plans, announced Sunday in Utqiagvik and formally on Monday by the U.S. Department of the Interior, open a public comment period, with final action to come later. The plans were announced as three of the Trump administration’s top officials visit Alaska.

U.S. Interior Secretary Doug Burgum, U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright, and Lee Zeldin, administrator of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, are in Alaska this week for a series of events, including a speaking engagement at Gov. Mike Dunleavy’s annual sustainable energy conference, which begins Tuesday in Anchorage.

During a brief question-and-answer session with reporters on Sunday, U.S. Sen. Dan Sullivan, R-Alaska, sat alongside the three cabinet members and called the effort to restrict development in NPR-A the “most egregious effort of the Biden administration,” adding that “one of the top priorities is to get the NPRA back to where it was supposed to be by the intention of Congress, to develop oil and to remove all the regulations that the Biden guys put on NPR-A, and that is a huge priority.”

While large oil companies have expressed little interest to date in drilling within the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, which lies to the east of the Prudhoe Bay oil fields, there has been interest in drilling within the reserve, which lies to the west.

Since the first days of the second Trump administration, federal officials have said that they are prioritizing an effort to eliminate obstacles for companies interested in digging or drilling for natural resources in Alaska.

Burgum, Wright and Zeldin traveled to the North Slope after meeting with state officials in Anchorage on Sunday and were scheduled to tour Pump Station No. 1 of the trans-Alaska Pipeline System before returning to Anchorage on Tuesday to participate in the governor’s energy conference.

The two-hour Anchorage event was largely closed to the public, but reporters were able to listen to closing remarks and ask limited questions at the end.

There were no new details about the potential construction of a trans-Alaska natural gas pipeline, and officials did not address the Trump administration’s decision to freeze or rescind grants awarded to renewable energy projects in Alaska.

Burgum, speaking in Anchorage, noted that Ted Stevens Anchorage International Airport offers direct flights to 16 countries and talked about the “rise of the Pacific” in terms of global commerce.

“Alaska can play such a huge role in this, but we’ve got to get the federal government out of your way. That’s what the three of us are here to do,” he said.

In response to a question, Burgum said the administration plans to prioritize development of the planned Ambler Road, a 211-mile mining access road through the Brooks Range, and the proposed King Cove Road, an 11-mile road connecting King Cove to the Cold Bay airport, among other projects.

On Monday, environmental groups responded to the NPR-A decision with scorn and concern.

Grandmothers Growing Goodness, an environmental group that supports Indigenous communities in the Arctic, said that the repeal of the Biden administration protections would significantly impact Teshekpuk Lake and its surroundings, which are important for the Teshekpuk caribou herd. “The area is also integral to Indigenous subsistence practices, supporting hunting, fishing, and gathering,” they said, in an email statement with the announcement

Protest demonstrations are planned in Anchorage for Monday and Tuesday to oppose the proposed Alaska LNG pipeline project and “other fossil fuel projects promoted by Gov. Dunleavy’s ‘sustainable energy conference,’” according to organizers.

“It’s hard to overstate the havoc this could wreak on the Western Arctic’s undisturbed habitat for caribou, polars bears and belugas,” said Marlee Goska, Alaska attorney at the Center for Biological Diversity. “Trump’s fixation on plundering Alaska’s ecosystems for short-term gain is matched only by the stupidity of turning this precious place into a fossil fuel extraction site. Alaska’s vast expanses of wild lands are a big part of what makes our state so special, and we’ll do everything possible to protect these places.”",https://alaskabeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/49159199058_5167f11791_o-2048x1365.jpg,N,,2025-06-02 21:01:11.035627

Science and technology activities at the EPA would see a 33 percent cut, while environmental programs and environmental management at the agency would see an 18 percent one.

And the Energy Department would also see a 13 cut to its science office. The budget document also proposes to “wind down” the department’s Office of Clean Energy Demonstrations, which was established in the Biden-era bipartisan infrastructure law to to bolster emerging energy technologies including hydrogen power, carbon capture, advanced nuclear reactors, and batteries.

“This sick joke of a budget is a nonstarter,” said Rep. Zoe Lofgren (Calif.), the top Democrat on the House Science, Space and Technology Committee, in a written statement. “In no way can America continue to lead if Trump continues his vendetta against the scientific enterprise. While Trump slashes budgets for American research and innovation, our adversaries, like China, are popping champagne. I will do everything I can to stand in the way of this ridiculous plan.

In previous years, a White House budget request has been taken as more of a signal of an administration’s priorities than a roadmap that’s likely to be realized since it’s Congress, not the administration, that has the power of the purse.

The Trump administration, however, has signaled that it is willing to go further to challenge that authority, already instituting massive layoffs at many agencies and gearing up for more.

And White House budget director Russell Vought said over the weekend that the administration would consider “impoundment” to get its agenda across the finish line.

It’s not entirely clear how the budget would play out politically, as cuts to programs such as NPS have been historically unpopular. The administration’s calls for cuts to FEMA have also been met with mixed reviews even within the GOP, though, the budget proposal stops short of the administration’s broader calls to eliminate FEMA entirely.

The document that was released late Friday gives additional color to a less detailed “skinny budget” previously released by the administration. The skinny budget also proposed big cuts at similar agencies.

The previously announced document called for a 55 percent cut to the EPA’s overall budget and a 31 percent cut to the Interior Department, which houses the Park Service.

Josh Shapiro’s plan to expand the commonwealth’s renewable energy resources, the Trump administration ordered a fossil fuel-fired power plant outside Philadelphia to keep running past its planned retirement date.

The U.S. Department of Energy on Friday ordered Pennsylvania’s electricity grid operator PJM Interconnect and owner Constellation Energy to keep the Eddystone Generating Station in Delaware County ready to meet peak power demands. It was scheduled to cease operations Saturday.

The order highlights challenges facing Pennsylvania policymakers as they work to ensure there’s enough electricity for industry and residents while reducing greenhouse gas emissions.

Legislation that would set a more ambitious goal for renewable energy production in what Shapiro describes as an all-of-the-above approach to meeting demand passed a state House committee on Monday.

House Bill 501 would enact the Pennsylvania Reliability Energy Sustainability Standard (PRESS), which is part of Shapiro’s broader energy policy dubbed the Lightning Plan. It would require 35% of the state’s energy to come from clean sources including solar, wind, nuclear and other emerging technologies by 2040.

Other aspects of the plan would provide tax credits for renewable energy development and establish a dedicated board to streamline energy permitting to incentivize developers to prioritize clean energy.

While President Donald Trump has backed the oil, gas and coal industries since he campaigned for his first term in 2016, the DOE order to keep the Eddystone Generating Station online cited an “emergency situation” as PJM warned that electricity demand in the 13 states it serves could soon outpace the opening of new power plants.

PJM projects its peak demand will grow by about 70,000 megawatts to 220,000 megawatts by 2040. The growth is being driven by the increased electrification of transportation and industry and the proliferation of data centers to satisfy the demand for computing power from artificial intelligence and other technologies.

PJM’s process to authorize new power plants to connect to the grid faces a backlog including hundreds of gigawatts of renewable energy while about 20% of its existing generating capacity is expected to retire in the next five years.

Starting this month, consumers in Pennsylvania and the rest of PJM’s footprint will see electric bills increase by 10% to 20% as a result of soaring prices in last July’s capacity auction, in which electricity generators bid to provide generating capacity.

Pennsylvania, meanwhile, lags behind most of the nation in renewable energy development. An analysis of federal energy data by PennEnvironment put the commonwealth behind all but Washington and Alaska, which tied for last place.

Debate on the renewable energy legislation Monday in the House Environmental and Natural Resources Committee demonstrated the tension between Pennsylvania’s energy future and its past.

Republicans argued the goal of obtaining 35% of the state’s energy from clean sources by 2035 is unrealistic. Natural gas and coal provide reliable electricity while helping to drive Pennsylvania’s economy, they said.

Rep. Tim Twardzik (R-Schuylkill) said renewable energy sources including solar and wind power would take up too much land. And subsidizing them at the expense of established fossil fuel sources would hurt workers and consumers by taking away jobs and increasing prices.

“It’s just going to waste money and not solve our problems,” Twardzik said.

Democrats said diversifying the state’s energy portfolio is essential to staving off an energy crisis.

“We are at a crossroads,” Rep. Chris Pielli (D-Chester) said. “I think that we should be looking at many forms of energy, nuclear, geothermal, and even using our gas and our oil.”

Pielli rebutted claims by Republicans that the renewable energy legislation would create winners and losers. He argued Pennsylvania’s gas industry benefitted from a subsidy when lawmakers chose not to impose an excise tax on gas production, forgoing billions in revenue.

Deeply conservative Texas, Pielli noted, leads the nation in both natural gas production, wind and solar energy.

“Let’s look at that … recognizing that this bill is an opportunity that we can fine tune, where we can use any and all of these resources to protect our consumers going forward when it comes to our power,” he said.",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/wind-farm-1536x1026-1.jpeg,N,,2025-06-02 22:04:15.403645

DOE looks to ax renewable energy, grid funding Under the DOE's budget proposal, EERE funding to support solar, wind and renewable energy grid integration would be zeroed out.
Annual funding for geothermal energy, which Energy Secretary Chris Wright has championed, would increase from $118 million to $150 million.
Overall, the EERE's annual budget for renewable energy programs would shrink from $795 million to $240 million.
The budget removes support for BOEM's renewable energy program and technologies ""that facilitate unreliable, intermittent energy,"" Interior said in its brief.","The Trump administration would make deep cuts to federal renewable-energy programs and scientific research under its proposed fiscal year 2026 budget, which calls for reducing annual nondefense spending by $163 billion, or 23%, a newly released budget blueprint showed.

Among a swath of cuts under the spending plan, the Department of Energy proposed to reduce funding for its Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy by more than $2.5 billion, amounting to a 74% reduction compared to FY 2025 levels. Programs within the US Department of Interior that support renewable energy, such as offshore wind generation, would be eliminated.

The White House Office of Management and Budget published the details late May 30, days after Democratic appropriators noted the request would be the latest in US history. The OMB shared a partial budget blueprint with congressional appropriators in early May.

""Remarkably, it is not even complete, because it still lacks all manner of essential details,"" US Senator Patty Murray, Democrat-Washington, vice chair of the Senate Appropriations Committee, said in a statement.

With 60 votes required to advance appropriations bills in the Senate, Murray warned that the president's budget request ""is dead on arrival in Congress as long as I have anything to say about it.""

In addition to a 1,224-page budget appendix released by the OMB, some individual agencies published briefs on how they would prioritize spending under President Donald Trump's budget proposal.

The White House said in a brief overview document that the discretionary spending cuts would achieve savings by ""reducing or eliminating programs found to be woke and weaponized against ordinary working Americans, wasteful, or best left to the states and localities to provide.""

In contrast to cuts to some agencies, annual defense spending would rise by 13% to $1.01 trillion, and the Department of Homeland Security's annual budget would jump by 65% in FY 2026 — increases that assume the passage of a party-line GOP budget reconciliation bill working its way through Congress.

The administration is also proposing deep spending cuts in science research programs across agencies DOE and Interior. The reductions include $255.3 million and 358 jobs from the US Environmental Protection Agency's Science and Technology program and the elimination of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's entire research arm.

To overcome the Senate's 60-vote filibuster threshold, 10 Senate Democrats joined with Republicans to pass a continuing resolution in March that largely maintained FY 2024 appropriations levels for FY 2025. Lawmakers will need to pass another stopgap measure to keep the government open if Congress fails to reach a FY 2026 spending compromise by Sept. 30.

DOE looks to ax renewable energy, grid funding

Under the DOE's budget proposal, EERE funding to support solar, wind and renewable energy grid integration would be zeroed out. Annual funding for geothermal energy, which Energy Secretary Chris Wright has championed, would increase from $118 million to $150 million.

Overall, the EERE's annual budget for renewable energy programs would shrink from $795 million to $240 million.

""This budget request focuses on cost efficiencies and fiscal constraint and focuses EERE resources on the energy technologies that are best positioned to support American Energy Dominance — reliable, firm power that Americans can depend on and unleashing American energy innovation,"" the DOE said in its brief.

The DOE's budget request includes no mention of the Grid Deployment Office, which was established under the Biden administration. A line item titled ""grid deployment"" foresees annual funding levels falling from $60 million to $15 million, or 75%. Grid deployment activities would be reorganized under the DOE's Office of Electricity, which would also receive a 31% annual budget cut.

The DOE proposed to drop ""carbon management"" from its Office of Fossil Energy's title and cut funding for carbon transportation and storage and point-source capture by more than half. Funding for mineral production and processing technologies would grow from $70 million to $100 million.

The proposal would cut annual funding for DOE advanced nuclear reactor demonstration programs from $315 million to about $155 million. Meanwhile, the DOE is seeking $750 million in credit subsidy funding to support financing for small modular reactors and advanced nuclear reactors through its Loan Programs Office.

""The most efficient tool that the Department of Energy has to help the nuclear industry is the Loan Programs Office,"" Wright said during a May 21 Senate Appropriations Committee hearing. ""It's not direct grant dollars.""

The DOE also proposed to rescind nearly $2.3 billion in unobligated credit subsidies appropriated for its Advanced Technology Vehicles Manufacturing Loan Program. The program ""has primarily subsidized the financing of electric vehicle and related components manufacturing projects"" in a manner inconsistent with Trump's executive order on ""unleashing"" American energy, the DOE said.

Interior seeks to boost oil and gas development

The Interior Department's FY 2026 budget request includes $112.7 million for the Bureau of Land Management's onshore oil and gas management program — a 10% annual increase above appropriated levels.

BLM renewable energy activities would receive zero funding after nearly $40 million was appropriated in FY 2024. As of December 2024, the BLM had permitted 33 GW of renewable energy capacity on public lands, exceeding the Biden administration's previous goal of 25 GW by 2025.

The Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, another subagency within Interior, would see its total annual budget fall from $211 million to $148 million.

The budget removes support for BOEM's renewable energy program and technologies ""that facilitate unreliable, intermittent energy,"" Interior said in its brief. BOEM funding to support offshore wind development would be eliminated.

Interior noted that BOEM is currently developing its 11th National Outer Continental Shelf Oil and Gas Leasing Program, citing a recent finding that revealed that at least 23% more recoverable oil and gas exists in the Gulf of Mexico. BLM is also working to expand oil and gas exploration and development opportunities in the National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska and the coastal plain of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.

Some appropriators already voiced opposition to the administration's proposed spending priorities.

More than 19 million acres of federal land leased for oil and gas exploration and development currently sit idle, Senator Jeff Merkley, an Oregon Democrat, said during a May 21 appropriations hearing.

""You don't have an all-of-the-above energy policy, you have a fossils-above-all policy,"" Merkley said.

EPA proposes $122 million cut to clean air programs

In all, the EPA proposes to cut 1,274 full-time positions and 54% of the agency's budget in the next fiscal year. The cost savings would be achieved with major cuts from the agency's large Science and Technology and Environmental and Management programs, including its air quality work.

""The budget reduces support for areas that deviate from EPA's core mission and advances common-sense deregulations that will drive the economy forward and make it more affordable to own a car, heat a home, operate a business and bring manufacturing back to local communities,"" the agency wrote in its budget brief.

Specifically, clean air programs would see a $122 million cut, or a 41% reduction from 2025 levels.

The EPA is also proposing to focus less on oversight. The agency's proposal would eliminate all funding for its independent watchdog, the Office of Inspector General, while cutting nearly $184 million from its enforcement program — a 49% reduction from its current budget.",https://www.spglobal.com/content/dam/spglobal/ci/en/images/platts/general/favicon.ico,N,,2025-06-03 02:01:33.878700

The rescinded funding includes a $15.12 million award made to Skyven Technologies Inc. on Jan. 14, 2025, to support a project in Medina, New York. The OCED on Jan. 15 announced the approval of funding for a project titled “Steam-Generating Heat Pumps for Cross-Sector Deep Decarbonization.” That project, led by Skyven Technologies, included plans to partner with manufacturing facilities across multiple U.S. manufacturing sectors to pioneer a process-heat-as-a-service-model, with the initial partner expected to be Medina, N.Y.- based Western New York Energy, a 62 MMgy ethanol plant.

According to information previously published by the DOE, Skyven’s approach would electrify steam production to replace natural gas boilers to meet the needs of an energy intensive facility that currently relies on fossil-fired heat. By developing this technology, Skyven would demonstrate expertise and economic viability of this technology solution that can be replicated among diverse heat-using manufacturers. During Phase 1, Skyven was expected to complete initial conceptual and engineering studies for the project, provide documentation and reports necessary to complete the National Environmental Policy Act review, and engage community and labor stakeholders.

The rescinded funding also includes a $200 million award made to Technip on Dec. 16, 2024, to support a project in the Gulf Coast region. That project, titled the “Sustainable Ethyle from CO2 Utilization with Renewable Energy (SECURE)” project, was to be led by Technip Energies USA Inc. in partnership with LanzaTech Inc. The companies planned to demonstrate an integrated process to utilize captured carbon dioxide from ethylene production.

According to information released by the DOE last year, the project was expected to use LanzaTech’s gas fermentation technology, a biotech-based carbon recycling process, and power carbon intensity (CI) hydrogen to create sustainable ethanol and ethylene. Phase 1 included plans to conduct front end engineering design (FEED), develop project plans, provide documentation and reports necessary to complete NEPA review and engage with community and labor stakeholders.

“While the previous administration failed to conduct a thorough financial review before signing away billions of taxpayer dollars, the Trump administration is doing our due diligence to ensure we are utilizing taxpayer dollars to strengthen our national security, bolster affordable, reliable energy sources and advance projects that generate the highest possible return on investment,” said U.S. Secretary of Energy Chris Wright. “Today, we are acting in the best interest of the American people by cancelling these 24 awards.”",https://bbi-strapi.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/DOE_Logo_New_79cb622ca1.jpg,N,,2025-06-03 02:01:38.800690

“Material Assistance” — The Most Onerous Restriction Almost certainly the most significant restriction, the material assistance provision denies eligibility for any credit to any facility that receives “material assistance” from a prohibited foreign entity.
Exceptions: What doesn’t count as “Material Assistance”?","On May 12, 2025, the House Ways and Means Committee reported out a significant tax reconciliation bill, known as the “One, Big, Beautiful Bill.” While the bill aims to extend and enhance several provisions from the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, it introduces substantial new restrictions on clean energy tax credits related to the involvement of “foreign entities of concern” (FEOCs) (also referred to as “prohibited foreign entities”), particularly targeting Chinese entities. Although the OBBB as reported by the Ways and Means Committee provided some delay in some of the FEOC restriction effective dates, the House Rules Committee subsequently added a manager’s amendment to accelerate the effective dates of these restrictions. These accelerated deadlines were adopted in the version passed by the full House on May 22, 2025. (Please see our alert here regarding the full House-passed version.)

Most of the major Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) credits that survive in the bill are now subject to new FEOC restrictions. Additionally, credits §45Y, §48E, and §45X are subject to additional restrictions for facilities or projects deemed to receive “material assistance” from FEOCs. Below is a summary of the affected credits, including the date of termination and the effective date of FEOC restrictions:

*This table assumes enactment in 2025

Key provisions of the FEOC rule

Under the bill, eligibility for these credits is generally denied where a “prohibited foreign entity” (i.e., a FEOC) is involved in certain aspects of the facility’s development or ownership. There are several prongs:

Ownership: The facility cannot be owned, in whole or part, by a FEOC. In other words, it cannot be a “foreign-controlled entity.”

Control/Operation: FEOCs may not operate or have control rights over the project. In other words, it cannot be a “foreign-influenced entity.”

Use of Components or Assistance: The most sweeping limitation applies to any project whose construction “involves material assistance” from a FEOC.

“Material Assistance” — The Most Onerous Restriction

Almost certainly the most significant restriction, the material assistance provision denies eligibility for any credit to any facility that receives “material assistance” from a prohibited foreign entity. Material assistance is defined as:

Any component, subcomponent, or critical mineral (as defined under §45X(c)(6)) that is extracted, processed, recycled, manufactured, or assembled by a prohibited foreign entity;

Any design of the property that is based on copyrights, patents, know-how, or trade secrets provided by such entities.

Exceptions: What doesn’t count as “Material Assistance”?

The bill provides limited safe harbors for certain non-specialized materials:

Assembly parts and constituent materials do not constitute material assistance if they are:

Not uniquely designed or formulated for the type of facility or component that benefits from the tax credit; and

Not exclusively or predominantly produced or sourced from prohibited foreign entities.

A key interpretive question arises: would the fact that a component (say, steel or circuit boards) is used across a variety of facility types mean that it qualifies under the “not designed exclusively” clause? That seems plausible—and may be critical to structuring compliance strategies. However, the “predominantly available” test introduces ambiguity, especially in markets where supply chains are heavily concentrated in China.",https://jdsupra-static.s3.amazonaws.com/profile-images/og.15723_2410.jpg,N,,2025-06-03 00:05:07.714320

Interior Secretary Doug Burgum said Monday the Biden administration exceeded its authority when it enacted a rule to protect 13 million acres of a federal petroleum reserve in the Alaskan wilderness from energy extraction.

“Congress was clear: the National Petroleum Reserve in Alaska was set aside to support America’s energy security through responsible development,” Burgum said in a statement accompanying the proposed rescission of the Biden-era rule.

Burgum said the 2024 rule protecting the area was inconsistent with the almost 50-year-old Naval Petroleum Reserves Production Act, which set aside the area following the oil crisis of the early 1970s.

The Interior Department’s move to end protections for the area stems from a pair of executive orders President Donald Trump signed in January — one of them declaring a national energy emergency to increase domestic oil, gas and critical minerals production, and another to unleash Alaska’s natural resource potential.

“The State of Alaska holds an abundant and largely untapped supply of natural resources including, among others, energy, mineral, timber and seafood,” the executive order read. “Unlocking the bounty of natural wealth will raise the prosperity of our citizens while helping to enhance our nation’s economic and national security for generations to come.”

A rule enacted by the Biden administration in May 2024 designated 13 million of the 23 million acres on Alaska’s North Slope as special areas that could not be drilled unless doing so had few adverse effects. Located in the northernmost part of the state, it is an ecologically pristine area that has long been home to migratory birds, grizzly bears, caribou and moose on which dozens of indigenous communities subsist.

It is also known to contain large amounts of oil.

In a post to Twitter/X, Wright said oil production was the “engine of economic growth” in Alaska, funding more than 90% of the state’s general revenue. “Unleashing American energy goes hand in hand with unleashing American prosperity,” he wrote.

Donald Trump declared a “national energy emergency” on the first day of his second term of office in January, promising an avalanche of executive orders friendly to the fossil fuel industry and supporting his campaign message of “drill, baby drill”.

Environmental groups had long feared Alaska would be the US president’s number one target given the state’s abundance of untapped oil and gas reserves, and immediately criticized the move to open up drilling in an area crucial to the survival of imperiled Arctic species.

“The Trump administration’s move to roll back protections in the most ecologically important areas of the Western Arctic threatens wildlife, local communities, and our climate, all to appease extractive industries,” Kristen Miller, executive director of the Alaska Wilderness League, said in a statement.

“This is another outrageous attempt to sell off public lands to oil industry billionaires at the expense of one of the wildest places left in America.

“These lands are home to caribou, migratory birds, and vital subsistence resources that Indigenous communities have relied on for generations. The public fought hard for these protections, and we won’t stay silent while they’re dismantled.”

The NPR-A lies about 600 miles north of Anchorage, and is bordered by the Chukchi Sea to the west and Beaufort Sea to the north. It is the largest single area of public land in the US, the Times reported.

It was created at the beginning of the 20th century as an emergency fuel reserve for the military, and expanded to full commercial development in 1976 by an act of Congress. Lawmakers, however, ordered that land conservation measures and wildlife protections should be given prominence.

Trump’s efforts to turbocharge drilling in Alaska, however, have not been as popular as he would have liked. Despite a promise to “open up” the 19m-acre Arctic national wildlife refuge, a proposed auction of leases in January, authorized by the previous Congress but a crucial plank of the incoming president’s energy strategy, did not attract any bidders.",https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/36ebdf1ae8913f97eae261b39b4afb105606219c/394_0_3938_3151/master/3938.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=a55aee5d3bc7a7b47e5b3c707c5e9288,N,,2025-06-02 20:05:39.698171

“We’re proud to partner with companies like Onyx, Sol Systems, and Nelnet to bring clean, reliable energy to Lawrenceville.”","Onyx Renewables completed a 5.7 MW solar project that is expected to fulfill 85% of electricity demand at Toyota Boshoku America’s (TBA) Illinois manufacturing plant. The company develops and produces interior, filtration and powertrain components for automotive manufacturers.

TBA invested in solar to stabilize energy costs and contribute to the company’s broader sustainability goals. Initially, TBA chose Sol Systems to design and develop the project. The project was then acquired by Onyx Renewables. TBA signed a power purchase agreement with Onyx “without any upfront capital investment,” it said.

The ground mount array is located on 17 acres of land adjacent to the company’s manufacturing facility. The project includes 590 W Hanwha Qcells solar modules mounted on a single-axis tracker from Array Technologies. It also includes Chint Power Systems inverters. The solar array is expected to generate more than 9.5 million kWh of electricity in its first year, Onyx reported. Nelnet Renewable Energy is the engineering, procurement, and construction (EPC) partner.

Onyx said it worked with Nelnet to prioritize workforce development and environmental stewardship by allocating at least 15% of project labor for qualified apprentices and paying prevailing wages.

The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 includes a myriad of incentives including the production tax credit, investment tax credit, energy community adder, and more. In order to take advantage of these; however, solar developers must meet specific guidelines as far as pay, number of apprentices employed and ratio of workers who come from qualified apprenticeship programs.

(Read: “Final guidance released on IRA’s prevailing wage and apprenticeship requirements”)

The project also received additional federal tax credits as it is in a designated energy community due to the area’s unemployment and fossil fuel employment numbers compared to the national average. Projects in energy communities can qualify for the production and investment tax credit bonuses available within the IRA. Tax adders are offered for projects within these designated communities that are expected to face challenges in the transition away from fossil fuels.

(Read: “IRS releases updated guidance on energy communities”)

Sol Systems committed to planting a pollinator-friendly habitat around the system, and when Onyx acquired the project, it partnered with a local environmental consultant to design and implement a series of plantings in and around the PV system. The seed mix selected consists of several pollinator species that are local to Illinois and recognized by the Illinois Dept. of Natural Resources, Onyx told pv magazine USA.

“This project is a testament to what’s possible when manufacturers, clean energy developers, and local communities work together toward shared goals,” said Anna Toenjes, associate vice president of impact & business development at Sol Systems.

The 5.7 MW solar installation is TBA’s largest onsite to date, and a big step toward the company’s net-zero goal.

“This project reflects our commitment to reducing our carbon footprint and our dedication to supporting the communities where we operate. It is also a significant step towards our goal of achieving net-zero carbon emissions by 2050,” said Ryan Hunt, Vice President of TBA. “We’re proud to partner with companies like Onyx, Sol Systems, and Nelnet to bring clean, reliable energy to Lawrenceville.”",https://pv-magazine-usa.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/06/IMG_6606-1200x900.jpg,N,,2025-06-02 22:04:18.977533

The proposal includes cuts to federal tax credits for EV owners and manufacturers.

Tennessee is a leader in the EV industry in the Southeast, with three EV manufacturing plants and multiple battery plants under construction. The industry has created more than 16,300 jobs and drawn $17.6 billion in investments in the Volunteer State, according to the Electrification Coalition.

Federal tax credits for EV owners and manufacturers, which were a part of the Inflation Reduction Act passed in 2022, including an up to $7,500 tax credit for many who purchase an EV, have incentivized owning and building EVs, aiding the industry’s rapid growth, Ben Prochazka, the executive director of the Electrification Coalition told News 2.

“These credits were designed to help make sure that the U.S. is really a leader and can catch up to other countries that have really invested a lot more in the policy or just direct investments that can support the cultivation of that industry,” Prochazka said.

However, those federal tax credits could be cut if the Senate passes the budget bill as is. President Trump’s “Big Beautiful Bill” includes cuts to all tax credits regarding EVs.

Prochazka argued the cuts would put EV jobs and investments at risk.

“What the inflation reduction act credits did was it was intended to really unlock huge private sector investments, and that happened, but now those private sector investments are a question mark because companies that were planning to build battery manufacturing facilities and or vehicle manufacturing are slowing down and in some cases canceling those plans altogether,” Prochazka said. “If we don’t make these investments, we have the potential to fall way behind and lose vast numbers of automotive sector jobs, battery jobs, infrastructure jobs, and those are all really critical to states like Tennessee, but also across the country.”

President Trump has long spoken against the federal tax credits for EVs and has been vocal about his support for the traditional automotive industry and its workers.

By 2030, Kraft Heinz expected to decrease the use of natural gas at those sites by 97% and lower energy use by 23%.
Kraft Heinz said in an emailed statement that it’s aware of the Energy Department’s “unilateral” decision.
We will continue to drive energy efficiency projects forward as we make these investments,” Kraft Heinz said.
Its Plainfield facilities, located more than an hour southwest of Chicago, includes a bottling plant, opened in 1966, and a warehouse that employs more than 600.","The U.S. Department of Energy cut funding for two dozen clean energy projects across the U.S., including a $170 million grant for Chicago-based food manufacturer Kraft Heinz at 10 U.S. plants, including one in Champaign.

The cuts also include a $75 million grant for Diageo’s facilities in Plainfield and Shelbyville, Kentucky. The beverage giant’s brands include Johnnie Walker and Smirnoff.

U.S. Secretary of Energy Chris Wright on Friday announced the cancellation of 24 grants worth more than $3.7 billion, which were awarded during President Joe Biden’s administration.

“DOE found that these projects failed to advance the energy needs of the American people, were not economically viable and would not generate a positive return on investment of taxpayer dollars,” the agency said in a news release.

At the 10 plants, Kraft Heinz planned to install technologies such as heat pumps, electric heaters, electric boilers, anaerobic digestors, biogas boilers, solar thermal, solar photovoltaic and thermal energy storage, the company said in a news release last year.

By 2030, Kraft Heinz expected to decrease the use of natural gas at those sites by 97% and lower energy use by 23%.

The Champaign plant is Kraft Heinz’s largest facility by volume production in North America, according to its website. The site has more than 1,000 employees and makes Kraft Mac and Cheese, Miracle Whip, ketchup, A.1. sauce and other products.

Kraft Heinz anticipated creating about 500 construction jobs across the 10 plants that included Champaign; Columbia, Missouri; Fremont, Ohio; Holland, Michigan; Kendallville, Indiana; Lowville, New York; Mason City and Muscatine, Iowa; New Ulm, Minnesota; and Winchester, Virginia.

Kraft Heinz said in an emailed statement that it’s aware of the Energy Department’s “unilateral” decision.

“While we will continue to evaluate this decision, it does not change our intention to continue investing in our 30 U.S. manufacturing facilities. Over the next approximately five years, we plan to invest $3 billion to modernize our U.S. supply chain infrastructure. We will continue to drive energy efficiency projects forward as we make these investments,” Kraft Heinz said.

Diageo’s grant, announced in March 2024, aimed to electrify production sites in Plainfield and Kentucky to make them carbon neutral by 2028 and 2026, respectively, according to a company news release last year.

Its Plainfield facilities, located more than an hour southwest of Chicago, includes a bottling plant, opened in 1966, and a warehouse that employs more than 600.

Diageo planned to partner with Rondo Energy of California to install heat batteries to capture and store renewable energy, while eliminating reliance on natural gas for boilers used in heating.

Beverage industry production — including distilling, bottling, cleaning, pasteurization and HVAC systems — is energy-intensive and typically uses natural gas for heat. The new technology sought to replace natural gas and eliminate nearly 17,000 metric tons of direct greenhouse gas emissions each year at the Plainfield and Kentucky facilities, said Diageo’s news release last year. That’s “the equivalent of taking more than 4,046 gasoline-powered cars off the road for a year.”

Diageo touted the project as a potential model for industrial heat systems in other sectors such as steel, paper, concrete and glass, as well as food and beverage.

Diageo did not reply to requests for comment.

Advocacy group Industrious Labs said in a news release Friday, “Pulling the plug at this stage not only wastes public and private resources, it stalls urgently needed upgrades in a region heavily impacted by industrial air pollution. Cutting these projects also means violating legal contracts signed in good faith by private companies and the U.S. government.”

Evan Gillespie, partner at Industrious Labs, said in the release, “The Trump administration rolled out tariffs, arguing that these measures are necessary to revive manufacturing — yet, at the same time, they are canceling manufacturing projects nationwide and increasing energy costs for manufacturers.”

Gillespie added, “Canceling these projects also hurts American workers and regions most in need of investment, handing a competitive advantage to Europe, China, Canada, and other nations that are making significant investments in clean manufacturing while leaving the U.S behind.”",https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/bd05ed6/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5195x2966+0+0/resize/1461x834!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fda%2F54%2F44c2106c48458c32802d9a87f513%2F2215095669.jpg,N,,2025-06-02 19:08:43.003123

The Court also makes clear that judicial review of an agency's NEPA decision is not the same as review of the final project.
The Court described the effects of slowing down NEPA projects through judicial review, leading to fewer projects being approved and fewer jobs.","The U.S. Supreme Court issued a decision on May 29, 2025, in Seven County Infrastructure Coalition v. Eagle County (No. 23-975) that clarified the role of deference to agency expertise in carrying out obligations under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) and clarified application of the Loper Bright decision in the NEPA context. Consistent with prior precedent, the Court also set limits on agency consideration of other projects and the scope of effects in a NEPA review, declaring that upstream and downstream projects need not be considered unless they are under the agency's authority and so interrelated that they effectively constitute one single project. This Holland & Knight alert discusses the major takeaways of this agency-friendly decision and how it may have lasting effects on NEPA jurisprudence and reviews of projects under NEPA moving forward.

Background

NEPA requires federal agencies to create a ""detailed statement"" for ""major Federal actions significantly affecting the quality of the human environment.""1 NEPA's sliding-scale approach requires Environmental Impact Statements (EISs) for proposed actions with the potential for ""significant"" environmental effects and allows for the preparation of an Environmental Assessment (EA) to determine whether a project will have ""significant"" environmental effects. In certain instances, a Categorical Exclusion (CatEx) expedites the NEPA process, where an agency has determined that a category of action would not normally, individually or cumulatively, have potential for significant environmental impacts absent extraordinary circumstances.

The NEPA statute was amended in 2023, with significant amendments adopted to the Council on Environmental Quality's (CEQ) NEPA regulations in 2020, 2022 and 2024. Since President Donald Trump took office in 2025, his administration has prioritized deregulation and expediting of project permitting and approval processes, including rescission of CEQ's NEPA regulations in the wake of several courts explicitly holding that CEQ lacks rulemaking authority. (See Holland & Knight's previous alerts ""Adding Fuel to the Fires Calling for Permitting Reform,"" Nov. 26, 2024, and ""Court's Denial of Review Leaves Open Questions of CEQ Authority,"" Feb. 3, 2025.) Thus, there has been significant flux in the NEPA context within the past six months that continues to evolve. The long-awaited Seven County decision is the latest action in this timeline of events that will impact NEPA decisions moving forward.

Seven County Case

In 2020, the Seven County Infrastructure Coalition, a group of Utah counties, proposed an 88-mile intrastate railroad project to connect the Uinta Basin to the national freight rail network. Because the project required approval from the Surface Transportation Board (STB), NEPA review of the project was triggered. After STB prepared an EIS and approved the project, Eagle County, Colorado, and other environmental groups challenged the sufficiency of the NEPA review in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. The Court ruled in August 2023 that the STB had committed ""numerous NEPA violations"" by failing to adequately analyze indirect environmental impacts and remanded the matter for further proceedings. (See Eagle County, Colorado v. Surface Transportation Board, No. 22-1019 (D.C. Cir. 2023).) The Seven County Infrastructure Coalition, along with the STB, filed a petition for a writ of certiorari before the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court granted the writ ""in light of the continuing confusion and disagreement in the Courts of Appeals over how to handle NEPA cases"" and ""to reiterate and clarify the fundamental principles of judicial review applicable to those cases.""

Supreme Court Decision

In an 8-0 decision delivered by Justice Brett Kavanaugh on May 29, 2025, the Supreme Court reversed and remanded the D.C. Circuit Court's decision, holding that the circuit court 1) did not afford the agency the ""substantial judicial deference"" required in NEPA cases and 2) misinterpreted NEPA to require consideration of other projects. The Supreme Court emphasized its intent to ""reiterate and clarify the fundamental principles of judicial review in [NEPA] cases,"" which, in the eyes of the Court, ""is deference.""

Interestingly, the Supreme Court did not opine on the validity of CEQ regulations or CEQ's regulatory authority, despite the recent executive and judicial activity on that issue.

Key Takeaways

There are several main takeaways from the majority Seven County opinion.

Agencies Are Afforded Substantial Deference in the NEPA Context

Despite the Court's recent holding in Loper Bright v. Raimondo, 603 U.S. 639 (2024), overturning Chevron deference and holding that deference to agency on questions of law, such as interpretation of federal statutes, conflicts with the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), and courts must exercise ""independent judgment in deciding whether an agency has acted within its statutory authority"" and ""ensur[e] the agency has engaged in 'reasoned decisionmaking' within those boundaries."" The Court nonetheless made clear that courts must afford substantial agency deference in judicial review of NEPA decisions, and that deference extends to what details are (and are not) included in the NEPA decision documents. The Court emphasized that courts ""should not micromanage agency choices so long as they fall within a broad zone of reasonableness"" (emphasis added).

In so holding, the Court appears to clarify the extent of Loper Bright application consistent with its language in that decision. Notably, the Court states in the Seven County decision that ""when an agency exercises discretion granted by a statute, judicial review is typically conducted under [a] deferential arbitrary-and-capricious standard."" Yet, like many statutes, NEPA is a broadly worded statute that does not expressly provide discretion over every aspect of NEPA decision-making. The Court reconciles Loper Bright in this decision by reasoning, for example, that the requirement that an EIS be ""detailed"" is a statutory question of law to be decided by a court, but the question of what needs to be included in order for the EIS to meet the ""detailed"" requirement is a question of fact that should be left up to the agency.

NEPA Is a Purely Procedural Statute

It is a bedrock NEPA principle that the statute imposes only a procedural, not a substantive, obligation on agencies, but the Court takes time to emphasize its importance in the Seven County decision. In the words of the Court, ""[u]nder NEPA, an agency's only obligation is to prepare an adequate report."" The Court contrasts NEPA to other environmental statutes that have substantive requirements – such as the Clean Air Act and Clean Water Act – to emphasize that NEPA has no substantive constraints on the agency's decision. ""Because an EIS is only one input into an agency's decision and does not itself require any particular substantive outcome, the adequacy of an EIS is relevant only to the question of whether an agency's final decision … was reasonably explained."" This principle underlies the Court's position that agencies are to be afforded substantial deference in conducting a NEPA review, including the extent of detail included in a NEPA decision document given the statute's purely procedural nature. This is consistent with the prior line of cases on deference to agency expertise, but not questions of law.

The Court also makes clear that judicial review of an agency's NEPA decision is not the same as review of the final project. Because NEPA is a procedural statute, a court cannot consider whether the project should have been approved but whether the final decision was reasonable and reasonably explained in the EIS. The Court also stressed that in some cases a deficient NEPA decision may not require a court to vacate the ultimate project approvals where corrections to the NEPA decision would not change the course of the project as approved, which is consistent with the APA's statement that ""due account shall be taken of the rule of prejudicial error."" 5 U.S.C. § 706. This will have some significance in future NEPA litigation as lower courts fashion relief.

Agencies Determine Scope of Environmental Effects to Be Reviewed

Because an agency is afforded substantial deference when complying with NEPA's procedural requirements, the Court emphasized that an agency is also afforded substantial deference in determining the scope of the environmental effects that it will address in its NEPA review of a project, and that courts must give agencies ""broad latitude to draw a 'manageable line'"" (citing Public Citizen v. Department of Transportation).2

As described by the Court:

""So long as the EIS addresses environmental effects from the project at issue, courts should defer to agencies' decisions about where to draw the line, including 1) how far to go in considering indirect environmental effects from the project at hand and 2) whether to analyze environmental effects from other projects separate in time or place from the project at hand.""

To support this conclusion, the Court reminded the public of another bedrock NEPA principle: the rule of reason. Agencies apply the rule of reason to determine whether and to what extent an EIS is necessary, and a court may not ""substitute its judgment for that of the agency"" unless the agency was unreasonable.

NEPA Review Need Not Include Consideration of Other Projects

Regarding the question of whether and to what extent agencies need to consider the environmental effects of other, geographically or temporally separate projects, the Court held that the circuit court had misinterpreted NEPA to find that the agency was required to address environmental effects from other projects. Instead, NEPA requires agencies to focus only ""on the environmental effects of the project at issue.""

Here, the agency had determined that upstream oil drilling and downstream oil refining were separate from the railroad project at issue, reasoning that they were not two phases of a single action but separate, independent projects. The Court determined that this approach was ""absolutely correct,"" explaining that the statutory focus of NEPA is on the ""proposed action,""3 and that effects from a separate project are not required to be evaluated. The Court differentiated between entirely separate projects, which are not required to be evaluated, and environmental effects of the project itself that may occur in a different geographical area or time, which are required to be evaluated as indirect effects. Applying Public Citizen, the Court reasoned that separate projects break the chain of proximate causation, even if they are factually foreseeable, and there is no ""reasonably close causal relationship"" between the project under review and the other, separate projects.

The Court also noted that the separate projects in this case fell outside of the reviewing agency's authority because other agencies possess the regulatory authority over the other projects. ""As this Court stated in one of the more important sentences in the NEPA canon, 'where an agency has no ability to prevent a certain effect due to its limited statutory authority over the relevant actions, the agency cannot be considered a legally relevant 'cause' of the effect'"" (citing Public Citizen, 541 U.S., 770). In other words, ""agencies are not required to analyze the effects of projects over which they do not exercise regulatory authority.""

Lastly, the Court rejected any notion of ""but-for causation"" as a reason for requiring agencies to consider other, separate projects. Just because Project A may make it more likely or more foreseeable that Project B will materialize does not necessitate review of the environmental effects of Project B when reviewing Project A. However, the Court did note that there may be certain circumstances in which other projects are so interrelated and close in time and place so as to constitute a single project within the authority of the reviewing agency, which is a decision up to the agency that should be afforded substantial deference.

NEPA Cannot Be Used as a Tool to Block or Delay Projects

Justice Kavanaugh's opinion emphasized that NEPA cannot be used as a tool to slow down or block projects, which in turn ""caused litigation-averse agencies to take ever more time and to prepare ever longer EISs for future projects."" The Court described the effects of slowing down NEPA projects through judicial review, leading to fewer projects being approved and fewer jobs. ""A 1970 legislative acorn has grown over the years into a judicial oak that has hindered infrastructure development 'under the guise' of just a little more process."" The Court urges that ""a course correction"" is necessary to return judicial review of NEPA decisions back to Congress' original intent. The opinion also cautions other courts from applying a lesser deference standard in judicial review of NEPA decisions, which causes ""overly intrusive"" review of in NEPA cases.

What Does This Mean and How Holland & Knight Can Help

The Court makes clear that courts are to give agencies deference in the context of NEPA review, particularly as it relates to scoping. Specifically, the Court emphasized that NEPA does not require evaluation of other, separate projects that are not under agency authority and are not so interrelated that they effectively constitute one project, thereby narrowing how far an agency must take its NEPA review.

Though the Court has made clear that judicial review of NEPA decisions are largely unaffected by the Loper Bright decision, it is likely to see further refinement of post-Loper deference in other contexts as courts grapple with the impacts of the Loper Bright decision in light of the Seven County decision.

This decision also coincides with federal agencies' undertaking rulemaking processes to update their NEPA regulations, pursuant to President Trump's ""Unleashing American Energy"" Executive Order (EO) 14154, dated Jan. 20, 2025. Agencies may consider and incorporate these conceptual limits on project scoping into their NEPA-implementing regulations.

Finally, the Court's determination that environmental effects of other, geographically or temporally separate projects are not warranted in a NEPA review will likely mean that ""indirect"" and ""cumulative"" effects4 will be narrowly defined or eliminated in future NEPA reviews and rulemaking.

Holland & Knight is closely tracking how agencies respond to the Seven County decision in modifying their NEPA procedures and how lower courts may apply Seven County and Loper Bright. For updated information on the matter, please contact the authors.

Alternatives To Extending A Coal Power Plant.
Nuclear power is in the news since President Trump unleashed on May 23 executive orders on accelerating nuclear technologies.","We are used to executive orders from President Trump, including one on April 8 stating that the Department of Energy (DOE) could step in and prevent coal-fired power plants from closing if an emergency shortage of electricity existed in that region. But few expected the DOE to step in so soon and force a coal plant in Michigan to stay open on May 23 just a week before the closure date.

This upends a lot of thinking about pollution of coal power plants, so how are the feds justifying this action?

The Campbell Power Plant In West Olive, Michigan.

Bloomberg Green Newsletter on May 30 reported that the Energy Secretary, Chris Wright, announced on May 23 that the Campbell plant in West Olive, Michigan, will stay open for another three months under authority of the Federal Power Act.

The plant is old, built in 1962, but generates a lot of electricity, 1.45 GW (gigawatts). It had planned to be closed by the owner, Consumers Energy, on May 31.

Why the sudden fed action? An emergency order from Wright said, “I hereby determine that an emergency exists in portions of the Midwest region of the United States due to a shortage of electric energy, a shortage of facilities for the generation of electric energy, and other causes.”

Is It A Real Emergency?

There are two sides of the coin, according to the Bloomberg report. On one side is the Midcontinent Independent System Operator (MISO), a regional enterprise extending from Montana to Michigan and south to Louisiana and Texas. MISO has pointed out an increased risk of electricity shortages this summer, due to greater demand from industry and data centers, but also due to closing of fossil-fueled plants. In the next five years, over 120 coal plants in the U.S. are planned to close. The last 80 coal-fired plants in the U.S. are scheduled to close by 2040.

On the other hand, an electricity emergency doesn’t exist, according to MISO and Michigan officials. MISO’s analysis showed generating capacity was sufficient for this year. The Public Service Commission of Michigan said the recent order from the DOE was unnecessary. The order would also boost the cost of electricity in Michigan and across the Midwest. The owner of the plant, Consumers Energy, has been deferring maintenance of the plant, and no longer ships coal there; it also has plans to move workers elsewhere. In short, to fix up the plant in order to keep it open would be costly.

It’s Not Good To Not Close A Coal-Fired Power Plant.

Coal electricity is now down to 15% from its peak of 50% U.S. supply in 2011. Why? One answer is renewables and batteries are cheaper. Another answer is air pollution. As documented by Bloomberg and Pope, in their book Climate Of Hope, “Particulate matter from burning coal contributes to strokes, heart disease, lung disease, and cancer. If we could eliminate all the coal-fired power plants in China and India alone, we would save half a million lives every year.” The book attributes 7 million deaths globally from air pollution. Note: these are 2017 numbers.

The book distinguishes air pollution from carbon pollution (climate change), which is also discussed in the book under the headings of Rising Seas, Severe Heat, Ocean Life, and Political Instability. Coal burns dirty and is the worst source of carbon polluting greenhouse gases. Fossil energies provide about 83% of the world’s energy, but cause around 73% of greenhouse emissions.

So, extending the life of a coal-fired power plant does not seem to be the best solution to an electrical crisis if or when it happens.

Alternatives To Extending A Coal Power Plant.

Here is a recent summary of several alternatives that were laid out with arguments pro and con.

Natural gas power plants provide 43% of grid electricity in the U.S., so gas plants would be using technology that the country already relies upon. Although Rystad Energy argue that global power demand will increase strongly this year and in years ahead, they predict fossil fuels will peak shortly in the power sector.

Nuclear power is in the news since President Trump unleashed on May 23 executive orders on accelerating nuclear technologies. First, the cost of new nuclear reactors, whether traditional reactors or SMRs, is substantially higher than renewable energies. Second is the ubiquitous threat of exposure to nuclear radiation, either from nuclear accidents or from underground storage of nuclear waste. Third is that modern forms of nuclear energy, including SMRs, are at the commercial starting gate, illustrated by one of the first domestic contracts that was canceled by a Utah community when the SMR price grew 50% more than agreed to.

Renewables. As well as commercial success in Australia, 90% of new energy in the U.S. in 2024 was provided by wind and solar renewables. Globally, renewables are rising and catching up to fossil sources in their percentages of electric power.

There are three clear advantages of renewables. One is commercial success of current operations in the U.S. and Australia. Two is cheaper cost, particularly PV solar and storage batteries. Three, renewables tied to grid-scale batteries provide dispatchable power.

Dispatchable Power Is Needed And Renewables Have It.

As energy secretary Chris Wright commented on Trump’s executive order unleashing nuclear electricity, “Nuclear has the potential to be America’s greatest source of energy addition. It works whether the wind is blowing, or the sun is shining, is possible anywhere and at different scales.”

The latter sentence is a negative reference to non-dispatchable renewable energies. But this is false: when a battery energy storage system (BESS) is connected to wind or solar, it makes the energy dispatchable. For example, in the state of South Australia renewables plus BESS have been providing 72% of grid electricity continuously for three years, and this is expected to rise to 100% by 2027. Renewables plus batteries have proven the stability of renewables commercially.

Rystad Energy has reported that global battery systems set a record 200 gigawatt-hours (GWh) last year, implying a growth rate of 80%. Beginning at 0.5 terawatts (TW) in 2024, total BESS capacity will rise by almost ten times to over 4 TW by 2040.

BESS, first built in 2017 by Elon Musk as the Hornsdale Power Reserve in South Australia, are expanding rapidly in the U.S. Intermittent power is no longer a reason to dismiss renewables, because BESS have solved this problem and solar and wind renewables with BESS are dispatchable.

The answer to an electricity crisis in the U.S., which may be coming with the AI revolution, is renewables—especially PV solar plus battery storage, because they are cheaper and faster to install. Growth in U.S. renewables, strong in 2024, will continue to provide dispatchable power for new data centers, industry decarbonization, and also electric vehicles.",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/683e0e5518c3e3d28036700b/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,N,,2025-06-02 19:07:58.908544

per kilowatt-hour, and Flathead Electric offers a lower rate of 9 cents/KWH for off-peak hours. A trip of 100 miles with the Bolt costs $3.07 and a little less if they charge at night. An average, front-wheel drive gas car, for the same trip, costs $12.13 (26.4 miles/gallon at

Furthermore, in five years there has been no maintenance or repair costs on the Bolt, while regular maintenance of the gas-powered car has been about $100/year.

Once dominant coal-fired power plants are being retired because they’re not economical to run. They’re also being phased out under a law to fight climate change that passed in 2021.

“We’re at an existential point with power,” said Mark Denzler, chief executive of the Illinois Manufacturers Association.

The problem with the recent energy proposal, according to business groups, is that the battery storage plan alone would have an estimated cost of $7 billion, and that money would be paid by electricity customers, including big businesses.

Denzler’s organization, which includes the state’s largest manufacturing companies, opposed the recent plan in Springfield but notes the problem needs to be addressed. His members use about a third of the state’s power, he said.

“Our view on energy is we need generation, transmission and new technologies like battery storage that can be done in an affordable manner,” Denzler said.

“For New Mexicans, clean car and charging tax credits are continuing in full force and New Mexico’s commitment to providing both economic opportunities and a clean, healthy environment remain in place,” state Environment Department spokesperson Jorge Armando Estrada wrote in an email to The New Mexican.

The measures, which passed the Senate on May 22 and the U.S. House a few weeks earlier, will have ripple effects to other states, like New Mexico, that have adopted similar standards to those in California. With mostly Republican support but with a handful of Democrats crossing the aisle, federal lawmakers voted to overturn a series of waivers given to California which allowed the state to adopt stricter environmental standards than the federal government’s and allowed for the adoption of regulations to phase in more and more clean vehicles.

California’s regulation mandated that no new gas-powered cars be sold in the state by 2035. Because several other Democratic-run states, including New Mexico, adopted standards based on California’s, the waivers acted as a Jenga block: Pull it out, and the whole tower built on top of it can fall.

President Donald Trump has said he supports rolling back the electric vehicle mandate. Estrada called the congressional vote one example of several “damaging and destabilizing actions” taken on the federal level that impact the adoption of lower-emission vehicles.

“New Mexico commits to continuing to collaborate on solutions that tackle vehicle pollution and make cleaner vehicles more affordable and accessible through its participation in the Affordable Clean Cars Coalition,” Estrada wrote.

California isn’t giving up its waivers without a fight. Last week, California Gov. Gavin Newsom called the votes “illegal” and announced the state would be filing a lawsuit in response. The U.S. Senate’s actions, Newsom said, overturned decades of precedent allowing California to set stricter pollution standards.

And they have friends in the fight, including New Mexico. The state joined a new coalition of almost a dozen states, known as the Affordable Clean Cars Coalition, that aims to continue efforts to transition to lower-emission vehicles and “preserve states’ Clean Air Act authority” to address vehicle emissions.

Even if electric vehicle proponents lose in court, there are still other measures in effect in New Mexico to encourage moving away from gas-powered cars. The state’s Clean Car Tax Credit offers up to $3,000 for residents buying certain electric, plug-in hybrid or fuel cell vehicles, which are electric cars powered by chemical reaction. The Public Service Company of New Mexico also announced it is launching another $4,000 incentive for income-qualified customers later this year, in addition to its existing rebate program for charging ports.

The votes to overturn California’s waivers also does not impact a recent proposal by the New Mexico Environment Department to establish a clean fuels standard. The program, which creates a system of credit and debits — exceed state standards, and be required to buy credits, fall below and earn credits — is authorized under a different state law passed in 2024.

“Although complementary for reduction of vehicle emissions, the clean fuels program operates independently from the program targeted by the U.S. House and Senate vote,” Estrada wrote.

Among the canceled awards was $331 million to Exxon Mobil Corp. for a project to use hydrogen instead of natural gas at the company’s Baytown, Texas, Olefins Plant.
The announcement comes roughly two weeks after the Energy Department moved to audit more than $15 billion in grants and other support awarded by the Biden administration for upgrading power grids and manufacturing energy technology.
It also follows an internal agency proposal to shut down the $27 billion clean energy office, which under former President Joe Biden provided billions for a network of hydrogen hubs, carbon capture projects and other clean energy technology.

The agency said the move came after it found the projects “failed to advance the energy needs of the American people, were not economically viable and would not generate a positive return on investment of taxpayer dollars.”

Sixteen of the 24 projects were awarded during the Biden administration between Election Day and President Donald Trump’s Jan. 20 inauguration, the department said in a statement.

Among the canceled awards was $331 million to Exxon Mobil Corp. for a project to use hydrogen instead of natural gas at the company’s Baytown, Texas, Olefins Plant.

The announcement comes roughly two weeks after the Energy Department moved to audit more than $15 billion in grants and other support awarded by the Biden administration for upgrading power grids and manufacturing energy technology. Under an audit policy announced May 15, the department told beneficiaries of agency grants and support that they must quickly comply with requests for information or risk cancellation.

It also follows an internal agency proposal to shut down the $27 billion clean energy office, which under former President Joe Biden provided billions for a network of hydrogen hubs, carbon capture projects and other clean energy technology.

Under an internal plan to eliminate the agency, billions of dollars for hydrogen hubs would have been eliminated as well as carbon capture and battery storage projects. Also slated for termination was a direct air capture project by a subsidiary of Occidental Petroleum Corp. that had been selected for an award of as much as $1.2 billion by the Biden administration.

Other canceled awards announced Friday included $375 million to Eastman Chemical Co. for a molecular recycling project in Longview, Texas; and $270 million to a subsidiary of Calpine Corp. for work on a carbon capture project at Exxon’s Baytown facility.

Interior Secretary Doug Burgum said the Biden administration had exceeded its authority last year when it banned oil and gas drilling in more than half of the 23 million-acre area, known as the National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska.
“We’re restoring the balance and putting our energy future back on track,” Mr. Burgum said in a statement.
But in 1976, Congress authorized full commercial development of the federal land and ordered the government to balance oil drilling with conservation and wildlife protection.
Matt Jackson, the Alaska State senior manager at The Wilderness Society, an environmental group, called the repeal of environmental protections an outrage.","The Trump administration said on Monday that it planned to eliminate federal protections across millions of acres of Alaskan wilderness, a move that would allow drilling and mining in some of the last remaining pristine wilderness in the country.

Interior Secretary Doug Burgum said the Biden administration had exceeded its authority last year when it banned oil and gas drilling in more than half of the 23 million-acre area, known as the National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska.

The proposed repeal is part of President Trump’s aggressive agenda to “drill, baby, drill,” which calls for increased oil and gas extraction on public lands and the repeal of virtually all climate and environmental protections.

“We’re restoring the balance and putting our energy future back on track,” Mr. Burgum said in a statement.

The National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska is an ecologically sensitive expanse of land about 600 miles north of Anchorage, bounded by the Chukchi Sea to the west and the Beaufort Sea to the north. It is the largest single area of public land in the United States. It covers crucial habitat for grizzly bears, polar bears, caribou, thousands of migratory birds and other wildlife.

Created in the early 1900s, the reserves were originally envisioned as a fuel supply for the Navy in times of emergency. But in 1976, Congress authorized full commercial development of the federal land and ordered the government to balance oil drilling with conservation and wildlife protection.

Mr. Burgum accused the Biden administration of prioritizing “obstruction over production and undermining our ability to harness domestic resources at a time when American energy independence has never been more critical.”

The announcement came as Mr. Burgum traveled to Alaska, accompanied by Lee Zeldin, the administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, and Chris Wright, the secretary of the Energy Department. The three were expected to encourage companies to drill in sensitive areas like the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and to support a liquefied natural gas pipeline in the state.

The plan to allow drilling in the petroleum reserve drew praise from the oil industry.

Emissions from the burning of fossil fuels are the main driver of climate change, which is heating the planet and creating dangerous new weather patterns. Alaska is warming at a rate two to three times as fast as the global average, resulting in thawing permafrost and melting sea ice. It is also disrupting the hunting, fishing and food-gathering practices of Indigenous communities.

Alaska Native groups have been divided over the Trump administration’s plans for the region.

“Too often, federal decisions that affect our homelands are made without the engagement of the North Slope Inupiat, the people these decisions will affect the most,” said Nagruk Harcharek, president of Voice of the Arctic Inupiat, which represents Inupiat leadership organizations on the North Slope and supports oil and gas projects.

The group supports allowing oil and gas projects in the region, and Mr. Harcharek said the visit by Mr. Burgum and others “shows the federal government sees our communities and people as partners, not a check-the-box exercise.”

Others said opening up the reserve threatened to destroy habitat for caribou and thousands of migratory birds, and would put communities that depend on subsistence hunting at risk.

“This is very concerning to us,” said Rosemary Ahtuangaruak, a former mayor of the predominantly Inupiaq city of Nuiqsut.

Is the increase in ethanol production in the U.S. associated with a corresponding increase in the number of operating ethanol plants?
Recently, Brazil has begun growing more corn and constructed new corn ethanol plants similar to the U.S. plants.
Currently, there are cellulosic ethanol plants in Brazil that represent a very small portion of the country’s total ethanol production.
POET’s Project Liberty resulted in an operating cellulosic ethanol plant as part of an operating corn ethanol plant.","Ethanol has become a major part of America’s energy landscape.

It was first used in cars, and is now mixed into most gasoline sold in the U.S. This rise has been driven by environmental concerns, energy security and advances in technology. Today, ethanol helps reduce carbon emissions while creating jobs and supporting rural economies.

Dr. Greg Gelles, professor emeritus of economics, and Dr. Joseph Smith, professor in the Linda and Bipin Doshi Department of Chemical and Biochemical Engineering, are experts in the economics, environmental impact and future ethanol production in America.

Both Gelles and Smith responded to the following questions.

Can you give a brief history of ethanol production in the United States?

Ethanol was first used as an automotive fuel in the 1920s and 30s. In early 2000, ethanol demand grew significantly due to energy security concerns and the U.S.’s increased dependence on imported oil. Environmental concerns related to Methyl tert-butyl ethers (MTBEs), used as fuel oxygenate, created additional demand.

In 2007, President George W. Bush signed the Energy Independence and Security Act with the goal of increasing renewable fuel production to 36 billion gallons by 2022.

What is the present volume of ethanol production in the United States?

U.S. ethanol production increased every year since 2000 with 2024 production reaching a record 16 billion gallons for an annualized growth rate of less than 8% per year. In addition, 2024 ethanol exports were 1.9 billion gallons with Canada importing nearly 50% of our exports. Iowa ranks as the largest state producer at 4.9 billion gallons. Most cars today use gasoline blended with ethanol (10% ethanol and 90% gasoline) referred to as E10. Some vehicles are tuned to use E85 (85% ethanol and 15% gasoline).

Is the increase in ethanol production in the U.S. associated with a corresponding increase in the number of operating ethanol plants?

The number of U.S. ethanol plants reached a maximum in 2011, when the corn farm subsidy was removed and decreased until 2015. The number has remained steady since then. During our visit to POET’s ethanol plant in Laddonia, Missouri, in 2013, they produced about 50 million gallons while in 2025 they produced over 80 million gallons.

In 2013, they produced about 2.7 gallons of ethanol per bushel of corn while today they produce 2.97 gallons per bushel, and they expect to produce less than three gallons per bushel next year. Significant advancements in agricultural science related to new hybrid corn and advanced farming techniques have also increased corn production from 150 bushels per acre to over 190 bushels per acre today.

To what extent is the ethanol market sustained by federal subsidies?

Steve Murphy, POET’s Laddonia plant manager, said that direct farm subsidies for U.S. ethanol blenders ended in 2011, although some states (including Missouri) still have a $0.05 per gallon incentive for blends less than 10% (for example, E15) but this “blenders credit” is paid to refiners, not ethanol producers. Steve also said there is a federal tax credit of 45 cents per gallon of ethanol when blended with gasoline.

Is corn the main raw material used worldwide in making ethanol?

Today, over 80% of the world’s ethanol production occurs in the U.S. and Brazil. While most of the U.S. ethanol is derived from corn, Brazil produces most of their ethanol from sugar cane. Recently, Brazil has begun growing more corn and constructed new corn ethanol plants similar to the U.S. plants.

As a biofuel that adds no net CO2 to the atmosphere, why is there an effort to capture the CO2? Does that add to the cost?

To reduce transportation’s carbon footprint, the government is focused on lowering the carbon intensity (CI) of transportation. Support for electric vehicles using renewable energy to generate required electricity and increasing the blend level for ethanol in gasoline are other ways being used to reduce transportation’s CI.

Mandates to use the Department of Energy’s GREET software to estimate the CI for transportation is now required for all government grants and loan guarantees. A recent university study concluded that ethanol has a CI score of 41.7% lower than gasoline. So, using E85 would reduce the transportation carbon footprint in the U.S. with additional savings possible.

In modern day ethanol plants, what products are made other than ethanol?

During our plant visits to Laddonia, we witnessed the hybridization of POET’s ethanol production. Today, they produce animal feed (distillers’ grain), as well as corn oil, dry ice and electricity (used to power the plant with excess sold back to their provider). Producing multiple products has increased their economic performance.

Is there a future for cellulosic ethanol?

Cellulosic ethanol is made from non-food plant materials (such as corn cobs, grass or wood waste). The challenge in producing ethanol from cellulose is that the starch content is much lower, thus ethanol production is lower and more expensive. Currently, there are cellulosic ethanol plants in Brazil that represent a very small portion of the country’s total ethanol production.

Brazil has said their plan is to build 20 more plants by 2027. Over the years, the U.S. government has funded several attempts to develop a profitable cellulosic ethanol plant. POET’s Project Liberty resulted in an operating cellulosic ethanol plant as part of an operating corn ethanol plant. This plant has since been decommissioned due to lower economic performance. An article in the March 2025 edition of Ethanol Producer Magazine announced “New Energy Blue” will build a cellulosic ethanol plant in Iowa using corn stover as its feedstock and projected to provide 20 million gallons of ethanol per year.

The idea of using low quality feedstock to produce biofuel is one of those projects that Gelles claims will never happen. Smith is more optimistic and believes, like other engineering challenges, society will eventually figure out how to make ethanol from cellulose economically.

Has the growth in the ethanol industry had a positive economic impact on rural America?

The local economic impact of POET’s Ladonnia plant is clear. This plant has created 50 high paying jobs and increased corn demand from local farmers. The ethanol market has had a positive economic impact on the total U.S. economy as well.

In 2024, the Renewable Fuels Association concluded that in 2023 about 72,400 U.S. jobs were directly associated with the ethanol industry with an additional 322,000 indirect jobs supported by the industry. They reported that the industry generated $32.5 billion in household income and contributed just over $54.2 billion to the nation’s gross domestic product.

Last week the Supreme Court weighed in—and agreed with these critics of NEPA abuse.
The case before the Court was Seven County Infrastructure Coalition v. Eagle County.
After the Surface Transportation Board completed a comprehensive 3,600-page environmental impact statement, they gave the Coalition the go-ahead for the project.
The analysis, that 3,600-page environmental impact statement, correctly was about the railroad and its impacts.","Fifty-five years ago, Congress passed and President Richard Nixon signed the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) into law. For a number of infrastructure projects that are built, funded, or approved by the federal government, NEPA requires federal agencies to prepare an environmental impact statement, or EIS. That EIS is essentially a public report that must (by law) address the significant environmental effects of a proposed project and identify feasible alternatives that could mitigate those effects.

When NEPA works correctly, it helps agencies make better decisions and ensure good project management. But NGOs, partisan advocacy groups, and activists have turned NEPA into a tool used to delay and, in many cases, altogether prevent development and innovation in the United States.

For years, scholars on both sides of the ideological divide—and Congress itself—have recognized that the misuse of NEPA needs to stop so the country can build much-needed infrastructure and other projects. Last week the Supreme Court weighed in—and agreed with these critics of NEPA abuse.

The case before the Court was Seven County Infrastructure Coalition v. Eagle County. It revolved around the “Seven County Infrastructure Coalition” building a railroad line connecting Utah’s Uinta Basin to the national freight rail network, which would allow the shipment of crude oil to refineries elsewhere. After the Surface Transportation Board completed a comprehensive 3,600-page environmental impact statement, they gave the Coalition the go-ahead for the project. They planned to move forward with the project— until the DC Circuit said no. According to the DC Circuit, the Board didn’t have to simply analyze the railroad and its impacts; they had to analyze every possible impact of the oil that would eventually be shipped down these railways, refined, and used. Moreover, the additional amount of oil refining at the Gulf—where the crude oil from Utah would be shipped via the railway and refined—would also need to be part of the EIS. Over three thousand pages of analysis wasn’t nearly enough for the judges of the DC Circuit.

In a unanimous decision released last week, the Supreme Court overturned the DC Circuit’s erroneous interpretation of the law. While the DC Circuit might not have liked the Surface Transportation Board’s decision to approve the project, that doesn’t matter, the Court ruled—the Board made a “reasonable and reasonably explained” choice. (I would hope that 3,600 pages is enough to reasonably explain something!)

More importantly, the Supreme Court said that a NEPA analysis needs only to focus on the project at hand, rather than every possible potential future or geographically separate project, like the additional drilling or refining that would be indirectly related to the railline’s approval. Here, in Seven County, the project was the railroad. The analysis, that 3,600-page environmental impact statement, correctly was about the railroad and its impacts. Sure, it was a railroad that would ship oil, but that’s a separate project; all that is at issue—and more importantly, all that the Surface Transportation Board can regulate—are the trains. The Surface Transportation Board, and agencies in general, “are not required to analyze the effects of projects over which they do not exercise regulatory authority,” the Court explained.

There’s no way to put it better than the Supreme Court did. “No rule of reason worthy of that title would require an agency to prepare an [Environmental Impact Statement] addressing effects from another project that is separate in time or place from the project at hand—particularly when it would require the agency to speculate about the effects of a separate project that is outside its regulatory jurisdiction.” Why would we ask an agency to analyze something that it cannot control and about which it has no expertise?

The bottom line, according to the Court: “Congress did not design NEPA for judges to hamstring new infrastructure and construction projects.” It took the Court 55 years to make this clear, but hopefully this Seven County decision will reduce court-imposed delays on needed improvements to infrastructure and help America make better use of its vast natural resources.",https://pacificlegal.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/railroad-utah.jpg,N,,2025-06-02 18:08:21.885472

Will, and should, the Trump Administration’s support for nuclear power research and testing usher in a new era of nuclear power in the U.S.?","Increasing demand for reliable, baseload power and concerns related to climate change are motivating a transition toward new energy sources and alternatives to fossil fuels. Nuclear energy currently provides approximately 20% of US electricity without releasing greenhouse gases and other pollutants into the air. While radioactive waste as a by-product is unavoidable and requires careful storage and management, nuclear energy’s ample ability to provide baseload power makes it an intriguing and relevant energy alternative. Of course, advances in technology go hand-in-hand with litigation meant to protect those advances, and nuclear power is not without its legal battles. Yet, if the most recent example of nuclear competitors failing to get along starts a trend, litigation in the nuclear space may actually spark more collaboration between competitors than confrontation.

ARE WE IN A NUCLEAR RENAISSANCE?

Since the first grid-connected nuclear powerplant in Russia in 1954, 32 countries around the world have constructed 440 nuclear reactors. The other 160+ countries are in various stages of nuclear development: some, like Australia, have banned nuclear power usage altogether; others are either phasing out, or have phased out, nuclear power; and still others are reconsidering or actively reviving nuclear power. While nuclear power has never gone away, in this context of mixed stages of nuclear development, the energy alternative is receiving more attention.

In the United States in particular, there appears to be a nuclear resurgence under the Trump Administration. While President Trump has been in office, the White House has actively encouraged nuclear research, and government agencies have highlighted advancements accomplished within this energy sector during the administration’s first 100 days. Such advancement has included strengthening the nuclear fuel supply chain by reducing U.S. dependence on China-sourced cobalt, a key element used in nuclear reactors. The administration also supported the nation’s first restart of a retired nuclear power plant (Palisades Nuclear Plant in Michigan). Moreover, the administration continues to encourage nuclear testing in labs around the U.S. And in relation to oversight and administrative control of this boom in nuclear research, the president signed an executive order that would reorganize the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and overhaul its regulations with the intention of quicker reviews of nuclear projects.

Outside of the political realm, the worldwide surge in AI is also providing an opportunity for nuclear power to take center stage. Data centers, a vital requirement for running AI systems, need power, massive amounts of power, and there has been a flurry of activity in the nuclear space as tech giants look for energy sources to power these data centers.

In this context, there is renewed interest in nuclear energy.

SPLITTING THE ATOM: STATE OF THE ART

Recent technological advances in nuclear reactor designs address many of the longstanding worries about nuclear energy. For example, Generation III+ and IV reactors incorporate passive safety features and improvements based on decades of operational experience. Molten salt reactors provide an alternative to water-cooled systems, and thorium-based fission provides a uranium-adjacent alternative that uses a more abundant resource and, in some respects, may be superior in physical and nuclear fuel properties. Additionally, smaller scale reactors, called “small modular reactors,” and even microreactors, are in development. A smaller footprint offers more flexible placement options, cost-effective upkeep and construction, faster construction, and scalability.

The nuclear power technology the United States and other countries have relied upon for decades continues to see innovation.

NUCLEAR INNOVATION BREEDS LITIGATION. . . AND COLLABORATION?

With innovation in any technology comes litigation focused on protecting that innovation. One particular case in the nuclear space provides an informative view into international nuclear energy relations and nuclear intellectual property litigation that melds rights of IP owners with overseas competitors, and the resulting impact on the global nuclear market. This particular case also highlights how, even if a party loses the adversarial battle in court, concurrent arbitration may actually win them the IP rights war by encouraging collaboration with competitors to reach agreements that benefit all parties involved.

In October 2022, Westinghouse Electric Company, a U.S.-based major nuclear player, filed Westinghouse Electric Company LLC v. Korea Electric Power Corporation (KEPCO) and Korea Hydro & Nuclear Power Co. Ltd. (KHNP) (Case No. 1:22-cv-03228-APM), in D.C. District Court. Westinghouse alleged that KEPCO and KHNP’s APR1400 (Advanced Power Reactor 1400) technology copied the System 80 reactor designed by Combustion Engineering, which Westinghouse acquired in 2000. Westinghouse filed the lawsuit to stop the Korean entities from selling reactors to Poland, which was in the process of evaluating offers from various nuclear power companies, Westinghouse included, to supply the country’s first commercial nuclear powerplant. Saudi Arabia and the Czech Republic had also invited KEPCO and KHNP to make bids for nuclear powerplants.

Reactor vessel of the APR1400

The APR1400 is a pressurized water reactor with its origins in the Combustion Engineering System 80+ design. Principally designed by KEPCO, the APR1400 produces 1400 MWe and has a 60-year design life. The APR1400 features improvements in operation, safety, maintenance, and affordability. In comparison to some of its peers, the APR1400 is faster to construct than the AP1000 has a design life on the longer end of the spectrum. It is a design that is promising to those interested in investing in nuclear power.

APR1400 vs. System 80+

In the lawsuit, Westinghouse specifically alleged that the use of APR1400 technology required its permission before being transferred to other countries considering deploying the design. This is because, Westinghouse claimed, U.S. laws restricting nuclear power sharing—known as Assistance to Foreign Atomic Energy Activities, 10 CFR Part 810 (Part 810)—require the technology owner to grant permission for use. Part 810 sets out regulations governing technology transfer related to nuclear reactors, equipment, and materials, and also requires the U.S. Department of Energy approve that sharing. Its purpose is stated in § 810.1:

“The regulations in this part implement section 57 b.(2) of the Atomic Energy Act, which empowers the Secretary, with the concurrence of the Department of State, and after consultation with the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, the Department of Commerce, and the Department of Defense, to authorize persons to directly or indirectly engage or participate in the development or production of special nuclear material outside the United States.”

Westinghouse interpreted the requirements in Part 810 to allow the owner of the technology at issue to weigh into its shipping overseas as well.

KEPCO and KHNP responded by filing countersuits against Westinghouse, and a motion to dismiss, arguing that Westinghouse’s position—that it had a private right of action to enforce Part 810 under the Atomic Energy Act (“AEA”)—was incorrect because, in the Defendants’ interpretation, the AEA shifts enforcement authority to the U.S. Attorney General, not private entities, such as Westinghouse, as a means to claim rights through litigation.

Ultimately, the District Court agreed with KEPCO and KHNP and dismissed the case in 2023, holding that Westinghouse lacked a private cause of action to enforce Part 810 under the AEA because the AEA vests in the Attorney General the power to seek to enjoin both actual and imminent violations of the Act or its implementing regulations.

So why is this case still relevant in 2025, and where does the collaboration between competitors appear? While Westinghouse may have been unable to state a cause of action under Part 810 to enforce its IP rights, concurrent arbitration, that just reached settlement in January 2025, provided an opportunity for the parties to negotiate. In January, when Westinghouse announced a global settlement agreement with KEPCO and KHNP, the terms of the agreement were still unknown. But this did not dampen what could be classified as an exultant mood with Westinghouse stating that the agreement “sets the stage for future cooperation between the parties to advance new nuclear projects globally.” Note the use of the word “globally”; this agreement appears to affect more than just competing bids for providing Poland with nuclear power. Westinghouse and KEPCO/KHNP focused on new nuclear projects across the globe when they reached their settlement, and large organizations, working together to advance nuclear energy plant construction and production will inevitably cover more ground than they could alone and embroiled in litigation.

Of the agreement, Tim Gitzel, president and CEO of Cameco Corporation, which owns Westinghouse, stated: “With more than 30 countries and over 100 companies pledging to triple nuclear capacity by 2050, the demand for nuclear power is undeniable. This agreement strengthens the industry’s ability to provide carbon-free, reliable, dispatchable baseload electricity to help achieve climate, energy and national security objectives.” Again, Gitzel undeniably referred to expanding nuclear power across the globe. So, while initially contentious, the APR1400-centered dispute between Westinghouse and KEPCO/KHNP may have positive and exciting ramifications for nuclear energy both at home and abroad.

Perhaps a surprise to see major competitors working together, more collaboration between intellectual-property-owning entities in the nuclear energy space can only encourage growth. And with the number of nuclear power supporters seeming to grow every day, an accessible and litigation-less nuclear power market could result in faster and more efficient growth in the nuclear energy sector.

ON THE OTHER HAND: SOLAR INDUSTRY SEES RISE IN IP LITIGATION

While the nuclear energy space appears to have a boom in its near future with more opportunities for collaboration, what about other energy sectors? Has there been recent collaboration in, say, the solar energy space? In short, no.

After decades of research and development, PERC (passivated emitter rear contact) technology has become the dominant market choice in the solar energy sector. Improvements to PERC’s central design usually go one of two ways: either HJT (heterojunction technology) or TOPCon (tunnel oxide passivated contact). Most of the solar industry has decided to take the TOPCon route, which is easier to achieve as it only requires adding one oxide layer to already existing PERC cells. In contrast, HJT’s more complex formula adds a thin, amorphous silicon film layer to both the front and back of solar wafers.

With a proliferation of TOPCon-based panel manufacturers, a crowded market continue to fuel intellectual property disputes. Unlike the collaboration that appears to be taking place in the nuclear space, there is currently a fight for solar supremacy, as he who owns the rights to prevalent solar panel techniques, owns the domestic manufacturing landscape.

Current chart of TOPCon and TOPCon adjacent litigation

Many of these solar lawsuits are in their nascent stages and only time will tell who the winners and losers of the TOPCon wars will be. First Solar, Inc., an American solar panel manufacturer, appears to be one of the most aggressive players, and the chart above comes from a recent First Solar earnings report, tracking is own litigation and that of its competitors.

WHAT’S NEXT?

As solar companies fight over IP, will we see more nuclear—or other clean energy alternatives—take solar’s place? Will there be more collaboration with their respective technology like Westinghouse, KEPCO, and KHNP? Will, and should, the Trump Administration’s support for nuclear power research and testing usher in a new era of nuclear power in the U.S.? And what antitrust concerns, if any, arise from large entities working together (Westinghouse, KEPCO, KHNP), or one company reigning supreme in a current energy space (potentially First Solar)? These questions, and more, remain unanswered, at least for now. But there is no denying the growing interest in nuclear power, and how it differs from other energy sectors.",https://www.womblebonddickinson.com/sites/default/files/2024-07/Nuclear_Plant_Energy_shutterstock_334593377.jpg,N,,2025-06-02 18:09:30.285442

Energy Secretary Chris Wright announced the cancellations May 30, claiming agency officials reviewed the awards and determined that the projects do not meet Americans’ energy needs, are not economically viable and would not generate a positive return on investment. He said in a statement that financial reviews of the projects in the prior administration had been rushed; two-thirds of the canceled awards were signed between Election Day 2024 and Inauguration Day. The current administration seeks to ensure federal investments ""strengthen our national security, bolster affordable, reliable energy sources and advance projects that generate the highest possible return on investment,” Wright said.

The canceled funding includes a pair of $500-million awards to Heidelberg Materials US Inc. and National Cement Co. of California Inc. DOE had selected Heidelberg’s proposal to implement carbon capture, transport and storage at its cement plant in Mitchell, Ind. At the time the award was announced in March 2024, the company said the effort could reduce the plant’s carbon dioxide emissions by about 2 million metric tons annually.

A spokesperson for Heidelberg told ENR that the termination notice it received indicated that the decision can be appealed, and the company is considering doing so.

National Cement’s canceled $500-million award of matching funds was also planned to go toward efforts aimed at cutting cement plant emissions. The company previously said the Level Net-Zero Project at its plant in Lebec, Calif., would involve replacing a portion of its fossil fuels with alternatives using locally sourced agricultural byproduct biomass, such as pistachio shells; and using calcined clay to produce cement that is less carbon intensive; and capturing and sequestering carbon dioxide emissions.

DOE’s Office of Clean Energy Demonstrations had selected both projects. Officials also canceled a third award under the same program, for $189 million to Brimstone Commercial LLC. The company planned to build its first commercial-scale cement plant using a novel production process the company says results in far fewer emissions than traditional processes. In addition to producing portland cement, the facility would produce the mineral alumina and clear a “mine-to-metal” path for U.S. aluminum production, a Brimstone spokesperson said via email.

The company said it believes the termination resulted from a misunderstanding “given our project’s strong alignment with President Trump’s priority to increase U.S. production of critical minerals.”

Mike Ireland, president and CEO of the American Cement Association, formerly the Portland Cement Association, called the cancellations “a missed opportunity” as carbon capture projects have had bipartisan support.

“The U.S. cement industry fully supports the administration’s approach to bolstering domestic manufacturing and innovation by eliminating regulatory red tape that has limited U.S. cement companies’ productivity and delayed their efforts to reach energy independence,” Ireland said in a statement. “We believe these [carbon capture and storage] projects align with that strategy and stand committed to supporting our members in the appeal process to ensure these critical investments are delivered.”

Other canceled awards include $331.9 million to Exxon Mobil Corp., which planned to put the money toward a clean hydrogen facility in Baytown, Texas; $540 million to energy company Calpine for carbon capture projects at two power plants in California and Texas; and $75 million each to American Cast Iron Pipe Co. and Quikrete subsidiary United States Pipe and Foundry Co. LLC for efforts to reduce the carbon output from their manufacturing operations.

Additional terminations may be coming. Wright issued a memo last month directing Energy Dept. staff to ensure that financial assistance award recipients and their projects are financially sound and aligned with Trump administration policies.

“The legislation would ensure that Massachusetts stays on track to reduce emissions from transportation — the sector that accounts for the greatest share of emissions in the Commonwealth,” according to a bill summary.
Last week, conspiracy theorist Alex Jones posted about the bill on X, which was subsequently removed from the social media platform.
“I do worry about an unintended and subtle bias against rural Massachusetts,” Barrett said at the hearing on the bill.
Massachusetts’ clean energy and climate plan lacks “clear, measurable guidelines or targets” to reduce miles driven, Gadbois said at the legislative hearing.","A pending bill in Massachusetts that looks to set a statewide vehicle miles traveled reduction goal as part of the decarbonization push has ignited national backlash, with critics calling it governmental overreach.

Under the so-called Freedom to Move Act, an interagency coordinating council would be tasked with crafting a “whole-of-government plan” to reduce reliance on personal vehicles and increase access to public transportation in the Bay State.

“The legislation would ensure that Massachusetts stays on track to reduce emissions from transportation — the sector that accounts for the greatest share of emissions in the Commonwealth,” according to a bill summary.

Senate Majority Leader Cindy Creem, a Democrat, is leading the push to shift the Bay State away from relying “too heavily” on electric vehicles as a “decarbonizing strategy.”

“With the Trump administration rolling back vehicle emission standards and withholding funds from EV charging programs, and with congressional Republicans looking to repeal EV tax credits and derail state-level EV rules, now is the time to pursue new strategies, additional strategies,"" Creem said during a legislative hearing in mid-May,

“Setting specific goals for reducing vehicle miles traveled would help guide decisions made across state government,” she added, “and sharpen the focus of efforts to promote alternative modes of transportation like public transit, biking, walking.”

A clip of Creem’s testimony has gone viral in the weeks following the Joint Committee on Telecommunications, Utilities and Energy’s hearing on May 14.

Last week, conspiracy theorist Alex Jones posted about the bill on X, which was subsequently removed from the social media platform. Fox News’ ‘The Faulkner Focus’ also featured it in a segment titled “Democrats divided over how to move forward,” last Tuesday.

In the segment, anchor Harris Faulkner interviewed conservative political commentator Michael Knowles, who noted a survey that MassInc conducted last year showing that 70 percent of respondents “felt unsafe on public transit in the Greater Boston area.”

“People want to be safe,” Knowles said. “You need to give people some kind of option to vote for you. As Democrats are struggling with being viewed as so out of touch, I don’t think this lady in Massachusetts is going to help.”

State Rep. Mike Connolly, a Democrat, is one of the bill’s eight co-sponsors. He told the Boston Herald on Saturday that he believes the way the bill is being portrayed is “completely overblown and ignorant.”

“This legislation doesn’t attempt to set some specific limit or establish any kind of prescriptive formula to punish individual drivers, as the right-wing reporting on this seemed to imply,” Connolly said. “All it really does is say that we should put the structures in place to consider and refine our policies around vehicle miles traveled.”

The bill’s summary states that MassDOT’s transportation plans must “provide a reasonable pathway to compliance with our emissions limits for the transportation sector.” If those reductions aren’t met, the agency would have to make a “greater investment in public transit, bike and pedestrian infrastructure, or other clean transportation options.”

Regional planning organizations and MassDOT would also be required to approve only projects with “a reasonable pathway to compliance with the greenhouse gas emissions sublimits … and the statewide vehicle miles traveled reduction goals.”

Massachusetts Fiscal Alliance, a watchdog group, thrust the bill into the national spotlight, with a May 23 post garnering nearly 350,000 views on X and being multiplied further by prominent conservative accounts.

Organization spokesman Paul Diego Craney says the legislation would be “incredibly damaging to the state economy and restrict transportation for countless residents.”

“Massachusetts lawmakers need to reverse course on the state’s mandate to hit net-zero by 2050,” Craney told the Herald on Saturday, “which is driving these lawmakers to propose some extreme pieces of legislation … Net-zero is nothing more than a fantasy.”

The interagency coordinating council would be created through the legislation, consisting of 15 state officials.

The group would assess and report on strategies “necessary to reduce statewide vehicles miles traveled through the establishment of an equitable, interconnected, accessible and reliable network of non-personal vehicle transportation options and through land use policies that reduce the need for personal vehicles,” according to the bill.

State Sen. Michael Barrett, a Democrat who chairs the Joint Committee on Telecommunications, Utilities and Energy, has raised concerns that the bill may not be practical in all parts of the Commonwealth.

“I do worry about an unintended and subtle bias against rural Massachusetts,” Barrett said at the hearing on the bill. He added it raises the “question of what someone is to do in a place where one has to travel a long distance” to work.

A statewide coalition of environmental organizations reported last December that transportation represents “37 percent of total emissions statewide, and it is one of the sectors where we have made the least progress toward our statutory Clean Energy and Climate Plan goals.”

One of the targets in that plan is for there to be “200,000 zero-emission vehicles on the road by 2025,” but the Bay State was “below half that total” at end of last year, according to the coalition.

State data shows that “light-duty vehicles” traveled 57,191 million miles in 2023, a figure projected to grow to “about 59,100 million in 2030.”

Seth Gadbois, a clean transportation staff attorney at the Conservation Law Foundation, highlighted that the bill is based on laws in Minnesota and Colorado, which redirected funding away from highway projects towards bus corridors.

Massachusetts’ clean energy and climate plan lacks “clear, measurable guidelines or targets” to reduce miles driven, Gadbois said at the legislative hearing.

“This absence leads to disparate and uncoordinated efforts to give people more options for how to get around,” he said, “all while miles driven by car and emissions continue to increase year over year.”

New Bedford resident Elijah DeSousa, founder of the energy advocacy group Citizens Against Eversource, told the Herald on Saturday that he believes the bill is not “just another climate proposal,” but a “blueprint for behavioral control disguised as environmental policy.”

“I refuse to quietly surrender the most fundamental right we have as citizens: the right to move freely, without needing permission from unelected councils or state-issued metrics,” he said.

Dan Newhouse (WA-04) sent a letter(link is external) to Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Administrator Lee Zeldin requesting an investigation into communications between anti-agriculture activist organizations and federal civil service employees.

""I am writing today to request you investigate collaboration between environmental activist groups and career staff that has appeared to permeate throughout the Region 10 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) office in Seattle, Washington,"" Rep. Newhouse wrote.

""The purpose of the federal government is to provide Americans with essential services, including navigating the complex regulatory burden placed on farmers.

Democrats, meanwhile, are lining up an assault on the filibuster-proof bill using all the procedural tools at their disposal, particularly by subjecting the mammoth package to a thorough scrubbing for compliance with the “Byrd rule” barring extraneous provisions. Any section found to violate the rule, which among other things requires a budgetary impact that can’t be just “merely incidental” to some other long-sought policy goal, can be stripped from the bill unless backers can get 60 votes to keep it.

The White House and GOP leaders have an ambitious timeline to get the package done by the July Fourth recess, though many see the August recess as a more likely backstop.

From Medicaid to food stamps, from clean energy to immigration, below is a roundup of the key issues to watch as the Senate gears up for the reconciliation debate.

Medicaid

Concern from Republican senators that Medicaid provisions in the House-passed budget reconciliation bill could harm rural health care facilities is emerging as a prominent obstacle to the party’s plan to finalize the bill by July 4.

At least three Republicans from states with large rural populations — Sens. Josh Hawley of Missouri, Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska — have reservations about the House version, which features a hard-fought compromise on Medicaid cuts.

High on the list for these senators is a provision that would add new restrictions on state taxes on health care providers. The House bill would prevent states from establishing new provider taxes, which states use to finance their share of Medicaid and leverage more funding from the federal government. States would also be prohibited from increasing existing provider tax rates.

“That’s a provision that concerns me,” said Hawley. “Our rural hospitals in Missouri depend on those arrangements.”

Another point of concern is the House bill’s provision for frequent eligibility checks for Medicaid, which some say may make it more difficult for people to sign up for plans.

People who lose Medicaid coverage for not complying with work requirements could also be prohibited from receiving subsidies in the marketplaces, potentially leaving them uninsured.

SNAP benefits

Sen. Charles E. Grassley’s opposition to sharing food stamp costs with states increases the likelihood that the Senate Agriculture Committee will draft reconciliation provisions widely divergent from those in the House reconciliation bill.

Grassley, R-Iowa, a member of the Senate Agriculture Committee, said in May that he opposes the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program cost-sharing that the House bill relies on to reduce the deficit by $128 billion from fiscal 2028, when the cost-sharing begins, to fiscal 2034. The House relied on that $128 billion for nearly 45 percent of its $286 billion in deficit reduction from food stamps, according to the Congressional Budget Office.

The Senate panel’s directions are to find at least $1 billion in deficit reduction over 10 years, far less than the $230 billion that the House Agriculture Committee was directed to find.

Grassley’s defection on a committee divided 12-11 would mean Republicans, if Democrats stick together, wouldn’t have a majority for the proposal that constitutes House Agriculture’s largest single piece of deficit reduction. And Senate Agriculture Republicans come largely from small rural states.

Clean energy tax credits

Senate Republicans’ views on clean energy tax credits — some wanting to shelter them, others to eliminate them — suggest uncertainty about the bill’s outcome until very late in the legislative process.

Four Senate Republicans warned in April against a full-scale repeal of clean energy tax credits, saying it would weaken U.S. leadership on energy. That puts them in disagreement with Senate Energy and Natural Resources Chairman Mike Lee, R-Utah, who said he wanted a full repeal of the energy tax credits in the 2022 climate law.

The House reconciliation bill left some clean energy credits in place temporarily but is phasing them out more quickly than initially planned thanks to Republican holdouts who accelerated the schedule in the final negotiations before the bill’s May 22 passage.

Sen. John Curtis, R-Utah, said in a statement that the House bill will go through “a lot of work before it’s a finished product,” adding that it’s important to make cuts while also being “very careful and surgical.”

Curtis was one of the four senators who signed an April letter to Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D.

“While we support fiscal responsibility and prudent efforts to streamline the tax code, we caution against the full-scale repeal of current credits, which could lead to significant disruptions for the American people and weaken our position as a global energy leader,” said the letter from Curtis, who was joined by Murkowski, Thom Tillis of North Carolina and Jerry Moran of Kansas.

Four Republicans in a Senate divided 53-47 could be decisive on the issue.

But Lee sounded determined in an April post on social media site X that “every last one” of the tax credits enacted by the 2022 law be repealed.

“It can, it must, and it will be,” Lee wrote. “Or it won’t pass.”

Spectrum

Lawmakers are also grappling with competing claims to various bands of the radio waves that are critical for both military and commercial communications.

While members of the House and Senate Armed Services committees jointly wrote the defense portions of the reconciliation bill, looking to resolve possible areas of disagreement out of the gate, the issue of preserving the Pentagon’s access to highly sensitive portions of spectrum used for missile defense systems, radars and more has emerged as a possible sticking point for a number of defense hawks.

Spectrum auctions are projected to generate scores of billions in revenue, a funding source that the bill’s proponents are loath to abandon.

Some of the most vocal members of the Senate Armed Services Committee on this topic — among them, Sens. Deb Fischer, R-Neb., and Mike Rounds, R-S.D. — have pushed back against the House bill’s approach to spectrum for failing to preserve the Defense Department’s access to certain airwaves.

Under the bill, the Federal Communications Commission would see its authority to auction off parts of the spectrum renewed through fiscal 2034, but the language aims to fence off certain bands (including the mid-band that DOD uses for radars, among other things) from potential sale to wireless companies.

President Donald Trump pledged in a post on his Truth Social account May 20 that he would “free up plenty of SPECTRUM for auction” and argued that the U.S. could use the bands for both 5G and 6G cellular networks as well as for national security purposes. House Energy and Commerce Committee leaders project that the auction authority would generate $88 billion in revenue over the next decade.

But Fischer countered that the Pentagon must be able to maintain its use of the mid-band — the 3.1 to 3.45 gigahertz range — as well as portions of the 7 and 8 gigahertz range.

Immigration

The House-passed version of the budget reconciliation package may undergo key changes on immigration-related issues when the Senate hammers out its version, with major players pulling in opposite directions on topline spending.

Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky, chair of the Senate Homeland Security Committee, has expressed skepticism about the level of funds for border wall construction in the House bill, asserting during a recent committee hearing “we should reassess … what we want to do and how much it costs.”

The House package designates $46 billion for a barricade along the U.S.-Mexico border. When Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem sought to justify the need for the appropriations during the hearing, Paul said the numbers she provided were “way off.”

Paul openly considered whether construction of the border wall would even be necessary given that the Trump administration is claiming success over a 95 percent reduction of illegal encounters at the border, which the president’s allies have credited to his handling of immigration.

But Paul often has idiosyncratic views within the Republican Party and it’s unclear whether he will be able to exert enough pull to limit the allocation for border wall construction, especially when Trump’s allies are eager to spend money to fulfill that policy goal.

Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, in contrast, has offered a robust vision for spending in the Senate bill as part of a blueprint he made public in February. The blueprint seeks to add $85.5 billion for border security, national security and domestic energy production, although his office didn’t offer a more definitive breakdown of the proposed funds.

Graham’s statement, however, checks off several priorities for immigration enforcement, including funds for a border wall, an increase in the number of detention beds and an increased number of immigration officers conduct mass detention and removals of criminal illegal aliens.

But instead of an all-new model, Tesla is working on stripped-down versions of the Model 3 sedan and Model Y compact SUV, Reuters reported in April.
Many investors long ago gave up hope for a transformational $25,000 EV that would juice sales.","Synopsis

Tesla executives worried about Elon Musk's denial regarding the $25,000 EV cancellation. They feared SEC scrutiny and investor confusion. The company shifted focus to robotaxis. This decision led to internal concerns and market uncertainty. Tesla is facing declining sales and rising competition from BYD. The affordable EV remains unreleased. Musk's actions raised questions about transparency and future product strategy.

Some senior Tesla executives were alarmed last year when Elon Musk denied a Reuters report that the company had killed a planned all-new $25,000 EV that investors had expected to drive explosive vehicle sales growth, according to people familiar with the matter.

""Reuters is lying,"" Musk had posted on X, minutes after the story published on April 5, 2024, halting a 6% decline in Tesla's stock. Tesla shares recovered some of the loss after Musk's post, but the stock was down 3.6% at market close.

The executives knew that Musk had, in fact, canceled the low-cost vehicle, which many investors called the Model 2, and pivoted Tesla to focus on self-driving robotaxis, the people said. The company had told employees the project was over weeks earlier, Reuters reported, citing three sources and company documents.

Musk's post was so confusing to some senior managers that they asked him whether he'd changed his mind. Musk rejected their concerns and said the project was still dead, according to the people with knowledge of the matter.

The executives' concerns, which haven't been previously reported, shed light on the company's struggle to deliver a low-cost, mass-market EV, considered a core promise of the company.

Live Events

Some other Tesla executives were unconcerned about Musk's X post, said people familiar with the matter. The automaker keeps its product plans flexible, one person said, to respond to market conditions.

A year later, struggling with a dated lineup and falling sales around the world, Tesla has still not released the low-cost EV that Musk once called pivotal to the company's future. Neither Musk nor Tesla has explicitly confirmed killing an all-new model that investors and Tesla enthusiasts have long referred to as the Model 2 because it would slot in below the current cheapest model in Tesla's lineup, the $42,500 Model 3.

On Wednesday, Musk announced that he is leaving his role as a special advisor to U.S. President Donald Trump to return his focus to his companies, including Tesla, SpaceX, xAI, Neuralink, and the social media company X.

Tesla and Musk did not respond to requests for comment.

Weeks after Musk's post on X, Tesla published an investor update that assured Tesla still planned ""new vehicles, including more affordable models"" that will be built on current manufacturing lines.

Musk and Tesla had said previously that the planned $25,000 EV would be an all-new model, designed and built from scratch on a new platform. Musk had touted the project as a testbed for groundbreaking manufacturing innovations that would lower the cost of electric vehicles.

But instead of an all-new model, Tesla is working on stripped-down versions of the Model 3 sedan and Model Y compact SUV, Reuters reported in April. No pricing on those models has been announced and the cars, set to roll out in the first half of 2025, have been delayed.

On Tesla's earnings call in April, engineering chief Lars Moravy said that the affordable models would ""resemble in form and shape the cars we already make.""

""The key is they'll be affordable,"" he added, ""and you'll be able to buy one.""

After Musk denied the Reuters report about killing the Model 2, executives questioned Musk about what the company should tell perplexed suppliers and investors, people familiar with the matter said.

Some executives told associates the denial made no sense -- investors and the public would inevitably learn the truth -- and worried it would hurt Tesla sales as buyers delayed purchases to wait for a $25,000 Tesla that, in reality, it had decided not to build.

Their concerns were not universally shared at the company. One of the sources familiar with the internal deliberations about Musk's public denial told Reuters that Tesla has considered a variety of strategies for producing low-cost EVs over the years.

Gary Black, a Tesla investor who manages money for the Future Fund LLC, said he didn't view Musk's statement as a ""denial"" at the time, noting that Musk often makes ""brief and abrupt"" comments that ""can be about anything.""

That said, Black told Reuters he recently sold his fund's $1.2 million position in Tesla in part out of concern the affordable new vehicle will be a ""stripped down Model Y"" rather than a ""differentiated product.""

WORRIES ABOUT SEC ENFORCEMENT

Some Tesla executives told associates they were worried that denying the Model 2 was dead could land Musk in hot water with the Securities and Exchange Commission for misleading investors about a future product line that had been baked into their forecasts for the company.

Musk had previously paid a $40 million settlement in 2018 over another social media post that the agency alleged misled investors that Musk planned to take Tesla private.

Reuters could not determine whether executives approached Musk directly with the SEC enforcement concern, nor if they alerted the SEC itself.

An SEC spokesperson declined to comment.

Musk's agreement with the SEC requires him to have his social media posts about certain aspects of Tesla, such as new business lines and forecasts about the company, first vetted by a lawyer.

Musk despises the settlement, according to people familiar with his thinking, and has told associates he doesn't post anything that needs attorney approval.

The same day Musk denied the Reuters report, he lifted Tesla's stock again in after-hours trading with a post saying ""Robotaxi unveil 8/8,"" for August 8, a plan he had not widely announced to Tesla employees, said people familiar with the matter. The Hollywood-style debut of a two-door ""Cybercab"" ended up being delayed until October and underwhelmed investors.

Many investors long ago gave up hope for a transformational $25,000 EV that would juice sales. Instead, Tesla posted its first annual vehicle sales decline in 2024 and sales were down 13% in the first quarter of 2025 amid rising competition and public protests against Musk's work in the Trump administration.

In April, Chinese automaker BYD outsold Tesla in Europe for the first time and is taking the global lead in affordable EVs. BYD's entry-level Seagull electric hatchback costs less than $10,000 in China and sells competitively for more than double that price in export markets.

“Box Canyon Solar represents the first utility-scale solar project for our portfolio, and together with Apache Solar II, puts us on schedule to add 100 megawatts of renewable energy by our 100th anniversary in 2026,” Leslie O’Hare, a digital content specialist with ED3, said today.
Developed by BrightNight and Cordelio Power, Box Canyon will ultimately supply clean power to 25 utilities under the Southwest Public Power Agency, serving more than 77,000 Arizona homes.
Solar energy is also a hedge against volatile natural gas prices, a more cost-effective alternative.
Developers estimate that the Box Canyon project will also bring with it an economic boost, projected to generate $43 million in tax revenue over 40 years and support more than $134 million in local economic activity.","The Box Canyon Solar Project, a 300-megawatt utility-scale solar facility near Florence, has officially begun producing electricity.

That’s according to Electric District No. 3, which is receiving 63½ megawatts of power from the new plant. It is ED3’s first utility-scale solar addition and part of a broader plan to add 100 megawatts of renewable energy by its centennial next year.

“Box Canyon Solar represents the first utility-scale solar project for our portfolio, and together with Apache Solar II, puts us on schedule to add 100 megawatts of renewable energy by our 100th anniversary in 2026,” Leslie O’Hare, a digital content specialist with ED3, said today.

Developed by BrightNight and Cordelio Power, Box Canyon will ultimately supply clean power to 25 utilities under the Southwest Public Power Agency, serving more than 77,000 Arizona homes. For its part, ED3 will generate an estimated 185,000 megawatt-hours annually, or enough energy to power 16,000 Maricopa homes.

The Box Canyon annual output of 900,000 megawatt-hours is expected to offset more than 640,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide and conserve 260 million gallons of water each year, according to developers.

O’Hare said the project helps meet growing energy demand in the rapidly expanding Maricopa region. Solar energy is also a hedge against volatile natural gas prices, a more cost-effective alternative. However, the project is solar-only and does not include grid stabilization or energy storage features.

The energy milestone comes as Pinal County positions itself at the center of Arizona’s EV industry. Once dubbed the “Detroit of the Southwest,” the county is already home to the Lucid Motors EV manufacturing plant in Casa Grande and is set to welcome a multibillion-dollar EV battery plant in Queen Creek next year. The region is also expanding workforce training through local partnerships, including a new electric vehicle technology program launched by the Maricopa Unified School District and Central Arizona Valley Institute of Technology.

Despite the growth in EV ownership, with more than 800 registered EVs in Maricopa alone, infrastructure has lagged behind. The city currently has just six public charging ports for over 12,000 residents per port, with many existing chargers inoperable or blocked by gas-powered vehicles. Tesla superchargers are located 24 miles away in Casa Grande and Chandler.

While the Arizona Department of Transportation announced plans to install high-speed charging stations along State Route 347 this year, that plan was scrapped in February by the Federal Highway Administration.

Meanwhile, ED3 is preparing for its next major solar investment to come online later this year. The Apache Solar II project, is under construction in Cochise County. That 38-megawatt project will also include ED3’s first utility-scale battery storage system, capable of storing 153 megawatt-hours of energy.

(AP) — The U.S. Department of Energy has ordered another power plant, this time an oil and gas plant in Pennsylvania, to keep its turbines running through the hottest summer months as a precaution against electricity shortfalls in the 13-state mid-Atlantic grid.

The department's order to the grid operator, PJM Interconnection, regarding the Eddystone power plant just south of Philadelphia on the Delaware River, is the department's second use of federal power under President Donald Trump to require a power plant to keep operating on the mainland United States.

Constellation Energy had planned to shut down Eddystone's units 3 and 4 on Saturday, but Trump's Department of Energy ordered the company to continue operating the units until at least Aug. 28. The units can produce a combined 760 megawatts.

The department, in its order, cited PJM's growing concerns about power shortfalls amid the shutdown of aging power plants and rising electricity demand.

PJM last year approved Constellation's request to shut down the units, but it welcomed the department's order to keep them operating, saying it's a “prudent, term-limited step” that allows PJM, the department and Constellation to study the longer-term need and viability of Eddystone's units.

The department took a similar step last week, ordering Consumers Energy to keep the J.H. Campbell coal-fired power plant open in Michigan past its Saturday retirement.

The grid operator there, the Midcontinent Independent System Operator, said the order was unnecessary, that there was no energy emergency there and that there should be enough energy in the region through the summer.

An environmental advocacy group, the Delaware Riverkeeper Network, criticized the move to keep Eddystone operating as an ""environmental injustice."" Shutting down the units would reduce hazardous pollution and carbon emissions from the decades-old facility and help the region meet federal clean air standards for smog, it said.

U.S. consumer demand for renewable energy continues to grow, with more solar panel capacity installed in 2024 than in 2023, which saw more than in 2022. But U.S. trade policy is in flux, and high tariffs have been imposed on imported solar panels, which may cause shortages.

I am a scholar who studies the Sun, as well as an entrepreneur who is working to harness its power here on Earth by creating new designs for generating solar electricity. As part of that effort, I’ve studied market trends and manufacturing capabilities in the U.S. and abroad. Right now, U.S. manufacturers do not produce enough solar panels to meet the nation’s demand, but industry investments and federal tax incentives have been making progress, though recent federal moves have created uncertainty.

In 2024, U.S. installers put up enough solar panels to generate 50 gigawatts of electricity – enough to power New York City for a year.

U.S. manufacturers made only a small fraction of that – 4.2 GW of solar modules in the first half of 2024. That was a big boost, though – a 75% increase compared with the same period in 2023. And the prices were roughly three times the cost of imports.

A look at recent imports

In 2024, the U.S. imported far more panels than the country needed, suggesting developers may be stockpiling panels for future projects.

Most of those imported panels were made in Asia, particularly Malaysia, Vietnam and Thailand. In fact, nearly all of the U.S.-made panels used at least some components from overseas. China currently makes about 97% of the world’s supply of photovoltaic wafers, which are building blocks of solar panels.

The effects of proposed U.S. trade policies on the solar industry remain unclear. Through 2024, manufacturing continued a yearslong ramp-up to take advantage of government policies favoring domestic manufacturing. And imported panels seem slated to suffer from ever-increasing tariffs, which drive up costs.

Domestic production rises

Since 2010, U.S. solar panel production has increased about eightfold. But U.S.-made panels are more expensive than imported alternatives. In 2024, U.S.-made panels typically cost 31 cents per watt, but imported panels, even including tariffs that existed before President Donald Trump’s second term, cost about one-third of that: 11 cents per watt.

But domestic manufacturers are bringing costs down by ramping up production while relying on the government to maintain or increase tariffs on imports, which may make U.S. panels more competitive domestically in the future.

Reliance on overseas sources

Despite that increase in domestic production, U.S. demand for solar panels has grown even faster. To meet demand, the U.S. imports a substantial portion of its solar photovoltaic modules.

Tariffs, including a 30% tariff on solar cells and solar panels starting in 2018, aimed to boost domestic manufacturing.

But those tariffs and falling global prices made solar installations more costly in the U.S. than in the rest of the world. The average global cost of installed solar systems dropped from $1.15 per watt in 2012 to $0.72 per watt in 2016, nearly half that of U.S. installations.

The 2018 tariffs, as well as earlier rounds in 2012 and 2014, have shifted the source of U.S. imports of solar panels – from China and Taiwan to Malaysia and South Korea. Manufacturers are also building solar panels in Singapore and Germany to maintain access to the U.S. market. And Chinese companies are even investing in U.S. solar manufacturers to take advantage of federal incentives and avoid tariffs.

New tariffs emerge

Trump’s proposal for new tariffs on foreign-made solar goods, including panels and components, particularly target Chinese-owned companies in Southeast Asia.

They could include a potential 375% tariff on Thai products – nearly quadrupling prices – and a 3,500% tariff on products from Cambodia.

In contrast, U.S.-made solar panels will be cheaper. But a reduced supply of solar panels will raise prices even of domestic-made panels, at least until U.S. manufacturing can catch up with the demand. Some developers have begun to delay or cancel solar installations to address rising costs.

Domestic investment

Due in large part to the Biden administration’s Inflation Reduction Act, enacted in 2022, the U.S. solar panel industry has seen significant investments.

Since the law’s enactment, more than 95 GW of manufacturing capability have been added across the solar supply chain in the U.S., including new facilities that in a year can construct enough solar panels to produce nearly 42 GW, beyond existing manufacturing levels. This growth in manufacturing capabilities is largely located in Texas and Georgia.

Still, the new administration’s shifting priorities and trade policies make the landscape uncertain. Before Trump began discussing various solar-related trade policies, the industry projected it would install an average of 45 GW of solar panels every year for the next decade.

The budget request calls for $387 million to be diverted from the Land and Water Conservation Fund (LWCF), one of the most significant federal conservation funds. Established in 1964, LWCF provides grants for conservation and recreation projects on federal, state and local levels. The program is funded by revenue from offshore oil and gas leases, in response to the environmental damage caused by oil and gas drilling. The move to cut the program’s funding is a major reversal as the bipartisan Great American Outdoors Act, passed in 2020 and signed into law by Donald Trump in his first term, permanently funded the LWCF.

The budget request also slashes popular conservation programs at the Bureau of Land Management, grant programs at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration that connect children with watershed learning opportunities, and critical environmental justice programs at the Environmental Protection Agency aimed at protecting communities from environmental harms caused by polluting industries.

In response, Jackie Ostfeld, Sierra Club Outdoors for All campaign director, released the following statement:

“This budget is yet another give away to big oil and corporate interests, and undermines his singular conservation achievement, the Great American Outdoors Act. Defunding the LWCF breaks a promise to the American people by eliminating a conservation tool that has been in place for more than fifty years.

This is the second power plant the administration has ordered to operate past its planned retirement under the excuse of a so-called “energy emergency”.

The Regional Transmission Organization PJM approved Eddystone’s Unit 3 and 4 retirement in February of 2024, confirming that its retirement will not affect reliability in PJM’s service region.

He also agreed with the plaintiffs’ arguments about the downline impacts on refineries and the upline impacts on the Uinta Basin.
What does this mean for federal environmental review in the U.S.?
The first is on the role of federal courts in environmental review done by federal agencies.
The second is reducing the required scope of federal agencies doing an environmental review for any given project.","The court ruled 8-0 in favor of the plaintiffs, the Seven County Infrastructure Coalition, a group of Utah counties that want to build a new rail line from the state’s oil-rich Uinta Basin. Justice Neil Gorsuch recused himself over potential financial conflicts of interest.

If built, the line would connect to existing Union Pacific tracks, which run along the Colorado River through Colorado, and eventually take the crude oil to refineries in the Gulf of Mexico.

Eagle County, Colorado, along with the Center for Biological Diversity sued over the environmental impact statement (EIS) completed by the Surface Transportation Board (STB). They claim that the EIS violated NEPA, because it didn’t adequately assess the downline impacts of the railway’s construction, like an increased risk of oil spills and wildfires due to more oil trains alongside the Colorado River, the impacts of pollution from oil refineries in communities in Texas and Louisiana, and how increased drilling might affect the Uinta Basin’s ecosystem.

A Washington D.C. circuit court ruled in favor of the Colorado communities and environmental group, saying that there were “significant deficiencies” with the STB’s environmental analysis.

“It omitted downline effects of projected increases in spills and accidents from additional oil trains traveling the existing Union Pacific rail line alongside the Colorado River—including effects on water, special status species or habitats, and recreation and land use,” Judge Robert Wilkins wrote in 2023. He also agreed with the plaintiffs’ arguments about the downline impacts on refineries and the upline impacts on the Uinta Basin.

Seven County Infrastructure appealed, and the case was heard by the Supreme Court in December.

In 2023, Congress amended NEPA using the language “reasonably foreseeable.” Essentially that means that if a potential environmental impact is “reasonably foreseeable,” then an agency must consider it as part of its environmental review process.

During oral arguments for the case, the plaintiffs asked the Court to consider a new test: whether the impacts were “remote in time and distance,” or, whether the impacts were very far in the future or geographically very far away. If that was the case, they argued, the impacts shouldn’t need to be considered.

What does this mean for federal environmental review in the U.S.?

Chris Winter is the director of the Getches-Wilkinson Center for Natural Resources, Energy, and the Environment at CU Boulder’s School of Law. He and other environmental law scholars have been following the case closely.

He said there are two core findings at the heart of the court’s ruling. The first is on the role of federal courts in environmental review done by federal agencies.

“Federal courts should defer to the agencies’ exercise of discretion and professional judgment in deciding how broadly or narrowly to craft their environmental reviews,” he said.

The second is reducing the required scope of federal agencies doing an environmental review for any given project.

“Agencies don’t have to look at the effects of other projects that might result from the approval of the discrete project the agency’s looking at right now,” he said of the second.

“An example of another project would be the exploration and development of oil and gas in the Uinta Basin,” he said. “The court thought of that as a separate project. Or, the refining of oil and gas in Texas at the end of the rail line. That also—in the court’s mind—was a separate project.”

Winter said this could have sweeping impacts on any federal agency that conducts environmental analysis for a project under NEPA, narrowing the scope of what any agency in the case would have to consider.

That’s bad news, he said, for transparency.

“Where the court says the agencies have to do less or they can constrain the scope of their environmental reviews, that’s necessarily going to affect the amount of information the public has about these projects,” he said, adding that the public will have to do more work to get engaged with federal environmental reviews as NEPA requirements change.

Winter is especially concerned about what this will mean for the country as the impacts of human-caused climate change get more severe, driven by emissions from fossil fuels.

“As this administration works to expedite approval of new fossil fuel infrastructure projects, I’m very concerned, as a result of this decision, that it’s gonna be more difficult for us, as the public, to know what the impacts are going to be for climate change over the long term,” he said.

In addition, he said that because this ruling says federal courts should defer to agencies, it means that the courts are less likely to be an avenue for the public to oppose projects it feels are harmful to the environment.

The Center for Biological Diversity—one of the plaintiffs in the case—decried the Court’s decision in a statement.

“This disastrous decision to undermine our nation’s bedrock environmental law means our air and water will be more polluted, the climate and extinction crises will intensify, and people will be less healthy,” wrote Wendy Park, an attorney for the Center. “It guarantees that bureaucrats can put their heads in the sand and ignore the harm federal projects will cause to ecosystems, wildlife and the climate.”

What comes next for the railway?

The Seven County Infrastructure Coalition intends to continue pursuing the project—with developers calling it “a generational investment in Utah’s rural communities.”

“This decision affirms the years of work and collaboration that have gone into making the Uinta Basin Railway a reality,” Keith Heaton, Director of the Seven County Infrastructure Coalition wrote in a statement. “It represents a turning point for rural Utah—bringing safer, sustainable, more efficient transportation options, and opening new doors for investment and economic stability. We look forward to continuing our work with all stakeholders to deliver this transformative project.”

As the case made its way through the courts, several permissions and permits were revoked from the rail line—like a special use authorization from the U.S. Forest Service (some of the proposed line passes through the Ashley National Forest in Utah). This was because agencies had based their approvals on the STB’s overturned environmental analysis.

According to its statement, the Coalition intends to work with the STB to reauthorize the railway, as well as with agencies like the USFS to get their right-of-way permits re-approved.

According to Winter, the Coalition did not appeal the entirety of the D.C. Court’s ruling—they only appealed the ruling on the more remote upline and downline impacts. The part of the ruling that states the impacts to the Colorado River were not adequately considered, was not part of the Coalition’s appeal, he said.

“The agency still has more work to do on the environmental analysis despite the Supreme Court’s ruling today,” he said. “So this doesn’t necessarily mean that the railroad will go forward or that it will be constructed, but I think it narrows the amount of work the agency needs to do now, in addressing the shortcomings in the EIS.”

The Center for Biological Diversity also said that it would continue to oppose any efforts to actually build the Uinta Basin Railway.

“What (the Court’s decision) doesn’t guarantee is the ill-conceived Uinta Basin Railway’s construction,” wrote attorney Wendy Park. “The last thing we need is another climate bomb on wheels that the communities along its proposed route say they don’t want. We’ve been fighting this project for years, and we’ll keep fighting to make sure this railway is never built.”",https://891khol.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Web-template-795-x-447-px.jpg,N,,2025-06-02 16:12:13.338599

Nuclear Energy Gets the Recognition It Deserves

The House bill preserves the nuclear production tax credit, representing a major win for reliable, baseload power generation that can meet America’s growing energy demands.

Rep. Newhouse’s earlier leadership organizing 25 House Republicans to advocate for nuclear tax incentives clearly paid dividends.

Smart Policy That Benefits Consumers

Unlike wasteful subsidies for unproven green technologies that were rightfully eliminated, the nuclear production tax credits represent market-based policy that delivers real benefits. Nuclear power provides reliable baseload generation that works regardless of weather conditions, long-term price stability, and energy security that reduces our dependence on foreign sources.

The preserved nuclear incentives will continue leveraging private capital for critical infrastructure development while strengthening our electrical grid’s reliability.

Looking Forward

With the House delivering a decisive victory for American energy policy, it’s now time for the Senate to build on this momentum and pass President Trump’s agenda. The nuclear provisions secured in the House represent just one piece of legislation that will strengthen American jobs, enhance our energy security, and reinforce our nation’s competitive position.",https://caseforconsumers.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/shutterstock_2425416119.jpg,N,,2025-06-02 17:12:51.680375

That means the stuff required to make stuff is in high demand, and none more so than what are known as “critical minerals.”

These are a handful of elements and minerals that are particularly important for making the modern devices that run the global economy. But “critical” here doesn’t mean rare so much as it means essential — and alarmingly vulnerable to supply chain shocks.

In the US, the Geological Survey has flagged 50 minerals as critical to our economy and security. And including some among that larger group, the US Department of Energy is focused on 18 materials that are especially important for energy — copper for transmission lines, cobalt for cathodes in batteries, gallium for LEDs, neodymium for magnets in motors, and so on.

For governments, these minerals are more than just industrial components — they’re potential bottlenecks. If producers of these substances decide to restrict access to their customers as a political lever, if prices shoot up, or if more industries develop an appetite for them and eat into the supply, companies could go bankrupt and efforts to limit climate change could slow down.

That’s because these minerals are especially vital for so many clean energy technologies. They’re essential for the tools used to produce, store, transmit, and use electricity without emitting greenhouse gases. They’re vital to building solar panels, batteries, and electric motors. As the worldwide race for cleaner energy speeds up, the demand for these products is surging. According to the International Energy Agency, mineral demands from clean energy deployment will see anywhere from a doubling to a quadrupling from current levels by 2040.

But these minerals aren’t spread evenly across the world, which could leave some countries bearing most of the environmental burdens from mining critical minerals while wealthier nations reap the economic benefits and other countries get left out of the supply chain entirely.

“A world powered by renewables is a world hungry for critical minerals,” said UN Secretary-General António Guterres at a panel last year. “For developing countries, critical minerals are a critical opportunity — to create jobs, diversify economies, and dramatically boost revenues. But only if they are managed properly.”

Right now, the US is a major consumer of critical minerals, but not much of a producer — a fact that’s become an obsession for the Trump administration. The president has signed several executive orders aimed at increasing critical mineral production within the US by relaxing regulations and speeding up approvals for new critical mineral extraction projects. In Congress, lawmakers are mulling spending billions of dollars to build up a critical mineral stockpile similar to the strategic petroleum reserve.

Even as the US government takes those steps, the international trade war that the Trump administration itself launched has begun to disrupt the global supply of critical minerals. China is one of the largest producers of critical minerals, particularly rare earth metals like dysprosium and terbium, but it has imposed limits on some of its critical mineral exports in response to President Donald Trump’s tariffs, sending prices skyward.

The dawning awareness that the critical minerals everyone needs may not be readily available has led countries to redouble their efforts to find more of these materials wherever they can — in the ocean, across deserts, and even in space. In the near term, that means the world will need more mines to expand supplies of critical minerals.

And with the market for clean energy poised to expand even further, scientists are trying to find new alternative materials that can power our world without making it hotter. But it will take more time and investment before the plentiful can replace the precious.

Why we’re hooked on critical minerals

Since the list of critical minerals is long and diverse, it’s helpful to narrow it down. And one mineral stands out: lithium.

The IEA estimates that half of the mineral demand growth for clean energy will come from electric vehicles and batteries, mainly from their needs for this soft, light metal. Depending on how aggressively the world works to decarbonize, lithium use is projected to increase by as much as 51 times its current levels by 2040, more than 10 million metric tons per year.

That’s because lithium is still the best material to store and release energy in batteries across a variety of applications, from the tiny cells in wireless earbuds to arrays of thousands of cells packed into giant batteries on the power grid. As more cars trade gasoline engines for electric motors, and as more intermittent wind and solar power connect to the grid, we need more ways to store energy.

While lithium is not particularly rare, getting it out of the earth isn’t easy. There are only a handful of places in the world that currently have the infrastructure to extract it at scale and at a low enough price to make doing so worthwhile, even with ever rising demand.

The US produces less than 2 percent of the world’s lithium, with almost all of it coming from just one mine in Nevada. The US has about 20 major sites where lithium could be extracted, according to the US Geological Survey, but building new mines can take more than a decade, and the timelines have only been getting longer. Because of their costs and the long-lasting environmental damage they can cause, mining projects have to undergo reviews before they can be approved. They often generate local opposition as well, stretching out project timelines with litigation.

But the US is motivated to build this out and there are already new lithium projects underway in places like the Salton Sea in California and the Smackover formation across the southern US. These sites would extract lithium from brine.

Could the US replace lithium and other critical minerals with cheaper, more abundant substances?

Not easily. “Substitution is not impossible, but depends on which material,” Sophia Kalantzakos, who studies environmental science and public policy at NYU Abu Dhabi, said in an email. Some materials are truly one of a kind, while others have alternatives that need a lot more research and development before they can step in. For example, there are companies investing in lithium alternatives in batteries, but they also have to build up a whole supply chain to get enough of the replacement material, which can take years.

And it’s not enough to mine critical minerals; they need to be refined and processed into usable forms. Here again, China leads, operating 80 percent of the world’s refining capacity. The bottom line is that there’s no immediate, easy answer to the critical mineral supply crunch right now. But there might be solutions that emerge in the years to come.

How can we get around critical mineral constraints?

These challenges have spurred a wave of research and development. Engineers are already finding ways to do more with less. Automakers like Ford, Tesla, and the Chinese company BYD are increasingly turning toward lithium iron phosphate (LFP) batteries as an alternative to conventional lithium-ion cells. Not only does the LFP chemistry use less lithium for a given energy storage capacity, it also uses less of other critical minerals like nickel and cobalt, lowering its cost. The batteries also tend to be more durable and stable, making them less prone to catastrophic failure.

The US Department of Energy has invested in ways to make lithium-based batteries more efficient and easier to manufacture by redesigning the structure of battery components to store more energy.

Researchers are also investigating battery designs that avoid lithium altogether. Chemistries like aluminum ion and sodium ion, as their names suggest, use different and far more abundant elements to carry charges inside the battery. But they still have to catch up to lithium in terms of durability, safety, performance, and production scale.

“I think this lithium-ion technology will still drive much of the energy transition,” said Rachid Amui, a resource economist who coauthored a United Nations Trade & Development report on critical minerals for batteries. It will likely be decades before alternatives can dethrone lithium. Eventually, as components wear out, recycling could help meet some critical mineral needs. But demand for technologies like batteries is poised to see a huge jump, which means the world will have no choice but to grow its fresh lithium supplies.

There is some good news, though. Mining is getting more efficient and safer. “There’s so much autonomous technology now being developed in the mining industry that is making mining safer than we could have ever imagined 15, 20 years ago,” said Adam Simon, a professor of earth and environmental science at the University of Michigan. That’s helping drive down costs and increase the efficiency of mineral extraction. The number of known sources of lithium is also rising. KoBold Metals, a mining firm backed by Bill Gates and Jeff Bezos, is using AI to locate more critical mineral deposits all over the world.

The Energy Department is also throwing its weight behind domestic innovation. The department’s Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy, which invests in long-shot energy ideas, is funding 18 projects to increase domestic production of critical minerals. The program, dubbed MINER, is aiming to develop minerals that can capture carbon dioxide.

“Through programs like MINER and targeted investments in domestic innovation, we’re working to reduce reliance on foreign sources and lay the groundwork for an American energy future that is reliable, cost-effective, and secure,” said Doug Wicks, a program director for ARPA-E, in a statement to Vox.

There’s also a global race to secure more mineral supplies from far-flung places, all the way down to the bottom of the ocean. On parts of the seafloor, there are vast fields of nodules made of nickel, cobalt, lithium, and manganese. For mining companies, the argument is that mining the seafloor could be less damaging to the environment than drilling or brine extraction on land.

But the ocean floor is anything but a desolate place; there’s a lot of life down there taking many forms, including species that have yet to be discovered. One of the most lucrative areas for sea mining, the Clarion-Clipperton Zone in the Pacific Ocean, happens to have a rich ecosystem of sponges, anemones, and sea cucumbers.

Another factor to consider is that pulling up rocks from the bottom of the sea is inevitably expensive. The Clarion-Clipperton Zone can reach 18,000 feet deep. Hauling those minerals up, shipping them to shore, and refining them adds to their sticker price.

“I think it’s interesting and needed because of the [research and development] that it stimulates,” Simon said. “But economically, there’s no company right now who could actually mine the lithium in those clays from the bottom of the ocean.”

There are even companies that have proposed mining critical minerals from asteroids. One company, AstroForge, has already launched a test spacecraft into deep space. That’s an even dicier business proposition since working in space is even more expensive than trying to mine the bottom of the ocean. But space mining technology is a moonshot — still gestational and decades away from even returning a sample. The companies behind these proposals say that humanity’s hunger for these minerals is only growing and it’s prudent to start taking steps now toward building up supplies of raw materials in space.

But for the time being, there’s no easy way around it: powering a greener world means we will still need to extract far more critical minerals to turn away from fossil fuels and toward clean energy. Otherwise humanity will continue extracting and burning coal, oil, and natural gas, further heating up the planet.",https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/05/GettyImages-1465662533.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&crop=0%2C10.725431491557%2C100%2C78.549137016885&w=1200,N,,2025-06-02 16:11:42.672400

Tyson Slocum, director of Public Citizen's Energy Program, warned in a statement following the Energy Department's latest order that ""extending the life of the unit will force ratepayers to shell out money to cover expensive maintenance and overpay for expensive power that will result in American households paying even higher electricity bills, as Trump's emergency order requires consumers to pay 100% of all costs to get the plant up and running, including a guaranteed profit for Constellation.""

""Trump's last-minute emergency order—issued literally on the last day these power plants were set to operate—causes significant, expensive complications,"" said Slocum. ""Old units like Eddystone require both minor and major maintenance—maintenance that was deferred because of its planned retirement on May 31.""

In December 2023, Constellation informed PJM Interconnection, the regional grid operator, that it would be retiring Eddystone Units 3 and 4, which ran on either fracked gas or oil. Constellation said at the time that ""continued operation"" of the units was ""expected to be uneconomic.""

PJM Interconnection signed off on Constellation's decision to retire the units in a letter dated February 27, 2024. But in the wake of the Energy Department's emergency order on Friday, PJM praised the Trump administration's intervention as ""prudent.""

Public Citizen slammed PJM's statement as a ""craven, politically motivated about-face.""

The order rescuing Eddystone Generating Station came days after the Trump Energy Department moved to save the coal-fired J.H. Campbell Generating Plant, stunning Michigan officials.

“It came as a surprise to everybody, and it was baffling why they chose this plant,"" Dan Scripps, chair of the Michigan Public Service Commission, told The Washington Post. ""Nobody asked for this order. The power grid operator did not. The utility that owns the plant did not. The state regulator did not.""

Citing state officials, the Post noted that ""the move will collectively increase electric bills for ratepayers in the Midwest by tens of millions of dollars."" The J.H. Campbell plant is ""the largest source of air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions in West Michigan,"" according to the Sierra Club.

Trump laid the groundwork to save the fossil fuel plants earlier this month with an executive order instructing the Energy Department ""to develop a process for using emergency powers to prevent unprofitable coal plants from shutting down in order to avert power outages.""

Bryan Smigielski, organizer of the Sierra Club's Michigan campaign, called the administration's J.H. Campbell plant rescue a ""blatant act of federal overreach"" that ""is being imposed against the wishes of Michigan consumers, businesses, regulators, and elected leaders.""

""Don't be fooled: There is no 'energy emergency' here—just a payday for the coal industry that leaves us with higher bills and dirtier air,"" Smigielski added.",https://www.commondreams.org/media-library/image.jpg?id=60352756&width=1200&height=600&coordinates=0%2C180%2C0%2C180,N,,2025-06-02 15:12:10.332612

Prototype 2.0

Summary of Trial Results

As disclosed in the Company's news release dated May 30, 2025, the Trial results (the ""Results"") were performed using Prototype 2.0 on the Nissan Leaf Battery Pack, The Nissan Leaf Battery Pack was first charged at 12 amperes using Battery X Rebalancing Technologies' cycling module to simulate a standard electric vehicle charging cycle. Once the first cell reached the voltage target of 4.20 volts (the ""Voltage Target""), a rebalancing current between 0 and 3 amperes was applied individually to the remaining cells until all 96-battery cells successfully reached the Voltage Target. The Voltage Target lies within the standard operating range for LMO and LNO lithium-ion cells of 3.0 volts to 4.20 volts, with 4.20 volts commonly recognized as the full capacity in the industry¹.

According to the diagnostic report provided by the vendor of the Nissan Leaf Battery Pack (the ""Battery Vendor Diagnostic Report""), the reported measured effective ampere-hour capacity of the Nissan Leaf Battery Pack prior to rebalancing was 50.34 ampere-hours (Ah). This served as the baseline capacity for the Trial. Following the Trial, Prototype 2.0's integrated software determined that 1.95 Ah of additional capacity had been successfully restored. While the Battery Vendor Diagnostic Report did not quantitatively indicate a loss of capacity, it indicated that the Nissan Leaf Battery Pack was operating at 50.34 Ah with minor voltage imbalance that placed the voltage below the Voltage Target. Rebalancing the cells to the Voltage Target achieved a 3.9 percent improvement in usable capacity.

The restored 1.95 Ah corresponds to the full theoretical rebalancing increase based on the Voltage Target achieved, and represents full recovery of the minor voltage imbalance indicated on the Battery Vendor Diagnostic Report. These results were determined by the Trial based on achieving the Voltage Target across all 96-battery cells, along with a software feature of Prototype 2.0 that shows the ampere-hours (Ah) capacity restored through rebalancing for each individual cell, with the largest discrepancy being 1.95 Ah, based on the Voltage Target. Battery X Rebalancing Technologies interprets this result as confirmation of Prototype 2.0's ability to restore all imbalance-induced lost capacity through precise voltage alignment and battery-cell level rebalancing.

Results

Battery X Rebalancing Technologies views this successful demonstration as a critical step in the technology validation process, paving the way for expanded testing, operational protocol development, and eventual commercial deployment.

The Problem: Rising EV Adoption Presents New Battery Lifecycle Challenges

In 2024, global EV sales reached approximately 17.1 million units, representing a 25% increase from 20232. With cumulative global EV sales from 2015 to 2023 totaling an estimated over 40 million units3, a significant share of the global EV fleet is expected to exit warranty coverage over the coming years.

By 2031, nearly 40 million electric, plug-in hybrid, and hybrid vehicles worldwide are anticipated to fall outside of their original warranty coverage4,5. This projection is based on current EV adoption figures and standard industry warranty terms, and underscores a growing risk for EV owners facing battery degradation, reduced capacity, and costly replacement requirements6. As the global EV fleet continues to expand, the demand for technologies that extend battery life, reduce long-term ownership costs, and support a sustainable transition to electric mobility is increasing.

The Solution: Pioneering Next-Generation Technologies to Support Lithium-Ion Battery Longevity

Battery X Rebalancing Technologies' proprietary software and hardware technology aims to address this challenge by extending the lifespan of EV batteries. This innovation is being developed with the aim to enhance the sustainability of electric transportation and the goal to provide EV owners with a more cost-effective, environmentally friendly ownership experience by reducing the need for costly battery replacements.

Battery X Rebalancing Technologies' rebalancing technology, validated by the National Research Council of Canada (""NRC""), focuses on battery cell rebalancing. The NRC validation demonstrated the technology's ability to effectively correct cell imbalances in lithium-ion battery packs, recovering nearly all lost capacity due to cell imbalance. The validation was conducted on battery modules composed of fifteen 72Ah LiFePO₄ cells connected in series. The cells were initially balanced to a uniform state of charge (SOC), with a measured discharge capacity of 71.10Ah. In the validation test, three of the fifteen cells were then artificially imbalanced-one cell was charged to a 20% higher SOC, and two cells were discharged to a 20% lower SOC-resulting in a reduced discharge capacity of 46.24Ah, following rebalancing using Battery X Rebalancing Technologies' rebalancing technology.

These advancements establish Battery X Rebalancing Technologies as a participant in lithium-ion and EV battery solutions, aiming to tackle the critical challenges of capacity degradation of battery packs and expensive replacements. By extending the lifecycle of battery materials within the supply chain, Battery X Rebalancing Technologies aims to support the energy transition and promote a more sustainable future.

,EPA,2025-06-02 18:40:07+00:00,Alaska Public Media,Fairbanks sees improved air quality after decade of effort - Alaska Public Media,"Casey Grove, alaskapublic.org, casey-grove",,,,,https://alaskapublic.org/news/environment/2025-06-02/fairbanks-sees-improved-air-quality-after-decade-of-effort,"Air quality in Fairbanks, somewhat infamously, has at times been among the worst in the nation.
Alaska Beacon reporter Yereth Rosen recently wrote about how -- despite a combination of cold air and geography that traps bad air -- Fairbanks is seeing its air quality improve, thanks in large part to drying out birch firewood before burning it.
YR: Yeah, if you look at the air quality, all these air quality measurements, you know, these measuring stations.
The air quality, actually, when I was there, it was fine.
And I guess that's even part of the story, because it's like there was nothing wrong with the air quality.","Air quality in Fairbanks, somewhat infamously, has at times been among the worst in the nation. But efforts to clear the air and lose that reputation are paying off.

Levels of a specific air pollutant known as PM 2.5 are down by about half over the past decade, according to the Environmental Protection Agency.

With particles no bigger than 2.5 micrometers in diameter, PM 2.5 is just right for embedding in people's lungs. It mainly comes from burning wood, an important heat source in Fairbanks.

Alaska Beacon reporter Yereth Rosen recently wrote about how -- despite a combination of cold air and geography that traps bad air -- Fairbanks is seeing its air quality improve, thanks in large part to drying out birch firewood before burning it.

Below is the transcript of an interview with Rosen on Alaska News Nightly. It has been lightly edited for length and clarity.

Yereth Rosen: Birch has a lot of moisture in it, like a lot more than spruce. And so when people are, they have a bunch of birch logs, and they're putting them into the wood stove without drying them, they're not going to burn efficiently. They're going to produce a lot more smoke and a lot more particulates.

So drying the birch, this is an important part of the big plan called a SIP, or a state implementation plan. There's a lot of bureaucratic stuff, but anyway, this is about, this is an important part, like, have kiln-dried birch available, kiln-dried wood available. If you go to the kiln, which I did, and you stand outside, you just see all the steam coming up. And that's all the steam coming out of the wood.

Casey Grove: Yeah. So that, along with the stove buy-back program — they had money to pay people for their old stoves, to get them more efficient new stoves — brings us to the fun part, which is that the air quality is dramatically better now in Fairbanks, right?

YR: Yeah, if you look at the air quality, all these air quality measurements, you know, these measuring stations. And the way that EPA puts it is the days when there are violations, it's at a level that is only about half as high as it used to be. And there just aren't that many 24-hour violations. But there's still some.

CG: I imagine, like, the local leaders in Fairbanks, Borough Mayor Grier Hopkins, might be applauding this and, you know, not exactly declaring victory, but definitely happy about this. But, I mean, there are still days that are in violation. What's the long-term picture here? I mean, do they get out of this situation where they're, like, constantly being monitored by the EPA, or what?

YR: Well, it doesn't look like that's going to happen anytime soon, that they'll get out of the situation. And if you kind of look at other cities that have inversions and air pollution problems, they sort of never get out of this situation where they have to worry. They always are going to have to worry about it. The very long-term solution would be, you know, some kind of energy that doesn't make smoke, which would be like an alternative energy, you know, renewable energy, which is all why, partly, why the Fairbanks situation is of interest to people who are outside of Fairbanks and outside of Alaska and outside of the United States, even, because it's a really interesting case study.

You know, the mayor and other people in Fairbanks kind of get it irritated at the idea that Fairbanks has this bad reputation. They don't like having a bad reputation for having bad air. So it's important for them to show the progress. And, you know, they do deserve credit for making progress, even though people got mad and didn't want to have the borough do any enforcement. So now the borough is just like in a position of, you know, they're trying to encourage people to do things and show the benefits. And so it's more like a carrot than a stick.

CG: Yeah, I feel like that's what this turned into, yeah. And I guess this is the part where I have to admit publicly that I'm from Fairbanks. I remember being there when, you know, there were many, many, many meetings about this at the borough level. And I mean, I distinctly remember one man testifying in public testimony that if a borough inspector tried to come up on his roof, he'd shoot him off like a squirrel, you know.

So I guess that makes that all makes me wonder, you know, with this news that the number of days per year that they're in violation is half as much as it used to be, is it any less controversial than it was?

YR: There's some things in the plan that are still bothering people. There's some things that homeowners have to do. But I think that just the fact that there is progress, and it's, like, not a hopeless thing is probably making people a little less upset about it. And, you know, people don't want to breathe dirty air, as well. You know, there's plenty of people who who are taking it seriously, plenty of residents that don't want want their kids breathing fine particulates.

CG: Well, I thought I saw a photo in this story at Alaskabeacon.com that showed some West Valley High School ski team members.

YR: Oh yeah.

CG: You took the photo. So I wondered, does that mean that you went to Fairbanks? Did you go skiing?

YR: Of course I went skiing!

CG: How was the air quality?

YR: Well, I was actually at Birch Hill. Of course, I went skiing because, you know how it's been in Anchorage. And I came back and, like, told my Junior Nordic kids, and they were all jealous that I was actually on real snow.

The air quality, actually, when I was there, it was fine. It was good. And I guess that's even part of the story, because it's like there was nothing wrong with the air quality. It was fine. There were a few stations, a few monitoring stations, that, you know, showed a little bit of issues. There's a few that are just kind of chronically, where there's some chronic things.

It's not just Israel; it's the Saudis and nations in the Persian Gulf.” Lower oil prices are a boost for consumers, who will see and on their utility bills, and for Trump’s push to lower inflation through reduced energy costs.
U.S. oil production hit a record high of 13.4 million barrels a day last year.
Tariffs on steel, which Trump announced he would be on Friday, are also putting a dent in oil companies’ profit margins.","The OPEC+ oil cartel said over the weekend that several members will ramp up production for the third consecutive month in another potential hit to a struggling U.S. oil industry that is being hit by low prices and tariffs that have made it more expensive to operate.

The group, which supplies about half of the world’s oil, said a group of its members would ramp up production that will amount to an additional 411,000 barrels per day for July. The move was widely expected by analysts but comes at a time of tepid demand due to economic uncertainties from tariffs and the resulting trade wars and costs hovering around $60 a barrel.

In a release, OPEC+ said a “steady global economic outlook and current healthy market fundamentals, as reflected in the low oil inventories” supported its July increase. Analysts said it is likely the group will not reach its additional quota but is the addition of supply to the market could still hit American producers, who have higher costs for production than their OPEC counterparts.

Saudi Arabia and Russia are trying to win back market share through increased production with the Saudis receiving the biggest share of the latest increases, ramping up its ceiling to around 9.5 million barrels a day.

President Donald Trump has also tried to forge more productive business relationships with major oil producers, including Saudi Arabia, and recently took a trip to the Middle East where he announced a series of business deals.

“President Trump has asked for it, he's cut some commercial deals with the leading members of OPEC, No. 1. No. 2, a lower oil price is very effective in limiting the hard currency that Russia and Iran can obtain,” said Ed Hirs, an energy fellow at the University of Houston. “It's in the interest of the Saudis right now because their concern really is Iran becoming a nuclear power right now. It's not just Israel; it's the Saudis and nations in the Persian Gulf.”

Lower oil prices are a boost for consumers, who will see and on their utility bills, and for Trump’s push to lower inflation through reduced energy costs. Trump came into office and has pushed companies to drill more through executive orders reducing required time for environmental reviews and cutting other regulations aimed at helping increase production.

America was already the world’s largest exporter of natural gas and produced more oil than any other country before the actions, and now U.S. companies are facing economic headwinds that are reducing incentive to continue high production levels. U.S. oil production hit a record high of 13.4 million barrels a day last year.

Whiplash from tariff policy is the main obstacle in front of American oil producers with uncertainty about where import taxes are headed weighing on economic activity and making it challenging for companies to plan for. Economists are projecting for reduced demand for oil this year due to Trump’s expansive tariffs, leaving American producers less revenue and incentive to continue drilling.

Tariffs on steel, which Trump announced he would be on Friday, are also putting a dent in oil companies’ profit margins. Some smaller companies have already rolled back plans to drill and laid off workers in preparation for tariff headwinds and lower prices.

The International Energy Agency is expecting production in the United States’ shale basins, where most of the country’s oil is produced, to fall later this year. Those losses could ramp up if oil prices fall under $60 a barrel, though the market it is entering a period that typically comes with higher demand as people drive more often in the summer and need to power air conditioning as temperatures rise.

Future prices for Brent crude and West Texas Intermediate both opened higher on Monday after OPEC’s announcement, but analysts see that as a trend that is unlikely to continue.

“If you keep driving down the revenues, that's going to certainly diminish any incentive to drill, you just can't make a return,” Hirs said. “The U.S. producers in these tight horizontal formations the shales, the Permian, these wells are expensive, and we can't compete on a low-cost basis with the other major producers like Russia, Saudi Arabia, Iran, Kuwait, Western African nations.”",https://midmichigannow.com/resources/media/7b093f45-b77d-4fd0-8c34-25292f2116dc-large16x9_AP23333598222179.jpg,N,,2025-06-02 15:12:26.094263

After five years of training the next generation of impactful environmental health researchers, we decided it was time to deepen our work and reinvest in our existing community. The unprecedented changes in the fields of public health, environmental protection and climate science we’ve seen this year – which directly impacts the careers and livelihoods of many Agents of Change fellows – has underscored the importance of providing our community with the knowledge, skills, networks, and social capital necessary to navigate this complex landscape.

As a result, we are launching the Fellows in Residence program.

Our reimagined fellowship is an effort to deepen our impact on decision-making and provide additional support to six senior Agents of Change fellows in their path towards creating more impactful research.

A reimagined future

This new initiative will build and strengthen alliances and collaborations with other programs, institutions and media organizations, provide support and network to help fellows navigate opportunities where they and their research can lead conversations in their respective fields, amplify our fellows’ expertise and help them develop community and policy products that will be incorporated into decision-making.

The Fellows in Residence program gathers Senior Agents of Change fellows who will participate in key networking opportunities through webinars, personalized mentorship opportunities, and more.

They will also have the opportunity to work on an individualized communication campaign to broaden the impact of their research. In this new era, fellows in residence will pick and choose different deliverables such as op-eds, fact sheets, policy briefs, science snippet videos, or more, that align with their current work and interests.

In short:

A Wood Mackenzie report outlines three potential futures for the global economy under different tariff scenarios, ranging from a modest growth slowdown to a full-blown recession, with energy industries across the board facing cost hikes and uncertainty.

Renewable energy sectors, especially battery storage and solar, are especially vulnerable due to their dependence on imports, and could fall behind technologically as tariffs make cutting-edge equipment from China financially inaccessible.

The Trump administration’s unpredictable tariff policy has made it difficult for utilities, manufacturers, and investors to plan long term, hindering domestic clean energy expansion and leaving the U.S. trailing behind Europe and China on costs and innovation.

Key quote:

“We’ve already kind of penalized solar with the tariffs that we have in place.”

— Chris Seiple, vice chairman for power and renewables, Wood Mackenzie

Why this matters:

The reach of tariffs into the energy sector is vast and disruptive. By inflating the cost of materials and creating uncertainty for long-term investment, these trade policies are dragging down the momentum of the renewable energy transition just as global demand for clean power accelerates. U.S. solar and battery storage companies, which rely heavily on imports for key components, are particularly exposed—importing over 90% of battery tech alone. Meanwhile, nations like China and those in the European Union are not only advancing rapidly in renewable deployment but are doing so at significantly lower costs. This disparity risks locking the U.S. into outdated infrastructure, raising costs for consumers and utilities alike. Worse, the murky motives behind the tariffs—ranging from protectionism to foreign policy posturing—make it nearly impossible for energy developers to plan.

In short:

The Court’s decision supports the Uinta Basin Railway, a project aimed at transporting crude oil from Utah to national markets, by narrowing the environmental review requirements under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA).

Environmental groups and Eagle County, Colorado, previously halted the railway with a successful lawsuit that argued the federal review ignored wildfire, pollution, and wildlife risks along the rail line.

Justice Brett Kavanaugh, writing for the Court, said the federal board need only consider direct impacts of railway construction and not indirect consequences like increased drilling or downstream pollution.

Key quote:

“The Board did not need to evaluate potential environmental impacts of the separate upstream and downstream projects. The environmental consequences of future oil drilling in the Basin are distinct from construction and operation of the railroad line.”

— Justice Brett Kavanaugh

Why this matters:

The Uinta Basin Railway ruling may reshape how major infrastructure projects are reviewed under NEPA, one of the nation's cornerstone environmental laws. For decades, NEPA has required that federal agencies consider not just the immediate impacts of projects like pipelines and railroads, but also how they contribute to broader harm — such as climate change, water contamination, or habitat destruction. This new interpretation gives agencies more leeway to sidestep those extended impacts, even when the consequences are foreseeable. That shift could speed up projects backed by fossil fuel interests while weakening a key tool used by environmental groups and communities to challenge pollution and public health threats. In this case, the crude oil trains would travel through sensitive terrain near the Colorado River and populated areas, raising concerns about spills, fire risks, and downstream air and water pollution.

US Supreme Court curbs major federal environmental statute

In short:

The lawsuit accuses the Trump administration of executive overreach by issuing pro-fossil fuel orders that undermine environmental protections and harm young people’s health and safety.

Plaintiffs argue these orders have increased greenhouse gas emissions, blocked renewable energy development, and suppressed climate science, violating rights under state and federal constitutions.

The suit follows a series of youth-led legal actions by Our Children’s Trust, including a major win in Montana that declared state fossil fuel policies unconstitutional.

Key quote:

“Trump’s fossil fuel orders are a death sentence for my generation.”

— Eva Lighthiser, youth plaintiff

Why this matters:

Legal efforts like this one are part of a growing trend of youth-led climate litigation aimed at holding governments accountable for environmental degradation. While fossil fuel development has long powered the U.S. economy, its emissions are a key driver of global warming, which scientists warn is intensifying storms, flooding, wildfires, and droughts across the country. Children and young adults are particularly vulnerable to these impacts, both physically and psychologically, and they face a future shaped by decisions made today. The plaintiffs live in states already experiencing climate-related harm, such as sea-level rise, heatwaves, and infrastructure collapse. Many also report chronic anxiety about the future. Lawsuits like this aim to challenge not just policy outcomes but the premise that economic growth must come at the expense of public health and environmental integrity.

Young plaintiffs in Juliana v. United States lose Supreme Court bid but say they'll continue their pursuit of climate justice

In short:

Misti Leon is suing Exxon Mobil, Chevron, Shell, BP, ConocoPhillips, Phillips 66, and Olympic Pipeline Co., alleging that their emissions caused the extreme heat that killed her 65-year-old mother, Juliana Leon, in June 2021 during a heat dome event in the Pacific Northwest.

The lawsuit argues the companies knowingly produced emissions that worsened climate change and misled the public about the risks, constituting wrongful death, public nuisance, and failure to warn.

Legal experts say this is the first case linking an individual’s death directly to corporate responsibility for climate change, a potential new front in environmental litigation.

Key quote:

“I never would have in a million years guessed that a heat dome and climate change would be what killed my mother and what took her from me.”

— Misti Leon, plaintiff

Why this matters:

Extreme heat is becoming one of the most lethal consequences of climate change. In the U.S., heat-related deaths have doubled over recent decades, often affecting the elderly, outdoor workers, and people without access to air conditioning. The scientific community overwhelmingly agrees that the burning of fossil fuels has driven global temperatures upward, intensifying weather events like heat waves. These events can overwhelm the human body, disable infrastructure, and trigger wildfires. While most lawsuits over climate harm have come from cities and states, this case signals a growing willingness to connect individual human loss to corporate actions. The implications for public health, particularly among vulnerable populations, are profound.

Other part in LFP batteries is iron (and there's a move to add some manganese in the mix).
LFP Batteries have about 140-200g/kWh or about $6 worth.
LFP batteries have about $2/kWh worth.
No one is currently working on true solid state batteries for mass market applications (No, neither CATL nor BYD nor Toyota nor Mercedes nor VW).","It'd be interesting to see EVs, instead of having different battery size options as we have now, to have different chemistry options. The cheapest ones could be sodium ion, with less range, and the most expensive ones could be NMC or solid state, with all options having the same size and weight. That also provides more options for people with special needs such as extreme cold weather performance, and makes manufacturers less susceptible to battery (or material) price swings since they could just adjust prices of each chemistry option independently with the same vehicle.

Lithium's at a relative price floor and is the primary price determinant now that cobalt use is so low in NMC and LFP is gaining traction in the West, as the market is largely dependent on the price of spodumene concentrate (SC6) which is used to produce lithium carbonate (Li2CO3). Higher cost Australian miners are beginning to tap out and are holding larger inventories because they don't want to sell to industry at current spot market rates, and new hardrock projects have similarly slowed down and been put on hold.

Further reductions in price will need to come from technological improvements like larger cell sizes in ESS or greater energy density to lower the BoM per kWh.

Edit to add: Sustained lower-than-incentive prices in the mining industry are a time bomb, as it's what creates/exacerbates boom/bust price cycles due to the illiquidity of supply in the industry. The incentive price is the price which continues to incentivise the necessary supply growth to meet new demand, and considering we're actively losing some supply it's pretty evident we aren't at that atm.

Despite this, domestic Chinese lepidolite operations (higher cost hardrock assets) remain online despite low prices as they're mostly verticalized assets with guaranteed offtake that guarantees locally sourced supply. This is suppressing SC6 prices further as despite demand growing so is supply, in spite of the price continuing to fall.

It's very interesting, though the impacts of all this are very different depending where companies are in the supply chain. Consumers are loving it, while miners are weighing temporary exits

It isn't so much the raw materials. The industry is moving towards LFP and away from costly NMC/NCA chemistries.

There's surprisingly little lithium in lithium ion batteries. Other part in LFP batteries is iron (and there's a move to add some manganese in the mix). Iron is cheap as dirt and manganese isn't expensive, either.

Cost factors have been:

- Processing and refining of lithium ore to lithium phosphate or lithium carbonate which until recently has had a ridiculously high profit margin. However, that is all but gone now.

- Relatively high number of rejects in factories which has since dropped below 5% (not a huge room for improvement, here, currently)

- The graphitic anode is still pretty pricey, though, but that is also unlikely to change. With the addition of silicon higher energy densities can be achieved but it remains to be seen if the added cost/complexity of high silicon anodes will be offset by the lower amount of cells you need for the same energy content.

The thing that has driven cost down most in recent years has been scaling...but there's also a limit to this.

It's really hard to forecast battery prices. If you look at all past forecasts they have been wildly off target. Currently I would put a greater emphasis on geopolitical factors on the price of batteries (tarrifs, trade wars, real wars and the resulting embargos,...) than any developments on the technical side.

Lithium is about $40/kg.

LFP Batteries have about 140-200g/kWh or about $6 worth. It can't really go below 140g. The price per kg can go up and is likely to spike again in a year or two. Maybe adding $6-20/kWh temporarily.

Copper is about $10/kg it will rise slowly.

LFP batteries have about $2/kWh worth. The amount can decrease but this requires an extra manufacturing step of plating some already very thin aluminium with even thinner copper.

There's about $2/kWh of graphite as well. This could maybe halve. Synthetic graphite could also become more viable and the price could decrease that way.

The other $40 is mostly manufacturing at various steps, none of them trivial. About $25-30 cell and $10-15 pack. People are hopeful it can halve again with incremental changes.

Different way of looking at it, automakers in the US and EU are in a constant struggle with union labor, and EVs take around 40% less labor Infernal combustion drivetrains have hundreds of steel parts manufactured with great precision, an EV drivetrain has many fewer moving parts. The potential to use less labor is an aspirational target from the automaker's perspective, the simplification is a potential for higher profit and also a great threat.

The economics of EVs vs ICE on a timescale of thirty years are as clear as they were for horses vs. cars in 1910, when the model T had been out for a couple of years. But it isn't at all clear how a legacy automaker can navigate the transition successfully right now, especially those who sell largely into the US market.

'Solid state' is not a precisely defined term. No one is currently working on true solid state batteries for mass market applications (No, neither CATL nor BYD nor Toyota nor Mercedes nor VW).

All the 'hype news' you hear are about semi-solid state (i.e. they still have a flammable electrolyte - it's just not liquid but more of a gel)...but since the term isn't clearly defined they use ""solid state"" in their PR blurbs.",,N,,2025-06-02 15:11:02.004180

The cost of EV charging at home vs. public EV charging Another critical aspect that EV owners need to consider is the difference in costs between charging at home versus charging in public.
Some states ""offer really cool plans where they'll give you [EV] charging for free,"" said Boutziouvis.
Public charging costs As for public charging, Boutziouvis said there are ""different ways to price it,"" as most public charging stations are independently owned and pricing is therefore up to the owner.
Some public EV charging stations are even free.","According to the AAA, the national average for gas prices is down 40 cents. That's an 11% year-on-year decrease. Yes, some US locales are seeing gas price spikes due to refinery issues. However, this drop can make you wonder: Is it cheaper to fill and use a gas-powered car in comparison to an electric vehicle?

The debate continues feverishly on social media sites like Reddit and TikTok: How much do you save when charging an EV compared with filling the tank of a gasoline-powered car?

One Reddit user says they now spend $70 more on their electricity bill from at-home charging compared with $330 a month in gas previously. Some Reddit users argue against the actual savings. One naysayer, for example, argues that public supercharging is expensive and time-consuming, and another says the cost of installing their home EV charger negated any savings.

Lowering fuel costs could be the main reason EV-curious drivers consider going all-electric in the first place. In June 2022, gas prices hit a record high, averaging more than $5 a gallon nationwide, and although gas prices have fallen to about $3.20 as of February, gas price volatility has many drivers looking at alternatives, such as EVs or hybrids.

The deeper we dove into the Reddit-rabbit hole, the more we found that not all Americans are ready to join the EV revolution. That message is echoed by a CNET survey from summer 2024 that found 43% of US adults have concerns with purchasing EVs, with 21% of respondents citing the cost of charging as a negative factor.

We asked industry experts the big question: Is it cheaper to charge an electric vehicle versus fueling a gas-powered car? The verdict is in -- based on current US averages, EV charging wins out.

The price of gasoline is volatile and, in some areas, expensive. Electricity also varies in price, but ""it's significantly cheaper"" than gasoline, said Anastasia Boutziouvis, solution product manager at ChargePoint, a company that operates the world's largest network of EV charging stations in North America and Europe. That means recharging an EV likewise will usually be considerably less expensive than topping off a gas-powered car's fuel tank.

""Generally, I find that charging an EV is less expensive than filling up a gas-powered car even in my neck of the woods, California, where we have the second-highest energy rates in the US,"" said CNET's 16-year auto and EV expert, Antuan Goodwin. ""That's probably because California also has the highest gas prices in the US, as well.""

We'll show you the math on how much cheaper charging an EV is compared to an internal combustion engine car.

We do the math: Comparing EV charging to filling a gas tank

When considering the costs of fueling or charging an electric car versus a gas car, the differences are stark and fairly obvious. EVs are propelled by electricity that is stored in batteries, which need to be recharged.

Gas-powered cars or those outfitted with internal combustion engines are fueled by burning gasoline.

Using averages from government data sources and AAA fuel prices, we did the math and mapped out for you all the monthly charging and fueling costs side by side.

These calculations use US driving averages for both EVs and ICE cars in data points such as fuel economy, miles driven, cost of electricity and gasoline, power needed for the average EV and more. You could drive a lot more (or less) and accordingly, see your fuel costs vary remarkably.

EV charging costs vs. fuel costs (US averages)

Using US averages, we multiplied what an average cost scenario would look like for both an average electric vehicle and an average ICE car assuming 1,250 miles driven in a given month to create the above graphic. Here are the average US figures we used to do the math.

Using US averages, we found the monthly cost of charging an EV to be $70.72 versus $158 to fuel an ICE car.

Using the same figures above, here's a yearly costs comparison:

$1,896 yearly average cost to fuel an ICE car

$848.64 yearly average cost to charge an EV

That's a yearly difference of $1,047.36

Again, prices for gasoline and electric vary by location -- so your actual savings may be more or less. For example, outlier states like Hawaii (39.6 cents per kWh) and California (33 cents per kWh) are far above the national average of 17 cents per kWh that we used in our math above.

The type of car or EV you have also plays a factor in cost savings. A Tesla Model 3 and a Ford F-150 Lightning -- while both EVs -- won't have the same power efficiency.

Monthly cost of charging an EV

The cost to fuel or charge an EV depends on several factors, but the cheapest way to do it is to charge your EV at home, during off-peak hours. In other words, charging your EV overnight with an at-home charging setup is likely the least costly way to recharge, and in some areas, may only cost a dollar or two; a fraction of the price of a gallon of gas.

Boutziouvis said that ""at a high level, what we're seeing is that the costs are about one-half or one-third of the costs of a gas-powered car"" in terms of getting a ""full tank,"" so to speak.

She said it can cost a few dollars, on average, to recharge an EV. Assuming that you're charging your EV at home using your own charger, the price of doing so really boils down to what you pay for electricity. ""It's totally based on local utility rates, and those vary across the US,"" she said.

Overall charging cost may also depend on whether you have a fixed-rate or variable electric rate or how your chosen energy plan outlines its time-of-use rates throughout the day.

The cost of EV charging at home vs. public EV charging

Another critical aspect that EV owners need to consider is the difference in costs between charging at home versus charging in public. If you don't have a charger or the ability to charge your EV at home, you'll need to do it somewhere else. There are public charging stations in many places such as retail parking lots. Here's an in-depth guide to where you can charge for free.

At-home charging tends to be cheaper, although there can be upfront costs when installing an EV charger and possibly upgrading your home's electrical system. AAA added a price tracker for public EV charging to its fuel prices coverage last November, and the current average cost as of Feb. 12, 2025 is 34.5 cents per kWh, more than double the cost of charging at home.

Home charging costs

The costs of charging at home will, as noted, depend on what you pay for electricity, which will vary depending on where you live. Electricity tends to be more expensive in Hawaii, New England and California and less expensive in western and Midwestern states, such as North Dakota, Utah and Washington. The nationwide average is just over 17 cents per kilowatt hour.

Another thing to keep in mind is that some states with deregulated energy markets -- more commonly known as energy choice markets -- may have additional incentives available to EV drivers. Some states ""offer really cool plans where they'll give you [EV] charging for free,"" said Boutziouvis. She also mentioned certain energy providers may offer incentives that are ""almost like a cellphone plan, with unlimited charging for $20 per month"" or something similar.

Those plans or incentives vary from state to state. In Texas, for example, TXU Energy and Gexa offer energy plans designed to entice EV drivers with free charging periods.

One other thing is that you may be able to use smartphone apps to schedule EV charging during off-peak hours, or when electricity rates are the cheapest (usually overnight), to save more money.

Driving electric can give you a degree of control over your operating costs, said Goodwin. ""I can save money by charging at home or pay more for the convenience of fast charging on longer trips""

""Or you go to the extreme of investing in solar or home energy storage for even more flexibility and energy independence in the long run -- versus combustion cars where I'm simply at the mercy of gas prices,"" said Goodwin.

Public charging costs

As for public charging, Boutziouvis said there are ""different ways to price it,"" as most public charging stations are independently owned and pricing is therefore up to the owner. Tesla is a notable example. It has its own fleet of charging stations, and in addition to the cost of electricity, it charges 50 cents per minute in ""idle fees"" to encourage you to drive away and free up chargers for other users.

Aside from Tesla chargers, other stations typically charge either a flat rate, a fee based on consumption or a fee based on the amount of time an EV driver uses the charger, Boutziouvis said. The costs are determined by local electricity rates plus any applicable fees or markup that the charger's owner implements.

There are two ""levels"" or types of charging to know about, which are AC and DC -- or level 2 and level 3 charging (more on this below). Effectively, DC charging is much faster and likely more expensive at a public charging station. ""DC charging could be $10 to $30 per session,"" Boutziouvis said, and takes 20 or 30 minutes to recharge a battery from 0% to 80%. Conversely, ""AC public charging could be a couple of bucks,"" she said.

""Two to three hours gets you enough range to get back on the road,"" said Goodwin. ""A true full charge at Level 2 could take 6 to 12 hours depending on your car and the charging station."" This is why Goodwin recommends the practice of fully charging your EV overnight at home. ""That's usually the cheapest, most convenient option,"" he said.

Put another way: The faster the charger, the more expensive it's going to be. You could also find free public charging at some locations.

There are more ways to save on electric driving costs that require some planning, says Goodwin. ""Taking advantage of off-peak charging at home if you're able, capitalizing on free EV charging at work or while shopping and maximizing local incentives are great starting points.""

The cost of level 2 vs. level 3 charging

The difference between level 2 and level 3 charging mostly involves speed and how much electricity is moving through a charger and into an EV's battery.

Level 2 charging

Level 2 charging ""is what you'd find in your house,"" said Boutziouvis, and usually delivers between 7 and 11 kilowatts to an EV's battery. That might get the typical EV 30 or 40 miles of range if they charge for a couple of hours. Given that the charging is slower, it may cost a few dollars to charge your EV at a level 2 public charging station. Some public EV charging stations are even free.

Level 3 charging

Level 3 or DC fast-charging, on the other hand, delivers between 50 and 350 kilowatts within the same time frame. Given that many, if not most, EV homeowners charge at home and overnight, it's typically not practical to have a level 3 charging setup at home, so these chargers are generally found in public locations. Given that they're faster, it may cost between $10 and $30 to charge at one, as Boutziouvis mentions.

The costs of EV home charging equipment

Charging your EV at home may be the cheapest way to refill the battery, but getting a charger hooked up can be a relatively big expense.

The cost really hinges on whether your at-home electrical setup can handle the addition of a charger. If not, you may need an electrician to replace your electrical panel (the breaker box is likely located in your basement or garage). That can be expensive depending on where you live and other factors.

Assuming you don't need an upgrade, Boutziouvis said a charger installation could cost around $700, and the costs may vary depending on how physically far away from your electrical panel the charger is. More distance means higher costs, as more materials are required. If you do need an upgraded electrical setup, a new electrical panel can cost a few thousand dollars.

Note that there are tax credits and incentives available for home-charging installation costs. For instance, there's a federal tax credit of 30% of hardware and installation costs up to $1,000, which was put into effect as a part of the Inflation Reduction Act. There may be some utility discounts and incentives, too. Duke Energy, for instance, provides a one-time credit of more than $1,100 per charger in some areas.

A good rule of thumb: If you plan on shopping around for a charger, check with multiple companies, check with your utility for credits and rebates and explore all applicable tax incentives to ensure you get the best deal.

How we do the math on the costs of filling a gas tank or charging an EV

How we do the math to determine average monthly gasoline costs

Step 1: Take the miles driven per month and divide it by the miles per gallon for your vehicle. That number gives you the amount of gallons of fuel needed for the month.

Here's the formula: [Miles driven per month] / [Miles per gallon (MPG) of your vehicle] = [Gallons of fuel required monthly]

Example using US averages: 1,250 miles / 25 MPG = 50 gallons

Step 2: Take the gallons needed per month to power your combustion car and multiply it by the cost of gasoline per gallon. This will tell you the monthly cost to fill up your car each month.

Here's the formula: [Gallons of fuel required for the month] x [Price of gas per gallon] = [Monthly fuel expense]

Example using US averages: 50 monthly gallons x $3.20 per gallon = $160 monthly fuel expense

How we do the math for monthly electric vehicle charging costs

Step 1: Take the average miles driven per month and divide it by the average miles per kWh your EV is capable of. This gives you the expected amount of kWh needed to power your EV each month.

Here's the formula: [Miles driven per month] / [EV miles per kWh]] = [kWh used per month for EV]

Example using US averages: 1,250 monthly miles / 3 kWH per mile = 416 kWh per month

Step 2: Then, you'd calculate the costs of generating those kilowatts by multiplying the cost per kilowatt hour of electricity (kWh) by the total kWh needed to power your EV in a month. This will give you the total cost to charge your EV per month.

Here's the formula: [Cost per kWh for electricity] x [kWh used per month for EV] = [Monthly EV charging costs]

Example using US averages: $0.17 x 416 = $70.72 monthly recharging costs",https://www.cnet.com/a/img/resize/7cab13b3429e8b95e5aad49b09137c801453c05e/hub/2024/06/20/a38b6d80-1aee-4f7d-8dcb-d8f11e462377/240617-feature-image-car-plates-v01-2.jpg?auto=webp&fit=crop&height=675&width=1200,N,,2025-06-02 16:12:50.043198

Data centers are undeniably energy-intensive, but they are also critical drivers of Oregon’s economy.
These facilities support thousands of family-wage jobs in the building trades and have spurred major investments in both power infrastructure and renewable energy projects.
I believe lawmakers are serious about fixing our clean energy challenges, but HB 3546 is not the answer.
Oregon’s skilled electricians are ready to build the infrastructure we need for a clean energy future.","As business manager of IBEW, the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, Local 48, I’ve seen firsthand how policy decisions in Salem ripple through our economy and workforce.

During campaign season, candidates often make ambitious, well-intentioned promises, but the real challenge and responsibility comes when lawmakers must translate those promises into policies that actually work. When it comes to meeting our energy and economic development needs, Oregon needs to re-evaluate its approach and priorities.

A recent report from Oregon Public Broadcasting and ProPublica exposed a harsh reality: despite Oregon’s bold commitments to clean energy, we are falling behind nearly every other state in building out renewable power. The problem isn’t a lack of will or demand, it’s a lack of grid infrastructure. We must dramatically increase renewable energy sources and invest in the transmission lines needed to deliver that power to Oregonians.

Increasing our load capacity is the best way to ensure affordable, stable electricity for consumers. However, instead of advancing solutions that build the grid and create jobs, Salem is pursuing HB 3546, known as the POWER Act — a bill that singles out data centers for new regulatory burdens not applied to other manufacturing sectors. Ironically, the technology companies behind these data centers have demonstrated real leadership in Oregon and nationally by investing in new wind and solar projects. Instead of rewarding this commitment to job creation and climate action, legislators are poised to add new costs and uncertainty exclusively for them. If passed, Oregon would become the first state in the nation to legislatively create a separate, punitive rate class for a specific industry.

Data centers are undeniably energy-intensive, but they are also critical drivers of Oregon’s economy. These facilities support thousands of family-wage jobs in the building trades and have spurred major investments in both power infrastructure and renewable energy projects. Other states have shown that it’s possible to work collaboratively with data center developers, utilities and consumer advocates to create agreements that encourage clean energy growth, ensure cost transparency and provide investment stability. Here in Oregon, the Public Utility Commission already has the authority to adjust rate structures through a careful, evidence-based process. There’s nothing wrong with simply emulating successful and proven models.

I believe lawmakers are serious about fixing our clean energy challenges, but HB 3546 is not the answer. HB 3546 will saddle our economy with more complex and unworkable regulations. As a state, we have set noble and ambitious climate goals. The only way to meet them is through investments in more renewable projects and new transmission lines and the same rules should apply equally to all large energy users, regardless of industry. It’s that simple.

Oregon’s skilled electricians are ready to build the infrastructure we need for a clean energy future. But we need policies that reflect the realities on the ground and not ones that threaten good jobs and undermine the industries investing in our state. Our elected leaders are right to focus on our power needs and climate goals, but let’s do it in a way that lifts up Oregon’s workers and keeps our economy strong. HB 3546, in its current form, fails this test and should be reworked.

It would not be a surprise if there was some sort of political motivation behind the removal of Tesla Superchargers on the Turnpike.
On Friday, Tesla revealed that the New Jersey Turnpike Authority (NJTA) had officially decided to choose a sole third-party provider for its electric vehicle infrastructure.
This resulted in the NJTA not renewing its contract to keep Tesla Superchargers on the toll road.","Tesla is bailing on a crucial piece of the puzzle that would likely enable the production of its vehicles in India, and will instead rely on imports, a bold strategy in the broader scheme, as the country has prioritized local manufacturing in an effort to bolster its economy.

The automaker has dragged its feet to commit to a localized production strategy in India, something that seemed to be the only pathway to a mass market presence in what is the most populous country in the world.

However, Tesla has evidently made a decision on what its plans for the market will be. It seems apparent that it still wants to sell vehicles in India and establish a presence there, but it will not do it in what many would consider a more traditional sense: building vehicles domestically. This is something the company has sparred with the Indian government on for several years.

Now, it’s made up its mind.

During a press conference earlier today, India’s Heavy Industry Minister, Shri Kumaraswamy, confirmed Tesla’s plans for how it will penetrate the massive Indian market, and it will not be doing so through domestic manufacturing:

Kumaraswamy indicated that Tesla has no interest in building cars in India, but it wants to establish some presence there, especially with showrooms, allowing citizens to see and drive the cars they could buy from the company.

The move comes as India has made major progress in reducing the import duties that have frightened many automakers from doing business as importers. India’s massive import duties on vehicles built in other countries doubled prices, which is a significant reason for Tesla’s delay in entering the market.

India is considering a reduction to just 10 percent from 100 percent, which would be significant for companies like Tesla, which are doing whatever they can to enter the market without feeling the impact of the duties.

Electric vehicles made up just 2.5 percent of sales in 2024. There were 4.3 million vehicle purchases in India last year.

Tesla CEO Elon Musk has responded to Tesla being required to decommission and shut down over 60 Superchargers on the New Jersey Turnpike, a move that was announced late last week.

We reported late last week that Tesla was being required to decommission 64 Superchargers on the New Jersey Turnpike as the governing body of the toll road had chosen a sole, third-party company to provide EV charging solutions. This decision requires Tesla to eliminate its current Superchargers on the Turnpike, one of the country’s heaviest-traveled roads.

Tesla to lose 64 Superchargers on New Jersey Turnpike in controversial decision

The New Jersey Turnpike Authority (NJTA) requested that Tesla shut down the 64 charging stalls as a result of its new partnership, something that many are confused by, considering the company’s Superchargers are accessible to many different car companies and not only Teslas.

Additionally, Tesla’s Supercharger Network has gained a reputation for being one of the most reliable, with an incredibly high rate of upkeep.

With these details being known, the NJTA is still choosing to go with another supplier, not even allowing Tesla to keep its already-built Superchargers active, something that would be widely beneficial to EV drivers as a whole.

Musk believes the move is a sign of corruption:

While there is no explicit evidence that this is being done as a retaliatory response to Musk or Tesla specifically, it does seem extremely odd that the NJTA is not allowing the company to keep already-built and active Superchargers available to EV drivers.

Tesla has prepared for this decision for several years already, as it knew this was a possibility. It built 116 other charging piles near the Turnpike, giving drivers access to reliable charging piles.

It would not be a surprise if there was some sort of political motivation behind the removal of Tesla Superchargers on the Turnpike. Politicians have already shown that they are willing to be very vocal about their distaste for Musk and Tesla.

Minnesota Governor and former Vice Presidential Candidate Tim Walz has been very up front about his disdain for the company and its CEO, especially as Musk took a stab at the Federal level with the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE).

Tesla is going to lose 64 Superchargers on the New Jersey Turnpike after a decision by the Turnpike’s governing body was made not to renew its contract with the automaker.

On Friday, Tesla revealed that the New Jersey Turnpike Authority (NJTA) had officially decided to choose a sole third-party provider for its electric vehicle infrastructure. This resulted in the NJTA not renewing its contract to keep Tesla Superchargers on the toll road.

The NJTA also requested, with its decision not to renew with Tesla, that the company decommission all 64 Supercharger stalls, an unprecedented decision that will remove these plugs from the turnpike, making charging more scarce on the busy roadway.

Tesla detailed the situation on Friday:

“The New Jersey Turnpike Authority (“NJTA”) has chosen a sole third-party charging provider to serve the New Jersey Turnpike and is not allowing us to co-locate. As a result, NJTA requested 64 existing Supercharger stalls on the New Jersey Turnpike to not be renewed and be decommissioned.”

Tesla said it has been preparing for the potential that the Turnpike Authority would make this decision for three years by building 116 Superchargers nearby to still supply drivers with reliable charging infrastructure.

The company also noted that its Trip Planner would adjust automatically.

There were also efforts to maintain a relationship that would benefit both the Turnpike and EV drivers who use it.

Tesla said it offered the NJTA various “above-market commercial items,” like an offer to build Superchargers at all New Jersey Service Plazas with equipment upgrades like screens and adapters for those companies who have gained access to its charging piles but need to utilize the NACS and CCS1 plugs.

The decision is one that seemed to baffle the company, especially as infrastructure is one of the biggest concerns among EV skeptics:

“Tesla always advocates for more infrastructure and co-location with additional third-party charging providers. This drives down costs through optionality, and accelerates EV adoption by having sufficient capacity to shoulder peaks. We expect that ~30 times more fast-charging capacity is needed to get to full EV adoption. NJTA’s decision to remove, rather than add, critical charging infrastructure is a setback for New Jersey’s EV adoption goals of 100% Zero-Emission New Car Sales by 2035. It removes Turnpike access to the most reliable (99.9% uptime), least congested (<1% waiters) and cost-effective (~30% lower $/kWh) charging. “

The company said it was more than willing to invest in Turnpike sites if the Authority or New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy wanted to reverse the decision.

SpaceX has been hit with yet another mishap investigation by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) related to the company’s ninth test flight of Starship earlier this week.

The FAA said the mishap investigation is “focused only on the loss of the Starship vehicle, which did not complete its launch or reentry as planned.” The agency said the loss of the Super Heavy booster is covered by one of the FAA’s approved test induced damage exceptions requested by SpaceX.

All of Starship and Super Heavy booster debris landed within the designated hazard areas, the FAA confirmed.

SpaceX Starship Flight 9 recap: objectives & outcomes

It said it activated a Debris Response Area out of an abundance of caution as the booster “experienced its anomaly over the Gulf of America during its flyback toward Texas. The FAA subsequently determined the debris did not fall outside of the hazard area. During the event there were zero departure delays, one flight was diverted, and one airborne flight was held for 24 minutes. ”

SpaceX has become accustomed to mishap investigations by the FAA, as they have been impacted by them on several occasions in the past, including on Flight 8. However, they are a precautionary measure and usually are resolved within a few weeks.

Flight 9 was one of SpaceX’s most eventful, as there were several discoveries during the launch. First, it was SpaceX’s first time reusing a Super Heavy booster, as the one utilized for Flight 9 was also used on Flight 7 in January.

Contact with the booster and Starship were both lost during Flight 9. SpaceX said the booster was lost “shortly after the start of landing burn when it experienced a rapid unscheduled disassembly approximately 6 minutes after launch.”

Meanwhile, Starship was set to make a splashdown in the Indian Ocean, but the vehicle was lost about 46 minutes into the flight, SpaceX said in a mission recap.

It was an improvement from the previous two flights, as both 7 and 8 resulted in the loss of Starship after just a few minutes. Flight 9 lasted considerably longer. These flights are also not intended to make it to Mars, despite what other reports might try to tell you.

The system is especially bad in underserved parts of the city, Sealy said.
In early April, as the EPA canceled grants for similar projects across the country, federal officials assured Thomasville that their funding was on track.
“These projects were selected because they have a really clear path to alleviating the health challenges facing this community,” he said.
“Is a new health clinic for Thomasville, Georgia, woke?” he asked.","Thomasville, Georgia, has a water problem. Its treatment system is far out of date, posing serious health and environmental risks.

“We have wastewater infrastructure that is old,” said Sheryl Sealy, the assistant city manager for this city of 18,881 near the Florida border, about 45 minutes from Tallahassee. “It’s critical that we do the work to replace this.”

But it’s expensive to replace. The system is especially bad in underserved parts of the city, Sealy said.

In September, Thomasville applied to get some help from the federal government, and just under four months later, the city and its partners were awarded a nearly $20 million Community Change grant from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to make the long-overdue wastewater improvements, build a resilience hub and health clinic, and upgrade homes in several historic neighborhoods.

“The grant itself was really a godsend for us,” Sealy said.

In early April, as the EPA canceled grants for similar projects across the country, federal officials assured Thomasville that their funding was on track. Then on May 1, the city received a termination notice.

“We felt, you know, a little taken off guard when the bottom did let out for us,” said Sealy.

Thomasville isn’t alone.

Under the Trump administration, the EPA has canceled or interrupted hundreds of grants aimed at improving health and severe weather preparedness because the agency “determined that the grant applications no longer support administration priorities,” according to an emailed statement to Grist.

The cuts are part of a broader gutting of federal programs aimed at furthering environmental justice, an umbrella term for the effort to help communities that have been hardest hit by pollution and other environmental issues, which often include low-income communities and communities of color.

In Thomasville’s case, the city has a history of heavy industry that has led to poor air quality. Air pollution, health concerns, and high poverty qualified the surrounding county for the Biden administration’s Justice40 initiative, which prioritized funding for disadvantaged communities. Thomasville has some of the highest exposure risks in Georgia to toxic air pollutants that can cause respiratory, reproductive, and developmental health problems, according to the Environmental Defense Fund’s Climate Vulnerability Index. The city’s wastewater woes don’t only mean the potential for sewage backups in homes and spills into local waterways but also the risk of upper respiratory problems, according to Zealan Hoover, a former Biden administration EPA official who is now advising the advocacy groups Environmental Protection Network and Lawyers for Good Government.

“These projects were selected because they have a really clear path to alleviating the health challenges facing this community,” he said.

Critics argue there’s a disconnect between the Trump administration’s attack on the concept of environmental justice and the realities of what the funds are paying for.

“What is it about building a new health clinic and upgrading wastewater infrastructure … that’s inconsistent with administration policy?” Democratic Georgia Senator Jon Ossoff asked EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin at a recent hearing.

Zeldin repeatedly responded by discussing the agency’s review process intended to comply with President Donald Trump’s executive orders, particularly those related to diversity, equity, and inclusion policies, but Ossoff cut him off, pushing for a specific answer about Thomasville’s grant. “Is a new health clinic for Thomasville, Georgia, woke?” he asked.

Thomasville’s Sealy said she understands that the federal government has to make hard funding decisions — that’s true locally too — but losing this grant has left her city in the lurch. In addition to the planned work on the wastewater collection system, the city needs to update its treatment plant to meet EPA standards. That overhaul will likely cost $60 million to $70 million, she said.

“How do you fund that?” Sealy asked. “You can’t fund that on the backs of the people who pay our rates.”

The funding cuts have left cities across Georgia — including Athens, Norcross, and Savannah — as well as nonprofit groups, in a state of uncertainty: some grants terminated, some suspended then reinstated, some still unclear. This puts city officials in an impossible position, unable to wait or to move forward, according to Athens-Clarke County Sustainability Director Mike Wharton.

“Do you commit to new programs? Do you commit to services?” he said. “Here you are sitting in limbo for months.”

Like Thomasville, Athens was also awarded a nearly $20 million Community Change grant. The city was going to use the money for backup generators, solar power, and battery storage at its public safety complex — ensuring 911, police, the jail, a domestic violence shelter, and other services could all operate during a power outage. That grant has been terminated.

The problem, Wharton said, goes beyond that money not coming in; the city had already spent time, resources, and money to get the grant.

“We spent $60,000 in local funding hiring people to write the grants,” he said. “Over a period of 14 months we invested over 700 hours of local personnel time. So we diverted our services to focus on these things.”

These frustrations are playing out for grant recipients throughout the state and country, according to Hoover. He said it’s not just confusing — it’s expensive.

“They are causing project costs to skyrocket because they keep freezing and unfreezing and refreezing projects,” he said. “One of the big drivers of cost overruns in any infrastructure project, public or private, is having to demobilize and remobilize your teams.”

Thomasville and Athens officials both said they’re appealing their grant terminations, which require them to submit a formal letter outlining the reasons for their appeal and requesting the agency reconsider the decision. They’re also reaching out to their elected officials, hoping that pressure from their senators and members of Congress can get them the federal money they were promised.

Other cities and nonprofits, as well as a group of Democratic state attorneys general, have sued, arguing that terminating their grants without following proper procedures is illegal. But that’s a difficult step for many localities to take.

“Suing the federal government to assert your legal rights is very daunting, even if the law is on your side,” Hoover said.

2. OPEC members to up oil production for third consecutive month

This weekend, the eight members of OPEC+ announced that they would continue to increase oil production in July, the third straight month in a row. The group’s target is an additional 411,000 barrels a day, or more than three times what it had previously planned, AFP reports, though analysts expect the actual production amount will be less.

The increases have followed a period of low production by Saudi Arabia, though The New York Times notes that the Saudis and other OPEC+ members like the United Arab Emirates “had chafed because some members, including Iraq and Kazakhstan, had exceeded their ceilings. The Saudis are now sending a message that they will not restrain output if others don’t.” Though the prices for Brent crude have fallen this year by around 16%, the Times adds that the Saudis, “who have low costs, can still make money at those levels” even as shale drillers in the U.S. have slowed. OPEC produces approximately 40% of the global crude oil supply, with oil and gas operations accounting for around 15% of total energy-related emissions worldwide.

3. The average energy project costs 40% more for construction, runs 2 years longer than expected: study

The average energy infrastructure project costs 40% more than expected for construction and takes nearly two years longer to complete than initially planned, according to a new study of 662 such projects in 83 countries by the Boston University Institute for Global Sustainability, published in the journal Energy Research & Social Science. Nuclear power plants were the worst offenders, with construction costing 102.5% more on average, or $1.56 billion more than expected. Hydrogen, carbon capture and storage, and thermal power plants that rely on natural gas were also among higher-risk infrastructure projects, the study found. “I’m particularly struck by our findings on the diseconomies of scale, with projects exceeding 1,561 megawatts in capacity demonstrating significantly higher risk of cost escalation,” Hanee Ryu, one of the researchers, said. “This suggests that we may need to reconsider our approach to large-scale energy infrastructure planning, especially as we commit trillions to global decarbonization efforts.”

Solar energy and transmission projects, on the other hand, had the lowest investment risks for construction and time costs, and are often completed ahead of schedule and for less than expected, the research found. Wind, similarly, “performed favorably in the financial risk assessment.” You can read the full report here.

4. IATA warns airline decarbonization is ‘in peril’

Airline industry decarbonization goals are “in peril,” according to comments made by the International Air Transport Association’s senior vice president for sustainability, Marie Owens Thomsen, at a trade conference in India on Sunday. While several major aviation groups have set 2050 as the goal for achieving net-zero carbon emissions for air travel, Owens Thomsen specifically cited the Trump administration’s policies as “obviously a setback,” Barron’s reports.

Programs to support the development of sustainable aviation fuels are also in jeopardy. The European Union requires carriers to include 2% lower-emission biofuel in their fuel mix starting this year, but Owens Thomsen said the cheap cost of oil is still diminishing the “sense of urgency that people have.” She expected a $4.7 trillion investment in SAF would be needed to meet the 2050 emission goals. “It is entirely achievable,” she went on, calling the money involved “very comparable to the money that was involved in creating the previous new energy markets, notably, obviously, wind and solar.”

5. GM kicks Tesla out of top EV spot in Canada

Tesla is no longer the best-selling electric vehicle in Canada. Late last week, GM announced it has officially taken the crown as the “#1 EV seller” in the country, following a surge in sales of 252% in the first three months of the year, led by the Chevy Equinox EV.

Though Tesla’s dethroning is also indicative of the brand’s diminished reputation abroad — Electrek notes Tesla registered just 542 cars in Quebec, the country’s top EV market, in the first quarter of 2025 — the numbers also reflect GM’s successes, with even sales of its GMC Hummer EV Pickup up 232%. Combined Q1 EV sales in Canada were nevertheless still down significantly, to 5,750 from 15,000 EV sales in Q4, Electrek adds, a dip attributable to Quebec’s pause on federal EV incentives between February and April.

Happy second day of meteorological summer! It could be a toasty one: The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s Climate Prediction Center expects hotter-than-average temperatures across much of the Southwest and Northeast this year.

It could reshape the scale of legal challenges that projects could face in the future, giving the Trump administration — and any successive administration — greater leeway to approve energy projects.

Under NEPA, federal agencies must study the environmental impacts of their decisions before they make them. The strictest studies can run into the hundreds of pages, and they can take years to complete.

But in what was essentially an 8-0 decision, the Court ruled that federal agencies almost never need to analyze the second-order environmental effects of their decisions. In other words, an agency need only study the environmental impact of a project itself — be it a pipeline, a solar farm, or, in the case at issue, a railroad — and not its metaphorically downstream consequences. That remains the case even if a given project might indirectly make it much easier to do something with a big environmental footprint, such as drilling for oil or natural gas.

That is the clearest effect of the ruling. But Justice Brett Kavanaugh, writing for the court’s conservative majority, went much further than that summary alone suggests. In a broad and forceful ruling, he told lower courts that they should stop nitpicking the environmental studies that federal agencies must publish under NEPA to justify their own decision-making. Courts should, instead, defer to federal agencies as much as is reasonable when reviewing a NEPA study. “The goal of the law,” he writes, “is to inform agency decision-making, not to paralyze it.” (Justice Neil Gorsuch recused himself from the case because of his connection to an oil magnate who could have benefited from the ruling.)

That suggests a significant change is coming to how the court system interprets NEPA, a law that is little known to the general public but that plays a defining role in how federal agencies make decisions or approve infrastructure projects. NEPA creates a procedural requirement that federal agencies study the environmental impact of any “major decision,” but that category is so broad that it affects virtually everything the federal government does — spend money, write a new regulation, or approve a new project on federal land. The law and the yearslong lawsuits that it spawns have been blamed for delays in building solar farms and transmission lines, but also oil refineries and gas pipelines.

Kavanaugh’s ruling is “pretty striking for just how strident it is, and how assertively it tries to shut the door on further NEPA litigation,” Nicholas Bagley, a University of Michigan law professor who studies the permitting system, told me. Kavanaugh’s message to lower courts is, in essence, “We keep telling you to knock it off. You keep not listening. So knock it the fuck off,” Bagley said.

At the very least, the ruling suggests that a new phase in the effort to reform the country’s permitting laws has arrived. Now that movement has, in essence, been blessed by the Supreme Court.

The case in question — Seven County Infrastructure Coalition v. Eagle County, Colorado — concerns an 88-mile railroad proposed to connect the Uinta Basin in eastern Utah to the national freight rail network. In 2021, the Surface Transportation Board, a federal agency that regulates railroads, approved the project after completing a roughly 3,600-page study of the railroad’s potential environmental impact.

Almost immediately, environmental groups argued that the board’s study did not go far enough. The ground beneath the Uinta Basin is rich in a waxy and particularly carbon-intensive crude oil; right now, very little of that oil is extracted because the only way to get it out is by truck, along windy mountain roads. The railroad, if built, would allow for much larger volumes of crude to be transported out of the basin and sent to Gulf Coast refineries. Building the railroad, in other words, would indirectly increase local oil extraction, and thereby raise global greenhouse gas emissions.

The board argued that its NEPA study did not need to consider these downstream effects because the board itself does not regulate oil extraction — that is, it regulates the building of railroads, not what gets moved on them.

The eight justices agreed that the board was right: It didn’t have to consider the effects of second-order oil drilling when it approved the railroad. (The railroad remains on hold for other reasons, Sambhav Sankar, a senior vice president at Earthjustice, told me.) But by going further in his ruling, Kavanaugh entered into a running debate about the role of NEPA and other permitting laws in the American economy.

NEPA was never meant to play the commanding role that it does today, Kavanaugh writes. When it was first signed into law in 1970, NEPA was meant to act as a “purely procedural” check on federal decision-making. Agencies were supposed to conduct environmental studies, make their decisions, then move on. But in a famous 1971 ruling concerning a proposed nuclear power plant in Maryland, Judge Skelly Wright of the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals transformed the law. He found that agencies had to carry out NEPA’s procedural requirements “to the fullest extent possible,” and crucially that courts could reject agencies’ analysis for lack of completeness.

Over the years, as hundreds of cases following Wright’s have added up, NEPA has turned into a “fearsome project killer,” Bagley said. Agencies spend decades of person-power and hundreds of thousands of dollars to prepare fastidious environmental reviews of their decisions. Any new infrastructure project or new policy change — even New York City’s congestion charge — requires some form of NEPA study.

Many conservatives have long opposed the modern NEPA process. But in recent years, some liberals have joined them, arguing that the law primarily slows down clean energy infrastructure and encourages NIMBYism. In practice, they say, NEPA acts as more of hindrance to the clean economy than the old fossil fuel economy: Because of a 2005 law, most oil and gas drilling has been exempt from the NEPA process, while wind farms, solar plants, and other forms of zero-carbon energy infrastructure still have to face it. Environmental groups rebut that the law is a useful tool to slow down fossil fuel pipelines, which do not generally get a NEPA exemption.

Data supports the idea that NEPA holds back clean energy projects, but that is partly because it holds back so many kinds of projects. The R Street Institute, a center-right think tank, has found that 42% of projects stalled by NEPA involved green infrastructure or conservation. Another analysis from the Center for Growth and Opportunity at Utah State University found that it takes more than two years on average for federal agencies to complete environmental reviews of solar and wind projects. Reviews for new hydroelectric or nuclear power plants take even longer.

Kavanaugh, in essence, rejects all of this. NEPA was never supposed to block or hinder large-scale energy or infrastructure projects, he writes; it was meant to “inform agency decision-making, not to paralyze it.”

“A 1970 legislative acorn has grown over the years into a judicial oak that has hindered infrastructure development ‘under the guise’ of just a little more process,” he says. When federal agencies write environmental studies under NEPA, courts should broadly defer to the decisions that they make. And even if an agency gets something wrong in its study or omits something important, that does not mean the entire study — and the decision that it justifies — should be thrown out. (There’s some irony to Kavanaugh’s call for deference to agencies here, given that the Supreme Court rejected the idea that agency regulations deserve deference last year.)

“What’s notable for me is that they didn’t just rule on the case,” Sankar, the Earthjustice lawyer told me. (Earthjustice participated in the case.) “They decided to take a broad swipe at NEPA itself, really unnecessarily.”

Alexander Mechanick, a senior policy analyst at the Niskanen Center and former White House regulatory lawyer, agreed with Sankar about the scope of the ruling. The court’s decision “does communicate over and over again, with a heavy hand, a real desire to get lower courts out of the business of fly specking the environmental impact assessments,” he told me.

It’s this forthrightness that seems to announce a new era of NEPA jurisprudence — one where the courts will accept a level of environmental review that they may have once rejected. In a way, Kavanaugh’s ruling is a fitting sequel to Wright’s 1971 decision in that both set the tone and capture the overarching environmental concerns of their respective eras, Bagley said.

Half a century ago, Judge Wright wanted to make sure that the American public could slow the wave of infrastructure that threatened to overwhelm the country’s landscape. NEPA represented “the commitment of the government to control, at long last, the destructive engine of material ‘progress,’” he wrote, asserting that judges must make sure the law’s goals are not “lost or misdirected in the vast hallways of the federal bureaucracy.”

Now, Kavanaugh seems to fear that progress itself has been held up. He writes that the modern NEPA process, with its cycles of “speculation and consultation and estimation and litigation,” has slowed down infrastructure projects and driven up their cost. He can sound more like an op-ed writer than a legal scholar as he lays out the law’s consequences in the ruling:

Fewer projects make it to the finish line. Indeed, fewer projects make it to the starting line. Those that survive often end up costing much more than is anticipated or necessary, both for the agency preparing the EIS and for the builder of the project. And that in turn means fewer and more expensive railroads, airports, wind turbines, transmission lines, dams, housing developments, highways, bridges, subways, stadiums, arenas, data centers, and the like. And that also means fewer jobs, as new projects become difficult to finance and build in a timely fashion.

In this declaration, Kavanaugh seems to put himself on the side of a growing and tenuously bipartisan movement to reform NEPA. A 2023 debt ceiling bill, signed by President Biden, included modest reforms to the NEPA process, imposing page limits and deadlines on the strictest forms of environmental studies. A more sweeping bipartisan effort to change the law failed last year. Now, House Republicans are taking their own crack at revising NEPA, creating an optional and more expensive permitting “fast track” for developers in the reconciliation bill.

Sankar, whose organization has championed NEPA, argues that the ruling’s practical upshot will be to allow the Trump administration greater leeway to build fossil fuel infrastructure. Kavanaugh’s ruling exhibits “a shocking disregard for the realpolitik of what's going on with this administration in particular,” he said.

“As we’ve been saying all along, NEPA gets demonized as the problem,” Sankar said. With the law’s role reduced, “I think people will see that there are a lot of other things that are the problem here, and taking federal agency expertise out of the equation is not going to hurry things up.” He added that state and local governments often rely on federal NEPA reports for their own analyses, and now those reviews may be less trustworthy.

Bagley, who has generally supported permitting reform efforts, agreed that NEPA is just one of several laws holding back clean energy projects nationwide. But it is an important one, he said, and reducing its scope will likely allow more projects to happen. He added that by changing it, advocates will learn of additional bottlenecks that are holding back construction — including laws that nobody has noticed yet because they were previously less important than NEPA. Advocates can also now focus their attention on state and local barriers to building.

“If you want to look at the permitting burdens across the United States, probably 80% to 90% of them are state and local. This [ruling] isn’t going to inaugurate a new era of American dynamism,” Bagley said. “It’s a small step in the right direction.”

Most of the cancelled projects were part of the Industrial Demonstration Program, which was created by the Inflation Reduction Act and designed to help commercialize decarbonization solutions that were past the early experimental stage, but were also not quite ready for mass deployment.

Proponents of the program found the DOE’s decision outrageous. “They’re not building an economy — they’re dismantling it and giving away the future of manufacturing,” Evan Gillespie, a partner at the advocacy group Industrious Labs, said in a statement. Canceling these projects is “handing the competitive advantage to Europe, China, Canada, and other nations that are making significant investments in clean manufacturing while leaving the U.S behind,” he added.

The Kraft Heinz Food Company, for example, was supposed to get $172 million to swap out fossil fuel-fired boilers and other heating equipment for electric heat pumps and solar thermal systems at 10 of its factories. “This project seeks to help a major American brand achieve deep decarbonization and serve as an example for other U.S. food and beverage companies to reduce emissions from process heat while reducing energy costs,” the original award from the DOE said. Diageo, the liquor conglomerate, and Kohler, the kitchen and bathroom appliance brand, were also among the awardees.

Cement production is one of the biggest sources of industrial emissions in the world, and also among the most difficult to decarbonize due to an integral chemical reaction that releases carbon into the atmosphere regardless of whether the plant burns fossil fuels. Experts aren’t sure yet what the best solution will be, and the DOE program awarded a variety of projects to test different pathways.

Heidelberg Materials, one of the largest cement companies in the world, was going to get $500 million to demonstrate the first cement plant to capture and sequester its carbon emissions in the U.S. A company called Sublime Systems that’s using an alternative chemistry and electric currents to make cement was supposed to receive $87 million to build its first commercial-scale factory in Holyoke, Massachusetts. Just last week, Sublime signed a deal to supply 623,000 metric tons of zero-carbon cement to Microsoft, in part to support the tech giant’s data center buildout. Another company called Brimstone was awarded $189 million to produce low-carbon cement alongside alumina, the base material used to make aluminum.

“Given our project's strong alignment with President Trump's priority to increase U.S. production of critical minerals, we believe this was a misunderstanding,” a spokesperson for Brimstone told me. “Brimstone's Rock Refinery represents the only economically viable way to produce the critical mineral alumina in the U.S. from U.S.-mined rocks. As the first U.S.-based alumina plant in a generation, our project — which would also make Portland cement — would clear a 'mine-to-metal' path for U.S. aluminum production, fortifying the U.S. critical mineral supply chain and creating thousands of jobs.”

Sublime also shared a statement asserting that its technology would enable the Trump administration’s priorities. “We continue our bipartisan appeal to leaders who recognize that investing in American-invented breakthrough industrial technologies can address multiple policy priorities in tandem to the benefit of Americans from all walks of life,” Sublime said. The company added that it has “prepared for the possibility of this disappointing outcome” and is “evaluating various scenarios that leave our scale-up unimpeded.”

Oil and gas companies were also hit. A $332 million grant to help Exxon switch to low-carbon hydrogen at one of its refineries was canceled, as were $540 million in grants for the energy company Calpine to install carbon capture on its natural gas plants.

“It is hugely disappointing to see these projects canceled — projects that had already progressed through a rigorous, months-long review process by technical experts at DOE,” Jessie Stolark, the executive director of the Carbon Capture Coalition, said in a statement. While Wright said the terminations would generate taxpayer savings, Stolark argued they were depriving Americans of economic benefits. “Every dollar invested by the American taxpayer can lead to up to $4 in economic output through additional supply and material orders, job creation, and broader economic benefits to regional economies,” she wrote, citing a Department of Energy-authored analysis.

None of the awardees responded to my inquiry as to whether they would consider pursuing legal challenges. According to the law under which the program was created, the funding was to be awarded “on a competitive basis,” based on the expected greenhouse gas emission reductions from the project and its potential to provide the greatest benefit to the greatest number of people. Additional criteria in the agency’s application process said it would evaluate projects based on the “degree to which the applicant assesses and demonstrates potential market competitiveness and sustainability for the proposed project, technology, and manufactured product(s) through market analysis and offtake agreements.”

Notably absent from the list of canceled projects is a grant for the steelmaking company Cleveland Cliffs. Earlier this month, I reported that the company was renegotiating its award under the Industrial Demonstration Program. On an earnings call, its CEO said it was abandoning plans to use clean energy and instead looking to use the funds to extend the life of its fossil fuel-fired blast furnace.

If gone unchallenged, the funding is not likely to be re-awarded to other projects. The budget bill that is currently working its way through Congress would rescind any money from the Industrial Demonstrations Program that isn’t under contract.",https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy82MDM1MjUzOC9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTgwMjA5ODQ1OX0.BU_tXl8KhyWVSJ5oIOP5u2uRWACrM8x5n4k17aa8CCA/image.jpg?width=1200&height=600&coordinates=0%2C100%2C0%2C100,N,,2025-06-02 14:12:17.785562

This marks the second-strongest start to a year on record for clean energy. ACP noted that growth is particularly strong in Republican-leaning states, where domestic manufacturing and energy production has created nearly 650,000 direct and indirect jobs and generates $3.4 billion in annual tax revenue.

“Clean power is shovel-ready at scale. With unprecedented demand growth for electricity, we must send consistent investment signals across the energy sector,” ACP CEO Jason Grumet said. “We have the technology, investment capital, and workforce required to build the $300+ billion of clean energy projects in our development pipeline. The greatest threat to a reliable energy system is an unreliable political system.”

Among the highlights, the report found that U.S. clean power capacity reached 320+ GW in Q1 2025, enough to power nearly 80 million American homes. Further, the 7.4 GW of new capacity made it the second-strongest Q1 on record. The 115 project phases that came online in Q1 total $10 billion of private investment into the U.S. energy infrastructure.

Also, battery storage capacity surpassed 30 GW nationwide, representing a 65 percent increase year-over-year, with Q1 2025 setting a new first-quarter record at 1,602 MW. In addition, the development pipeline grew 12 percent year-over-year to reach 184,418 MW, with storage and wind pipelines growing 57% and 24% respectively.

It is worth noting that even the energy producers are also starting to catch up to this consensus of analysts.
However, when it comes to federal funding for upgrades as well as energy efficiency enhancement, they are going to help the hydropower industry so as to maintain their aging facilities and also continue their status as being a major contributor to the US renewable energy shift.
It is well to be noted that hydropower comprises 27% of total renewable energy generation within the US, as per the Department of Energy.
Significantly, such kinds of facilities comprise the overwhelming majority and are at 96% of renewable energy storage capacity in the US.","It is well to be noted that the Donald Trump administration has gone on to take extraordinary measures in order to reverse the transition when it comes to US renewable energy shift. However, the decarbonization stage is already set.

Wind, and to be more specific solar, has already far outpaced natural gas when it comes to new power generation additions to the nation’s grid strength, and this trend is anticipated to continue as the signs indicate the demand when it comes to renewable energy has nowhere to go but only climb. Let’s discuss the three of them.

Greenhouse gas emissions – more information is available just at a click of the button

Keeping the federal energy policy aside, there are many US states that continue to pursue clean power portfolios.

Global firms that operate within the US also need information on certain sources of electricity that are flowing through the grid so as to fulfill their commitments to clean power. In order to respond to these demand-side forces, leading US grid operator MISO—Midcontinent Independent System Operator—in 2022 went ahead and launched an online greenhouse emissions dashboard, which enabled the users to monitor the carbon intensity of the MISO grid throughout 15 midwestern and southern states. In 2024, the organization enhanced its projections in order to achieve emissions reporting almost in a real-time mode.

It is worth noting that MISO happens to be one of the several regional operators that were established in the 1990s in order to support national grid dependence and resilience. Its territory happens to include the state of Iowa as well as other states having a considerable stake when it comes to wind energy. Under the MISO umbrella come states such as Illinois, Kentucky, Indiana, Arkansas, Louisiana, Minnesota, Missouri, Mississippi, Montana, South Dakota, and Wisconsin, in addition to certain small footholds in Texas too.

Even when President Trump took office in January 2025, MISO went on to improve its emissions reporting by way of launching a new consumed feature to the dashboard in March of the same year, which offers a high level of detail when it comes to carbon emissions at the user end.

The organization noted that increasingly strict regulations, member goals, and customer requirements are indeed driving requests for MISO in order to leverage its functional data so as to offer credible emissions data estimates.

Major drivers when it comes to this kind of interest include going ahead, meeting as well as reporting emission reduction goals by creating novel tariffs in order to support end-use customer demands, increasing visibility when it comes to operational decision-making, and also data to aid investment decisions.

All they said was it might not be done, but it can

Yet another indication when it comes to the permanency of the US energy transition comes from the green hydrogen industry. It is well to be noted that green hydrogen can be produced by way of water and electrolysis systems that run on renewable electricity, but it happens to be much more expensive as compared to conventional hydrogen, which gets extracted from natural gas.

Around the world, industry has indeed struggled to find buyers. However, industry analysts have gone on to identify Texas as one of the markets where green hydrogen can also compete with natural gas, partly because of co-location opportunities when it comes to combining green hydrogen with waste carbon so as to produce synthetic liquid fuels known as electrofuels or E-fuels.

Apparently, the co-location strategy decreases considerable cost when it comes to transporting hydrogen across long distances.

It is worth noting that even the energy producers are also starting to catch up to this consensus of analysts. For instance, in May 2025, Infinium, which happens to be a leading fuel producer, began construction on its new project Roadrunner e-fuels facility, located in West Texas. Apparently, the electricity when it comes to running this facility is going to come from another 150 MW wind farm.

In a press announcement, Infinity wrote that this location is anticipated to become the largest fuels production facility in the world when operational by way of producing 23,000 tonnes every year of sustainable aviation fuel as well as other fuel products. It is well to be noted that the company has already enlisted certain buyers within the aviation sector that are indeed motivated to decrease their dependence when it comes to conventional jet fuel. This includes the likes of American Airlines and IAG, which is the parent company of British Airways as well as Aer Lingus.

This co-location strategy is already at work outside Texas as well. For instance, there is a solar-powered electrolyzer that is going to supply green hydrogen in order to produce ammonium fertilizer domestically, thereby eradicating any long-distance transportation costs. Moreover, Ecolectro, which is a New York startup, has already introduced a containerized and transportable electrolyzer that is designed for on-site usage within multiple hydrogen-dependent sectors that include steelmaking and fertilizers along with e-fuels.

The call is indeed coming from within

Interestingly, President Trump’s American energy dominance plan happens to include three major renewable resources – Geothermal, biomass, and hydropower—under the protective umbrella. All three happen to represent a prominent opportunity in order to decrease the nation’s dependence on fossil energy.

When it comes to biomass, the effect when it comes to that policy protection has almost been immediate. While the Trump administration went on to either delay or even abandon other federally driven renewable energy projects, in February 2025, Montana Renewables, which is a biofuels firm, went on to receive an approval to draw almost $780 million from a $1.44 billion loan guarantee that was issued by the Department of Energy at the time of Joe Biden‘s administration.

Apparently, these funds are going to help the firm to broaden its present facility at Great Falls in Montana, which makes use of biomass to produce sustainable aviation fuel. This kind of drawdown was announced by Calumet, its parent company, which confirmed that the expanded facility is going to be one of the biggest in the world, having a capacity of almost 300 million gallons of sustainable aviation fuel every year.

The point here is that the effect of the energy policy on US hydropower activity by Trump is going to take longer in order to unfold. There are new hydropower dams that are long-term and also capital intensive. However, when it comes to federal funding for upgrades as well as energy efficiency enhancement, they are going to help the hydropower industry so as to maintain their aging facilities and also continue their status as being a major contributor to the US renewable energy shift. It is well to be noted that hydropower comprises 27% of total renewable energy generation within the US, as per the Department of Energy. It can also be used for energy storage within systems that pump out water into an elevated reservoir during times of excess power and, in a way, release them into turbines when the demand for power is high. Significantly, such kinds of facilities comprise the overwhelming majority and are at 96% of renewable energy storage capacity in the US.

It is worth noting that an even more prominent effect is going to be felt within the geothermal industry as the new drilling technology broadens the range of geothermal power plants across new regions in the US. Unlike solar and wind energy, geothermal happens to be available at a constant and steady rate, and that too on a 24/7 basis, by offering gas power plants a compelling source of competition.

During the conclusion of the first term in office of President Trump, the promise of saving coal jobs indeed turned out to be a very empty one. When it comes to his second term, the President has already made enough promises to fossil energy stakeholders, which he may not be able to keep since oil and natural gas also join coal when it comes to the ranks of energy resources that are destined to be marginalized, since renewables are going to become cheaper and more accessible, apart from being even more efficient.",https://www.powerinfotoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/index.ico,N,,2025-06-02 17:12:58.978856

Among the projects losing their grants were an ExxonMobil hydrogen project in Texas and several carbon capture projects located throughout the United States.
“It is hugely disappointing to see these projects canceled — projects that had already progressed through a rigorous, months-long review process by technical experts at DOE,” Stolark said.
DOE officials said of the 24 awards cancelled, nearly 70% (16 of the 24 projects) were signed off on between last November’s presidential election and President Trump’s inauguration on Jan. 20 of this year.
“By terminating these awards, DOE is generating an immediate $3.6 billion in savings for the American people,” the department said.","WASHINGTON — The Department of Energy on Friday canceled $3.7 billion in funding for clean energy and greenhouse gas reduction-related projects awarded in the last weeks of the Biden administration.

Among the projects losing their grants were an ExxonMobil hydrogen project in Texas and several carbon capture projects located throughout the United States.

In a press release announcing the move, the department said the affected projects “failed to advance the energy needs of the American people, were not economically viable and would not generate a positive return on investment of taxpayer dollars.”

It also said the Biden administration had “failed to conduct a thorough financial review” of the projects.

The action inspired a sharp rebuke from the Carbon Capture Coalition, a nonpartisan collaboration of more than 100 companies, labor unions, and conservation and environmental policy organizations.

“Today, the cancellation of 24 DOE-funded projects, many of them carbon capture related, is a major step backward in the nationwide deployment of carbon management technologies,” said Jessie Stolark, the coalition’s executive director.

“It is hugely disappointing to see these projects canceled — projects that had already progressed through a rigorous, months-long review process by technical experts at DOE,” Stolark said.

ExxonMobil had been planning to build a large-scale low-carbon hydrogen plant at its Baytown, Texas, facility. Last year, the Biden administration awarded the project $330 million, all of which was rescinded on Friday.

This project had been expected to produce up to 1 billion cubic feet of hydrogen per day from natural gas, with over 98% of the associated CO2 captured and stored underground.

Now the fate of the project is unknown and a spokesperson for the energy giant declined to comment.

Also taking a hit in Texas, were Eastman Chemical’s plastic recycling project in Longview, which lost $375 million in funding, Calpine’s carbon storage project in Baytown, which lost a $270 million grant, and Orsted’s clean methanol project near Houston, which had expected $99 million in DOE funding.

All of the projects were being developed in a bid to transform the Houston-metro area and make the Texas Gulf Coast a “hub for clean energy” their developers said.

Other canceled awards include $500 million that was to have gone to Heidelberg Materials US, Inc.; $95 million to Nevada Gold Mines, LLC; and $270 million to Sutter CCUS.

Sublime Systems, a company making low carbon cement, lost an $87 million grant.

“This is how the Trump administration treats American industry and American workers. They’re not building an economy — they’re dismantling it, and giving away the future of manufacturing,” said Evan Gillespie, partner at Industrious Labs, a nongovernmental organization focused on modernizing and cleaning up heavy industry.

“The Trump administration rolled out tariffs, arguing that these measures are necessary to revive manufacturing — yet, at the same time, they are canceling manufacturing projects nationwide and increasing energy costs for manufacturers,” Gillespie continued.

“These projects would have helped catapult the U.S. into a leadership position in the technologies that will bring down emissions and pace the next generation of industrial evolution. Killing these projects means more emissions, more pollution, and more people getting sick,” he said.

Earlier this month, the DOE issued a secretarial memorandum entitled, “Ensuring Responsibility for Financial Assistance,” which outlined the department’s revised policy for evaluating financial assistance on a case-by-case basis.

The policy was intended to “identity waste of taxpayer dollars, protect America’s national security and advance President Trump’s commitment to unleash affordable, reliable and secure energy for the American people.”

On Friday, the department said it used this new criteria to evaluate each of the 24 now-rescinded awards and determined “they did not meet the economic, national security or energy security standards necessary” to “sustain” the federal government’s promised investment.

DOE officials said of the 24 awards cancelled, nearly 70% (16 of the 24 projects) were signed off on between last November’s presidential election and President Trump’s inauguration on Jan. 20 of this year.

“By terminating these awards, DOE is generating an immediate $3.6 billion in savings for the American people,” the department said.

“While the previous administration failed to conduct a thorough financial review before signing away billions of taxpayer dollars, the Trump administration is doing our due diligence to ensure we are utilizing taxpayer dollars to strengthen our national security, bolster affordable, reliable energy sources and advance projects that generate the highest possible return on investment,” said Energy Secretary Chris Wright.

“Today, we are acting in the best interest of the American people by cancelling these 24 awards.”

But the Clean Air Task Force, a global nonprofit organization that advocates for the rapid development and deployment of low-carbon energy and other climate-protecting technologies, said that is not the case.

“Today’s action is bad for U.S. competitiveness in the global market and also directly contradictory to the administration’s stated goals of supporting energy production and environmental innovation,” said Conrad Schneider, senior director of the organization’s efforts in the United States.

“Canceling cutting-edge technology demonstrations, including support for carbon capture and storage projects, undercuts U.S. competitiveness at a time when there is a growing global market for cleaner industrial products and technologies,” Schneider said.",https://www.thewellnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/wright-2.jpg,N,,2025-06-02 17:12:39.584106

Florida-based Next Era Energy, which owns Point Beach and sells the generated electricity to We Energies, did not comment for this story.
But the Nuclear Energy Institute, the trade association for nuclear plant operators, says the plants are robust structures.
Across the U.S., 12 nuclear reactors have been approved to keep going until 80.","The public comment period ends Monday on a federal ruling that could boost a plan to keep the Point Beach Nuclear Plant operating into the 2050s. Critics have several concerns, including what climate change may do to the plant north of Manitowoc that generates about 15% of Wisconsin’s electricity.

The Nuclear Regulatory Commission, or NRC, has spent about five years looking at the plan to extend the license of the two reactors at Point Beach another two decades beyond their current expiration dates of 2030 and 2033. That would push the age of the plant along Lake Michigan to about 80.

Recently, in a revised draft of a supplemental environmental impact statement, commission staff issued a preliminary conclusion that there are no adverse environmental impacts that would preclude renewing the licenses.

That finding troubles Alfred Meyer, who’s on the steering committee of Physicians for Social Responsibility-Wisconsin. Meyer says one of his key concerns is that weather conditions are changing, and are predicted to keep doing so as more greenhouse gases go into the atmosphere.

“And what I worry about is instead of looking forward to see what might be coming, our regulators are really looking in the rearview mirror and talking about rainfall levels in 1901 and 1895. It seems ridiculous,"" he says.

Meyer says there could be a huge rainstorm that would cause erosion on the lake bluff at Point Beach. Plus, the risk of more frequent tornadoes. He says the GAO, or Government Accountability Office, told the NRC last year that it isn’t fully considering the risks related to climate change.

Florida-based Next Era Energy, which owns Point Beach and sells the generated electricity to We Energies, did not comment for this story. But the Nuclear Energy Institute, the trade association for nuclear plant operators, says the plants are robust structures. The NEI’s Brett Titus says the license holders are required to analyze information about natural hazards.

“And if there is any new credible information that comes through the scientific community, our licensees have to address that in a timely basis, consistent with the regulatory requirements there,"" he says.

Climate and weather are also on the mind of Amy Schulz, a retired nurse and president of Physicians for Social Responsibility-Wisconsin. She says the U.S. government and nuclear industry still haven’t solved the long-tern problem of storing the highly radioactive waste generated at plants like Point Beach. Around the nation, Schulz says, the spent uranium fuel stays in in-plant pools of water, or outside in concrete and steel casks.

“And they are vulnerable to weather events, as well as catastrophic events, whether it be through a terrorist attack or a nuclear accident,"" she says.

In response, the Nuclear Energy Institute’s Brett Titus says, “Right now, it’s in the safest configuration it can be. Both within the pools and especially when it gets out into dry casks.""

Titus acknowledges a long-term storage solution is still a ways off. He says the U.S. Energy Department is working to find a national or regional location that wants the waste. Occasionally, a Midwest site gets mentioned, but more often sites in Texas or New Mexico.

Beyond the storms and waste issues, the critics of license extensions say they continue to worry that key parts of older plants like Point Beach are wearing out or becoming brittle — just like a lot of things 50 years old and with hopes of being active until 80.

The industry responds that licensees have aging management programs to keep things running.

Across the U.S., 12 nuclear reactors have been approved to keep going until 80. The Point Beach review comes as President DonaldTrump has signed executive orders aimed at speeding up the approval of new reactors, including smaller, advanced ones, now getting an early look for several locations, including possible placement at the shut down Kewaunee Nuclear Plant.

The NEI’s Titus says he’s generally encouraged. “All these policies are generally there to strengthen and bolster national security and meet the energy goals.”",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/6f0b351/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1274x669+0+219/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Flegacy%2Fsites%2Fwuwm%2Ffiles%2F201511%2F6517602679_b9601f9a5d_o.jpg,N,,2025-06-02 15:12:14.233321

Federal EV tax credit and battery manufacturing incentives targeted in new budget legislation.

Might this impact the Canadian government’s 2035 plans?

President Donald Trump has revoked California’s authority to set stricter emissions standards. His goal is to unwind electric vehicle support policies enacted under the Biden administration. The decision is being challenged on legal grounds and is expected to face court review.

The rollback targets a decades-old waiver system that allows California to establish emissions standards exceeding federal limits. The authority originated with the 1967 Air Quality Act and was confirmed by the 1970 Clean Air Act. Under President Biden, new waivers had been issued to enforce more stringent rules beginning with 2026 model year vehicles.

Congress relied on the Congressional Review Act to repeal those waivers, though it’s been determined by those in the know that they are ineligible for disapproval under the Act. California officials said they will file legal action in response.

In a parallel move, the Department of Transportation halted approvals for the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure (NEVI) program. Congress had appropriated $5 billion to build a national charging network, but only $527 million had been obligated as of early February.

Budget Legislation Proposes to End EV Tax Credit and Impose New Fees

The big news is this: On May 22, House Republicans passed a budget bill that would eliminate the $7,500 EV tax credit with limited exceptions for automakers yet to exceed 200,000 eligible sales. The bill also outlines a gradual phase-out of incentives for battery manufacturing by 2028 and restricts parts sourcing from certain countries.

On top of the credit loss, a new annual federal tax is proposed under the same bill: $250 for EV drivers and $100 for hybrid vehicle owners. These fees are intended to support the Highway Trust Fund, which is typically funded by gasoline taxes.

Some manufacturers have expressed support for the changes as compliance and financial burdens will be lessened, not to mention that consumers still vastly prefer ICE vehicles nationally. However, analysts caution that policy shifts could be reversed depending on the outcome of upcoming elections. One way or another, a slowing of EV sales in the country and state seems inevitable.

Despite the federal policy shift, the EV market has continued to grow. According to S&P Global Mobility, EV registrations rose 16% in the first quarter of 2025, while market share increased to 7.7%, up from 6.9% in the same period the year before. The same thing occurred in Canada in the same period. Analysts attribute part of the increase to consumers purchasing ahead of anticipated policy changes.

Canada To Ban New ICE Vehicles By 2035

Should the Trump Administration manage to pass its Bill, the repercussions will be felt beyond the Golden State’s borders, perhaps reaching as far north as Canada. The country’s often-criticized Electric Vehicle Availability Standard is partially dependent on the continued involvement of numerous states. It also relies heavily on Provincial and Federal incentives, which have faced difficulties since the beginning of this year. If the 4th largest Global economy loses its ability to enforce ZEV (Zero Emission Vehicle) mandates, there is little hope that Canada will be able to implement its plans for 2035.",https://motorillustrated.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Alpine-A390-6-1500x1004.jpg,N,,2025-06-02 14:12:09.239631

The order issued on May 30 follows a legal petition filed by the Center for Biological Diversity, Patagonia Area Resource Alliance, and other groups.

“The Arizona Department of Environmental Quality threw clean air and a healthy environment under the bus when approving the Hermosa mine’s air pollution permit,” said Jeremy Nichols, a senior advocate at the Center. “Thankfully the Clean Air Act is still working and holding the mining industry accountable for protecting air quality and communities.”

The Hermosa mine threatens to release hundreds of tons of toxic air pollution every year, putting clean air, biodiversity and the health of nearby communities at risk.

The legislation aims to make permanent the expiring tax provisions of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act while rolling back key elements of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), with clean energy tax credits taking a bigger hit than many had anticipated. Despite early signs of potential bipartisan concern — most notably a letter from 21 House Republicans expressing reservations about undermining energy incentives — support for clean energy did not materialize when it counted. The House action comes amid a flurry of activity across the executive branch, with President Trump issuing a series of executive orders to bolster the US nuclear sector and federal agency leaders laying out plans to reshape energy and environmental programs. As the bill moves to the Senate, where internal GOP divisions are already surfacing, it’s unclear whether the more aggressive provisions will stick if the Senate opts for a more moderate path, leaving the broader Republican energy and budget agenda facing a critical political test.

Reconciliation Package Passes Through the House

On May 22, the House narrowly passed its reconciliation bill in a 215-214 vote, with one member abstaining. The legislation seeks to make permanent the lower tax rates established by the Republicans’ 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which are set to expire at the end of this year. What advanced was an amended package consolidating 11 separate bills previously approved by their respective committees. Notably, the measure includes significant revisions to tax provisions tied to the Inflation Reduction Act.

Clean Electricity ITC and PTC: For those wishing to utilize the clean electricity production tax credit (45Y) and investment tax credit (48E), projects must begin construction within 60 days of the legislation’s enactment. Additionally, to maintain eligibility to receive the tax credits, the projects must be operational by December 31, 2028. This is an accelerated timeline from the one originally proposed by the House Ways and Means Committee version of the bill, which had set a 2031 deadline. Projects failing to meet these requirements would no longer be eligible for the credits.

Foreign Entities of Concern (FEOC) Restrictions are now applied to these credits. After enactment of the legislation, the credit user cannot be a specified foreign entity. One year after enactment, facilities that begin construction cannot receive material assistance from a prohibited foreign entity. Two years after enactment, the credit user cannot be a foreign-influenced entity or make an applicable payment to a prohibited foreign entity.

Immediate Elimination of these credits for solar or wind residential or rural leases.

Nuclear Carveout: Eligible advanced nuclear facilities and expanded nuclear facilities are exempted from the 60-day beginning-of-construction requirements and instead must only comply with the placed-in-service deadline on December 31, 2028.

Nuclear Power Production Credit: For 45U, the credit expires at the end of 2031.

Advanced Manufacturing Tax Credit: For 45X, production occurring after 2031 will now no longer qualify — one year earlier than current law. In addition, under the legislation, wind-energy components cease to be eligible after 2027 — five years earlier than the IRA intended.

Clean Fuel Production Credit: For 45Z, the credit’s life is extended from 2028 to 2031. Under the legislation, feedstock must be sourced exclusively from the United States, Canada, or Mexico. Credits are denied if the producer becomes a prohibited foreign entity or foreign-influenced entity.

Carbon Sequestrating Credit: For 45Q, the credit is maintained as originally written in the IRA, remaining until 2032.

Clean Hydrogen Production Tax Credit: 45V is eliminated for new projects beginning after December 31, 2025.

Electric Vehicles Credits: The Clean Vehicle Credit (30D), Used Clean Vehicle Credit (25E), Alternative Fuel Vehicle Refueling Property Credit (30C), and Qualified Commercial Clean Vehicle Credit (45W) are all eliminated for new projects beginning after December 31, 2025.

Energy Efficiency Credits: The Energy Efficient Home Improvement Tax Credit (25C), Residential Clean Energy Property Credit (25D), and Energy Efficient New Homes Tax Credit for Home Builders (45L) are all eliminated for new projects beginning after December 31, 2025.

For all the credits listed above — except the Clean Electricity ITC and PTC, which have their own, more-stringent requirements — the following FOEC restrictions now apply: After enactment, the credit user cannot be a specified foreign entity. Two years after enactment, the credit user also cannot be a foreign-influenced entity — defined by if, during the taxable year, a specified foreign entity has the authority to appoint a board member, executive officer, or similar individual; if a single specified foreign entity owns at least 10% of the entity; if multiple specified foreign entities collectively own 25% or more of the entity; or if they together hold 25% or more of its debt. Furthermore, an entity will also be considered foreign-influenced if, during the prior taxable year, it knowingly, or should have known it, made payments — such as dividends, interest, compensation for services, rents, royalties, guarantees, or other fixed and periodic payments — either amounting to 10% or more of such payments to a single specified foreign entity or 25% or more in total to multiple specified foreign entities.

Beyond tax measures, the bill claws back unobligated IRA funds from both the Department of Energy (DOE) and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Specifically, the bill eliminates unused IRA credit subsidy funding, which is a key source of funding for the Loan Programs Office (LPO). While the bill preserves existing loan authority, the rescission of the credit subsidy could have significant implications for the LPO’s ability to administer its programs. It also removes a previously included — and controversial — provision that would have allowed the sale of small public land tracts in Utah and Nevada for development.

The legislation now heads to the Senate, where significant changes are expected. Republican leaders aim to pass the bill before the July 4 recess, though procedural and political hurdles could delay action beyond the mid-August deadline, which is tied to the recent $4 trillion increase in the federal debt ceiling.

With a 53-47 majority, Senate Republicans need at least 51 votes to pass the measure. However, several GOP senators have already expressed concerns. Senators Thom Tillis (R-NC), Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska), John Curtis (R-Utah), and Jerry Moran (R-Kan.) have criticized the House bill’s rollback of IRA tax credits as too aggressive. Others, including Senators Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) and Susan Collins (R-Maine), oppose the bill’s proposed Medicaid cuts and have publicly stated they have “Medicaid red lines” they won’t cross. On the opposite end, Senators Ron Johnson (R-Wis.), Rick Scott (R-Fla.), Mike Lee (R-Utah), and Rand Paul (R-Ky.) argue the bill doesn’t go far enough in addressing deficit reduction, signaling that Senate Republicans must navigate divisions from both moderates and fiscal hardliners.

Trump’s Executive Orders on Nuclear

On May 23, President Trump announced four Executive Orders (EOs) aimed at boosting the nuclear industry:

“Deploying Advanced Nuclear Reactor Technologies for National Security” mandates the acceleration of development and use of advanced nuclear technologies by the federal government, including establishing a program for the use of nuclear energy at military installations and directing the DOE to designate sites for deploying these reactors.

“Reforming Nuclear Reactor Testing at the Department of Energy” mandates the DOE to expedite the testing and deployment of advanced reactors through streamlined processes at National Laboratories and a new pilot program outside of them, with a focus on reaching operational status for qualified test reactors and at least three pilot program reactors within specific deadlines. Furthermore, the order requires the DOE to reform its environmental review procedures under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) to remove barriers to reactor development.

“Reinvigorating the Nuclear Industrial Base” emphasizes the critical need to address challenges like foreign dominance in nuclear reactor designs and a reliance on external sources for nuclear fuel. The order directs the Secretary of Energy to use the authority provided by the Defense Production Act (DPA) to seek voluntary agreements with domestic nuclear energy companies. These agreements are intended to facilitate cooperative procurement of LEU and HALEU and allow consultation to enhance spent nuclear fuel management (including recycling and reprocessing), ensure the availability of the nuclear fuel supply chain capacity, and expand the nuclear energy workforce.

“Ordering the Reform of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission” directs the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to reorganize to “promote the expeditious processing of license applications and the adoption of innovative technology.” A dedicated team of at least 20 officials will be created to draft new regulations.

Not all of this will ultimately prove realistic. For instance, the Trump administration called for 20 new Section 123 Agreements for Peaceful Nuclear Cooperation by 2028 when only 25 have been signed since 1954. The administration also set a goal of 10 new large reactors with complete designs under construction by 2030, when only two have been done in the last 40 years. Still these four EOs clearly shine a light on the administration’s goals for nuclear and the potential for revitalizing this industry.

Agency Updates

Trump’s recent executive actions align with statements made by Secretary of Energy Chris Wright during a DOE budget oversight hearing. Wright emphasized his strong support for using the DOE’s Loan Programs Office to accelerate the deployment of nuclear energy projects. He also highlighted his top priorities, which include advancing US artificial intelligence capabilities, supporting the emerging geothermal industry, and streamlining the approval process for oil, gas, and coal projects. However, on May 15, the DOE announced that it would be reviewing 179 individual awards totaling over $15 billion, starting with those at the LPO, an initiative that may run counter to Secretary Wright’s comments about using the LPO for nuclear.

During budget oversight hearings before both the House and Senate, EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin faced sharp questioning from lawmakers. Following President Trump’s “skinny budget request,” Zeldin announced plans to eliminate the EPA’s Office of Atmospheric Protection — which oversees the Energy Star program — as well as the Office of Air Quality Planning and Standards. In their place, the agency will establish two new offices within the Office of Air and Radiation: the Office of Clean Air Programs and the Office of State Air Partnerships. When pressed about the future of Energy Star, Zeldin stated he is in discussions with several private entities to take over the program, arguing that since it is not mandated by Congress, the EPA has the authority to transfer its management. However, the privatization of the Energy Star program would still likely require congressional authorization.

Meanwhile, the confirmation process for key positions across federal agencies continues to progress. In May, several appointments were finalized.

At the DOE, the following were advanced out of the Senate committees: Jonathan Brightbill to be General Counsel, Tina Pierce to be Chief Financial Officer, Wells Griffith to be Undersecretary, Brandon Williams to be Undersecretary for Nuclear Security / Administrator for Nuclear Security, Dario Gil to be Undersecretary for Science, Kyle Haustveit to be Assistant Secretary for Fossil Energy and Carbon Management, Ted Garrish to be Assistant Secretary for Nuclear Energy, Tristan Abbey to be Administrator of the US Energy Information Administration, Matthew Napoli to be Deputy Administrator for Defense Nuclear Nonproliferation, Scott Pappano to be Principal Deputy Administrator of the National Nuclear Security Administration, Conner Prochaska to be Director of the Advanced Research Projects Agency – Energy, and Catherine Jereza to be Assistant Secretary of Electricity. Timothy Walsh has been nominated for Assistant Secretary of Environmental Management and Audrey Robertson has been nominated for Assistant Secretary for Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy.

Key Takeaways

Over the last seven decades, power generation in the U.S. has shifted from coal dominance to natural gas.

Crude oil remains the second most important source of power, despite widespread efforts to reduce fossil fuel consumption.

Renewables have grown steadily but still represent less than 9% of the total energy mix.

This animated chart uses data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration to illustrate how the country’s energy generation landscape has evolved since 1950.

U.S. Energy Generation by Source, 1950–2024

As seen in the video above, natural gas has experienced the most significant growth—rising from just 6.2 quadrillion BTUs in 1950 to 39.2 in 2024—making it the leading energy source in recent years, surpassing both coal and oil.

Coal use peaked between 2000 and 2005 but has since declined sharply, falling from 23.2 quadrillion BTUs in 2005 to just 10.6 in 2024. Meanwhile, crude oil usage resurged in the early 2010s after years of contraction, peaking in 2024 at 27.5 quadrillion BTUs.

Renewables such as wind and solar, though still relatively small in absolute terms, have shown consistent growth since 2005. Wind reached 1.5 quadrillion BTUs by 2024, while solar grew from virtually zero to 1.1 quadrillion BTU.

Nuclear energy has remained relatively stable since the 1990s, plateauing at around 8 quadrillion BTUs annually. This follows a period of rapid growth from the 1970s to the 1990s but has since been constrained by high costs and regulatory hurdles.

The Eddystone Generating Station, located just south of Philadelphia on the Delaware River, is owned and operated by Constellation Energy.
The site’s original coal-fired supercritical units, Units 1 and 2, were retired in 2011 and 2012.
Third Major Federal Intervention The Eddystone order marks the Trump administration’s third major federal intervention in U.S. power markets.
This emergency order helps keep money in consumers’ pockets while keeping their homes and businesses fully powered.","The Department of Energy (DOE) has issued its third Section 202(c) emergency order in the past two weeks, this time to bolster reliability in PJM Interconnection by compelling Constellation Energy to keep Units 3 and 4 of its dual-fuel Eddystone Generating Station in Pennsylvania open beyond their scheduled retirement date of May 31, 2025.

The May 30-issued directive, another rare and significant federal intervention, aims to address acute resource adequacy concerns within PJM’s territory, which spans 13 states and the District of Columbia.

The DOE’s order states that PJM shall, in coordination with Constellation Energy, run specified units at the Eddystone Generating Station when PJM deems necessary, past their planned retirement date of May 31, 2025. While it expires on Aug. 28, 2025, the order essentially declares that “emergency exists in portions of the electricity grid” operated by PJM “due to a shortage of facilities for the generation of electric energy, resource adequacy concerns, and other causes, and that issuance of this Order will meet the emergency and serve the public interest.”

PJM Supportive of the Directive

In a statement sent to POWER on May 31, PJM expressed support for the directive, calling it “a prudent, term-limited step that will retain the covered generators for a 90-day period.” Over the past two years, “PJM has repeatedly documented and voiced its concerns over the growing risk of a supply and demand imbalance driven by the confluence of generator retirements and demand growth,” the grid operator said. The order will allow DOE, Constellation Energy, and PJM “to undertake further analysis regarding the longer-term need and viability of these generators,” it said.

The Eddystone Generating Station, located just south of Philadelphia on the Delaware River, is owned and operated by Constellation Energy. The facility’s six units have a combined nameplate capacity of 820 MW. Units 3 and 4—commissioned in the late 1960s and early 1970s—are each 380 MW subcritical steam turbine units that can operate on natural gas or oil, but the plant also includes four smaller oil-fired peaking units (Units 10, 20, 30, and 40) totaling 60 MW. The site’s original coal-fired supercritical units, Units 1 and 2, were retired in 2011 and 2012. Historically, Units 3 and 4 have provided valuable flexibility to PJM during periods of fuel price volatility or supply constraints.

Constellation formally moved to retire Eddystone Units 3 and 4 with a deactivation notice to PJM in December 2023, citing economic pressures and its broader shift toward a cleaner generating portfolio. In a February 2024 letter, PJM noted it did not identify reliability violations from the proposed retirement, and it granted Constellation the green light to push forward with its announced May 2025 retirement.

However, in December 2024, PJM proposed changes to its tariff under a new Reliability Resource Initiative (RRI), citing near-term resource adequacy concerns. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) approved the revisions in February 2025, acknowledging “the possibility of a resource adequacy shortfall driven by significant load growth, premature retirements, and delayed new entry.”

PJM has in recent months repeatedly flagged that it is facing an urgent supply-demand dilemma compounded by surging power demand from electrification, data centers, and onshoring manufacturing. In January, the grid operator acknowledged a capacity shortage could affect its system as early as the 2026/2027 delivery year. As POWER has reported, the PJM expects its summer peak to climb about 70,000 MW to 220,000 MW over the next 15 years, while winter peaks are estimated at 210,000 MW by 2039. PJM, however, is also bracing for 40 GW of retirements by 2030, 60% of which is coal and 40% natural gas-fired.

The DOE’s order compels PJM and Constellation to take “all measures necessary” to ensure that the Eddystone units “are available to operate. Until August, “PJM is directed to take every step to employ economic dispatch of the units to minimize cost to ratepayers,” it states. “Constellation Energy is directed to comply with all orders from PJM related to the availability and dispatch of the Eddystone Units.”

Both entities will need to file any necessary tariff revisions or waivers at the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) to recover costs associated with the emergency operation, as allowed under federal law.

The order, notably, restricts operation to “the times and within the parameters determined by PJM for reliability purposes,” and mandates that all operations comply with environmental requirements “to the maximum extent feasible while operating consistent with the emergency conditions.” It also requires PJM to provide daily notifications regarding the units operation and compliance, and it will require PJM to submit, by June 15, a detailed report on steps taken to ensure operational availability and minimize environmental impact.

Third Major Federal Intervention

The Eddystone order marks the Trump administration’s third major federal intervention in U.S. power markets. On May 16, the DOE issued two emergency orders to the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority (PREPA) following a full island-wide blackout and warnings that the grid could face up to 135 days of forced load shedding this summer. The orders required PREPA to dispatch more than 30 fossil-fueled generation units—including some mothballed assets—and accelerate vegetation management along key transmission corridors. The DOE found that “any major generation unit anywhere on the island would result in significant numbers of Puerto Ricans losing access to power,” and mandated 90-day emergency measures to stabilize the grid.

A week later, on May 23, the DOE ordered the Midcontinent Independent System Operator (MISO) and Consumers Energy to keep the 1,560-MW J.H. Campbell coal plant in Michigan available for operation through the summer, overriding a planned May 31 closure. That order cited the North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC)’s 2025 Summer Reliability Assessment, which warned of “elevated risk of operating reserve shortfalls” in the Midwest, owing to the retirement of thermal generation and reduced solar output. The Campbell order, like Eddystone, required economic dispatch, daily reporting, and compliance with environmental laws to the maximum extent practicable.

The measures reflect an aggressive posture by the DOE, which says it is acting in accordance with President Trump’s January 2025 declaration of a national energy emergency. Most recent 202(c) emergency orders have responded to active grid emergencies like hurricanes or extreme weather and focused on short-term generation dispatch actions.

“Maintaining access to affordable, reliable, and secure power is always our top priority, particularly during the summer months when electricity demand reaches its peak,” said U.S. Secretary of Energy Chris Wright on Friday. “Americans should never be left wondering whether they will be able to turn on their lights or air conditioning. This emergency order helps keep money in consumers’ pockets while keeping their homes and businesses fully powered. Energy shortfalls or unnecessary price increases are not options in this Administration.”

However, critics—including environmental groups and some consumer advocates—argue that the order amounts to a bailout for uneconomic, aging fossil-fueled plants.

“Trump’s last minute emergency order—issued literally on the last day these power plants were set to operate—causes significant, expensive complications,” said Tyson Slocum, director of Public Citizen’s Energy Program. “Old units like Eddystone require both minor and major maintenance—maintenance that was deferred because of its planned retirement on May 31. Extending the life of the unit will force ratepayers to shell out money to cover expensive maintenance and overpay for expensive power that will result in American households paying even higher electricity bills, as Trump’s emergency order requires consumers to pay 100% of all costs to get the plant up and running, including a guaranteed profit for Constellation.”",https://www.powermag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/eddystone-2-constellation.jpeg,N,,2025-06-02 13:15:24.507396

The funding is part of the Nuclear Energy Waste Transmutation Optimized Now (NEWTON) program, which aims to make the conversion of U.S. commercial used nuclear fuel (UNF) economically viable within 30 years.

Transmutation technologies can significantly reduce the mass, volume, activity and lifespan of UNF by converting long-living hazardous isotopes into materials that decay more quickly. This reduces the duration needed for long-term storage and improves overall economy and safety of operations.

“We are incredibly proud of this planned transformational work in nuclear waste transmutation, which has earned well-deserved recognition and support from the DOE’s NEWTON program,” said Temitope Taiwo, director of Nuclear Science and Engineering at Argonne. ​“The innovative approach positions Argonne at the forefront of sustainable nuclear technology solutions.”

“I am very excited to receive funding from the NEWTON program to advance this brand-new technology. This method uses physics-based separation instead of conventional chemical separations, making it a separation technology that is more secure.” — Taek K. Kim, Argonne senior nuclear engineer

The first Argonne project was awarded $7 million and is led by Taek K. Kim, a senior nuclear engineer and manager of Nuclear Systems Analysis. The project, titled ​“Liquid Lead Suspended Fuel Subcritical Fission Blanket for Nuclear Waste Transmutation,” focuses on a new type of transmutation process. It also uses innovative separation methods — centrifugal force — to remove the waste by-products from the process. Fission is the process of splitting an atomic nucleus into two or more smaller nuclei, releasing a large amount of energy.

The project aims to transmute the entire U.S. stockpile of minor actinides within 30 years, reducing the nuclear fuel mass by 28 times, which is roughly equivalent to shrinking a large swimming pool filled with used fuel down to the size of a small hot tub. It will also decrease radiotoxicity management time 333-fold.

“I am very excited to receive funding from the NEWTON program to advance this brand-new technology,” said Kim. ​“This method uses physics-based separation instead of conventional chemical separations such as PUREX, making it a separation technology that is more secure and more difficult to use for nefarious purposes.”

The proposed transmutation system uses a proton accelerator to start fission in a liquid lead setup containing tiny minor actinide particles — the heavy, radioactive elements near the bottom of the periodic table. As the minor actinide particles fission, the two new smaller nuclei are ejected from the particle and can be separated from the actinide particles by centrifugal methods in a recycling system.

More technical details about the project are available on the ARPA-E website.

Argonne’s second NEWTON award-winning project is in partnership with DOE’s Fermilab National Accelerator Laboratory. Michael Kelly, an accelerator physicist in Argonne’s Physical Science and Engineering directorate, leads the project, ​“Nb3Sn Proton Driver Linac for Accelerator Driven Systems.” The project is focused on developing advanced superconducting cavities used in particle accelerators.

Particle accelerators could play a significant role in the management of the 90,000 metric tons of UNF at U.S. nuclear plants. Made from materials that conduct electricity without resistance when cooled to very low temperatures, superconducting cavities are specialized components stacked together in particle accelerators to efficiently propel charged particles, like protons, to high speeds.

An accelerated proton beam can generate an intense flux of neutrons, uncharged subatomic particles that are useful for probing materials at the atomic scale. When directed at radioactive waste inside a nuclear reactor, these neutrons multiply and can transform radioactive waste into less harmful materials. The team is developing advanced superconducting cavities using a thin film of niobium-tin (Nb3Sn) to reduce the size and cost of accelerators while improving their reliability and efficiency.

Between both projects, Argonne scientists are working on the most critical pieces of making transmutation a reality: the accelerator and proton beam, as well as the target and reactor.",https://www.anl.gov/sites/www/files/2025-05/34258D_0570_NTNS_Controlled%20Centrifugal%20Contactor%20Technology_WEB_16x9.jpg,N,,2025-06-02 13:15:31.618490

The $72 million award terminated by the U.S. Department of Energy funded the testing of a carbon capture system on a natural gas-fired turbine operated by electric utility Louisville Gas and Electric and Kentucky Utilities at its Cane Run Generating Station in Jefferson County.

>> In Other News: A New Protocol for Carbon Removal via Direct Ocean Capture & Storage

Carbon capture refers to technologies that seek to reduce climate-warming carbon dioxide emissions from burning fossil fuels by capturing and storing carbon dioxide before it’s released into the atmosphere. The utility described the project last year as an “important step in assessing the future viability” of carbon capture technology for natural gas-fired power plants. LG&E and KU, which serves more than 1 million customers in the state, would have captured a portion of carbon dioxide emissions to be potentially reused by a nearby manufacturer, according to a press release.

Liz Pratt, a LG&E and KU spokesperson, in a statement said the utility was “disappointed” the award was terminated but remained “focused on driving innovation and important research and development in this space.”

“Together with our project partners, we will review our options for advancing this important research project,” Pratt said.

Among the other awards terminated Friday by the DOE included a number of other carbon capture and storage projects and a project by multinational alcoholic beverage company Diageo that sought to add batteries to decarbonize production facilities including in Shelbyville, Kentucky.

U.S. Secretary of Energy Chris Wright in a Friday statement said canceling the approximately $3.7 billion in total awards was “in the best interest” of Americans.

""While the previous administration failed to conduct a thorough financial review before signing away billions of taxpayer dollars, the Trump administration is doing our due diligence to ensure we are utilizing taxpayer dollars to strengthen our national security, bolster affordable, reliable energy sources and advance projects that generate the highest possible return on investment,"" Wright said in a statement.

Investment into carbon capture systems played a large role in the energy policy of the former Biden administration, which sought to require utilities with coal-fired power plants operating past 2039 to capture 90% of carbon dioxide emissions from the plants or have those plants retire by 2032. That carbon capture requirement also applied to new natural gas-fired power plants. The Trump administration has swiftly reversed course, reportedly planning to eliminate any caps on greenhouse gas emissions from coal-fired and natural gas-fired power plants.

Supporters of carbon capture technologies generally say it’s necessary in transitioning to clean energy and addressing industries that are hard to decarbonize, while skeptics, including environmentalists, question whether the technologies will allow for the further burning of fossil fuels.

Byron Gary, an attorney with the environmental legal organization Kentucky Resources Council, told the Lantern the award termination fits into the Trump administration’s “broader strategy” of “trying to undermine climate regulation.”

**E&E News** reported Friday that the Trump administration is expected to argue the U.S. power sector, a major contributor of greenhouse gas emissions, doesn’t contribute “significantly” to climate change.

Most of these projects focus on carbon capture and decarbonization. The DOE said this decision followed a review. It found weak execution plans, unclear goals, and limited national security or economic benefits.

Secretary David Wright confirmed this news by saying,

“While the previous administration failed to conduct a thorough financial review before signing away billions of taxpayer dollars, the Trump administration is doing our due diligence to ensure we are utilizing taxpayer dollars to strengthen our national security, bolster affordable, reliable energy sources and advance projects that generate the highest possible return on investment. Today, we are acting in the best interest of the American people by cancelling these 24 awards.”

Why DOE Scrapped Billions in Projects Signed Before Inauguration?

The press release notes that 16 of these projects—nearly 70%—were approved between Election Day and January 20. Most focused on carbon capture and decarbonization technologies.

Wright said the prior administration rushed these deals without proper financial vetting. In contrast, the current DOE leadership conducted a detailed review to ensure public funds are used wisely.

He pressed on the fact that,

“These decisions protect national security, ensure energy reliability, and prioritize high-return investments.”

Earlier this month, DOE issued a memorandum titled “Ensuring Responsibility for Financial Assistance,” outlining strict review standards. The canceled projects failed to meet key criteria—economic value, energy security, and national interest—leading to their termination under this revised oversight policy.

Heavy Industry and CCS Take the Hardest Hit

The cancellations mainly impact big carbon capture projects in cement and industry. A media report highlighted the major losses industries suffered due to the canceled projects.

Heidelberg Materials: $500 million canceled

National Cement Co. of California: $500 million canceled

Brimstone Energy: $189 million canceled

Sublime Systems: $87 million canceled

Calpine’s Baytown project: $270 million canceled

ExxonMobil’s Texas hydrogen shift plan: $332 million canceled

Wyoming carbon capture pilot: $49 million canceled

Many companies expressed disappointment and confusion. Brimstone Energy believes its project was misunderstood, despite its alignment with U.S. critical mineral goals. ExxonMobil declined to comment, while Heidelberg is considering an appeal.

These projects aimed to cut industrial CO₂ emissions and aid low-income, high-pollution communities. Losing them means emission-heavy sectors lose vital tools for transition, especially since some processes, like cement production, can’t easily switch to renewables.

Market Reaction: A Blow to Investor Confidence

The cancellation signals that U.S. federal support for carbon capture may not be guaranteed anymore. This worries clean tech investors and developers who rely on long-term government backing for costly, high-risk projects.

Now, companies might turn to:

Private equity

Green bonds

International funding partnerships

Academic collaborations

However, these options often lack the scale and speed of federal aid. Industry leaders fear this move could slow U.S. innovation, especially as Europe and Asia ramp up funding for decarbonization technologies.

Jessie Stolark from the Carbon Capture Coalition expressed disappointment over this decision. She said,

“Today, the cancellation of 24 DOE-funded projects, many of them carbon capture related, is a major step backward in the nationwide deployment of carbon management technologies. It is hugely disappointing to see these projects canceled – projects that had already progressed through a rigorous, months-long review process by technical experts at DOE.”

“Further development and deployment of carbon management technologies is crucial to meeting America’s growing demand for affordable, reliable, and sustainable energy. To be clear, ensuring projects funded by the bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act move forward toward commercialization are necessary to demonstrate the technology across fossil fuel power generation and key industrial sectors, including natural gas-fired power generation, cement, and basic chemicals.”

Climate Goals at Risk Without CCS Support

The DOE’s reversal may hinder U.S. climate goals. Carbon capture and storage (CCS) is vital for decarbonizing cement, steel, and fossil fuel power plants. Without these technologies, emissions from these industries may continue unchecked.

Moreover, many canceled projects were in areas heavily affected by pollution. Their loss means those communities may face ongoing poor air quality and health risks.

Environmental advocates argue that the DOE’s cost-saving approach could lead to larger climate costs later. Reducing carbon capture efforts now could impede the U.S. from meeting its emissions targets under global agreements.

Fuelling the resistance, Congresswoman Marcy Kaptur said,

“The abrupt termination of $3.7 Billion in clean energy investment is shortsighted and malicious. This decision will raise energy costs for American families and undermine our nation’s competitive edge. In Northwest Ohio, it endangers jobs, and undermines manufacturing in our critical glass industry, while empowering China and our global competitors. Nationwide, DOE is not only raising the cost of energy in Red Districts and Blue Districts — we’re ceding ground to global competitors racing ahead in innovation and energy efficiency.”

“This decision undercuts American innovation, discourages private-sector investment, and harms workers like the ones I represent who are counting on these projects for jobs and economic revitalization. The American people deserve leadership that meets the moment — not one that backs away from the challenge of a clean, affordable energy future. If the Trump Administration was looking to give Communist China everything they wanted, they are well on their way.”

What’s Next: A Policy Reset for Clean Energy Funding

Moving forward, the DOE is likely to set higher standards for federal clean energy grants. Projects will need to show strong environmental potential along with:

Economic viability

Realistic timelines

National security value

Clean energy still has bipartisan support across many U.S. regions. Yet, the path to funding may now involve stricter standards and accountability.

This gap could attract more private and foreign investment. However, scaling solutions without federal support will be tough. The big question is: Can the U.S. remain a global leader in climate tech while limiting funding for transformative projects?",https://carboncredits.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/flux_DOE-Cancels-3.7B-Clean-Energy-Grants-Due-to-Viability-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-06-02 13:15:35.760228

But that undermines one of TVA’s main arguments for building new gas plants in the first place: its self-determined deadline for coal retirement.
“The imperative of 2027 closure of the [Kingston coal plant] is not adequately disclosed.
That coal plant is the largest in the fleet, providing a capacity of roughly 2.4 GW.
TVA plans to add a nearly 1.5-GW gas plant on site and a 0.9-GW gas plant in Cheatham County, about 20 miles from Nashville.","The Tennessee Valley Authority is considering extending the life of its coal plants.

Or, at least, that is what the utility is saying publicly.

“TVA is very concerned about how they are being viewed by the Trump administration,” said Stephen Smith, director of the Southern Alliance for Clean Energy.

TVA currently operates four coal plants: Kingston, near Knoxville, Cumberland, near Clarksville, Gallatin, about 30 miles from Nashville, and Shawnee, in Paducah, Kentucky.

In 2021, TVA announced a plan to retire all coal plants by 2035. Two of the coal plants, at Kingston and Cumberland, are scheduled to close completely by 2027 and 2028, respectively, and be replaced with equivalent gas generation.

“Substantial performance and cost risk is carried by operating a coal fleet reaching the end of its useful life,” TVA wrote at the time. “Unplanned outage rate, a component of availability, is the primary driver of challenges.” Many Tennesseans experienced this firsthand during Winter Storm Elliott two years ago, when TVA issued rolling blackouts after coal and gas plants failed.

But earlier this month, TVA changed its tune, shortly after President Donald Trump signed executive orders aimed at reviving the coal industry and granted TVA exemptions to Biden-era coal pollution regulations.

“We’re evaluating our coal units’ lifespans,” TVA’s new CEO Don Moul said during a recent board meeting. “We continue to depend on them to help power this region.”

Moul declined an interview request from WPLN News about the possible extensions. Wade White, a member of the TVA Board, the utility’s main regulator, also declined an interview with WPLN News at a meeting in early May.

TVA undermines one of its key arguments for new fossil fuel generation

TVA may find it difficult to extend use of the Kingston or Cumberland coal plants, because the utility would have to get permission to emit two kinds of dangerous fossil fuel pollution simultaneously, as new gas plants at those sites come online. All four of the utility’s coal plants rank among the top five climate polluters in Tennessee and Kentucky — with Cumberland consistently ranking as the top emitter. Air pollution from these plants is also linked to hundreds of premature deaths each year.

Or TVA could burn coal longer if any gas plant construction gets behind schedule. But that undermines one of TVA’s main arguments for building new gas plants in the first place: its self-determined deadline for coal retirement.

When proposing a 1.5-gigawatt gas plant for Kingston, for example, TVA suggested that the gas plant was the only option for generation because of how quickly it needed to shut down the coal plant — an argument scrutinized by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency last year.

“TVA dismisses the lower costs, lower financial risks, and far superior environmental performance of [the solar option] by arguing that solar cells could not be installed by 2027,” EPA wrote in a letter to the utility. “The imperative of 2027 closure of the [Kingston coal plant] is not adequately disclosed. If closure by 2027 is an imperative, then TVA created an alternative that is technically infeasible and therefore not a viable alternative.”

More: In Tennessee, who uses the most fracked gas? | WPLN News

TVA’s own transmission queue challenges this idea. As of January 2025, the utility had about 8.6 GW worth of solar and battery projects, with requested dates of June 2025 or later, waiting to be developed and added to the grid. That is more power than TVA’s entire gas buildout this decade.

Last year, TVA said it takes an average of “5.4 years” for a solar project to come online, but experts say TVA could speed up the rate at which it’s bringing solar projects online.

“If TVA had the proper ambition and motivation, they could be building out solar and storage to scale,” Smith said. “They choose not to, and they choose then to mislead the public that it’s not possible.”

TVA made a similar argument for the Cumberland site a few years ago. That coal plant is the largest in the fleet, providing a capacity of roughly 2.4 GW. TVA plans to add a nearly 1.5-GW gas plant on site and a 0.9-GW gas plant in Cheatham County, about 20 miles from Nashville.

TVA stressed the need to have replacement generation by 2026 to replace the first of the coal plant’s two units.

“If the first Cumberland unit must stay in operation beyond 2026, significant investment would be required to maintain safe and reliable operations and comply with environmental regulations,” TVA wrote in an environmental review. “Operation beyond 2026 would also inject operational risk back into the TVA system due to the deteriorating condition of the coal units.”

So, why would TVA now say it is considering keeping its coal plants running longer?

The U.S. ‘national energy emergency’

President Donald Trump declared a “national energy emergency” on his first day in office.

This was not an effort to mitigate the climate crisis. The Trump administration purged those words from government websites, and reduced or cut scientific reports, data tools like the “billion-dollar disasters” database, and scientists from the federal workforce.

The Senate will also soon consider the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act,” which would repeal tax credits for clean energy development in the nation’s first big climate law — which has a special provision for the Tennessee Valley Authority — and incentives for consumer purchases on items like electric vehicles and solar water heaters. The new bill threatens the national trend: Solar, wind and batteries were forecasted to make up 93% of new electric generation this year. (However, that isn’t the Tennessee trend.)

Trump instead wants to boost fossil fuel production. Many of his executive orders aim to expedite oil and gas projects and reduce regulations on pollution.

For context, the U.S. became the world’s largest producer of gas in 2011, surpassing Russia, and the largest producer of oil in 2018, surpassing Saudi Arabia. The nation reached record fossil fuel production under Biden. Some scientists and environmentalists say the U.S. is now, under Trump, a “petrostate.”

Trump also wants to salvage the declining coal industry, which may partially explain TVA’s willingness to open the conversation on extensions.

“Much of this is a political discussion that TVA is having publicly to send a signal to the Trump administration that they’re responding to some of Trump’s desires,” Smith, the director, said.

Coal use has been waning for over a decade, largely due to cheaper options like gas and renewables. Nearly all coal plants in the U.S. are more expensive to run than the cost of building renewable replacements, according to a 2023 study by Energy Innovation, without factoring in tax credits or environmental regulations.

More coal was retired during Trump’s first administration than during the Biden presidency or Obama’s second term.

Although coal remains the dirtiest fuel for energy, Smith said, Trump has created a pathway for delays.

“We’re seeing lots of things starting to slip in the wrong direction,” Smith said. “The environment doesn’t care about politics. The physics are going to happen, and that’s what we’re most worried about.”",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/44d54f9/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1024x538+0+115/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F90%2F9e%2F76c757874eab8585152c283ed1df%2Fcumberland-tva-1024x768.jpg,N,,2025-06-02 13:16:13.997522

DOE canceled a combined $3.7 billion in financial assistance to energy projects, including carbon capture and sequestration projects and other decarbonization initiatives. It said the projects “failed to advance the energy needs of the American people, were not economically viable and would not generate a positive return on investment of taxpayer dollars.”

By terminating the awards, DOE said it expects to generate $3.6 billion in taxpayer savings. The Center for Climate and Energy Solutions estimates the cuts could result in the loss of 25,000 jobs and $4.6 billion in economic output.

“Canceling cutting-edge technology demonstrations, including support for carbon capture and storage projects, undercuts U.S. competitiveness at a time when there is a growing global market for cleaner industrial products and technologies,” said Conrad Schneider, senior director U.S., Clean Air Task Force.

About 70% of the awards were issued between the presidential election day and Donald Trump’s inauguration on January 20th in the final days of the Biden Administration.

“While the previous administration failed to conduct a thorough financial review before signing away billions of taxpayer dollars, the Trump administration is doing our due diligence to ensure we are utilizing taxpayer dollars to strengthen our national security, bolster affordable, reliable energy sources and advance projects that generate the highest possible return on investment,” said Secretary Wright.

The Office of Clean Energy Demonstrations advances cutting-edge technologies, including green hydrogen, carbon management, nuclear energy, long-duration energy storage, industrial decarbonization, and renewables and grid innovations. The office was established in 2021 and has managed a $25 billion-plus portfolio of clean energy demonstration projects across the U.S.

“Locking domestic plants into outdated technology is not a recipe for future competitiveness or bringing manufacturing jobs back to American communities,” said Steven Nadel, executive director, American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy.

This story was originally published by Grist and is reproduced here as part of the Climate Desk collaboration.

In the depths of the COVID-19 pandemic, Justin Bibb was living in a tight, one-bedroom apartment in Cleveland, Ohio. He couldn’t open his windows because his home was an old office building converted to residential units—not exactly conducive to physical and mental well-being in the middle of a global crisis. So he sought refuge elsewhere: a large green space, down near the lakefront, that he could stroll to.

“Unfortunately,” Bibb said, “that’s not the case for many of our residents in the city of Cleveland.”

A native of Cleveland, Bibb was elected the 58th mayor of the city in 2021. Immediately after taking office, he took inspiration from the “15-minute city” concept of urban design, an idea that envisions people reaching their daily necessities—work, grocery stores, pharmacies—within 15 minutes by walking, biking, or taking public transit. That reduces dependence on cars, and also slashes carbon emissions and air pollution. In Cleveland, Bibb’s goal is to put all residents within a 10-minute walk of a green space by the year 2045, by converting abandoned lots to parks and other efforts.

Cleveland is far from alone in its quest to adapt to a warming climate. As American cities have grown in size and population and gotten hotter, they—not the federal government—have become crucibles for climate action: Cities are electrifying their public transportation, forcing builders to make structures more energy efficient, and encouraging rooftop solar. Together with ambitious state governments, hundreds of cities large and small are pursuing climate action plans—documents that lay out how they will reduce emissions and adapt to extreme weather—with or without support from the feds. Cleveland’s plan, for instance, calls for all its commercial and residential buildings to reach net-zero emissions by 2050.

For local leaders, climate action has grown all the more urgent since the Trump administration has been boosting fossil fuels and threatening to sue states to roll back environmental regulations. Last week, Republicans in the House passed a budget bill that would end nearly all the clean energy tax credits from the Biden administration’s signature climate law, the Inflation Reduction Act. “Because Donald Trump is in the White House again, it’s going to be up to mayors and governors to really enact and sustain the momentum around addressing climate change at the local level,” said Bibb, who formerly chaired Climate Mayors, a bipartisan group of nearly 350 mayors.

City leaders can move much faster than federal agencies, and are more in-tune with what their people actually want, experts said. “They’re on the ground and they’re hearing from their residents every day, so they have a really good sense of what the priorities are,” said Kate Johnson, regional director for North America at C40 Cities, a global network of nearly 100 mayors fighting climate change. “You see climate action really grounded in the types of things that are going to help people.”

Shifting from a reliance on fossil fuels to clean energy isn’t just about reducing a city’s carbon emissions, but about creating jobs and saving money—a tangible argument that mayors can make to their people. Bibb said a pilot program in Cleveland that helped low- to moderate-income households get access to free solar panels ended up reducing their utility bills by 60 percent. The biggest concern for Americans right now isn’t climate change, Bibb added. “It’s the cost of living, and so we have to marry these two things together,” he said. “I think mayors are in a very unique position to do that.”

To further reduce costs and emissions, cities like Seattle and Washington, DC are scrambling to better insulate structures, especially affordable housing, by installing double-paned windows and better insulation. In Boston last year, the city government started an Equitable Emissions Investment Fund, which awards money for projects that make buildings more efficient or add solar panels to their roofs. “We are in a climate where energy efficiency remains the number one thing that we can do,” said Oliver Sellers-Garcia, commissioner of the environment and Green New Deal director in the Boston government. “And there are so many other comfort and health benefits from being in an efficient, all-electric environment.”

To that end, cities are deploying loads of heat pumps, hyper-efficient appliances that warm and cool a space. New York City, for instance, is spending $70 million to install 30,000 of the appliances in its public housing. The ultimate goal is to have as many heat pumps as possible running in energy-efficient homes—along with replacing gas stoves with induction ranges—and drawing electricity from renewables.

Metropolises like Los Angeles and Pittsburgh are creating new green spaces, which reduce urban temperatures and soak up rainwater to prevent flooding. A park is a prime example of “multisolving”: one intervention that fixes a bunch of problems at once. Another is deploying electric vehicle chargers in underserved neighborhoods, as Cleveland is doing, and making their use free for residents. This encourages the adoption of those vehicles, which reduces carbon emissions and air pollution. That, in turn, improves public health in those neighborhoods, which tend to have a higher burden of pollution than richer areas.

All this work—building parks, installing solar panels, weatherizing buildings—creates jobs, both within a city and in surrounding rural areas. Construction workers commute in, while urban farms tap rural growers for their expertise. And as a city gets more of its power from renewables, it can benefit counties far away: The largest solar facility east of the Mississippi River just came online in downstate Illinois, providing so much electricity to Chicago that the city’s 400 municipal buildings now run entirely on renewable power. “The economic benefits and the jobs aren’t just necessarily accruing to the cities—which might be seen as big blue cities,” Johnson said. “They’re buying their electric school buses from factories in West Virginia, and they’re building solar and wind projects in rural areas.”",https://www.motherjones.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/cleveland-mayor-bibb.webp?w=1200&h=630&crop=1,N,,2025-06-02 14:13:11.639251

The policy brief highlighting these technologies can be found here.

The United States has emerged as the global standard for the private fusion energy sector, with multiple fusion developers building toward deployment in the early-to-mid 2030s. The Trump administration has recognized the importance of sources of nuclear energy to ensure “America leads both in energy production and environmental innovation.” However, the House recently passed legislation that would be detrimental to the future of U.S. leadership in fusion energy and stifle American innovation.

Despite these setbacks, there are still opportunities for the administration and Congress to maintain – and even further – the United States’ position as a leader in fusion energy. To do so, it will require federal policy action across the value chain, including the preservation and enhancement of technology neutral tax credits, closing science and technology gaps required for commercial fusion energy deployment, and the continuation of essential public-private partnership programs. Investing in fusion energy now is key to unlocking its huge energy potential and maintaining U.S. fusion energy leadership. Failing to do so will allow global competitors to seize the opportunity to dominate the future of energy.

Fusion energy can bolster American innovation and support U.S. leadership.

Fusion, the power of the stars, is the process by which lighter atomic nuclei, such as hydrogen, merge to form a heavier nucleus, releasing energy. Commercial deployment of fusion energy could secure permanent U.S. energy independence, stabilize low-carbon grids with firm, clean power, promote energy addition to support growing power needs, and drive economic growth.

Today, the U.S. private fusion energy industry counts 25 verified companies which have secured over $6 billion in private funding, most of which aim to put fusion energy watts on the grid in the 2030s. Today, multiple U.S. fusion companies are preparing concrete plans to do so.

Commonwealth Fusion Systems (CFS) is partnering with the utility Dominion Energy to build its ARC plant, which will be sited in Chesterfield County, Virginia, with plans for grid connection in the early 2030s.

Helion Energy is conducting a feasibility study at Chelan County Public Utility District in Malaga, Washington, to build a 50 MW power plant near Rock Island Dam, which would fulfil a Power Purchase Agreement the company has with Microsoft.

Type One Energy has entered a Cooperative Agreement with the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) to jointly develop plans for Infinity Two, a 350 MWe stellarator fusion power plant targeted for the mid-2030s.

The success of these projects is essential to securing U.S. fusion energy leadership. Sustained federal support and policy certainty are necessary to ensure they reach commercial deployment.

Commercializing fusion energy will take federal support to close the science and technology gaps, including funding for demonstration projects and federal tax credits.

Congress must preserve, amend, and expand clean energy tax credits. The 48E investment tax credit and 45Y production tax credit are central to the business cases of fusion energy companies. These provisions help overcome the “missing middle” investment gap common to breakthrough innovation sectors like fusion, in which pilot plants can be overly costly for early-stage investors, but overly risky for traditional project finance. The tax equity relief these credits provide plays an essential role in bridging this gap to allow fusion energy companies to reach commercial viability. Furthermore, the transferability provision of these tax credits enables pre-revenue fusion energy startups to also benefit from these credits.

However, the version of the 2025 reconciliation bill which recently passed the House would eliminate 48E and 45Y for all projects except those for which construction begins within 60 days of the enactment of the proposed legislation, and for such projects to be placed into service (i.e., reaching the grid) by the end of 2028. In practice, this makes all fusion energy projects ineligible for this credit, pulling the rug out from under the fusion energy companies driving U.S. leadership in the sector.

Preserving the existing 48E and 45Y phaseout schedule, and ideally extending these tax credits through 2040, would give U.S. fusion energy companies the runway to fulfill their potential to secure U.S. energy independence, enable energy addition to meet growing power needs, stabilize future grids, and drive economic growth. Furthermore, amending the advanced manufacturing production credit (45X) to include key components of fusion systems would encourage the growth of a world-leading fusion energy supply chain in the United States, creating manufacturing jobs and driving economic growth.

Federal investment should be focused on closing the science and technology gaps to speed up commercialization, like increasing support for experimental facilities and sustaining funding for existing ones. By directing public sector resources toward closing science and technology gaps required across concepts, industry-wide commercialization challenges can be addressed without the government “picking winners.” This requires coordination between the public and private sector. The Fusion Industry Association’s one-time appropriations request includes $4.3 billion to support the construction of necessary test beds to close these gaps, and to expand public-private partnerships aimed at addressing the key science and technology challenges facing fusion commercialization. This would help direct public sector resources towards commercially relevant R&D.

Congress should increase resources for the Milestone-Based Fusion Development Program (MBFDP) to match the scale required for demonstration and pilot plants. Fusion energy companies face a chicken-or-the-egg challenge: even with a strong concept, prototype development can stall due to a lack of funding, with many investors requiring proof-of-concept before committing large blocks of capital, but proving a concept requires significant funding upfront. By providing milestone-based support and crowding in private investment, the MBFDP helps private companies secure the resources necessary to build their demonstration and subsequently pilot plants. The Fusion Industry Association’s one-time appropriations request to allot $4.95 billion over the next ten years to support MBFDP would provide necessary scale to support American private fusion companies compete against state-sponsored global competitors in putting fusion energy watts on the grid.",https://cdn.catf.us/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/06115415/data-abstract-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-06-02 12:29:53.070563

This is what the UK’s policy set-up has delivered, enabling Highview to move ahead with confidence.
Gas-fired power plants are the most common fast-response option of choice today, increasingly allied to lithium-ion batteries to manage short-duration balancing challenges.
On an international stage, the first mover on this opportunity today is the UK company Highview Power.
“Though smaller than what will follow, this one is very important because it is our first full-scale commercial plant,” says Highview Power CEO Richard Butler.","The UK’s policy frameworks have helped to unlock an opportunity in cryogenic gas that will lead to the gradual phase-out of gas-fired power plants in the UK in the decades ahead – and other countries could follow suit.

This is the headline message from Richard Butland CEO of green-energy innovator Highview Power, in a recent interview with gasworld.

“Policy is critical,” said Butland. “The right [policy] frameworks unlock everything as [they] give us access to the cheapest capital on the best terms [by] providing certainty [to projects].”

Butland also made the follow-up point that providing certainty is not the same as providing a subsidy.

“There have been some research and development grants we have secured down the years, but we don’t expect government handouts. These are 50-year investments we are making – and the right policy framework means we can secure capital at 6%, say, rather than 12% or more. That is critical.”

Highview’s business model is to fund and own the assets it builds, in the knowledge that the power its technology supplies has long-term payment guarantees that attach which make the whole opportunity stack up financially. This is what the UK’s policy set-up has delivered, enabling Highview to move ahead with confidence.

The background to Highview Power’sinvestment

As the energy transition builds, and renewable energy grows in the mix, the question of how to store electricity most effectively for grid flexibility has been climbing the agenda.

Gas-fired power plants are the most common fast-response option of choice today, increasingly allied to lithium-ion batteries to manage short-duration balancing challenges.

But it is well understood that another piece in the puzzle is needed in the form of low-carbon long-duration energy storage. This means large stores of low- or zero-carbon energy that can be accessed and used from four to up to 20 hours at a time, and sometimes even longer.

One of the leading moves in this space is a cryogenic technology that delivers precisely such long-duration storage – the use of liquid air to deliver stored energy.

On an international stage, the first mover on this opportunity today is the UK company Highview Power. And more than a decade on from proving its technology with a small-scale pilot project near London, a first commercial-scale plant is now taking shape, to be followed by four much larger plants by 2030, with two to be built in Scotland and two in England.

Each of the four larger planned UK facilities is a 2.5GWh plant and due to come onstream by 2030, but before that Highview will deliver a smaller project at Carrington near Manchester, in north-west England.

“Though smaller than what will follow, this one is very important because it is our first full-scale commercial plant,” says Highview Power CEO Richard Butler.

The plant encompasses compression, liquefaction, and storage of air, ready for regasification and being put through a steam turbine to make electricity.

The Carrington plant should be ready to switch on in the first quarter of 2026 and will serve as an important test-case for Highview.","https://www.gasworld.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1200,height=900,fit=contain,quality=75,metadata=none,format=auto,gravity=auto/https://www.gasworld.com/wp-content/files/2025/05/Richard-Butland-CEO.jpg",N,,2025-06-02 12:30:00.957214

However, in that timespan, a lot has changed in the automotive industry, as EV adoption has slowed greatly compared to its earlier, rapid pace, prompting many companies – including Ford – to scale back their planned investments in that particular area, as well as plans to expand EV lineups in many ways. Regardless, it sees as if Ford’s EV team isn’t going anywhere.

“And so that strategy all remains the same. We’re going to stay in EVs. We’re going to continue to invest in our advanced electrical development team out in California,” Ford Vice Chair John Lawler stated at the 2025 AllianceBernstein Strategic Decisions Conference. “There’s a lot of benefits that are coming from that. That’s not changing, but we’ve adjusted, based on the customer feedback we had being in the marketplace early, to what types of vehicles are actually going to resonate with customers and how do we make them more affordable so that we can attract a larger cohort of customers because large vehicles are not the right form factor for EVs.”

Indeed, Ford has pivoted away from focusing on developing larger, more expensive EVs in favor of smaller, more affordable ones, and that’s precisely what its skunkworks team has been tasked with creating for years now. Ford CEO Jim Farley recently revealed that this new, future platform is officially called CE1 Skunk Works, which is the first time we’ve heard that piece of information.

Ford has been in the midst of developing platforms for future EVs for some time now, but last month, we learned that the company’s low-cost EVs will have their own unique setup – officially known as CE1. Ford’s skunkworks EV team is using a streamlined process to develop that particular platform, which is set to underpin a handful of future models, potentially starting with a mid-size pickup. Those models will be a bit more simplistic in nature, with Farley recently confirming that they won’t be sold with things like Level 3 autonomous driving technology, however.

The CRA upends plans to implement Advanced Clean Trucks (ACT), which would require manufacturers to sell an increasing percentage of zero-emission chassis, including those for school buses by 2035. The CRA also targets Advanced Clean Cars II that would require all passenger car, truck and SUV sales be zero-emission in 2035 and the Omnibus Heavy-Duty Low NOx regulations for off-road emissions.

While the waivers were not been signed by President Donald Trump at this writing, California is at least one state preparing to take legal action if and when signed. Additionally, the weight of the future of zero-emission vehicles and clean air requirements will fall on states and OEMs. Many OEMs are taking a wait and see approach.

“Today’s votes in the Senate fly in the face of nearly 50 years of precedent. For decades, California and other states have had the authority to adopt vehicle emissions standards that exceed those at the federal level, and for good reason,” said Dan Lashof, senior fellow at World Resources Institute (WRI), when the CRA passed the Senate May 22. “These standards are vital in protecting people from the vehicle pollution which causes asthma attacks and other serious health problems.”

CARB Chair Liane Randolph released a statement disapproving of the CRA waivers, noting that it is a “short-sighted political move” and a strike against the long-term goal of zero-emission vehicles.

“California profoundly disagrees with today’s unconstitutional, illegal and foolish vote attempting to undermine critical clean air protections,” she wrote. “It’s an assault on states’ rights the federal administration claims to support that puts national air quality standards out of reach and will have devastating effects for the 150 million Americans who breathe unhealthy air every day. These actions are contrary to the text of the Congressional Review Act, as recognized by the nonpartisan U.S. Government Accountability Office and the Senate Parliamentarian. California will pursue every available remedy to challenge these actions and defend our right to protect the public from dangerous air pollution. Turning the clock back on both cleaner combustion engine requirements and zero-emission technology is an attack on clean air.”

Meanwhile, states that voted to adopt CARB’s regulations are postponing enforcement. Four of the 10 states that follow CARB (Maryland, Massachusetts, Oregon and Vermont) have pushed back their ACT compliance timelines by a year or more.

While not a CARB-specific state, the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection announced earlier this month it is extending its suspension of enforcement of its own Pennsylvania Heavy-Duty Diesel Emissions Control Program until Jan. 2, 2028.

This includes school buses and the ACT rule. Gerry Wosewick, executive director of the Pennsylvania School Bus Association, said the government agency has been working hard with partner organizations to roll back this requirement.

“This has been a legislative priority for us for quite a few years now and we have been advocating for it pretty heavily during that time,” Wosewick said. “It was actually a part of [the PSBS] legislative committee’s [strategy] plan. Since this is a regulatory issue, we have had several pieces of legislation that have been entered over multiple sessions in an effort to best address this change. Despite our lobbying efforts, we have been unsuccessful in getting any legislation through.”

With the Pennsylvania School Boards Association, MTA and others, Wosewick said there was enough pressure to address the regulation, which was key to getting it delayed.

“I oftentimes refer to it as the death by a thousand paper cuts in Pennsylvania,” he added. “While our contractors are phenomenal and find new and innovative ways to continue operations, it’s the constant small regulatory and statutory changes that keep making it more difficult to operate in the industry.”

Instead, he commented the industry should be able to work collaboratively to focus on timely emissions rollouts, as opposed to being forced to respond to regulatory drives.

Back at the federal level, the budget reconciliation bill passed by the House of Representatives May 22 is a comprehensive piece of legislation proposing significant changes, including scaling back the tax credits for clean energy included in the Inflation Reduction Act.

WRI noted that if the cuts in the current iteration of the bill are passed, “average Americans will see severe consequences: Businesses will face more red tape and uncertainty; it will be more difficult and costly to meet growing electricity demand; consumers will see skyrocketing electricity prices; workers will lose jobs; and local governments will encounter barriers to implementing programs that benefit their communities and save money,” it said in a statement.

The organization added that it would erase much of the $400 billion in investment and savings that clean energy tax credits have generated thus far.

“The proposed sudden elimination of the credits, which support low and no emission vehicle technologies, including the Qualified Commercial Clean Vehicle Credit (45W) and the Alternative Fuel Vehicle Refueling Property Credit (30C), will not only hinder the transition to cleaner vehicles and healthier communities but will pose immediate logistical and financial challenges to school districts, municipalities and others who have already made plans and budget decisions predicated on being able to access these credits,” WRI said. “Moreover, eliminating these credits means we are limiting consumer choice and ceding competitiveness in this growing market to China.”",https://stnonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/22-stnexpo-ridedrive.jpg,N,,2025-06-02 12:30:50.153844

Paris [France], June 2 (ANI): French automotive supplier Valeo has reaffirmed its commitment to continue investing in India following a one-on-one meeting between CEO Christophe Perillat and Commerce and Industry Minister Piyush Goyal during the minister's three-day tour to France.

The global automotive technology company, headquartered in France, expressed strong optimism about India's economic prospects and the country's electric vehicle transformation.

Valeo's Pune facility is positioned at the forefront of India's EV revolution, supporting the nation's ambitious mobility goals with expanded operations and cutting-edge technologies.

Speaking to ANI after the meeting with Minister Goyal, Perillat conveyed enthusiasm about India's growth trajectory.

'There is a lot of optimism in the Indian economy. We are investing a lot in India. Very happy to share this with the Minister, and we're happy to be there and happy to continue the growth story of Valeo over there,' he stated.

The CEO highlighted several factors driving their confidence in the Indian market.

'We think that the passenger car market is going to significantly increase. We've seen that in recent years thanks to better infrastructure, good utilities, a lot of talents from the management we have there (India), from the people we are there. So very excited. It was a fantastic meeting,' Perillat added.

Piyush Goyal wrote on X after the meeting,'Held a meeting with Mr. Christophe Perillat, CEO of @Valeo_Group a global automotive supplier company with a strong footprint in India. Appreciate the company's trust in India's growth story and their plans to enhance investments in the country. We discussed avenues to scale up their manufacturing presence in India,'.

According to Valeo's assessment, India is accelerating its EV adoption at an unprecedented pace. As in the world's most populous country, the potential for electric vehicle market revolution is enormous.

EVs accounted for approximately 5 per cent of India's total vehicle sales in 2023, but this figure is expected to surge dramatically.

By 2030, the market is projected to grow by nearly 30 per cent, driven by enthusiastic adoption of electrified two-wheelers and the iconic three-wheel tuk-tuk, which comprised nearly half of all EV sales. Electric SUV models are also increasingly appearing on Indian roads.

As a global leader in electric powertrain technologies, equipping one in three new vehicles worldwide, Valeo plays a major role in meeting India's rapidly growing EV demand.

At its plant in Pune, Maharashtra, the company manufactures a comprehensive range of EV technologies for local automakers, including Tata Motors and Mahindra & Mahindra, supplying components for two-wheelers, three-wheelers, and SUVs.

The Indian government, under Prime Minister Narendra Modi's leadership, has approved a forward-looking scheme to promote domestic manufacture of passenger cars with special focus on electric vehicles.

This landmark initiative aligns with India's national goals of achieving net zero by 2070, fostering sustainable mobility, driving economic growth, and reducing environmental impact.

Today, the Ministry of Heavy Industries issued detailed guidelines for the 'Scheme to Promote Manufacturing of Electric Passenger Cars in India' (SPMEPCI), which was announced on March 15, 2024.

The Department of Revenue, Ministry of Finance, simultaneously issued notifications for reduced import duties in line with the scheme provisions.

To encourage global manufacturers to invest under the scheme, approved applicants will be allowed to import Completely Built-in Units (CBUs) of electric four-wheelers with a minimum Cost, Insurance and Freight (CIF) value of USD 35,000 at reduced customs duty of 15 per cent for five years from the application approval date.

Approved applicants are required to make a minimum investment of Rs 4,150 crore in accordance with scheme provisions. The initiative is designed to establish India as a premier global destination for automotive manufacturing and innovation while achieving 'Make in India' objectives.

The scheme aims to attract investments from global EV manufacturers, promote India as a manufacturing destination for electric vehicles, generate employment, and position India prominently on the global EV manufacturing map.

In determining that PJM faces an emergency, DOE also cited a PJM report from February 2023 indicating the grid operator faced tightening supply-demand conditions this decade.
PJM approved Constellation’s request to shutter its Eddystone units 3 and 4 in February 2024, saying retiring the units didn’t pose reliability risks.
“Trump’s last minute emergency order — issued literally on the last day these power plants were set to operate — causes significant, expensive complications,” Slocum said.
Besides issuing additional emergency orders, DOE can extend previously issued orders under FPA section 202, ClearView Energy Partners said in a client note on May 30.","Dive Brief:

Declaring an emergency in parts of the PJM Interconnection’s footprint, the U.S. Department of Energy on Friday ordered Constellation Energy and PJM to continue operating 760 MW of oil- and gas-fired peaking capacity in Pennsylvania that Constellation had planned to deactivate the next day.

The emergency order directs Constellation to keep operating two units at its Eddystone power plant near Philadelphia until Aug. 28. The order can be extended.

PJM supports DOE’s order. “The department’s order is a prudent, term-limited step that will retain the covered generators for a 90-day period,” the grid operator said Saturday. “This will allow DOE, Constellation Energy and PJM to undertake further analysis regarding the longer-term need and viability of these generators.”

Dive Insight:

The Federal Power Act’s section 202(c) gives the DOE secretary the authority to temporarily order power plants to operate during wars and emergencies. It has been used 17 times since August 2020, according to DOE.

DOE partly based its order on a May 9 report from PJM that said the grid operator had enough power supplies for this summer under normal conditions, but that under extreme conditions featuring record-setting demand it could have to call on demand response resources to avoid power outages.

In determining that PJM faces an emergency, DOE also cited a PJM report from February 2023 indicating the grid operator faced tightening supply-demand conditions this decade. In addition, PJM in December asked FERC to approve a fast-track interconnection process for some planned power supplies to address potential reliability concerns, DOE said. FERC approved the plan in February.

“The potential shortage of electric energy, shortage of facilities for the generation of electric energy, and other causes in the region support the need for the Eddystone Units to contribute to system reliability,” DOE said.

DOE issued a similar emergency order on May 23 to keep a 1,560-MW, coal-fired power plant owned by Consumers Energy in Michigan running for nearly three months beyond its planned retirement date.

Constellation is taking immediate steps to continue to operate Eddystone units 3 and 4 through the summer, according to Paul Adams, a spokesman for the Baltimore-based independent power producer.

“Eddystone Units 3 and 4 remain in ‘Ready’ status and we are working quickly to retain necessary staff and perform necessary maintenance to allow for safe and reliable operations this summer and beyond,” Adams said Monday in an email.

Like in other regions, power plant owners in PJM must get permission from the grid operator to retire a generating unit. PJM studies whether a power plant shutdown will hurt grid reliability. PJM approved Constellation’s request to shutter its Eddystone units 3 and 4 in February 2024, saying retiring the units didn’t pose reliability risks. The units were installed between 1967 and 1970, according to Constellation.

PJM on Friday gave Buchanan Generation permission to deactivate on July 1 two gas-fired generating units in Virginia totaling 80 MW.

PJM operates the grid and wholesale power markets in 13 Mid-Atlantic and Midwest states and in the District of Columbia.

Depending on how long DOE ultimately orders the Eddystone power plant to keep running, the department’s order could affect Constellation’s plan to buy Calpine in a $16.4 billion deal. As part of its proposal pending at FERC, Constellation said it would sell four power plants totaling 3,546 MW in PJM’s eastern region, where Eddystone is located. The sale aims to allay concerns that a combined Constellation and Calpine could exert market power in eastern PJM.

Ratepayers will be required to pay for the costs of continuing to run the Eddystone units, including enough money to ensure Constellation earns a profit to maintain and run the units, Tyson Slocum, director of Public Citizen’s Energy Program, said in a press release.

“Trump’s last minute emergency order — issued literally on the last day these power plants were set to operate — causes significant, expensive complications,” Slocum said. “Old units like Eddystone require both minor and major maintenance — maintenance that was deferred because of its planned retirement on May 31.”

DOE’s “move to keep these zombie plants online will have significant public health impacts and increase electricity costs for people in Michigan and Pennsylvania,” Kit Kennedy, power sector managing director at the Natural Resources Defense Council, said Saturday.

Besides issuing additional emergency orders, DOE can extend previously issued orders under FPA section 202, ClearView Energy Partners said in a client note on May 30. “Weather predictions lie outside our remit, but we would suggest that a long, hot summer could set the stage for an extension,” the research firm said about the Consumers Energy order.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/qzgXMv1J3VMrM8hc0NRGP3uEIbTMr5RaEZOYFtpLgTE/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9QSk1fQ29udHJvbF9Sb29tXzEuSlBH.webp,N,,2025-06-02 12:30:04.446619

The award cancellations are a “major step backward in the nationwide deployment of carbon management technologies,” Jessie Stolark, the executive director of the Carbon Capture Coalition, said.","This audio is auto-generated. Please let us know if you have feedback.

The U.S. Department of Energy on Friday canceled $3.7 billion in awards from its Office of Clean Energy Demonstrations, including $540 million in grants for two carbon capture projects planned by Calpine.

The canceled awards were mainly for carbon capture and sequestration and other decarbonization projects, according to DOE. Affected companies include PPL Corp., Ørsted and Exxon Mobil Corp.

The Calpine grants were for CCS projects at its 550-megawatt gas-fired Sutter power plant in Yuba City, California, and its 810-megawatt Baytown power plant in Baytown, Texas.

c“After a thorough and individualized financial review of each award, the DOE found that these projects failed to advance the energy needs of the American people, were not economically viable and would not generate a positive return on investment of taxpayer dollars,” DOE said.

Sixteen of the 24 terminated awards were signed between President Donald Trump’s election in November and Jan. 20, according to DOE.

The DOE assessed the canceled awards under a review process outlined earlier this month. The department said it is reviewing 179 awards that total over $15 billion in financial assistance.

“DOE is prioritizing large-scale commercial projects that require more detailed information from the awardees for the initial phase of this review, but this process may extend to other DOE program offices as the reviews progress,” the department said.

DOE created the Office of Clean Energy Demonstrations in late 2021 to manage about $27 billion in funding appropriated by the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act and the Inflation Reduction Act, according to a mid-November report from the U.S. Government Accountability Office.

Below is a list from DOE of the canceled awards announced on Friday.

DOE’s decision to terminate the awards was “shortsighted,” according to Steven Nadel, executive director of the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy. “Locking domestic plants into outdated technology is not a recipe for future competitiveness or bringing manufacturing jobs back to American communities,” Nadel said in a statement.

The award cancellations are a “major step backward in the nationwide deployment of carbon management technologies,” Jessie Stolark, the executive director of the Carbon Capture Coalition, said. “Ensuring projects funded by the bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act move forward toward commercialization are necessary to demonstrate the technology across fossil fuel power generation and key industrial sectors, including natural gas-fired power generation, cement, and basic chemicals.”

On Thursday, the Supreme Court transformed the National Environmental Policy Act, or NEPA, an environmental permitting law that affects virtually every decision that the federal government makes. The quasi-unanimous ruling limits the law’s scope and cuts off future avenues for challenging energy and infrastructure projects under the law.

It could reshape the scale of legal challenges that projects could face in the future, giving the Trump administration — and any successive administration — greater leeway to approve energy projects.

Under NEPA, federal agencies must study the environmental impacts of their decisions before they make them. The strictest studies can run into the hundreds of pages, and they can take years to complete.

But in what was essentially an 8-0 decision, the Court ruled that federal agencies almost never need to analyze the second-order environmental effects of their decisions. In other words, an agency need only study the environmental impact of a project itself — be it a pipeline, a solar farm, or, in the case at issue, a railroad — and not its metaphorically downstream consequences. That remains the case even if a given project might indirectly make it much easier to do something with a big environmental footprint, such as drilling for oil or natural gas.

That is the clearest effect of the ruling. But Justice Brett Kavanaugh, writing for the court’s conservative majority, went much further than that summary alone suggests. In a broad and forceful ruling, he told lower courts that they should stop nitpicking the environmental studies that federal agencies must publish under NEPA to justify their own decision-making. Courts should, instead, defer to federal agencies as much as is reasonable when reviewing a NEPA study. “The goal of the law,” he writes, “is to inform agency decision-making, not to paralyze it.” (Justice Neil Gorsuch recused himself from the case because of his connection to an oil magnate who could have benefited from the ruling.)

That suggests a significant change is coming to how the court system interprets NEPA, a law that is little known to the general public but that plays a defining role in how federal agencies make decisions or approve infrastructure projects. NEPA creates a procedural requirement that federal agencies study the environmental impact of any “major decision,” but that category is so broad that it affects virtually everything the federal government does — spend money, write a new regulation, or approve a new project on federal land. The law and the yearslong lawsuits that it spawns have been blamed for delays in building solar farms and transmission lines, but also oil refineries and gas pipelines.

Kavanaugh’s ruling is “pretty striking for just how strident it is, and how assertively it tries to shut the door on further NEPA litigation,” Nicholas Bagley, a University of Michigan law professor who studies the permitting system, told me. Kavanaugh’s message to lower courts is, in essence, “We keep telling you to knock it off. You keep not listening. So knock it the fuck off,” Bagley said.

At the very least, the ruling suggests that a new phase in the effort to reform the country’s permitting laws has arrived. Now that movement has, in essence, been blessed by the Supreme Court.

The case in question — Seven County Infrastructure Coalition v. Eagle County, Colorado — concerns an 88-mile railroad proposed to connect the Uinta Basin in eastern Utah to the national freight rail network. In 2021, the Surface Transportation Board, a federal agency that regulates railroads, approved the project after completing a roughly 3,600-page study of the railroad’s potential environmental impact.

Almost immediately, environmental groups argued that the board’s study did not go far enough. The ground beneath the Uinta Basin is rich in a waxy and particularly carbon-intensive crude oil; right now, very little of that oil is extracted because the only way to get it out is by truck, along windy mountain roads. The railroad, if built, would allow for much larger volumes of crude to be transported out of the basin and sent to Gulf Coast refineries. Building the railroad, in other words, would indirectly increase local oil extraction, and thereby raise global greenhouse gas emissions.

The board argued that its NEPA study did not need to consider these downstream effects because the board itself does not regulate oil extraction — that is, it regulates the building of railroads, not what gets moved on them.

The eight justices agreed that the board was right: It didn’t have to consider the effects of second-order oil drilling when it approved the railroad. (The railroad remains on hold for other reasons, Sambhav Sankar, a senior vice president at Earthjustice, told me.) But by going further in his ruling, Kavanaugh entered into a running debate about the role of NEPA and other permitting laws in the American economy.

NEPA was never meant to play the commanding role that it does today, Kavanaugh writes. When it was first signed into law in 1970, NEPA was meant to act as a “purely procedural” check on federal decision-making. Agencies were supposed to conduct environmental studies, make their decisions, then move on. But in a famous 1971 ruling concerning a proposed nuclear power plant in Maryland, Judge Skelly Wright of the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals transformed the law. He found that agencies had to carry out NEPA’s procedural requirements “to the fullest extent possible,” and crucially that courts could reject agencies’ analysis for lack of completeness.

Over the years, as hundreds of cases following Wright’s have added up, NEPA has turned into a “fearsome project killer,” Bagley said. Agencies spend decades of person-power and hundreds of thousands of dollars to prepare fastidious environmental reviews of their decisions. Any new infrastructure project or new policy change — even New York City’s congestion charge — requires some form of NEPA study.

Many conservatives have long opposed the modern NEPA process. But in recent years, some liberals have joined them, arguing that the law primarily slows down clean energy infrastructure and encourages NIMBYism. In practice, they say, NEPA acts as more of hindrance to the clean economy than the old fossil fuel economy: Because of a 2005 law, most oil and gas drilling has been exempt from the NEPA process, while wind farms, solar plants, and other forms of zero-carbon energy infrastructure still have to face it. Environmental groups rebut that the law is a useful tool to slow down fossil fuel pipelines, which do not generally get a NEPA exemption.

Data supports the idea that NEPA holds back clean energy projects, but that is partly because it holds back so many kinds of projects. The R Street Institute, a center-right think tank, has found that 42% of projects stalled by NEPA involved green infrastructure or conservation. Another analysis from the Center for Growth and Opportunity at Utah State University found that it takes more than two years on average for federal agencies to complete environmental reviews of solar and wind projects. Reviews for new hydroelectric or nuclear power plants take even longer.

Kavanaugh, in essence, rejects all of this. NEPA was never supposed to block or hinder large-scale energy or infrastructure projects, he writes; it was meant to “inform agency decision-making, not to paralyze it.”

“A 1970 legislative acorn has grown over the years into a judicial oak that has hindered infrastructure development ‘under the guise’ of just a little more process,” he says. When federal agencies write environmental studies under NEPA, courts should broadly defer to the decisions that they make. And even if an agency gets something wrong in its study or omits something important, that does not mean the entire study — and the decision that it justifies — should be thrown out. (There’s some irony to Kavanaugh’s call for deference to agencies here, given that the Supreme Court rejected the idea that agency regulations deserve deference last year.)

“What’s notable for me is that they didn’t just rule on the case,” Sankar, the Earthjustice lawyer told me. (Earthjustice participated in the case.) “They decided to take a broad swipe at NEPA itself, really unnecessarily.”

Alexander Mechanick, a senior policy analyst at the Niskanen Center and former White House regulatory lawyer, agreed with Sankar about the scope of the ruling. The court’s decision “does communicate over and over again, with a heavy hand, a real desire to get lower courts out of the business of fly specking the environmental impact assessments,” he told me.

It’s this forthrightness that seems to announce a new era of NEPA jurisprudence — one where the courts will accept a level of environmental review that they may have once rejected. In a way, Kavanaugh’s ruling is a fitting sequel to Wright’s 1971 decision in that both set the tone and capture the overarching environmental concerns of their respective eras, Bagley said.

Half a century ago, Judge Wright wanted to make sure that the American public could slow the wave of infrastructure that threatened to overwhelm the country’s landscape. NEPA represented “the commitment of the government to control, at long last, the destructive engine of material ‘progress,’” he wrote, asserting that judges must make sure the law’s goals are not “lost or misdirected in the vast hallways of the federal bureaucracy.”

Now, Kavanaugh seems to fear that progress itself has been held up. He writes that the modern NEPA process, with its cycles of “speculation and consultation and estimation and litigation,” has slowed down infrastructure projects and driven up their cost. He can sound more like an op-ed writer than a legal scholar as he lays out the law’s consequences in the ruling:

Fewer projects make it to the finish line. Indeed, fewer projects make it to the starting line. Those that survive often end up costing much more than is anticipated or necessary, both for the agency preparing the EIS and for the builder of the project. And that in turn means fewer and more expensive railroads, airports, wind turbines, transmission lines, dams, housing developments, highways, bridges, subways, stadiums, arenas, data centers, and the like. And that also means fewer jobs, as new projects become difficult to finance and build in a timely fashion.

In this declaration, Kavanaugh seems to put himself on the side of a growing and tenuously bipartisan movement to reform NEPA. A 2023 debt ceiling bill, signed by President Biden, included modest reforms to the NEPA process, imposing page limits and deadlines on the strictest forms of environmental studies. A more sweeping bipartisan effort to change the law failed last year. Now, House Republicans are taking their own crack at revising NEPA, creating an optional and more expensive permitting “fast track” for developers in the reconciliation bill.

Sankar, whose organization has championed NEPA, argues that the ruling’s practical upshot will be to allow the Trump administration greater leeway to build fossil fuel infrastructure. Kavanaugh’s ruling exhibits “a shocking disregard for the realpolitik of what's going on with this administration in particular,” he said.

“As we’ve been saying all along, NEPA gets demonized as the problem,” Sankar said. With the law’s role reduced, “I think people will see that there are a lot of other things that are the problem here, and taking federal agency expertise out of the equation is not going to hurry things up.” He added that state and local governments often rely on federal NEPA reports for their own analyses, and now those reviews may be less trustworthy.

Bagley, who has generally supported permitting reform efforts, agreed that NEPA is just one of several laws holding back clean energy projects nationwide. But it is an important one, he said, and reducing its scope will likely allow more projects to happen. He added that by changing it, advocates will learn of additional bottlenecks that are holding back construction — including laws that nobody has noticed yet because they were previously less important than NEPA. Advocates can also now focus their attention on state and local barriers to building.

“If you want to look at the permitting burdens across the United States, probably 80% to 90% of them are state and local. This [ruling] isn’t going to inaugurate a new era of American dynamism,” Bagley said. “It’s a small step in the right direction.”",https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy82MDM0MTQ4Mi9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTgxMDIwOTM1MX0.W-MFFQTZQg680fQGjR2Oa_XkUCA_-hIIBlZ19SpAdyg/image.jpg?width=1200&height=600&coordinates=0%2C100%2C0%2C100,N,,2025-06-02 12:30:07.600891

The new government plans to promote electric vehicles with new purchase incentives, but has yet to provide a detailed proposal.
Following a 27 percent-reduction in sales of new battery electric cars (BEV) in Germany in 2024, a total of 1.65 million BEVs were registered at the start of this year.
Instead, purchase support should be focused on smaller cars and low-income households.
The NGOs called for a registration tax which would make small and efficient electric cars cheaper, while buyers of particularly climate-damaging luxury cars would have to pay up to 17,500 euros extra.","The new German government could implement its planned support for electric car purchases in a socially fair manner without an additional burden on public coffers, argues a report commissioned by a group of climate and social welfare NGOs. ""Socially just and climate-friendly electric mobility is feasible. Politicians must finally help to make small, climate-friendly cars in particular more affordable,” the NGOs said.

The report compiled by think tank Green Budget Germany (FÖS) says that the government should finance price reductions for electric cars, as well as low-income leasing options, by increasing levies on combustion engine cars and reforming company car taxation.

The ramp-up of electromobility is key for finally reducing emissions in the transport sector, which have been flatlining for decades in Germany. A successful shift to electric mobility will also be crucial to secure the long-term survival of the country’s automotive industry. The new government plans to promote electric vehicles with new purchase incentives, but has yet to provide a detailed proposal. The choice for the new transport minister, Patrick Schnieder from the conservative Christian Democrat Union (CDU), suggests that profound policy shifts in the sector are unlikely.

Germany was aiming to have 15 million electric cars on the road by 2030, but sales collapsed after the previous government axed a popular subsidy programme after Germany's 2023 debt brake ruling, putting this target increasingly out of reach. Following a 27 percent-reduction in sales of new battery electric cars (BEV) in Germany in 2024, a total of 1.65 million BEVs were registered at the start of this year.

Policies that make combustion engine cars more expensive are particularly effective for climate protection, says the report, which was commissioned by environmental NGOS Friends of the Earth Germany (BUND) and NABU, umbrella group Climate-Alliance Germany, the country’s largest social welfare organisation Caritas, as well as the ACE Auto Club Europa.

The report urges the government to not repeat the previous support policy consisting of across-the-board purchase subsidies, given that circumstances have changed since then. “In the mid and high price categories, electric cars are already often cheaper than comparable combustion models,” the report states, adding that support for those models would therefore be a waste of money because people would buy them regardless of subsidies. Instead, purchase support should be focused on smaller cars and low-income households.

The NGOs called for a registration tax which would make small and efficient electric cars cheaper, while buyers of particularly climate-damaging luxury cars would have to pay up to 17,500 euros extra. They also favoured a social leasing model that would result in monthly payments of 70 and 150 euros, depending on the car model.",https://www.cleanenergywire.org/sites/all/themes/cleanenergywire/logo_og.png,N,,2025-06-02 12:29:30.829830

Food, water, and energy are all intertwined, and one cannot be sustained without the other.
Take, for example, how water provides the hydration and food we need to survive and energy powers the infrastructure and processes that bring us clean water and produce food.
Rather than outsourcing its energy needs to solar panels on land, this technology provides clean energy while reducing water evaporation, protecting water resources, and minimizing land use.
The Triangular Nexus: Where Food, Water, and Energy Converge for Global Sustainability Attempting to achieve food, water, and energy security independently is like trying to balance the three corners of a pyramid—it simply cannot be done without endangering the availability of the other resource.","Drawing millions of tourists annually, the Great Pyramids of Egypt stand as one of the most awe inspiring and resilient architectural designs of human history. They have stood for nearly 5000 years enduring extreme weather conditions such as drought, rainfall, and high temperatures. The magic behind the pyramid’s longevity comes from its triangular shape that evenly distributes the weight and impact of these external forces, preventing erosion and deformation.

However, if one side wall were to break, the two remaining sides would lose their stability and the structure would quickly collapse. Just as any other pyramid structure, its strength comes from its sides that provide the internal stability. In the same way, we as humans have needs for our own well-being.

On the base of Maslow’s Hierarchy of Needs lies a person’s first and most essential physiological needs: breathing, food, water, shelter, clothing, sleep. With these being the bedrock of survival, they are directly connected to the global food, water, and energy systems. Food, water, and energy are all intertwined, and one cannot be sustained without the other. Take, for example, how water provides the hydration and food we need to survive and energy powers the infrastructure and processes that bring us clean water and produce food. If any one of these aspects is missing, it affects the others and undermines our basic needs.

The food-water-energy nexus forms the foundation of human existence, much like the sides of a pyramid that depend on each other for structural integrity. When we have a stable flow of food, water, and energy, we can thrive, allowing us to move upwards through the hierarchy of needs, toward the higher levels of safety, love, esteem, and ultimately self-actualization. However, if one of these more base needs is compromised, it creates instability, preventing us from meeting the higher needs in Maslow’s pyramid.

Food Holds Everything Together

While the majority of the Earth’s surface is covered by water, less than 1% of that water is fresh and salt free. To make this water drinkable, it must go to a water treatment plant that utilizes energy-intensive processes like filtration, disinfection, and distribution.

On the flip side, water is used during every phase of energy production from extracting resources to cooling power plants. These systems are directly connected: Energy is required to produce water and water is used to produce energy.

Within the lakes of New Jersey lies the largest floating photovoltaic plant that mutually benefits both water and energy systems. This system places rows of solar panels directly on the surface of the Canoe Brook Reservoir which powers the nearby Canoe Brook Water Treatment Plant. Rather than outsourcing its energy needs to solar panels on land, this technology provides clean energy while reducing water evaporation, protecting water resources, and minimizing land use. Alongside that, the natural cooling effect of water prevents the solar panels from overheating and increases electricity gains up to 22%.

These technologies are a great start for conservation, but it does not protect the needs of food. Given that the agriculture sector consumes about 70% of global freshwater, much of their needs are met with naturally occurring reservoirs and aquifers. The floating photovoltaic plant doesn’t allow sufficient solar radiation to reach the microbial aquatic community which changes its natural water levels. This can have negative effects for downstream ecosystems of agricultural land that depend on these waters, and essentially harming food production in the long term. And without food, there’s no reason to preserve water and energy resources.

Without Water, the Pyramid Cannot Stand

As the human population continues to grow by the millions each year, feeding everyone nutritious meals is one of the most pressing issues of our time. When the price of energy increases, the price of fertilizers, electricity for machinery, and processing all go up too. As a result food availability and accessibility will be more restricted.

The Safi Region of Morocco has a solution that resists using fossil fuel for energy generation by integrating wind energy, with a wind-hydrogen conversion system, to enhance their agriculture production. Specifically, these wind turbines ensure reliable energy supply by utilizing the hydrogen power to store its energy for greenhouse operations like irrigation, heating, and cooling. This has led to substantial reductions in carbon emissions as a result, allowing this model to be adopted in other arid and semi-arid regions.

Although this system has been able to support food production through clean energy, it has had a direct impact on the environment. Due to the fact that hydrogen energy undergoes a process called electrolysis where water is split into hydrogen and oxygen elements using electricity, large amounts of water is used. This has increased water stress in the region and has left aquifers dry. The region’s lack of policies and regulation in protecting water usage has worsened this issue and deteriorated its water quality, directly impacting the health of its people and the environment. While food and energy can mutually benefit each other, it cannot be sustained without proper water planning as all resources depend on water availability.

While energy is conserved and dependable for food production, the maintenance of these energy sources have increased water stress in the region and have left aquifers dry. Without the proper method of water preservation and regulation, there are again losses in agriculture. Not to mention, the deteriorating water quality can have direct health impacts on people and the environment.

What Happens When Energy is Lost?

More often than not, water and food insecurity occur simultaneously. Water scarcity limits agricultural productivity whereas food scarcity can exacerbate clean water accessibility. Especially since producing and transporting food requires significant water resources, communities are only left with contaminated water sources for everyday use. This directly and indirectly impacts malnutrition of children and adults, further emphasizing the consequences of these systems being independent of each other.

But there are solutions. Here’s how— in Bangladesh farmers take existing fish ponds and plant their rice paddy fields within them. Typically, paddy is grown in flooded fields but due to the groundwater shortages in the country, many farms have dried up. This approach allows rice yields to increase by 8 to 15% with the nutrient cycling and pest control handled by the fish.

Despite such innovative methods, Bangladesh still faces extensive drought periods every year. When ponds and aquifers are dried out for irrigation, farmers must utilize electric pumps to draw water from deeper in the ground. These pumps are overworked during the heat and operating at a much higher rate, consuming more energy than usual. This goes to show that without using effective energy management strategies, climate change will drain energy resources faster.

The Triangular Nexus: Where Food, Water, and Energy Converge for Global Sustainability

Attempting to achieve food, water, and energy security independently is like trying to balance the three corners of a pyramid—it simply cannot be done without endangering the availability of the other resource. In our growing world, there is only a limited amount of these natural resources before we risk completely exploiting the Earth.

Understanding how these systems are tightly interwoven within the triangle of food, water, and energy allows for the development of better technologies, practices, and policies that address these systems together.

Utilizing the nexus, Sundrop Farms in Port Augusta, Australia which grows tomatoes, harnesses solar energy to power a desalination plant that provides clean water for their greenhouse. Despite Australia being prone to extreme climate, making agriculture difficult, they are able to produce 15% of the country’s tomatoes! They are fresh-water self-sufficient by converting seawater from nearby gulf which means they do not use locally contaminated groundwater. Their solar farm not only produces enough electricity to power their desalination plant but also utilizes any excess energy for heat and storage facilities as well.

Ensuring that food, water, and energy has a circular flow, these kinds of holistic systems efficiently utilize and optimize our finite resources. By being local and self-sufficient, they are also able to adapt to fit their own climate change challenges. With this adoption of the ‘Nexus Approach’ we can foster true sustainability and transcend our hierarchy of needs because our basic needs have been met: Food which nourishes us. Water that sustains us. And power — clean, renewable power — that is the invisible force that keeps everything powered up and working.

To initiate the Food-Water-Energy Nexus in your area, changes need to happen within our government. Instead of treating food, water, and energy as separate sections, they must be integrated and seen as interconnected components of a single system.

Multilateral development banks (MDBs) are in a position to enable this expansion of energy in their mission to help developing economies achieve economic growth and energy access, but the banks are hindering the use of nuclear power. Meanwhile, Russia and China, both nuclear technology export leaders, are filling the gap and gaining geopolitical influence. Other countries, such as France and the Republic of Korea, have state-owned nuclear enterprises, but they are market competitors and not geopolitical adversaries. As developing nations seek nuclear power to meet rising energy needs, MDBs must revise their outdated and politicized views of the technology—or risk ceding political capital to autocratic actors.

STAY CONNECTED

An essential tool in the development toolkit

Developing countries’ energy demand is rising, requiring more firm power generation. Nuclear energy offers a reliable baseload critical for economies industrializing with energy-intensive sectors such as manufacturing and data centers. A 900-MW nuclear reactor can produce—with a much smaller footprint—the same power as 8.5 million solar panels or 800 wind turbines. And, unlike hydropower and geothermal energy, nuclear power is much less geographically constrained, enabling it to be sited in many locations.

Major economies are exporting their nuclear aversion

Currently, most MDBs do not fund nuclear energy projects. The Asian Development Bank (ADB) refuses to finance nuclear energy projects due to issues such as waste management and high investment costs. The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) prioritizes its energy strategy for “scaling up renewables,” supporting nuclear projects solely in areas of safety like decommissioning, with no involvement in construction. EBRD states it is neither in favor of or opposed to nuclear energy; it is simply operating within the mandate determined by its shareholders. The World Bank—the largest and arguably most influential MDB—cites a lack of expertise as its reason for not funding nuclear energy projects, although it frequently relies on external contractors for expertise in other sectors.

However, the World Bank’s president, Ajay Banga, recently signaled a potential shift by pushing the board to reconsider its stance on funding nuclear energy projects. In reality, the World Bank’s voting structure, which allocates voting power according to how much funding a country provides, grants its biggest funders with veto power. Germany serves as a key example: it shut down its nuclear reactors and opposed the inclusion of nuclear power in the European Union’s green investment taxonomy. The World Bank is held hostage by this tunnel vision, which supports only renewable projects, even though these technologies alone cannot meet the growing energy demands of developing nations.

MDBs’ refusal to fund nuclear power projects exacerbates the geopolitical divide between developing economies and the developed nations. This results in missed opportunities to expand energy access in poorer nations based on the prejudices of wealthier nations.

Lenders of last resort

MDBs’ current failure to finance nuclear projects cedes opportunities to other lenders. Western banks, including Goldman Sachs and Barclays, recently announced their support for nuclear energy, but this long-term commitment is questionable given private lenders’ risk-averse nature. Prolonged construction timelines and high capital costs for nuclear energy projects in countries like the United States may eventually deter commercial banks from maintaining their support for the technology.

Russia and China could fill the gap if the West leaves nuclear financing to others. Russia leads global nuclear power plant construction, accounting for about 60 percent of reactor exports, with ongoing projects in nations like Turkey, Bangladesh, and Egypt. Similarly, China is rapidly building out its domestic nuclear capacity—targeting over 100 new reactors by 2035—and leveraging the technology as a geopolitical tool under its Belt and Road Initiative, establishing projects in nations such as Pakistan and Argentina.

The MDBs’ absence in nuclear financing starkly contrasts with the generous loans offered by Russia and China. By leveraging state funding, Russia offers highly attractive terms, covering up to 85 percent of total project costs, as seen in Egypt’s loan, with lower interest rates and longer repayment periods than those required by the Organisation of Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) for its members—an organization that does not include Russia or China. Russia is also expanding its equity stakes in international nuclear projects, such as Turkey’s Akkuyu nuclear power plant, where it holds a majority stake, fostering closer geopolitical ties and exerting influence over critical energy infrastructure.

Similarly, China extends significant financial support, covering 85 percent of construction costs for Pakistan’s Chasma 5 reactor along with a $100 million discount on the total project cost. China has also offered to cover 85 percent of costs in loans for Argentina’s Atucha III reactor.

By refusing to finance nuclear projects, MDBs force developing nations to rely on Russian and Chinese nuclear exports. Both nations’ dominance in nuclear energy exports risks creating significant geopolitical imbalances, expanding their grip on critical energy sources while weakening Western influence over international energy security. The MDBs must rectify this problem to ensure a more geopolitically diverse financing model for nuclear power construction and operation in developing nations.

Breaking the logjam

MDBs must consider structural changes to bypass the veto power of its major players and begin funding nuclear energy projects. One option is to create a consortium of pro-nuclear states within the MDBs. These nations could create a separate fund for nuclear energy financing, independent of contributions from anti-nuclear nations. This would not be a complete fix—the bank’s broader policy against nuclear finance would remain unaffected—but it’s a crucial step in the right direction.

Outside of direct financial support, development banks do have other options. They can establish pathways for technical assistance for nuclear projects, similar to the Energy for Growth Hub’s nuclear trust fund proposal for the World Bank. This can include enlisting expert contractors as advisors to governments building nuclear power plants and fostering open dialogues on nuclear energy. By taking these steps, development banks can empower developing nations to harness nuclear power and create a more equitable energy future.

Don’t hand adversaries a nuclear victory

The increasing dominance of Moscow and Beijing in global nuclear energy finance risks reshaping future energy affairs. It is time for MDBs to acknowledge nuclear energy as an essential tool to expand energy access. The World Bank and other multilateral organizations must reform their antiquated policies to support nuclear energy deployment and allow developing countries to more readily achieve economic growth. If they don’t, autocratic regimes willing to weaponize their energy dominance will eagerly fill the void.

Included in the survey are companies that are incorporated in the U.S., operate in the U.S., and file financial statements with a government agency. This includes private companies and cooperatives that file a 10-K or a comparable financial statement with a government agency, and mutual insurance companies that file with state regulators. It also includes companies that file with a government agency but are owned by private companies, domestic or foreign, that do not file such financial statements. Excluded are private companies not filing with a government agency; companies incorporated outside the U.S.; and U.S. companies consolidated by other companies, domestic or foreign, that file with a government agency. Also excluded are companies that failed to report full financial statements for at least three-quarters of the current fiscal year. Percent change calculations for revenue, net income, and earnings per share are based on data as originally reported. They are not restated for mergers, acquisitions, or accounting changes. The only changes to the prior years’ data are for significant restatement owing to reporting errors that require a company to file an amended 10-K.

Revenues are as reported, including revenues from discontinued operations when published. If a spin-off is on the list, it has not been included in discontinued operations. Revenues for commercial banks includes interest and noninterest revenues. Revenues for insurance companies include premium and annuity income, investment income, and capital gains or losses, but exclude deposits. Revenue figures for all companies include consolidated subsidiaries and exclude excise taxes. Data shown are for the fiscal year ended on or before Jan. 31, 2025.

Profits are shown after taxes, extraordinary credits or charges, cumulative effects of accounting changes, and noncontrolling interests (including subsidiary preferred dividends), but before preferred dividends of the company. Figures in parentheses indicate a loss. Profit declines of more than 100% reflect swings from 2023 profits to 2024 losses. Profits for real estate investment trusts, partnerships, and cooperatives are reported but are not comparable with those of the other companies on the list because they are not taxed on a comparable basis. Profits for mutual insurance companies are based on statutory accounting.

Assets are the company’s year-end total. Total stockholders’ equity is the sum of all capital stock, paid-in capital, and retained earnings at the company’s year-end. Excluded is equity attributable to noncontrolling interests. Also excluded is redeemable preferred stock whose redemption is either mandatory or outside the company’s control. Dividends paid on such stock have been subtracted from the profit figures used in calculating return on equity.

The figure shown is a fiscal year-end number as published by the company in its annual report. Where the breakdown between full- and part-time employees is supplied, a part-time employee is counted as one-half of a full-time employee.

The figure shown for each company is the diluted earnings-per-share figure that appears on the income statement. Per-share earnings are adjusted for stock splits and stock dividends. Though earnings-per-share numbers are not marked by footnotes, if a company’s profits are footnoted it can be assumed that earnings per share is affected as well.

The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission has approved NuScale Power’s design for a 462-MW small modular reactor power plant, the U.S. nuclear regulator said on Thursday.

NRC completed its technical review of NuScale’s US460 in less than two years, ahead of schedule and under budget, it said. The US460 is based on NuScale’s 12-module, 600-MW US600 design, which NRC approved in 2020 after more than three and a half years of review.

The newly-approved design’s larger modules will help NuScale power plants more effectively serve hyperscale data center customers, CEO John Hopkins told investors in November. Data centers represent a key segment for the company as it looks to lock down its first U.S. customer this year.

Dive Insight:

The NRC approval came earlier than expected, according to estimated completion timelines provided by NRC and reiterated by Hopkins on several recent investor calls. NuScale had anticipated a final decision by July, Hopkins said on May 12.

The approval could be crucial as NuScale moves through “advanced commercial dialogue with major technology and industrial companies, utilities and national and local governments,” Hopkins said in March.

“Once we get finalization” for the 77-MWe design, “we’re off to the races,” Hopkins said.

NuScale has not announced a binding customer deal. But in its first-quarter investor presentation, the company said it expected a “firm customer order” by the end of this year.

NuScale manufacturing partner Doosan has 12 modules in production now at its South Korea foundry and could deliver up to 20 per year in the near term, Hopkins said on May 12. Its first power plant could be operational by the end of 2030 if it gets a finalized deal soon, he added.

For now, NuScale is acting as the nuclear technology subcontractor to Fluor Corp. on a 462-MW power plant project in Romania that could reach a final investment decision early next year.

Though it has decreased its stake over time and has said it will continue to do so, Fluor remains a major shareholder in NuScale.

NuScale previously had an agreement with Utah Associated Municipal Power Systems for a 462-MW commercial power plant at Idaho National Laboratory. Known as the Carbon Free Power Project, that plant — like the design NRC approved on Thursday — would have used six 77-MW modules. But it was canceled in November 2023 as NuScale’s target power price rose toward $90/MWh and interest from UAMPS members failed to materialize.

Thursday’s approval means the US460 meets “applicable agency safety requirements” and can be referenced in future reactor construction permit, operating license or combined license applications, NRC said.

But before building and operating a US460 plant, NuScale, its development partner ENTRA1 Energy or another entity would still have to apply for one or more of those permits or licenses. That process can take 30 months or longer at present, NRC says.

Still, NRC’s approval positions its technology as “the most near-term American SMR power solution,” NuScale said on Thursday. In addition to being the only SMR with NRC design approval, NuScale’s SMR technology is one of the few that runs on conventional low-enriched uranium rather than more scarce high-assay, low-enriched uranium.

The approval boosts NuScale amid broader momentum for U.S. advanced nuclear companies. On May 23, the Trump administration issued four executive orders to expand reactor deployments, ease regulation and shore up domestic fuel and equipment supply chains.

One order would require NRC to review new reactor applications within 18 months, significantly shorter than current timelines. Another would expand the roles of the departments of Energy and Defense in reactor licensing and deployment, potentially creating new pathways for design approvals and expedited siting of power plants on federal land.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/07QS1EBWzyfECYCerAfh9BmyXdHQoJDgjieQzzgGzoA/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS8xNjAycHgtVS5TLl9OdWNsZWFyX1JlZ3VsYXRvcnlfQ29tbWlzc2lvbi5qcGc=.webp,N,,2025-06-02 12:30:18.613658

The Shade Map, now available through American Forests’ Tree Equity Score platform, shows where shade exists — and where it doesn’t — in 101 of the largest urbanized areas in the country, covering more than 360 cities and towns. It visualizes how shade from trees and buildings changes throughout the day, providing decision-makers with data to guide local heat resilience efforts.

“Most cities aren’t armed with the data they need to know if there is shade where communities need it most,” said V. Kelly Turner, associate director of the UCLA Luskin Center for Innovation. “That’s where the Shade Map comes in. Never before has it been this easy for communities in the U.S. to know how much shade they have, where it is and whether the source is buildings or vegetation.”

The map reveals widespread “shade deserts” — areas lacking adequate shade infrastructure — throughout virtually all major urban regions in the U.S. With extreme heat contributing to an estimated 12,000 premature deaths each year, the new resource responds to an urgent public health need. It also shows that, at noon, trees provide 25 times more shade than buildings, making them a particularly powerful solution.

UCLA Luskin Center for Innovation

By showing shade at noon, 3 p.m. and 6 p.m. — including parcel-level data in select cities — the Shade Map allows civic leaders to identify where investments in natural and engineered shade are most needed.

The researchers explored the role of shade in heat equity planning in three immersive stories as examples of how the tool can be useful:

In Austin, parents can explore shade coverage on routes to schools and the disparity in shade coverage across the city.

In Detroit, transit and city planners, as well as transit riders, can explore shade conditions at and near bus stops, where coverage is critical for protecting the 85,000 people who rely on public transit daily.

In Phoenix, where dangerous heat is a daily reality, city planners and residents can use shade data to guide improvements in public parks, building on the city’s Shade Phoenix Plan.

So we are still not talking about lone owner-operators being out on the road in long-distance electric trucks for days or weeks on end.","Volvo Trucks reveals FH Aero Electric long-distance electric semi, offering a range of 372 miles.

The truck features 780 kWh worth of batteries and was engineered with MCS (megawatt charging system) in mind, which will eventually permit recharging in under an hour.

Heavy-duty electric truck offerings still face the reality of single-day trips between warehouses with their own charging infrastructure at each end, as truck charging plazas remain largely on the drawing board.

Commercial buyers now have some choices from multiple manufacturers when it comes to heavy-duty electric trucks—choices that didn't exist at all five years ago.

In a short span of time, truck makers ranging from Scania to Volvo to Daimler have introduced two- and three-axle tractors and flatbed options, allowing fleets that feature trucks that perform repeatable, daily routes to go electric.

But truck makers have more than just regional models in mind.

The latest electric semi from Volvo Trucks is aimed at long-distance routes, able to cover 600 kilometers or 372 miles between charging sessions. This would permit the truck to make the trip from Albany, NY, to Washington DC without recharging with a few miles to spare, at least on paper.

And serious distances like these require serious batteries.

The newly revealed 6x2 Volvo FH Aero Electric features 780 kWh worth of battery packs, eight in total, which coupled with a compact driveline technology dubbed e-axle maximizes the battery space on board.

And truck makers including Volvo are getting ready for a future MCS (Megawatt Charging System) that will permit the truck's batteries to complete the 20-80% session in just 40 minutes.

""Now, transport companies can operate really long distances with electric trucks without having to compromise on productivity. The superfast charging and high payload capacity make this a very competitive solution,"" said Roger Alm, President of Volvo Trucks.

Volvo Trucks’ long-distance semi seeks to give fleets a zero-emissions option as MCS tech gets ready for a wider debut, but the reality of investment in private charging infrastructure remains.

One crucial element here is the availability of MCS itself, with just a handful of stations in Europe at the moment, all of them still quite experimental even if nominally online. So a landscape where MCS stations dot European or American highways is still some time away, as are any charging stations that are designed to cater to 18-wheelers. At the moment there aren't many of those, either.

But Volvo Trucks isn't the only manufacturer racing ahead of where charging infrastructure actually is at the moment.

In 2023 Mercedes-Benz introduced its own long-distance electric semi dubbed eActros 600, with 600 kWh worth of battery capacity on board and a range of up to 310 miles.

Volvo's 372-mile truck eclipses that number, but the real-world impact of this EV range progress is perhaps secondary to other considerations currently holding back EV semi truck adoption among fleets.

But some progress is finally being made for truck charging outside of seaports.

Earlier this year Amazon ordered over 200 of the eActros trucks from Mercedes-Benz for its European operations, set to rely largely on behind-the-fence charging infrastructure at its own hubs.

In fact, it is Amazon's operations that will represent one of the largest-scale tests of long-distance electric trucks in the real world, with the sizable fleet being the largest orders for EV trucks of its kind.

Amazon is in a special if not unique position, able to operate electric semis between warehouses with their own charging infrastructure, and that's quite different from a lone driver being out on the road for several days.

In effect, it's largely the big logistics and retail companies that would even have the necessary geographic footprint to make these electric routes possible on paper, with companies like DHL in Europe being another example.

One other element that often goes unmentioned in these scenarios are repeatable routes that are easy to predict and schedule. So we are still not talking about lone owner-operators being out on the road in long-distance electric trucks for days or weeks on end.

This effectively places these semis back in the category of doing daily runs between warehouses without overnighting at trucking plazas, even if their ranges are double those of trucks meant for regional beverage delivery and other repeat routes.

But some progress is finally being made for truck charging outside of seaports. Charging corridors are finally starting to see real construction efforts in a handful of locations in Europe and North America, after years on the drawing board, with freight operators planning for an EV truck landscape that might still take a decade or more to become readily noticeable by commuters.

For now, the few long-distance electric trucks are bound to rely on their own charging infrastructure for the foreseeable future, until truck charging plazas with MCS or simply lower and less pricey charging rates become more commonplace.

Given how long it took for passenger EVs to make coast-to-coast trips in the US that weren't complete nail-biters on each leg, reaching a utopia where MCS stations permit the same for trucks could take a while.","https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/volvo-2-683da6034dbad.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.753xh;0,0.0416xh&resize=1200:*",N,,2025-06-02 12:29:18.165683

The San Diego Foundation says it has asked the EPA for more information about reimbursement for remaining expenses but has yet to hear back.
It’s common for federal grants to operate on a reimbursement basis, says Hampton Dohrman, who runs a nonprofit management and consulting firm in San Diego.
But without the expected federal funding, nonprofits may not have the financial reserves to weather these types of situations for the long term.
More than half of the San Diego County nonprofits reviewed in a report from the San Diego Regional Policy & Innovation Center had operational surpluses in 2023 — with their federal grant funding.","It came as no surprise to the team at Casa Familiar when the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency told the organization early last month that its $12.7 million federal grant was being terminated.

Casa Familiar had planned to use the money from the Community Change Grants program to improve San Ysidro’s air quality through a low-cost, zero-emissions mobility project to bring electric transportation to the community.

But the EPA had already terminated the nonprofit’s Environmental Justice Community Problem Solving grant for $500,000, awarded last year. So after months of uncertainty fueled by the Trump administration’s sweeping cuts across the federal government, the nonprofit was expecting the other shoe to drop.

And it was already feeling the financial strain. Casa Familiar had spent about half of its $500,000 grant and had budgeted to spend the remaining half this year.

The EPA grants function as reimbursements to backfill recipients’ spending: Groups must first have money to spend and then file for reimbursement with the agency.

“We were already doing the activities,” including hiring staff and distributing almost 200 air purifiers to people in the community, said Lisa Cuestas, Casa Familiar’s executive director. “That’s going to show up as a loss on our budget for this fiscal year.”

Without federal dollars coming in, Casa Familiar and other San Diego nonprofits are reevaluating their overall budgets in order to keep operating day to day. Their previously federally-funded projects are now stalled — but in addition, many groups have also been forced to cut staff, pay and services.

“We are pivoting and doing what we need to do so that our work can continue,” said Franco Garcia, the executive director of the Environmental Health Coalition, which — with its partner, the San Diego Foundation — had a $20 million EPA grant terminated.

The EPA announced in late April that it was canceling nearly 800 environmental justice grants, including those awarded under the Inflation Reduction Act’s Community Change Grants program. The legality of the terminations is still being challenged, since the funding was approved by Congress under the 2022 law.

Nearly $216 million in Community Change grants were allocated to California, and nationwide the program provided nearly $1.6 billion for environmental and climate justice projects in disadvantaged communities.

As with several departments across the federal government, the EPA has been reviewing its grant programs to ensure they “align with administration priorities,” according to an EPA spokesperson.

“Maybe the Biden-Harris Administration shouldn’t have forced their radical agenda of wasteful DEI programs and ‘environmental justice’ preferencing on the EPA’s core mission of protecting human health and the environment,” the spokesperson said in an email.

The Trump administration has moved to terminate grants from other agencies as well, including the National Endowment for the Arts, Institute of Museum and Library Services and the National Institutes of Health.

Many of the moves are being challenged in court, and some grants have been reinstated as a result of federal rulings. But in the meantime, nonprofits are figuring out what comes next.

Federal funding is crucial to the operations of many of San Diego County’s roughly 13,000 nonprofits. In 2023, roughly $940 million in federal money was awarded or contracted to about 3,600 local nonprofits alone, according to a report this month from the San Diego Regional Policy & Innovation Center.

Cuestas says Casa Familiar has had to re-forecast its budget on a near-weekly basis since January to account for the changes at the federal level.

The nonprofit spent about $20,000 of its $12.7 million grant for its zero-emissions mobility project, an amount it was able to get reimbursed despite the uncertainty. And it began hiring staff for the project, which Cuestas says would have brought about 30 new jobs to San Ysidro.

But the organization had expected to pay staff and cover programmatic costs with about $2 million of its federal funding over the next three years, and it had factored the funding into its roughly $9 million annual budget. As a result, the organization has laid off staff, including eight employees hired to work on environmental justice projects.

The Environmental Health Coalition spent about $150,000 to $200,000 on its EPA-funded climate projects, Garcia said, including one to build a linear park at Boston Avenue in Barrio Logan and another to make homes more resilient to climate disasters.

The projects are two of about a dozen that are included in “Rooted in Communidad, Cultivating Equity,” a joint initiative with the San Diego Foundation to fund climate justice efforts in neighborhoods such as Barrio Logan, Shelltown and Mount Hope.

Without funding coming from the federal government, though, the Environmental Health Coalition hasn’t been reimbursed for everything it has spent. The nonprofit has had to lay off, furlough or cut pay for about half of its staff of 15, Garcia said.

The San Diego Foundation says it has asked the EPA for more information about reimbursement for remaining expenses but has yet to hear back. A spokesperson said the foundation couldn’t give details on how much has already been spent on the projects overall as it works to prepare a final accounting of all expenses incurred.

It’s common for federal grants to operate on a reimbursement basis, says Hampton Dohrman, who runs a nonprofit management and consulting firm in San Diego. “It is reasonable for the federal government to have extra scrutiny on dollars,” he said — it can ensure that the programs “hit the boxes that were approved in the grant.”

But such grants can pose challenges for recipients, he adds. Nonprofits can only progress on projects as long as they can pay for them up front.

Federal grants also often come with indirect cost rates, which can be used to pay for administrative and other costs associated with running a program, such as paying the rent or electricity bill.

Those were some of the costs that the Museum of Us was counting on having covered by its federal funding, said James Hadden, the museum’s senior director of development and external communications.

That institution had grants from the National Endowment for the Arts and the Institute of Museum and Library Services (IMLS) terminated earlier this year. A federal judge ordered the IMLS funding reinstated — but to the organization it’s still uncertain.

Micah Parzen, the museum’s CEO, told The San Diego Union-Tribune earlier this year that the administration’s IMLS cuts in particular posed a threat to the institution’s work. “Certainly future work on existing projects is in jeopardy, and future projects,” Parzen said at the time.

More recently, museum leaders have identified different budgetary and planning scenarios going forward and remain committed to not laying off any staff, Hadden said.

The museum and other nonprofits awarded federal grants, such as the Anza-Borrego Foundation, either hadn’t yet used them or were able to get reimbursed for payments they had already made.

But without the expected federal funding, nonprofits may not have the financial reserves to weather these types of situations for the long term.

And there are already signs that some local nonprofits’ financial stability has been hit hard in recent years — especially as help from COVID-19 funds has dried up.

During the pandemic, many nonprofits benefited from emergency funding to keep providing services to their communities, which allowed them to build up their reserves, said Tessa Tinkler, the senior director of research and evaluation at University of San Diego’s Nonprofit Institute.

But according to the 2024 State of San Diego Nonprofits, a report published by the institute in January, a quarter of the organizations surveyed had less than three months of cash reserves last year. The overall average dropped from eight months of reserves in 2023 to six months the following year.

And about 40% of nonprofits surveyed used cash reserves to cover operational costs — a figure Tinkler expected to rise this year even before the Trump administration’s cuts.

“It was already going to be a year that we were probably going to see people dipping more and more into their cash reserves,” Tinkler said. “And then this happened.”

Surpluses can help ensure that a nonprofit doesn’t have to dip into its reserves in the first place. But nonprofits’ surpluses are heavily supported by federal funding — no longer so reliable.

More than half of the San Diego County nonprofits reviewed in a report from the San Diego Regional Policy & Innovation Center had operational surpluses in 2023 — with their federal grant funding. Without federal funding, that share dropped to 17%.

To Alan Berube, the report’s researcher, that’s a clear sign federal money is keeping local nonprofits afloat.

“It’s clear that taking those grants away is a huge fiscal blow to their finances,” he said, “and something that they probably can’t weather for very long without significantly cutting services, cutting payroll and maybe ultimately having to close their doors.”",https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/SUT-L-BUENFIN-1115-016.jpg?w=1024&h=679,N,,2025-06-02 12:30:54.180896

VinFast: EVs Help the Planet and the Household Budget Back to video

Article content

Canadian families are having to make tough choices as grocery bills climb by 3.8% year over year1. With 85% now feeling like they’re living paycheque to paycheque2 and 61% reconsidering major life decisions due to rising costs3, every purchase matters more than ever.

Article content

Article content

In this climate, consumers will have to calculate which vehicle makes the most financial sense over time. The answer increasingly points to electric.

Article content

The Numbers Don’t Lie

Article content

Recent research reveals a compelling financial picture for electric vehicles. Clean Energy Canada found that EVs save Canadian drivers roughly $3,000 annually on average. Over ten years, that adds up to about $30,000 in savings4. An electric hatchback or SUV can save $28,500 compared to its gasoline equivalent during the same period.

Article content

An earlier research from Vincentric supports these findings. They analyzed 40 electric vehicles against comparable gas models and came to the conclusion that 95% of EVs cost less to own over five years than their traditional counterparts5. The savings come from lower fuel costs, reduced maintenance needs, and fewer repairs.

Article content

Long seen as an environmentally friendly alternative to gasoline cars, EVs are now emerging as practical financial tools for households watching every dollar. Yes, EVs often cost more upfront, but they can reduce the total cost of ownership, a growing concern for budget-conscious families. Lower fuel costs make a difference when gas prices swing unpredictably, and reduced maintenance helps when unexpected repair bills can derail household budgets.

Article content

This financial logic could be especially appealing to parents. The Spring Financial report found that 70% of parents with kids at home are reconsidering major decisions due to cost pressures6. They’re 40% less likely to afford emergency savings compared to other Canadians.

Article content

For these families, an EV’s lower operating costs might help free up money for other priorities.

Article content

The psychological shift may be underway. Canadians who once bought EVs to feel good about the environment might now be turning to them to make better financial decisions.

Article content

Meeting the Market Where It Is

Article content

Automakers recognize this change. VinFast, the best-selling automaker in Vietnam, for example, has structured its Canadian strategy around what budget-conscious buyers actually want. Their “3 Good” approach focuses on premium cars, affordable prices, and excellent aftersales policies. It’s straightforward messaging for complicated times.

Article content

Currently, VinFast offers one of the longest warranties in the car industry, with their all-wheel-drive mid-sized electric SUV, the VinFast VF 8, covered for ten years or 200,000 kilometers, with unlimited kilometers on the battery under normal usage. This is financial insurance for families who can’t afford unexpected repair bills. The warranty reduces long-term uncertainty, which matters more when household budgets are already stretched thin.

Article content

Article content

The brand’s approach aligns with current Canadian priorities. Affordable pricing addresses upfront cost concerns. Well-equipped vehicles provide value. Strong service commitments reduce ownership risks. These aren’t luxury considerations anymore; they’re necessities for families making careful financial decisions.

Article content

VinFast’s strategy reflects the broader market reality. Canadian buyers want EVs that make financial sense first and environmental sense second. Both matter, but economic pressures have reordered priorities.

Article content

The New Equation

Article content

Today’s car buyers face a different calculation than they did several years ago. Environmental benefits still matter, but financial benefits often determine the final decision. EVs deliver on both, but the economic case has become the compelling argument.

Article content

In this environment, brands should recognize that they’re selling financial security as much as environmental responsibility. They can win over customers by understanding what Canadian families need most right now: vehicles that help their budgets work better, not just make their carbon footprint smaller.

The [environmental] groups may complain bitterly over losing a main source of leverage and fundraising appeals. But let them complain. They do not speak for the trees, much less for the American public.

But there’s a less rosy way to tell the story. The Supreme Court’s paean to agency deference is oddly selective. At the end of the last term, for example, the Court invalidated the Environmental Protection Agency’s effort to adopt a rule that would have prevented upwind states from polluting the air of downwind states. “The EPA’s sin,” as I explained for this magazine at the time, “was failing to adequately respond to a single oblique comment that it received.”

That’s the opposite of deference. It’s intensive, even hyperactive, scrutiny of the EPA’s decision to protect the environment. Instead of deferring to the agency’s lengthy, technical defense of the rule, the Supreme Court flyspecked it—just as the D.C. Circuit flyspecked the agency decision approving the 88-mile railroad in the Uinta Basin. That’s exactly the kind of “overly intrusive (and unpredictable) review” that the Supreme Court criticized the lower courts for.

It sure looks like the conservative majority is adjusting the intensity of judicial scrutiny to suit its policy preferences. When agencies downplay environmental harms, Seven County says they should get a free pass. When agencies move to protect the environment, the courts will tie them into knots.

That’s not the way administrative law is supposed to work. If deference is the touchstone in NEPA cases, it ought to be the touchstone across the board. If the Supreme Court means it when it says that “the political process, and not NEPA, provides the appropriate forum in which to air policy disagreements,” that same line of thinking should extend to other government decisions that aren’t about NEPA.","https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1200,h_600,c_fill,f_jpg,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep,g_auto/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1ecd1136-5f9e-4113-a170-bdd16f7da70e_638x821.png",N,,2025-06-02 13:16:00.729013

“The draft EIS confirms this project will have only minimal and short-term impacts primarily during construction of the submerged pipeline tunnel,” Manley said.","In April, the Army Corps said it would fast-track review of a federal permit for the project under Trump’s declaration of a national energy emergency. The draft is a step toward issuing a final environmental impact statement, or EIS.

The agency’s final review will inform its decision whether to issue a permit and whether the project complies with federal regulations, including the National Environmental Policy Act, or NEPA.

The Corps’ Detroit District Commander Lt. Col. Wallace Bendeff said the agency is committed to following the NEPA process despite the shortened review.

“The Detroit District continues to prepare the Final EIS and comply with all applicable legal and policy requirements, including its federal trust responsibility to Tribal Nations, the National Historic Preservation Act, the Endangered Species Act, and the National Environmental Policy Act,” Bandeff said.

The agency will issue a decision sometime this fall.

Enbridge spokesperson Juli Kellner said in a statement that the draft review is a significant step in the five-year review of the project.

“Our goal is to have the smallest possible environmental footprint. The tunnel design already reflects that intent, and we will use the USACE’s findings from the (draft environmental review) to further refine the project,” Kellner said.

Enbridge has said the project will make a safe pipeline safer. The Corps found the tunnel project is necessary as demand for oil and petroleum products will remain steady or increase through 2050.

The agency examined several main alternatives for the project that include taking no action, building the tunnel as proposed or placing a protective rock cover over the exposed segment of Line 5 on the lake bed. The review also considered options for decommissioning the existing dual pipelines in combination with Enbridge’s proposed tunnel.

Julie Goodwin, an Earthjustice attorney representing the Bay Mills Indian Community, said the Straits of Mackinac represent the center of creation for the tribe.

“It is a rich area with cultural and spiritual and economic importance to the tribe,” Goodwin said. “The Corps is not considering alternatives where no oil would flow through the Straits of Mackinac, and that’s a real problem.”

The public will be able to provide input on the agency’s findings through the end of June. Virtual hearings will be held June 18 and 25.

Environmental groups and Great Lakes tribes have condemned the agency’s move to fast-track review, saying the project poses too great a risk of an oil spill. Anne Woiwode with Michigan’s Sierra Club Chapter said in a statement it is reviewing the agency’s draft, but its position hasn’t changed.

“Line 5 remains an existential threat. Chances of an oil spill in the Great Lakes – our most valuable freshwater resource – skyrockets if this tunnel is built in the Straits. We can’t drink oil. We can’t fish or swim in oil,” Woiwode said.

The draft review said the risk of oil escaping the tunnel is “virtually zero.” The document states about 48 million gallons would need to spill over the span of around 50 hours to fill the tunnel and prompt a release.

David Holtz, who serves on Sierra Club’s board of directors, also raised concerns about the potential for methane to enter the construction area and risk an explosion. Enbridge plans to reduce that risk through ventilation and air monitoring. The Corps found it’s unlikely an explosion would occur during construction.

Scott Manley, executive vice president of government relations with Wisconsin Manufacturers and Commerce, said in a statement that homeowners and businesses rely on the products that Line 5 carries for heating and fuel.

“The draft EIS confirms this project will have only minimal and short-term impacts primarily during construction of the submerged pipeline tunnel,” Manley said. “Although the pipeline has operated safely in the Mackinac Straits for decades, this important project will ensure that businesses and homeowners will continue to have access to the affordable and reliable energy they need with yet another level of environmental protection.”

Enbridge reached a deal to build the Line 5 tunnel during former Michigan Republican Gov. Rick Snyder’s administration in 2018. A year later, Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel sued to shut down Line 5 on behalf of Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer.

A Michigan appeals court upheld a state permit for the tunnel in February after tribes and environmental groups challenged its approval by the Michigan Public Service Commission. Tribes and groups are now asking the Michigan Supreme Court to overturn the permit.

Meanwhile, Enbridge has re-applied for multiple state permits granted for the project that were set to expire in 2026. Tribal and environmental advocates are calling on Gov. Whitmer and the Michigan’s Department of Environment, Great Lakes and Energy to protect the Great Lakes.

A decision has yet to be issued in Michigan’s case against Enbridge after a Michigan judge heard oral arguments earlier this year. Michigan officials allege a 1953 easement for the pipeline’s operation violated the state’s public trust doctrine and should be revoked.

Attorneys for Enbridge argue the company’s easement is valid.",https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/businessnorth.com/content/tncms/custom/image/f61cea88-d711-11e4-a797-d31ae85be7a2.jpg?resize=600%2C315,N,,2025-06-02 12:31:13.012291

Up to 24 hydrogen and carbon capture projects had been previously backed by the Department of Energy’s (DOE) Office of Clean Energy Demonstrations (OCED), created under the 2021 Bipartisan Infrastructure Law to scale up emerging clean energy technologies.

However, the current administration has described the awards as lacking a thorough financial review.

The US Energy Secretary Chris Wright accused the Biden administration of rushing many of the projects through. “[They] failed to conduct a thorough financial review before signing away billions of taxpayer dollars,” he said.

“Today, we are acting in the best interest of the American people by cancelling these 24 awards,” Wright added.

Among the most prominent cuts are $332m for ExxonMobil’s Baytown refinery, $99m for Ørsted’s hydrogen-based clean methanol project near Houston, and $375m for Eastman Chemical’s chemical recycling facility.

In a statement, the DOE said the projects “failed to advance the energy needs of the American people, were not economically viable and would not generate a positive return on investment of taxpayer dollars.”

H2 View has contacted ExxonMobil and Ørsted for comment on the proposed funding cancellations.

The Baytown hydrogen complex is set to be the largest clean hydrogen facility in the world, and it’s expected to reach a final investment decision (FID) this year.

While the major funding may now be revoked, Exxon could continue development using private capital or alternative funding.

The initiative has already attracted strong commercial interest. In May, ExxonMobil signed a long-term offtake agreement with Japan’s Marubeni Corporation for the supply of 250,000 tonnes of hydrogen-based ammonia annually, starting in 2029.

Additionally, the company has a preliminary agreement with Trammo to deliver up to 500,000 tonnes of blue ammonia from the Texas facility.

New market intelligence suggests that the recent funding cancellations are part of a broader shift that could significantly weaken North America’s position in the global low-carbon hydrogen market.

The region’s projected share of global low-carbon hydrogen capacity is now expected to fall from 46% to just 28% by 2030.

Analysts attribute the decline to mounting policy headwinds under the Trump administration, including halted federal funding and rising import tariffs, which are seen as curbing the momentum behind green hydrogen development.","https://www.h2-view.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1200,height=900,fit=contain,quality=75,metadata=none,format=auto,gravity=auto/https://www.h2-view.com/wp-content/files/shutterstock_131684321-e1743761525567.jpg",N,,2025-06-02 12:29:38.180382

Dr. Hart, a professor of public policy at George Mason University and a noted expert in energy innovation policy, highlight the importance of sustained federal investment in energy R&D.","House Republicans and the Trump administration seem to think that the road to “energy dominance” will be built by paving over the federal government. To that end, the House reconciliation bill and the presidential budget proposal would gut the Department of Energy, finishing a job that DOGE has already begun.

It’s a counterproductive approach that will kill innovations that are vital to the nation’s future. Senate Republicans should inject some common sense into the debate before it goes much further, salvaging DOE functions that both parties agreed not so long ago were essential tools in the federal kit.

The House majority and the administration are focusing energy policy on tax reform and deregulation. There are gains to be made through these approaches. Many energy tax incentives subsidize technologies that don't need them. Many regulations snarl energy projects that pose few risks to society or the environment.

But this strategy will not lead to abundant, affordable, and clean energy. Federal investment in energy research, development, and demonstration must be sustained– in fact expanded – to drive American innovation toward this goal.

Federal research and development (R&D) spending is necessary because – understandably – private companies don’t invest enough in technologies with large social benefits. This market failure strikes the energy industry particularly hard. Energy companies spend much less on R&D than other dynamic sectors. Big Tech and Big Pharma, notably, plow a large chunk of their profits back into research, generating breakthroughs like AI and GLP-1 drugs.

But these companies also recognize that work sponsored by federal agencies like the National Science Foundation (NSF) and National Institutes of Health (NIH) underpin their own investments. Since World War II, Republicans and Democrats have agreed on this logic. Federal R&D investments create foundational knowledge that enables the private sector to identify money-making opportunities, and it trains the next generation of researchers to boot.

DOE’s science and applied energy offices play similar roles. They support academic researchers as well as the national laboratory system, a unique national resource. Labs like Tennessee’s Oak Ridge and New Mexico’s Sandia, originally founded to carry out the Manhattan Project, now collaborate with the private sector to deliver innovations like new designs for nuclear power plants and improved drilling technologies.

The administration's budget for fiscal year 2026 slashes these offices. The Advanced Research Projects Agency for Energy (ARPA-E), for example, which the National Academies found to be highly effective and which has led to the creation of 167 companies and $14.6 billion in private follow-on investment since 2009, would be cut by more than 50%. Even the Offices of Nuclear and Fossil Energy, which support industries that the administration claims to like, face severe cuts.

DOE also funds programs to support technologies making the difficult transition from the lab to the market at commercial scale. These programs are as vital as the agency’s R&D investments. Just as no battle plan survives first contact with the enemy, no technology catches on with a critical mass of customers without plenty of adjustments. Each adjustment creates investment risk. Government support can make those risks acceptable to investors.

Unfortunately, many technologies that could make American energy more abundant, affordable, and sustainable, don’t survive this “valley of death.” For reasons good and bad, the energy industry is too risk-averse to seek out, test, and then adopt innovations. Even high-risk investors tend to shy away from energy startups.

Commercialization of new energy technologies is a genuine market failure. New kinds of power plants, such as those powered by underground heat or nuclear fusion, simply will not appear in the United States without DOE investments in technology demonstration, early adoption, and production scale-up. A bipartisan group of lawmakers responded to this challenge in 2022 by creating a new Office of Clean Energy Demonstrations (OCED) and expanding DOE’s Loan Programs Office (LPO).

The administration and the House Republicans would decimate these offices, following on from DOGE-driven staff cuts to the bone and beyond. The proposed FY26 budget would ratify America's pullback from the cutting edge of energy innovation.

This strategy does have one big winner: China. As in other key economic sectors, Beijing has combined legitimate investment with blatant cheating to establish dominance in critical energy technologies such as solar power and batteries. If the drive to slash DOE succeeds, China's continued expansion in energy will accelerate, rapidly cutting U.S. companies out of global markets.

Let us be clear. Some of what DOE spends money on is wasteful. We should cut programs to prop up industries that are too far gone to reclaim and technologies that have no chance of ever competing without subsidies. LPO should be reformed, to focus more tightly on helping energy companies with important technologies reach scale. OCED could be much better focused on technologies with true commercial potential. Like regulatory and tax reform, budget reform is needed. And if we are going to need fossil fuels for decades to come –and we will–those technologies too need to be explored and improved, as the Trump administration has insisted.

The current approach, though, invokes broad cost-saving justifications without a coherent strategy to advance national energy goals. It will lead to extraordinary losses: of ideas, of talent, of competitiveness, and of global influence, in a world where competitors are poised to exploit America’s retreat.

The future U.S. energy system must indeed be based on a comprehensive, forward looking strategy. But cutting energy R&D means that will not happen.

The Senate is the last line of defense against these losses. It needs to stand fast.

While this repeal would significantly raise energy costs, forcing Americans to pay more every month, another consequence has flown under the radar: If the reconciliation bill becomes law, it will threaten grid reliability and block America’s ability to meet increasing electricity demand.

After House passage, the Senate will take its turn marking up the Reconciliation bill, where Senators will face a grim proposition: Could this bill leave their constituents in the dark?

Utilities meeting rising demand with clean energy – for now

Electricity demand is growing, and future demand projections are skyrocketing. Electricity consumption grew over 3% in the last 12 months, and some estimates suggest demand will grow up to 25% by 2030, adding 120 gigawatts (GW) of peak electricity demand. This new demand is driven by the rapid increase of AI data centers and onshoring of domestic manufacturing – both of which enjoy bipartisan support in Congress and the Trump administration.

The electricity industry is meeting the moment with a surge of investment in new resources. In 2024, the U.S. grid added 51 GW of new resources, 93% of which were solar, wind and energy storage. The market is speaking loud and clear – clean energy is the fastest available resource to build to meet demand.

Most of the project pipeline is renewable energy and energy storage. Utilities that conduct long-term planning are planning to build 97 GW of solar, 36 GW of wind and 49 GW of energy storage through 2030, compared to just 61 GW of gas. The EIA estimates 70% of capacity growth in 2025 and 2026 will be solar, wind, or energy storage. And these resources are 95% of what’s seeking to connect to the grid.

In Texas’s ERCOT competitive electricity market, rapid demand increases are being met with solar and batteries. Peak demand has grown by 11 GW in five years, while ERCOT has met that growing demand with 22 GW of solar, 17 GW of wind, 8 GW of energy storage, and 3 GW of gas generation.

The North American Electricity Reliability Corporation (NERC) credits that new installed clean energy capacity with helping meet ERCOT’s rising summer peak demand, saying “lower risk is attributed to a nearly doubling of battery energy storage capacity.”

Meeting new power demand takes time – repealing tax credits would reset the clock

Utilities and market participants have a plan to meet rising demand from AI and manufacturing, and are investing billions to expand the electricity system. But the House reconciliation bill pulls the rug out from under these projects, many of which have already spent years in planning and development, risking America running out of power.

Even where new projects remain cost competitive, restructuring blown up financing arrangements and sorting through new and complex Treasury regulations will take time, leaving a resource gap the market will not be able to backfill.

Here’s why:

Planning new energy projects takes time. Projects typically need to request the right to connect to the grid an average of five years before they come online. Utilities issue requests for proposals three or four years in advance of when they need the power, resulting in signed contracts that move projects forward in the development process. Capacity markets like PJM procure three years in advance, and even these markets saw prices spike when supply could not meet rising demand forecasts. Utilities and project developers submit purchase orders years in advance for long lead items like large scale transformers.

The actual project construction phase represents the last one-to-two years of a much longer planning and development process, and by the time a project starts construction utilities and project developers have committed significant time and capital into development.

Why a budget reconciliation bill threatens grid reliability

We already know suddenly killing off federal tax credits will raise the cost of wholesale electricity 50% by 2035, but the damage goes far deeper than just cost – it threatens 150 GW of new solar, wind, and energy storage projects planned over the next five years but not yet under construction. That’s new capacity sorely needed to keep the lights on across America.

In many cases, the House reconciliation bill would kill projects that are under development, setting the process of building new resources back by years, and leaving the grid unprepared for growing demand. This means power won’t be available for new manufacturing facilities or AI data centers, forcing strategic industries to look elsewhere to meet their needs.

And worse, terminating projects already under development will leave grids unprepared for extreme weather and other unforeseen events, risking blackouts. NERC highlights growing reliability concerns in multiple grid regions as new resources struggle to keep pace with growing demand.

But NERC also says “resource additions since last summer have helped lower the risk of energy shortfalls in several areas.” Rapidly growing solar and energy storage capacity protect our grid from looming reliability risks, for now.

New gas isn’t the answer

We can’t just pivot to building more gas plants. Manufacturers’ order books are full for the next four-to-five years and plants that are not already in the planning process are unlikely to be built until 2030 or later. Gas plant costs have doubled or more in the last several years with turbines and construction labor in short supply.

Adding insult to injury the U.S. Energy Information Administration warns gas costs could rise 91% by 2026, with proposed expansion in greater liquified natural gas exports creating “additional risk over the forecast period,” further threatening cost concerns.

“We’ve got to be really careful here from an affordability standpoint about the choices we’re making,” said NextEra CEO John Ketchum. “What we don’t want to do is drive ourselves to only one solution – that being a gas-fired solution – that’s now more expensive than it ever has been in history.”

This leaves utilities and grid operators with few options. Unable to meet rising demand, utilities may hold back connecting new manufacturing facilities and AI data centers to the grid. Slowing down new capacity additions could create compounding impacts on already-rising electricity costs. And grids around the country will be underprepared for the next heatwave or cold spike.

Four U.S. Senators already stated changes to existing federal energy tax credits within the reconciliation bill should be made “without undercutting current and future private-sector investments that are vital to domestic manufacturing, energy innovation, and affordability for American families.”

With this much on the line, America’s energy policy shouldn’t put reliability at risk.

But the most impressive clean energy producer in the country isn’t on the coast; it’s in the heart of the Great Plains.

Renewables in the heart of America

South Dakota, better known for cattle ranches, cornfields and the granite faces of Mount Rushmore, is now generating a higher percentage of its electricity from renewable sources than any other state in the nation.

According to Environment America’s 2024 State of Renewables Report, South Dakota generated enough renewable energy to cover 92% of all the electricity sold in the state, with wind power being the main source.

This wasn’t the result of climate change policies or a big city initiative. It happened in a rural state, driven by simple geography and practicality.

South Dakota: A natural fit for clean power

South Dakota’s renewable transformation didn’t happen by accident. It’s rooted in the land itself.

Wind power alone generates more than half of South Dakota’s electricity. The state’s flat terrain, steady winds and open landscapes make it one of the most effective regions in the country for reliable and consistent wind. Wind energy helps South Dakota avoid more than 10 million metric tons of carbon emissions every year, the equivalent of taking 2.2 million cars off the road.

Since 2019, wind generation in South Dakota has more than quadrupled. Today, South Dakota’s 29 wind projects produce enough electricity to power more than 2 million homes, far more than the roughly 360,000 in the state.

Alongside wind, South Dakota relies on hydroelectric power, mainly major dams on the Missouri River, which accounted for 21% of the state’s power in 2023. However, hydropower comes with trade-offs, for instance, after the Missouri was dammed populations of cottonwood trees along the river plummeted, reducing nesting areas for birds and valuable habitat for countless species.

While we generally oppose hydropower, and wish to see a day when rivers like the Missouri can flow freely once again, hydropower still remains an important source of power for many communities. And while it’s not as environmentally safe as wind and solar it’s far from as harmful as pollutive fossil fuels.

Solar is still a small player in South Dakota energy, but it seems to be growing. The state generated just 4 gigawatt hours (GWh) of solar power in 2022, but thanks to improving technology, falling prices and the solar market coming to scale, in 2024, that number had grown nearly 100 fold to 346 GWh. That’s roughly enough energy to power 35,000 average U.S. homes.

South Dakota’s renewable energy success offers a blueprint for other states. By utilizing their own unique geography, climate and open land, other states can also take advantage of their inherent strengths while maintaining a diverse and robust energy grid.

Renewable energy benefits rural communities

For South Dakota and other rural states, renewable energy offers independence and community resilience.

Traditionally, rural communities have had less control over their power than most. Electricity is often generated hundreds of miles away, and prices are dictated by markets or companies far removed from the people actually using the power. With renewable energy, especially wind and solar, that’s beginning to shift.

When a local farmer leases part of their land for a wind turbine, that farm becomes a power producer. When a rural landowner installs solar arrays, the community gains a measure of control over its own energy supply. When we allow battery energy storage to be built near where we live, we can store some of that renewable energy for later. And when energy is harnessed close to where it’s used, less is lost in transmission, and more of the benefits stay local.

That kind of autonomy appeals to landowners. Renewable energy offers communities a way to meet their needs without waiting on outside actors, be it a distant utility or far-away supplier. Renewable energy provides stability during price spikes and control over their own community’s resources.

That stability also creates opportunity. Environment America and the state environmental groups in our network support renewable energy because it’s good for the environment. That’s our mission. In South Dakota, as well as other states, many people have also embraced renewable energy because it supports local economies and jobs.

In South Dakota, clean power generates more than 2,700 jobs, that includes construction crews, electrical workers, engineers, land surveyors, repair people and more. Besides cheaper energy and job opportunity, local economies also benefit from tax credits and new infrastructure, all while building a cleaner, more self-reliant future.

Renewable energy can also help communities remain resilient and functional in times of crisis, and as extreme weather grows more frequent, that kind of dependability is becoming essential. Pair wind and solar with modern battery storage, and rural communities don’t just weather storms, they thrive. Local hospitals, farms and families can stay powered even when the greater regional grid fails, and these batteries continue to get better — holding more power, becoming cheaper to produce and making renewable energy more efficient and rewarding than ever.

Beyond South Dakota: A rural energy revolution

South Dakota might be an impressive standout, but it’s far from the only state that’s getting energy from its abundant renewable resources. The U.S. produced more than three times as much solar, wind and geothermal power in 2024 than in 2015, with growth in every single state.

Across the country, other rural states are emerging as leaders in renewable energy. In 2024:

83% of Iowa’s electricity sales came from renewable sources,

Kansas generated 74%,

New Mexico hit 67%,

Wyoming reached 57%, and

Oklahoma made 54%

While these states differ politically, geographically and culturally, they share a key trait. They’re all making progress when it comes to efficiently harnessing their natural advantages, be it wind, water, sun or land, to build cleaner, healthier and more resilient energy systems.

For many of these states, clean energy isn’t a replacement for traditional industries, it’s an extension of them. The same fields that grow corn or graze cattle can also host wind turbines. The same communities that once sent goods downriver can now operate (ideally small) hydroelectric dams. The same houses, whose roofs once blocked out the beating sun, can now harness it.

Clean energy can also diversify rural economies. Wind and other renewables generate payments for landowners and tax credits for consumers. Rural America — once seen as trailing in technology and infrastructure — is now ahead of the curve when it comes to renewable energy. These states are not just producing power for themselves, but disproving myths and breaking down partisanship.

Rethinking the clean energy map

Nearly 97% of America can be considered rural land, and that land is rapidly shifting towards renewables.

The wind turbines that power South Dakota, the solar arrays that support New Mexico, the the hydropower that fuels Oregon, these aren’t fringe efforts or programs — renewables now produce enough electricity to power nearly 70 million American households. Wind and solar have become central to how many people in America are powering their lives, their homes and their businesses.

This shift matters, because it shows that clean energy is not bound by politics. It can (and should) serve everyone.

If the rest of the country is paying attention, they’ll see that the renewable energy revolution isn’t just possible, it’s already well underway. And while we have to continue fighting for renewables across the nation, it’s inspiring that the very places we once assumed would be the last to change, are the same ones leading the charge.",https://environmentamerica.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/SD-Windmills-Ruthie-Moeckly.jpeg,N,,2025-06-02 12:29:42.920426

The Texas Senate passed a number of bills which could have ground renewable energy development to a halt, including:

SB 388 (King), which would have required that 50% of new generation come from natural gas or else make renewable energy pay steep fees to gas companies

SB 819 (Kolkhorst), which would have adopted a discriminatory and capricious permitting program for wind and solar energy

SB 715 (Sparks), which would have forced wind and solar companies to pay onerous “firming” fees

SB 383 (Middleton), which would have banned offshore wind in state waters from interconnecting with ERCOT

Thankfully, all of these bills ultimately died! One other bill started off bad – HB 3556 (Vasut), which would have allowed the state to veto certain wind energy projects – but was amended to be good policy (requiring closer consultation between wind energy developers and the parks and wildlife department).

There were also a number of attacks on transit and biking, including bills to undermine Austin’s Project Connect (SB 2519, SB 3071 and SB 2238 among others), Dallas Area Rapid Transit (HB 3187) and Harris County investments in bike infrastructure (SB 2722).

Attacks on local efforts to fight climate change (including HB 4313 and HB 4314 by Representative Cecil Bell), to prohibit cities from adopting ordinances to protect ashe juniper trees SB 1927 (Hinojosa, Adam), and to prohibit the insurance department from factoring in climate change SB 495 (Sparks) all also fortunately didn’t make it through.

Good Bills Passed

Energy

SB 1202 (King) would streamline the permitting process for rooftop solar and batteries, making it easier for Texans to install clean backup power. Bills to adopt consumer protection standards for solar customers, increase recycling of wind turbines and solar panels, and to set decommissioning and fire safety standards for battery energy storage systems, all passed.

There was some small progress on energy efficiency by passing SB 783 (Menéndez) – which allows the State Energy Conservation Office to update building energy and water conservation standards – and HB 5323 (King) which establishes a Texas Energy Waste Advisory Committee.

ERCOT will have more power to address the surging demand for electricity from data centers through SB 6 (King), including by allowing them to require data centers to use their own backup power during power grid emergencies.

Right to repair

Texas will become the first red state in America to give people more freedom to fix their own stuff, thanks to HB 2963 (Capriglione). This will be a great help in curbing electronic waste.

Water

The Devil’s River – one of the most pristine rivers in the state – will get new protections thanks to HB 3333 (Morales, Eddie), which prohibits TCEQ from issuing new permits authorizing waste or pollutants to be discharged in the river basin.

Homeowners following local watering restrictions can no longer be fined by HOAS for having brown or discolored lawns thanks to HB 517 (Harris Davila).

Walkable, Transit-friendly Neighborhoods

HB 24 (Orr) removes barriers to a variety of housing types, such as townhomes and accessory dwelling units, which can save water and energy.

Oil and gas

Abandoned oil and gas wells are too often leaking methane and contaminating groundwater. SB 1150 (Middleton) would force oil and gas companies to plug these orphan wells when they’ve been inactive for at least 15 years, while SB 1146 (Birdwell) would speed up well plugging by reducing the potential legal liability for people who own the land on which an orphaned well sits (but who don’t own the well itself).

Clean air

SB 763 (Alvarado) provides for a more regular protectiveness review of the standard permit for concrete batch plants

The Great Outdoors

SB 2232 (Hinojosa, Adam) establishes an Unplug Texas Day encouraging Texans to put down their phones and go outside and enjoy our beautiful parks.

Good Bills that Died

While there was much to celebrate, sadly some good bills ended up dying out.

Wildlife

HB 4028 (Zwiener) and SB 2441(Zaffirini) to get plastics manufacturers to end the dumping and spills of plastic pellets into our waters, and HB 1904 (Canales) to ban mass balloon releases – both major harms to wildlife – failed to make it.

HB 4212 (Curry) which would have established the Texas land, water, and wildlife conservation account to provide a permanent funding source to support conservation projects, passed the House but died in the Senate.

HB 1437 (González, Mary) which would have created a pollinator health task force, and its Senate companion, SB 2850 (Menéndez) each passed its respective chamber, but neither passed both chambers, which frustratingly means it fails to become law. Fortunately, though, the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department has agreed to update its pollinator protection plan, accomplishing a lot of what the bills would have done.

HB 5259 (Flores) to direct TPWD to develop a Wildlife Corridor Action Plan got a committee hearing, but went no further in the process.

Electric vehicles

Policies to add electric vehicle charging stations to state parking garages, HB 2145 (Bhojani), and to promote Vehicle to Grid technology, HB 3511 (Anchía), passed the House but died in the Senate.

Water

Many bills that would have promoted better water conservation standards also did not pass. Policies that would allow counties to adopt tax credits for rainwater harvesting, HB 3637 (Troxclair), and to allow Hays County to adopt water conservation standards for in unincorporated areas, HB 2347 (Zwiener), passed the House but died in the Senate.

PFAS pollution

A number of bills to address toxic PFAS pollution (known as “forever chemicals”) failed to pass, including SB 1898 (Johnson), which would ban the use of firefighting foam containing PFAS chemicals except during emergencies, and several bills to study the problem – HB 1145 (Morales Shaw) and HB 3738 (Shofner).

Don’t mess with Texas

None of the bipartisan bills to reduce litter and waste made it, including SB 728 (Johnson) and HB 2048 (Lujan), which would have created a bottle deposit program, and SB 2689 (Hancock) and HB 4839 (Walle) which would have established a new fund to promote recycling.

Clean air

Clean air was also not prioritized this session as SB 2082 (Miles), which would have prohibited the operation of concrete crushing facilities near hospitals, died.

Bad bills which passed

HB 49 (Darby) would absolve oil and gas companies of liability for contamination resulting from the discharge of treated oil and gas wastewater into waterways

SB 2078 (Kolkhorst) could discourage composting because if a city requires businesses to compost, it can’t send that food waste to another county.

Other bills of note

The budget: Lawmakers approved another $5 billion to the Texas Energy Fund. While most of the money will go to build new gas power plants, $1.8 billion will go to the Texas Backup Power Package Program, which will help install backup power, including solar and storage, at critical infrastructure such as nursing homes and water treatment plants.

Unfortunately, many of our asks of appropriators were denied. A TCEQ program which provides filters to schools which find lead in their drinking water got no funding, which means the program will likely end when federal funding runs out. TPWD had asked for an additional $30 million for the Farm and Ranch Lands Conservation Program, but instead they got the same, wholly insufficient, $2 million they got in the last biennium.",https://environmentamerica.org/texas/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Untitled-design-2025-05-30T171342.945-1024x576.png,N,,2025-06-02 12:30:29.821259

WASHINGTON — The Department of the Interior has proposed rescinding a rule put in place last year that added new restrictions on oil and gas development in the National Petroleum Reserve in Alaska. Rescinding the 2024 rule will remove regulations that are inconsistent with the Naval Petroleum Reserves Production Act of 1976, restore the original intent of the Act for the management of the area, and eliminate roadblocks to responsible energy production.

After a thorough legal and policy review, Bureau of Land Management and Department officials concluded that the 2024 Bureau of Land Management rule entitled “Management and Protection of the National Petroleum Reserve in Alaska” exceeds the agency’s statutory authority under the Naval Petroleum Reserves Production Act of 1976, conflicts with the Act’s purpose, and imposes unnecessary barriers to responsible energy development in the National Petroleum Reserve in Alaska.

The Reserve, encompassing approximately 23 million acres on Alaska’s North Slope, was set aside by Congress for oil and gas exploration and development as a matter of national energy security and policy in reaction to the oil crisis in the 1970’s. The BLM administers the reserve pursuant to the Naval Petroleum Reserves Production Act, which mandates an “expeditious program of competitive leasing” while balancing the protection of surface resources.

“Congress was clear: the National Petroleum Reserve in Alaska was set aside to support America’s energy security through responsible development,” said Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum. “The 2024 rule ignored that mandate, prioritizing obstruction over production and undermining our ability to harness domestic resources at a time when American energy independence has never been more critical. We're restoring the balance and putting our energy future back on track.”

The 2024 rule significantly expanded procedural requirements and created a presumption against oil and gas activity in approximately 13 million acres designated as “Special Areas” unless operators could prove minimal or no adverse effects on surface resources. These provisions not only lack a basis in the Naval Petroleum Reserves Production Act but undermine the BLM’s obligation to carry out an effective and timely leasing program.

The proposed rescission is consistent with recent Executive Orders issued by President Trump in January 2025—E.O. 14153 “Unleashing Alaska’s Extraordinary Resource Potential” and E.O. 14156 “Declaring a National Emergency.” These directives emphasize the urgent need to reverse restrictive policies that hinder domestic energy development and economic growth, particularly in Alaska.

Under the proposed rule rescission, the BLM would revert to the regulations that were in place prior to May 7, 2024, which have long guided responsible development in the National Petroleum Reserve in Alaska while incorporating protections for wildlife, subsistence and surface values through the Integrated Activity Plan process.

The proposed rule will be published in the Federal Register and open to public comment for 60 days.

MEDINA – A federal grant for $15 million would have helped build the first-of-its-kind industrial decarbonization system at Western New York Energy.

But that project, and 23 other clean energy and manufacturing innovation projects across the country, were cancelled last week by the Trump Administration.

Skyven Technologies was looking to build the industrial decarbonization system at the ethanol plant. The company said the nationally significant project uses electrified high-temperature steam production, calling it a critical need for decarbonizing U.S. manufacturing.

Skyven said its system would have reduced annual operating costs at the ethanol plant, cut carbon local emissions, and served as a replicable model for food, beverage and chemical manufacturers across the country.

“This groundbreaking project is a major step forward in reducing carbon emissions in the industrial space,” Skyven, a Texas-based company, announced in September. “Arcturus will cut 20,000 metric tons of CO2 emissions per year from WNYE’s facility, which is equivalent to removing 4,300 cars from the road annually. And this is just the beginning of what our cutting-edge technology can achieve.”

The project had already attracted major private investment and was expected to drive an additional $150 million to the Medina site, the company said. Skyven in September announced it had been approved for a federal grant for the project.

Energy Secretary Chris Wright on Friday announced that $3.7 billion in project grants were being cancelled by the Department of Energy.

After a thorough and individualized financial review of each award, the DOW found the projects “failed to advance the energy needs of the American people, were not economically viable and would not generate a positive return on investment of taxpayer dollars,” according to a press release from the DOE.

The grants were primarily targeted for carbon capture and sequestration, and decarbonization initiatives.

“While the previous administration failed to conduct a thorough financial review before signing away billions of taxpayer dollars, the Trump administration is doing our due diligence to ensure we are utilizing taxpayer dollars to strengthen our national security, bolster affordable, reliable energy sources and advance projects that generate the highest possible return on investment,” Wright said in a statement. “Today, we are acting in the best interest of the American people by cancelling these 24 awards.”",https://orleanshub.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/cropped-Hub-bookmark-icon-32x32.png,N,,2025-06-02 12:29:47.797976

The long-rumored more-affordable new Tesla has been a point of contention inside the company for years, according to countless reports. While Tesla has spent years promising to expand its lineup into more budget-friendly segments, CEO Elon Musk seems to be convinced that the way to go is to dump the steering wheel entirely—the company's future should hinge on autonomous driving and artificial intelligence, not competing with other car companies.

But according to a new report, there is—or at least was—a great deal of confusion within Tesla as to whether this potentially $25,000 electric vehicle is happening or not.

That kicks off today's edition of Critical Materials, our morning roundup of industry and technology news. Also on deck today: the legality of President Donald Trump and Congress's crackdown on EVs comes into question, and BYD is facing blowback over its price cuts. Let's dig in.

30%: War Of Words Over Tesla's Maybe-Cancelled $25,000

Tesla More Affordable Compact EV, Rendered

Everybody wants more affordable EVs. Cross the $25,000 barrier, with or without any tax incentives, and you open up zero-emission transportation to a whole new class of buyers—or really anyone fed up with how expensive new cars have become.

If any automaker could pull that off outside of China or Europe, it's Tesla. And Tesla's investors generally want the company to expand its somewhat stale lineup of cars, even as it makes big promises around AI and robots. In fact, Musk's own ""Master Plan"" from way back in 2006 promised luxury cars first, then low-cost family cars later.

So the automotive world was a bit stunned in April last year when Reuters reported that Musk had cancelled a long-awaited $25,000 EV. Musk responded by doing what he normally does in response to negative press: by saying Reuters is lying. He has since alluded to some new and more affordable models coming soon, but very little evidence of this has arisen.

Today, however, Reuters reports that senior Tesla executives were taken aback when Musk denied the car had been axed—to their knowledge, it was pretty much dead. And if it wasn't, well, other people needed to know about it:

The executives knew that Musk had, in fact, canceled the low-cost vehicle, which many investors called the Model 2, and pivoted Tesla to focus on self-driving robotaxis, the people said. The company had told employees the project was over weeks earlier, Reuters reported, citing three sources and company documents.

Musk’s post was so confusing to some senior managers that they asked him whether he’d changed his mind. Musk rejected their concerns and said the project was still dead, according to the people with knowledge of the matter.

After Musk denied the Reuters report about killing the Model 2, executives questioned Musk about what the company should tell perplexed suppliers and investors, people familiar with the matter said.

That story notes that this concern was not universally shared within the company. Some executives told Reuters that Tesla generally keeps its plans flexible for future products. Others, however, worried that the Securities and Exchange Commission could get involved if Musk ""[misled] investors about a future product line that had been baked into their forecasts for the company.

Regardless, it's now mid-2025, a more affordable Tesla is still MIA, and the going theory is that any models that do arise could be stripped-down versions of the Model Y or Model 3 and not something entirely new. We'll see what happens here, but as Tesla's lineup loses steam, rivals are catching up fast.

60%: How Legal Is Trump's EV Rollback?

Los Angeles Traffic 1950s

Trump's policies around EVs, charging and a zero-emission future represent a 180-degree handbrake turn from those of his predecessor, President Joe Biden. It started with the freezing of federal funding for EV charger networks, and as Trump's Big Beautiful Bill works its way through Congress, it could mean an end to EV tax credits and manufacturing incentives—as well as California losing its ability to set tougher emissions rules that a dozen other states follow too.

But as anyone following the news these past few months will know, many of Trump's orders and proposed policies get challenged in court, to varying degrees of success. Automotive News today speculates on what could happen here:

However, Congress used a contested method, the Congressional Review Act, to revoke the California waivers. That mechanism is meant to disapprove agency rules. For example, in 2017, Congress passed a Congressional Review Act joint resolution to disapprove a rule enacted by the Consumer Finance Protection Bureau that would have limited clauses preventing people from suing their banks.

California officials have said the state plans to sue.

If the use of the Congressional Review Act for this purpose stands, it will open up agency notices, orders, declarations, licensing and statutory interpretations to congressional review.

And as for the charging funding:

In February, the highway administration said it would review the implementation of the program, rescind previous guidance and suspend approvals for states. It said no new funds would be issued, but existing obligations would be reimbursed. As of Feb. 6, the department had obligated about $527 million of the remaining $3.3 billion.

The GAO issued a decision May 22 that said “DOT violated the recording statute” because it “treated signed project agreements as the point of obligation” rather than the time that the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act made appropriations.

The GAO said the department must release funds appropriated by Congress, which has the power of the purse, according to the Constitution. Or, it must “propose funds for rescission or otherwise propose legislation to make changes to the law for consideration by Congress,” the GAO said.

All of this is to say that things could be more up in the air than we realize.

90%: BYD Criticized For Escalating China's EV Price War

As advanced as China's EV sector is, it's got too many brands competing for too few buyers—all of which are embroiled in a brutal price war that's helping sales but is ultimately not great for profits. It also has ramifications for the stability of the entire space.

Bloomberg today reports that BYD, in particular, is getting raked over the coals for its most recent round of price cuts. In fact, the automaker's shares sank 17% amid fears that the government may have to step in:

In a commentary on Sunday, the People’s Daily — the mouthpiece of China’s Communist Party — criticized the “rat-race competition” and warned that price wars can seriously affect supply-chain security. Low-priced and low-quality products would seriously damage the international reputation of “Made-in-China,” it said, without naming any specific companies.

Also over the weekend, China’s automobile industry association warned against “vicious competition” that would hurt profit margins, impair product quality and hinder the healthy development of the industry. The Ministry of Industry and Information Technology agreed with that stance and will step up measures to root out unhealthy competition in in the auto sector and protect market order and consumer rights, media outlet Cailian reported.

BYD was at the fore of the latest round of discounting, slashing prices as much as 34% last last month in a move that was followed by rivals including Zhejiang Leapmotor Technology Co. and Geely Automobile Holdings Ltd. Analysts at Citigroup estimated that after BYD’s discounts, traffic to its dealerships may have surged between 30% to 40% week-on-week.

A price war may juice your sales in the short term, but it can have downstream effects that take years to be seen.

As tariffs create uncertainty in the US power market, development activity is likely to slow down, according to the study, entitled “All aboard the tariff coaster: implications for the US power industry”.
Under the trade tensions scenario, by the end of 2026 the US effective tariff rate settles at 10% with a 34% tariff on China.
In the trade war scenario, the US maintains an aggressive tariff policy and implements reciprocal tariffs that result in an overall effective tariff rate of 30% through 2030.
In 2024, nearly all battery cells used in US utility-scale storage projects came from China.","Recent tariff policies in the United States are set to increase the cost of power generation technologies, with energy storage seeing the biggest hike, according to a report from Wood Mackenzie.

Energy storage would be hit the hardest due to its dependence on Chinese imports and could see cost increases of up to 50%, the report warned.

As tariffs create uncertainty in the US power market, development activity is likely to slow down, according to the study, entitled “All aboard the tariff coaster: implications for the US power industry”.

Vice chairman of power and renewables at Wood Mackenzie Chris Seiple said: “In a business with five-to-10-year planning cycles, not knowing what a project will cost next year or the year after is disruptive and causes massive uncertainty for US power industry participants.

“As a result, we could see potential delays in project development and rising power purchase agreement (PPA) prices. We will definitely see impacts on power sector capital projects. The severity depends on what scenarios play out.”

Wood Mackenzie’s P&R Supply Chain Cost Hub tariff calculator was used to estimate the impact tariffs would have on the cost of power sector capital projects.

Tariff impacts are assessed using various inputs, including project and equipment cost breakdowns, as well as US import data.

The analysis looked at two scenarios – trade tensions and trade war. Under the trade tensions scenario, by the end of 2026 the US effective tariff rate settles at 10% with a 34% tariff on China. In the trade war scenario, the US maintains an aggressive tariff policy and implements reciprocal tariffs that result in an overall effective tariff rate of 30% through 2030.

Based on these scenarios, Wood Mackenzie estimates most types of technologies will experience cost increases of 6% to 11%, with utility-scale storage the exception.

In 2024, nearly all battery cells used in US utility-scale storage projects came from China. With the combination of high tariffs on China and US dependence on imports from China, Wood Mackenzie’s P&R Supply Chain Cost Hub estimates cost increases could be anywhere from 12% to more than 50% for utility-scale storage projects, depending on the tariff scenario.

Seiple added: “While US battery cell manufacturing capacity is expanding, it is not expanding at a pace nearly fast enough to meet even a small fraction of battery projects in the US.

“In 2025 we estimate there is sufficient domestic manufacturing capacity to only meet about 6% of demand and by 2030 domestic manufacturing could potentially meet 40% of demand.”

Another effect of the tariffs will be to significantly increase the cost of the US solar market, according to the report. In Wood Mackenzie’s trade tensions scenario, the cost of a utility-scale solar facility in the US will be 54% more expensive than in Europe and 85% more expensive than a new solar plant built in China.",https://renews.biz/media/27526/iberdrola_gorman-bess.jpg?width=640,N,,2025-06-02 12:30:38.931084

RML Group continues to develop its in EV battery manufacturing capabilities, with this latest certification putting the firm a step closer to homologating its ‘VarEVolt’ battery platform, which the firm intends to supply to automotive manufacturers.

James Arkell, Head of Powertrain at RML Group, said: “This certification puts clear water between us and a number of smaller start-ups in the EV space. It underlines our readiness to move from prototyping and niche volumes to supporting larger production contracts.”",https://www.motortradenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/RML-batteries.jpeg,N,,2025-06-02 12:29:21.974912

The US needs the EV tax credit to support our battery manufacturing investments To continue creating a resilient and competitive US-based battery and EV industry, we need to support a policy environment of certainty.
The US battery manufacturing industry is in a growth stage and relies on continued strong EV demand.","Recent investments in the US battery and Electric Vehicle (EV) manufacturing industry are key to establishing a robust supply chain and supporting job growth. Billions of dollars of investments have been driven by a powerful combination of (1) forward looking policies like state and federal vehicle standards, (2) incentives designed to kickstart a domestic battery industry, (3) automaker recognition that the future of the auto industry is electric, and (4) consumer demand for EVs.

While the rest of the world continues supporting their zero-emission commitments and races to be part of the EV economy, the Trump Administration and the 119th Congress are dismantling US industry support at nearly every turn.

Two weeks ago, Congress took the unprecedented step of revoking the authority of states to enforce standards accelerating the deployment of cleaner diesel trucks and electric passenger cars and heavy-duty trucks—a right that states have exercised for over 50 years to reduce vehicle pollution. Now, Congress and the Trump administration are attempting to use the Budget Reconciliation Bill to roll back EV manufacturing and consumers incentives, undo federal passenger vehicle fuel economy and emission standards, and add an excessive $250 annual fee on to EVs that is two-to-three times greater the taxes paid by the average gasoline driver.

These actions are not only a major setback to the deployment of EVs in the United States, but a major blow to the country’s nascent EV battery manufacturing supply.

US supply chain investments and job growth

Investment in the US EV supply chain is a smart move for creating jobs, building technology leadership in a growing industry, and lowering costs. You don’t have to look too hard to see that auto executives know EVs are the future. Even in the US, which lags behind other nations in EV adoption, 1 in 10 new vehicle sales are electric.

One critical element to success is building a robust EV supply chain here in the US. There was a flurry of supply chain investments supported by the Biden Administration and the 117th Congress, following the passage of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (BIL) and the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA).

Over the past decade, approximately $198 billion in announced investments have been made in the manufacturing of batteries and electric vehicles (EVs) in the US, with the potential to create around 195,000 new jobs. Over 80% of these investments were announced after the passing of the BIL in 2022, thanks to the grants, tax credits, and subsidized loans. These policies are responsible for spurring the creation of a more reliable battery supply chain right here in the US. Notably, the states with the highest investments include Georgia, Michigan, North Carolina, Tennessee, and Nevada.

Figure and calculations by EDF

Investments are being made throughout the supply chain. If we look at lithium extraction, a mineral in all lithium-ion batteries, we see the US is forecasted to be a top lithium producer in 2030 due to increased mining expansion. The Argonne National Lab found that in 2022, Australia, Chile, and China were top producers, but in 2030, the US, Argentina, and Australia will likely rise to the top. Midstream battery production was a key target of funding by the Biden Administration and the 117th Congress. This involves manufacturing battery inputs, such as cathodes, anodes, separators, electrolytes, and cells. The Argonne National Lab reported that as of 2024, there were announcements for 79 electrode and cell manufacturing facilities and 63 facilities for battery-grade components manufacturing. Lastly, the US is also rapidly expanding the production of EVs and batteries. A 2024 study by EDF found that in 2028, EV manufacturing facilities would be capable of producing 4.7 million new EVs each year, and by 2024, there were announcements that point to the yearly manufacturing capacity of 1,083 gigawatt hours of EV batteries.

The jobs associated with these investments will also stimulate local economies. A recent report by Atlas Public Policy found that as of September 2024, 31% of the jobs announced were in census tracts deemed as Justice40 disadvantaged communities, meaning they experience high environmental and socio-economic burdens. In addition, they found that 12% are in communities that have experienced economic hardships due to the decline in the fossil fuel industry. It was estimated that over 800,000 additional jobs could be created through indirect employment – the result of increased spending in communities.

But the Trump Administration and the 119th Congress are attempting to slash many of these incentives that support this growing manufacturing base, including the New Clean Vehicle tax credit (30D), the Alternative Fuel Vehicle Refueling Property Credit (30C), and the Advanced Manufacturing tax credit (45X).

These policy shifts are pulling the floor out from under the US-based battery and electric vehicle (EV) manufacturing industry, and we are already seeing the . It is clear that the reversal of these policies, tax credits, and grants, will slow the transition to EVs and is already hurting the US manufacturing base. An ICCT study estimates that repealing the IRA tax credits could result in a loss of 130,000 direct and 310,000 indirect US jobs by 2030. Most of these jobs are located in the Midwest and southern states where the manufacturing base is being established.

The net impact on jobs in 2030 if the IRA is repealed. Figure by ICCT.

We can still save the EV tax credit

This big push towards US EV manufacturing competitiveness was backed by strong demand-side policies that are at risk. The New Clean Vehicle tax credit (30D) included in the IRA reduces the cost of EVs up to $7,500, making them more affordable for middle income households. The tax credit is tied to domestic mineral sourcing and battery production restrictions, thereby designed to incentivize automakers to bring manufacturing to the US and diversify material sourcing to countries with trade agreements, sometimes referred to as “friendshoring”. Unfortunately, this tax credit is slated for elimination in the bill passed by the House in May, therefore creating more market uncertainty for the battery and EV industry. The current proposal eliminates it for most EVs in 2026 and the credit would go away completely by 2027. The Used Clean Vehicle tax credit (25E) is eliminated entirely, reducing accessibility for lower income households looking to switch to electric.

In addition, long-term industry-wide vehicle pollution standards play a crucial role, providing automakers with more certainty and direction for their R&D investments and enabling companies to compete on a level playing field. The EPA vehicle standards reduce global warming pollution, soot, and smog forming pollution. They incentivize manufacturers to increase the availability of clean vehicles that meet drivers needs. While this has been proven to be an effective approach to cleaning our air, it is now on the chopping block. As noted earlier, Congress has already moved to block states from implementing standards to bring more electric vehicles to dealers’ lots while the House has included provisions in the budget reconciliation bill to undermine federal fuel economy and emission standards.

These drastic policy changes, along with constantly changing tariff policies, are already hurting battery manufacturing investments. We are seeing stalled U.S. manufacturing investments, which, if they continue, could halt job production, harm our competitiveness in the global market, compromise supply chain security, and slow decarbonization.

However, the House changes are not baked into law—yet. The reconciliation bill is currently being considered in the Senate and several Senators have expressed an interest in tweaking tax provisions in the House bill. Until both chambers approve the same text there’s a chance cooler heads can prevail. President Trump wants the bill on his desk by Independence Day. Will the future of EV manufacturing go out with a bang? Or will drivers maintain freedom to choose the clean vehicle that best fits their needs? Your member of Congress needs to hear from you as soon as possible before these changes are baked in.

The US needs the EV tax credit to support our battery manufacturing investments

To continue creating a resilient and competitive US-based battery and EV industry, we need to support a policy environment of certainty. There have been three steadying strategies to building the US battery economy – invest in US manufacturing, amplify demand signals, and create strong and diversified partnerships with producing countries. The recent rollback of promised government funding and the current threat to the EV tax credits add to the environment of uncertainty that will hurt the US manufacturing base.

There’s no way around it – slashing incentives to build a US EV supply chain is a major blow at a critical moment. The US battery manufacturing industry is in a growth stage and relies on continued strong EV demand. The combination of demand and supply-side policies is the strategy that provides the best chance of successfully creating a resilient and competitive battery supply chain so that the US automotive companies lead in the global car market and American workers can build the cars of the 21st century.",https://blog.ucs.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/vw-plant-chatanooga.jpg,N,,2025-06-02 11:25:37.534567

Rand Paul of Kentucky has already indicated he opposes the bill because it will ""explode the debt.""
Including interest, the House bill would increase the debt by $3.1 trillion, according to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget.
I'm worried that the House bill goes way too far in that regard,"" Hawley said in a CNN interview.
In the Senate, the deduction is not an issue, since none of the blue states have Republican senators.
The House-passed bill includes a $4 trillion debt ceiling hike, while the Senate's budget blueprint contained a $5 trillion increase.","Washington — The Senate this week is taking up the massive budget package containing President Trump's second-term agenda, a measure that squeaked through the House with a one-vote margin, solely with Republican votes. Its path through the Senate seems destined to be similarly narrow, with the package almost certain to be revised, since parts of it are opposed by a handful of GOP senators critical to its passage.

House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, recently ventured to the other side of the U.S. Capitol to remind Republican senators ""that we are one team"" and pleaded with them to keep the bill substantially intact.

""I encouraged them to make as few modifications as possible, remembering that I have a very delicate balance on our very diverse Republican caucus over in the House,"" Johnson said in an interview with ""Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.""

Senate Majority Leader John Thune, a South Dakota Republican, acknowledged that balance, but told reporters ""the Senate will have its imprint"" on the bill. He can afford three ""no"" votes from Republicans if all Democrats vote to block its passage in the Senate, and there are no absences.

GOP Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky has already indicated he opposes the bill because it will ""explode the debt."" Including interest, the House bill would increase the debt by $3.1 trillion, according to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget. Similar to the House, in the Senate, there are Republicans who think there's not enough cost cutting, while others argue some provisions are too draconian.

These are the key sticking points as the legislation moves to the Senate:

Medicaid changes

Sens. Susan Collins of Maine, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Josh Hawley of Missouri are among the Republicans who have expressed concern about some of the changes to Medicaid, a government program that provides health care to low-income Americans as well as those with disabilities. And the trio of senators supported an amendment to the budget resolution earlier this year that would have removed the language instructing the committee overseeing Medicaid to make $880 billion in cuts. That amendment failed.

The House-passed legislation includes new work requirements that would apply to childless Medicaid recipients without disabilities between the ages of 19 and 64. It also requires states to conduct more frequent eligibility checks on Medicaid recipients to root out waste, fraud and abuse, and it would penalize states that provide state-funded health care to undocumented immigrants. The bill also seeks to lower federal costs by freezing states' provider taxes at current rates and prohibiting them from establishing new provider taxes, among other changes.

While these Senate Republicans have generally been supportive of the work requirements, some have warned that they will not support the bill if it includes any cuts to Medicaid benefits.

In a New York Times opinion piece published earlier this month, Hawley called ""slashing health insurance for the working poor"" both ""morally wrong and politically suicidal.""

A handful of senators have also warned of the impact of freezing provider taxes at current levels, since states use the taxes to help fund their share of Medicaid costs, although Murkowski has expressed support for this. Hawley said he's concerned about the impact on rural hospitals, while also voicing opposition to new copay requirements for beneficiaries.

""I don't like the idea of decreasing funding for rural hospitals. I'm worried that the House bill goes way too far in that regard,"" Hawley said in a CNN interview. ""I also don't like what is basically a hidden tax on working poor people who are trying to get health care. I mean, this whole idea of we're going to charge them now additional copays in order to access healthcare — I have to say, that just sounds like a tax to me.""

Deeper spending cuts

Meanwhile, a number of fiscal hawks have balked at the bill's spending cuts or even threatened to oppose the measure without securing deeper cuts, echoing the frustration expressed on the other side of the Capitol by members of the conservative House Freedom Caucus throughout negotiations on the package.

Sen. Ron Johnson, a Wisconsin Republican, said the package's aim to cut $1.5 trillion ""isn't squat, quite honestly."" And Sen. Rick Scott, a Florida Republican, has also rebuffed the cuts, saying the amount is ""not going to do it.""

""Their bill would not pass in the Senate, and I think there's plenty of us that would vote against it,"" Scott told reporters earlier this month, adding that the upper chamber should go through every line in the budget to find savings.

Sen. Roger Marshall, a Kansas Republican, said ""the job of the Senate is to try to increase the cuts in spending,"" calling the House cuts a ""great start"" while urging the Senate to hit $2 trillion. And Sen. Ted Cruz, a Texas Republican, told the network that he believes ""the Senate is going to cut spending more than the House.""

""We're going to see the Senate be more fiscally conservative,"" Cruz added.

Rolling back IRA clean energy tax credits

The House-passed bill would also roll back some of the clean energy tax credits under the Biden-era climate and health care law, including an earlier phasing out of a tax break for clean energy vehicles. But the provisions could face opposition in the upper chamber.

Last month, Murkowksi, along with GOP Sens. John Curtis of Utah, Jerry Moran of Kansas and Thom Tillis of North Carolina, penned a letter to the Senate majority leader to ""emphasize the importance of maintaining a stable and predictable tax framework to promote domestic energy development.""

""While we support fiscal responsibility and prudent efforts to streamline the tax code, we caution against the full-scale repeal of current credits, which could lead to significant disruptions for the American people and weaken our position as a global energy leader,"" the group wrote.

Tillis told reporters after the House passed the bill that the Senate needs to ""look at the specifics"" of revising the clean energy tax credits, saying ""we've got to make sure the businesses who believe the government was setting this as a priority don't have a lot of stranded costs.""

At the same time, other Senate Republicans, like Johnson, have called for eliminating the clean energy tax credits, setting up a possible clash within the conference.

State and local tax deduction

Among the provisions that spurred extensive debate in the House was one allowing residents to deduct more in state and local taxes on their federal returns, known as SALT. Divisions over an increase to the SALT cap threatened to sink the package in the days leading up to its passage in the lower chamber as a handful of blue-state Republicans fought for a higher cap, ultimately settling for $40,000, an increase from $10,000.

In the Senate, the deduction is not an issue, since none of the blue states have Republican senators. Accordingly, a number of Senate Republicans have indicated that they oppose its inclusion in the bill.

""Eliminate it,"" Johnson, the Wisconsin senator, told reporters of the SALT cap increase.

Republican Sen. Kevin Cramer of North Dakota told The Hill that the cap could potentially be cut in half once the Senate makes its changes.

But the House speaker said he warned senators that changing the provision would not only risk getting it through the lower chamber again, but also the Republican majority.

""In the House, we do have a number of members who are elected in places like New York and California and New Jersey, and they have to provide some relief to their constituents,"" the Louisiana Republican told ""Face the Nation."" ""Those are what we call our majority makers. Those are the people who are elected in the toughest districts and help us have the numbers to keep the majority in the House, and so, this is political reality.""

Debt ceiling

Fiscal hawks are also unhappy with the inclusion of a provision raising the debt ceiling by trillions of dollars. The House-passed bill includes a $4 trillion debt ceiling hike, while the Senate's budget blueprint contained a $5 trillion increase. The debate comes as Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told congressional leaders earlier this month that the federal government could be unable to pay its bills as soon as August if Congress doesn't act.

Paul has been the most vocal in opposing an increase to the debt limit. The Kentucky Republican has said ""there's nothing fiscally conservative about expanding the debt ceiling more than we've ever done it before."" Paul said he could be convinced to support the package if the debt ceiling provision is removed and voted on separately.

Instead, Paul has proposed a short-term increase of $500 billion, raising the debt ceiling for a matter of months, which he said would allow conservatives to verify that spending cuts have actually been implemented before approving a further hike.

""If I vote for the $5 trillion debt, who's left in Washington that cares about the debt?"" Paul said Sunday on ""Face the Nation."" ""The GOP will own the debt once they vote for this.""

Paul's Senate colleague, Johnson, also backs splitting the package into multiple parts, as well as a smaller, short-term extension.

Food stamps

The package also cuts billions in federal dollars from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, also known as SNAP or food stamps. The change will require states to cover a share of the costs to provide benefits that help low-income individuals and families pay for groceries. Currently, the program is fully funded by the federal government, although states take on some of the cost to administer it. Beginning in 2028, states will have to chip in for the program as well.

""That's something that I heard some members voice concern about,"" Sen. John Boozman, an Arkansas Republican, said before Memorial Day. ""So, we'll need to address that.""

Senate Begins Putting Its Stamp on Giant Trump Tax, Debt Limit Bill Back to video

The Bill would also eliminate the production and investment tax credits for hydrogen facilities for projects that begin construction after 2025.

Among its numerous proposed amendments to U.S. income tax law, the Bill would eliminate, for most future projects, the federal clean electricity production tax credit and clean electricity investment tax credit, which had each previously been expanded under the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (the ""IRA""). The Bill also imposes broad ""prohibited foreign entities"" restrictions. These restrictions purport to (1) limit parties that can claim tax credits if owned by restricted foreign persons and (2) disqualify projects that receive certain assistance from restricted foreign persons. However, some projects may benefit from the Bill, most notably those intended to qualify for the tax credit for clean transportation fuel production.

This memorandum summarizes certain key provisions of the Bill affecting these tax credits and highlights planning considerations for investors in the affected industries. Based on messaging from senators, including Republican senators, following the passage of the Bill by the House of Representatives, we anticipate the Senate will seek to revise the Bill in ways that will at least partially narrow the scope of the changes contained in the Bill. We also anticipate that the drafting for certain provisions will need to be clarified in future iterations of the Bill, in order to streamline its implementation.

Current Law

Under the IRA, a 10-year production tax credit (""PTC"") is available for certain facilities that generate electricity with zero net greenhouse gas emissions, which can include both wind and solar energy facilities. An investment tax credit (""ITC"") equal to a percentage of a taxpayer's investment in such facilities, as well as in property used for the storage of electricity, hydrogen, or thermal energy (""energy storage technology"" or ""EST""), is also available. Under the IRA, the PTC and the ITC are each subject to a gradual phase-out that would begin for facilities and EST that start construction two calendar years after the year in which annual U.S. greenhouse gas emissions from the production of electricity are 25% or less of their 2022 level (but in no case earlier than 2032).

In addition, in lieu of claiming the PTC or the ITC, the IRA permits certain taxpayers to transfer the credits by selling them to another taxpayer in exchange for a payment in cash or cash equivalents.

Proposed Changes

ACCELERATED SUNSET DATE

Under the Bill, the PTC and the ITC would be eliminated for clean energy generation projects or EST that either (i) begin construction more than 60 days after the date the Bill is enacted into law or (ii) are placed in service after December 31, 2028. An exception would apply for certain nuclear facilities (and certain expansions of existing nuclear facilities, in the case of the PTC) that begin construction no later than December 31, 2028. Thus, clean energy generation facilities or EST would be ""grandfathered"" and remain potentially eligible to qualify for the credits under the current IRA rules (including after enactment of the Bill, but subject to the limitations on transactions with foreign entities summarized below), if they (i) have already begun construction or will begin construction no more than 60 days after the Bill's date of enactment and, in each case, will be placed in service before December 31, 2028 or (ii) have already been placed in service and qualified for a PTC or ITC.

In addition, certain projects that began construction prior to 2025 and which qualify for the previous versions of the PTC or ITC (i.e. under Sections 45 and 48 of the Internal Revenue Code (the ""Code"")), rather than the version of the PTC and ITC introduced by the IRA (i.e. under Sections 45Y and 48E of the Code), would remain eligible for these pre-IRA version of these credits (importantly without the restrictions on transactions with foreign entities imposed by the Bill).

Beginning in 2026, the Bill would eliminate the PTC and ITC for residential solar leases, though this change is expected to practically impact only a small number of states whose laws impede rooftop solar companies from directly entering into power purchase agreements with customers (and where leasing is therefore more prevalent as an alternative). This prohibition would also apply to residential wind leases.

BONUS CREDITS GENERALLY PRESERVED

Any entitlement to bonus credits (or ""adders"") for qualifying projects would be preserved under the Bill, including the ""energy community"" adder and the ""domestic content"" adder. However, the Bill would cut off the ITC low-income community bonus credit program after 2028. Any projects seeking to receive an allocation under this program would need (in addition to being ITC-eligible) to be placed in service no later than December 31, 2028 or four years after the date of the allocation, if later.

TRANSFERABILITY GENERALLY PRESERVED

The ability of taxpayers to sell PTCs and ITCs for clean energy generation or EST projects to other taxpayers would be preserved for both new and existing projects. An earlier draft of the Bill had proposed to eliminate transferability for certain new projects, but this change would have been largely redundant in light of the accelerated sunset date for such credits. Restrictions on transferability could yet be reintroduced when the Senate takes up the Bill.

EXTENSION FOR CLEAN TRANSPORTATION FUELS

The Bill would extend the clean fuel production tax credit under Code Section 45Z (the ""45Z credit"") for sales of sustainable aviation fuels and other clean transportation fuels through 2031. This credit was scheduled to expire in 2027 under the IRA. Further, the criteria for the lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions analysis used to determine eligibility for the 45Z credit appears to be more generous than under the IRA.

However, the Bill would impose new restrictions to qualify for the 45Z credit. Notably, in order to qualify for the credit, the fuel would need to be ""exclusively"" derived from feedstock produced or grown in the United States, Mexico, or Canada. Transferability of the 45Z credit would also be eliminated for credits generated by sales of fuel occurring after 2027.

ELIMINATION OF OTHER CREDITS

Several other credits relating to electric vehicles (""EV"") and their related infrastructure would be eliminated after 2025, including the Code Section 30C credit (for installation of EV charging stations), the Code Section 30D credit (for buyers of new clean vehicles), and the Code Section 45W credit (for buyers of commercial clean vehicles). In the case of the Section 45W credit, an exception would apply for vehicles acquired pursuant to a written contract entered into before May 12, 2025 that are placed in service prior to 2033.

The Bill would also eliminate the production and investment tax credits for hydrogen facilities for projects that begin construction after 2025. The transferability of credits generated by existing hydrogen projects would be preserved.

The Bill would accelerate the phase-out of the Code Section 45X advanced manufacturing production credit from 2033 to 2028 for wind energy components and from 2033 to 2032 for all other eligible components. Transferability of the credit would be eliminated for credits generated by sales of eligible components occurring after 2027.

The Bill would also accelerate the phase-out of the Code Section 45U zero-emission nuclear power production tax credit from 2033 to 2032 while preserving the transferability of the credit.

RESTRICTIONS ON TRANSACTIONS WITH FOREIGN ENTITIES

The Bill would prohibit taxpayers that engage in certain transactions with foreign entities from claiming tax credits. These prohibitions fall into two categories: (1) restrictions related to ownership, funding and services (the ""prohibited foreign entity"" restrictions) and (2) restrictions related to procurement and construction (the ""material assistance"" restrictions). These prohibitions were added to the Bill primarily to address the direct and indirect reliance of the clean energy industry on the Chinese supply chain and some of these prohibitions apply to existing, operating projects in addition to new projects.

If enacted, the prohibited foreign entity restrictions would take effect in two phases, with certain requirements applicable to taxable years beginning after the date of enactment and a second, more stringent, set of requirements taking effect for taxable years beginning more than two years after the date of enactment. These restrictions would apply to all of the tax credits discussed above, with the exception of the EV tax credits and the pre-IRA PTC and ITC credits.

The material assistance restrictions would apply to projects that begin construction after 2025. In contrast to the prohibited foreign entity restrictions, the material assistance restrictions would apply only to the Code Section 45X advanced manufacturing production credit and the post-IRA versions of the PTC and ITC under Code Sections 45Y and 48E.

Observations

IMPLICATIONS FOR EXISTING PROJECTS

Due to the grandfathering provisions contained in the Bill described above, projects that are currently operational or that have begun construction generally would remain eligible for the PTC and the ITC as well as for the credit transferability provisions of the IRA. However, unless a project began construction before 2025 and qualifies for the pre-IRA PTC and ITC (under Code Sections 45 and 48), owners of the project would still be subject to the Bill's new restrictions on transactions with foreign entities and could become ineligible to claim the tax credits or be subject to recapture of ITCs in future taxable years after such restrictions take effect.

IMPLICATIONS FOR NEW PROJECTS

The Bill passed by the House of Representatives reflects a shift in energy policy, as the Bill aggressively moved up the sunset date originally proposed by the Ways & Means Committee for many of the clean energy tax credits. It may be advisable for investors and developers to start planning for how to grandfather projects in development through the start of construction safe harbor, which requires a taxpayer to either (1) begin physical construction on site or (2) incur 5% of expenditures with respect to a project. Projects that do not begin construction by the date that is 60 days after the date of enactment of the Bill would be ineligible for any PTC or ITC.

Historically, whenever the PTC and ITC were scheduled to sunset, eligibility for the credits was based on when a project started construction. The new Bill would make PTC and ITC eligibility dependent, in part, on the timeframe for a project to be ""placed in service."" This would likely generate renewed focus on construction schedules and appropriate risk mitigants by developers, investors, and lenders.

IMPLICATIONS OF FOREIGN TRANSACTION PROHIBITIONS ON EXISTING AND NEW PROJECTS

The Bill's prohibitions on foreign ownership and assistance are complex and drafted broadly such that they could potentially capture inadvertent indirect transactions with certain foreign entities and many of the prohibitions

could apply to existing projects in addition to future projects. U.S. investors and developers are advised to speak to their tax advisors on how these new prohibitions may apply to them.

Utilities are hardening the grid with regionally specific, durable infrastructure.","The U.S. grid is under unprecedented pressure. Along with increasingly severe weather events, skyrocketing demand from data centers and electric vehicles (EVs) reveals a need for significant investment in a system built for the previous era.

That pressure is only mounting. Over the past 10 years alone, the U.S. has seen twice the number of weather-related outages compared to the previous decade. On the other hand, the thirst for energy keeps increasing, with power demand expected to reach a new high of 4,244-billion kWh in 2026.

COMMENTARY

While many utilities are hardening infrastructure by upgrading poles and wires—a necessary step—brute force solutions alone won’t be enough. To truly future-proof the grid, resilience must be rooted in intelligence via systems that anticipate, adapt, and respond dynamically.

Why Grid Hardening Can’t Wait

Over the next five years, electricity consumption will rise dramatically, in tandem with artificial intelligence (AI) usage, and a resulting spike in demand for data centers is a driving force behind this. By 2030, the U.S. is expected to consume more electricity for data processing than for all other energy-intensive manufacturing goods combined, including aluminum, steel, cement, and chemicals.

EVs have earned a reputation as a greener substitute for gas-powered vehicles by helping slash air pollution and carbon emissions. But they also bring a new kind of pressure to the grid. In 2023, EV charging pushed electricity use in the transportation sector to 18.3 TWh—enough to power approximately 1.7 million homes for a year, per the data provided by EIA. And with battery-powered EVs on the rise, that demand is expected to climb to 131 TWh by 2030. This is equivalent to powering more than 12 million average American homes year-round.

On top of the growing demand on an aged system, the increased frequency and intensity of extreme storms, wildfires, winter storms, flooding, and heat waves are now revealing weak areas in the grid. Weather accounted for 80% of all the major U.S. power disruptions between 2000 and 2023. This figure seems extreme at face value, yet it is the unfortunate reality: Most electricity flows through above-ground infrastructure, including utility poles, transformers, and transmission lines. Consequently, they remain vulnerable to high winds, torrential rain, ice storms, lightning, and heat waves. The American power system was not designed to withstand the extremes of modern-day severe weather.

Building Collaboration Into Long-Term Grid Strategy

Much of the grid infrastructure was built with a 50-to-80-year life span. This has meant that reactive hardening has often been the chosen plan of action for many utility companies. However, piecemeal fixes are prone to missing the most vulnerable areas, passing the problem down the line, and resulting in expensive and time-consuming recurring repairs.

One example of cascading grid failure is the 2003 North American Blackout, which left 50 million people without power across eight U.S. states and Ontario, Canada. It started with small transmission line failures and plant closures brought on by poor communication, software glitches, and operator errors. Overloaded lines and system failures set off a quick cascade, halting subways, water systems, hospitals, and communication networks in seconds.

The incident revealed how localized issues, if not managed with a system-wide perspective, can spiral into full-scale grid collapse. However, with a comprehensive, grid-wide hardening strategy, secondary failures are not only predictable but preventable.

True grid resilience requires more than simply upgrading physical assets; it demands a shift in mindset from patchwork maintenance to long-lasting, system-wide planning. Integrating long-term hardening means designing for the future severe weather, not reacting to the last storm. It also means rethinking how utilities plan and implement infrastructure upgrades, starting with breaking down silos across departments.

Engineering teams may know which components are aging or overloaded, but without input from the finance team, the engineering team could propose solutions that are technically sound but economically unsustainable. This could lead to great reliability, but affordability for ratepayers could take a direct hit. Conversely, finance teams may prioritize low-cost fixes that don’t address underlying vulnerabilities, leading to a seemingly affordable rate for ratepayers until the next weather event, and thus could undermine the reliability of the grid. Operations teams, who have boots on the ground, often understand the system’s day-to-day fragility better than anyone, but they are rarely brought into strategic planning early enough to make a difference.

The price of energy emergencies must be considered in the total cost of ownership, which ultimately sits with the customer. The utility must plan and pay upfront for a smart capital investment in a resilient and reliable grid or pay after the disaster. Post-event costs are typically several orders of magnitude higher, and lives are lost in the most unfortunate cases.

When these functions operate in isolation, long-term hardening efforts are fragmented at best and counterproductive for the various stakeholders at worst. In contrast, when departments align around a shared resilience framework and bridge the gap between the field and office teams, utilities can make smarter, more durable investments. A perfect balance would result in smart capital investment that balances reliability, resilience, and affordability.

Hardening with Intelligence

Physical grid infrastructure hardware has come a long way since its predecessors that were designed and implemented in the 1960s and 1970s. Utility companies now have access to AI-era solutions and physical upgrades.

Utilities are hardening the grid with regionally specific, durable infrastructure. Fire-resistant poles made of steel or composites provide more durability than wood during severe heat events, and covered conductors are replacing bare wires in wildfire-prone regions like California to lower ignition hazards. Raised substations, with waterproofed components, are also being built in coastal and flood-prone areas to keep operations running during storm surges.

Although these physical improvements are vital, grid resilience in 2025 must also use smart solutions. AI, predictive analytics, intelligent automation, and real-time monitoring solve the vulnerabilities hardware alone cannot fix—allowing the grid to predict disruptions, react in real time, and quickly recover when failures happen.

AI-driven analytics and phasor measurement units (PMUs) are disrupting how utilities monitor and manage transmission systems. By collecting data on electrical waves, PMUs enable utilities to identify early indicators of equipment stress, voltage fluctuations, or grid instability. AI and machine learning algorithms improve this capacity by analyzing data sets from sensors and smart meters to forecast equipment failures, isolate faults, and maximize dispatch decisions.

When coupled with drones, AI can also be used to strengthen the grid, as this technology combination is ideal for reaching remote or potentially hazardous locations. For instance, Southern California Edison now uses AI-powered drones for image analysis, surveying 50,000 square miles of high-risk territory.

Moreover, smart segmentation and self-healing networks are changing the way utilities find and handle outages. Self-healing networks can find a fault, isolate it, and reroute power—often in a few seconds. This is possible through the combination of automated switching, real-time data monitoring, and grid-edge intelligence, which reduces downtime and stops network-wide outages.

By integrating distributed energy resources (DERs), such as rooftop solar, battery storage, and local generators, these systems can also maintain service to critical facilities and customers even if disconnected from the main grid. For example, DERs can be sent exactly when and where they are needed. When combined with smart meters and grid sensors, DERs allow a utility to keep hospitals, emergency responders, or critical industrial operations online during a significant outage.

The U.S. grid is faced with a plethora of modern-day difficulties—ones it was not built to manage—and physical improvements are only one part of the answer. Combining the strength of physical upgrades with the intelligence of AI helps the grid not only resist the pressures of rising demand and severe weather but also foresee and adapt to these stresses. Smarter, data-driven grids could pave the way for a more resilient, reliable, efficient, and sustainable power system for the American ratepayer.",https://www.powermag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/fig1-power-grid.jpg,N,,2025-06-02 12:30:42.524319

Depending on eligibility, customers can receive US$1,100 per kWh of storage and US$3,100 per kW of solar.

To apply, customers need to verify that they meet the low-income criteria of at or below 80% of the area median income and then contact an SGIP-approved developer.

The SGIP Advanced Payment Program provides customers with 50 percent of the SGIP incentive in advance, allowing them to avoid out-of-pocket costs until the system is installed and the complete SGIP incentive is secured.

When customers reserve funds, they have up to a year to comply with the programme requirements before receiving the incentive.

CPUC says the one-year period gives customers time to enroll in a demand response programme, which will shift their electricity consumption in response to grid demands.

The CPUC’s intent to utilise IRA tax credits to fund the systems comes at an interesting time, given that the US House Ways and Means Committee recently submitted the budget reconciliation bill, which looks to roll back IRA measures majorly.

The bill includes several proposals, such as ending Section 25D residential energy tax credits by the end of this year, cutting the investment tax credit (ITC) for large-scale projects by 2028 at the latest, completely phasing out the Production Tax Credit (PTC) after 2031, and terminating the 45X Advanced Manufacturing and Clean Hydrogen Tax Credits earlier than anticipated.

__

In April, the United Nations University Institute for Environment and Human Security (UNU-EHS) launched the 2025 Interconnected Disaster Risks report, which examines why necessary actions are not taken to address climate change despite decades of warnings by scientists – as well as what is preventing these actions. While previous editions of the report analysed how the disasters are interconnected, and what risk tipping points the world will reach if humanity continues to weaken the systems humans depend on, this year’s edition asked a crucial question: “how do we change course?”

In an exclusive interview with Earth.Org, Irmak Karakislak, senior expert at the UNU-EHS and lead author of the Interconnected Disaster Risks report, explains that the world can build on the change that is already happening.

An Interview With Irmak Karakislak

EO: “If we know what we need to do, then why are we not doing it?” This is a crucial question the report addressed. What are your thoughts on this attitude of humans, especially considering climate change is intensifying?

Karakislak: Most people agree that we should protect our ecosystems, stop pollution, reduce waste, and so many people around the world are trying to make changes for these goals. We recycle, plant trees or support climate-friendly causes — and these efforts matter. However, our report highlights a key challenge: we often stop at surface-level or superficial fixes and fail to confront the deeper systems and mindsets that created the crisis in the first place.

For example, our rivers are polluted with plastic waste, which leads to floods, ecosystem damage and health risks. In response, we often focus on recycling, which helps, but doesn’t solve the root problem of why we have so much plastic waste to begin with. The real issue is the “take-make-waste” model of production and consumption, where we extract resources, use them and then throw them away. The assumption that resources are endless, that newer is always better or that waste is someone else’s problem is causing this issue. Our report shows that we need to go deeper to rethink the very ideas of waste, consumption and value.

EO: Why is it difficult – and appears almost impossible – for humans to really take required steps to stop emissions and halt climate change?

Karakislak: One of the biggest reasons is that we are not tackling the deeper, systemic forces driving the climate crisis. Our societies are built on long-standing assumptions about how the world should work and they often go unquestioned. These include ideas like infinite growth, the separation between humans and nature, or the belief that economic value matters more than our well-being or sustainability. In our report, we introduce the Theory of Deep Change, a framework that helps us to explore these hidden layers – the mindsets, beliefs, and structures shaping our everyday decisions. The good news is that these deeper ideas are not set in stone. They are socially constructed, built over time by people, meaning that they can change.

It seems difficult, but such deeply ingrained beliefs can shift. Think about smoking, for example. It was once considered completely normal behaviour, you could smoke in restaurants, offices, even airplanes. Over time, as we recognized the health risks and began to change public perceptions, laws and norms followed. The same kind of shift is possible in how we relate to the environment and climate. It requires a transformation in how we think, what we value and how we imagine the future. But even when we know what needs to change, actually making those changes can be daunting. This is often referred to as the Delta of Doom – a space where solutions are known, but implementation becomes stalled due to conflicts of interest, fear and systemic resistance. Navigating this space requires strong collective will and governance to overcome the inertia and push through toward meaningful, lasting change.

EO: Are governments and other institutions doing enough to address climate change?

Karakislak: There are many ongoing efforts being made by governments and institutions to address the climate crisis, but the reality is that they are often fragmented, short-term or insufficient in scale. Most of the current solutions stay as superficial fixes that do not challenge the root causes of our problems. What we keep returning to in our work is the need for truly global cooperation, because the problems we face are deeply interconnected, and so are the solutions.

A powerful example of what is possible is the Montreal Protocol, a landmark agreement where countries came together to phase out ozone-depleting substances. It has been highly successful: the ozone layer is expected to fully recover by 2066. This is proof that collective, multilateral action can work. We need more of these ambitious, cooperative efforts to address today’s challenges.

EO: The report outlines five key changes to achieve a desirable future. How can key stakeholders such as the governments and advocacy groups effectively implement these changes?

Karakislak: Our report introduces the idea of deep change, which occurs at two levels called inner and outer levers. Inner levers relate to shifting mindsets, values and assumptions with the aim to redefine what is possible. Outer levers are about structural change like new policies, governance models or investments. These two levers must work together to ensure deep, long-lasting change.

One of the five key changes we explore is the shift from short-term thinking towards long-term thinking, so we can leave a liveable and thriving world for future generations. This begins with an inner shift like caring about the well-being of those who come after us. But it must also be supported by outer lever mechanisms, such as committees for the future. These are often parliamentary or governmental bodies that formally advise on long-term impacts. These committees already exist in countries like Chile, Finland, Wales, the Philippines and even within the European Commission. They are practical ways to integrate future-thinking into decision-making.

EO: Despite decades of warnings from scientists, not much has been done to reverse climate change. How do you think the five key changes outlined in the report will translate into desired results?

Karakislak: While we know so much about the climate crisis and yet still struggle to act decisively is the central question driving our report. Part of what we found is that change is already happening in many places, and these examples can inspire and guide broader transformation. One of the five key changes we outline is about realigning our relationship with nature. When we treat nature as separate from us, as something to control or extract from, we create cascading risks.

But ecosystems can recover when we change our approach and give them the chance. In the US, the Kissimmee River in Florida was once altered for navigation, causing widespread ecological damage. When the river’s natural flow was restored, biodiversity and water quality began to rebound, proving that healing is possible when we work with nature rather than against it.

Another example is from Kamikatsu, Japan, a small town that recycles over 80% of its waste by sorting it into 45 categories. The community took on this ambitious approach entirely by itself and became a global model for zero-waste living along the way. These kinds of community-driven efforts show that, with the right values, tools and support, we can get desired results.

EO: What challenges do you think may arise in the application of the Theory of Deep Change?

Karakislak: Like any framework, the Theory of Deep Change comes with limitations. One of the biggest challenges is that change is highly context-dependent. What sparks transformation in one place might not work well in another. So, applying the theory requires local sensitivity, inclusive dialogue and collaboration among changemakers across regions.

Another challenge is that current systems, as flawed as they are, benefit certain groups. There can be resistance to change, but the cost of not changing is far greater. We are experiencing risks that threaten to trigger cascading disasters, from the climate crisis to food and water insecurity. The deeper shifts we propose in this report are urgently necessary. Change is not without difficulty, but it holds the opportunity to build systems that are fairer, more sustainable and resilient.

EO: What last thoughts would you like to share with our readers?

Karakislak: With so many crises happening at once, it is easy and normal to feel hopeless and overwhelmed at times. But our report offers a different perspective: it shows that change is already happening, and we can build on it. Across the globe, people are rethinking systems, restoring ecosystems and experimenting with bold, new ideas.

The journey towards a better future that we can build together starts with all of us. Even seemingly small actions matter, because collectively, they create a big impact. Readers should feel inspired to see themselves as part of this transformation, to reimagine what is possible and to work towards achieving it.

At their headquarters, on a small scale, they show how it’s done.

With the Climate Innovation Center, inaugurated in Salt Lake City last summer, the nonprofit not only searched for a facility that reflected its decarbonization efforts, but one that would create “a teaching tool and living laboratory,” inviting Utahns to watch the workings of a real-life, ultra-efficient, zero-emissions building.

After receiving many industry professionals to showcase the two-story building, with its extensive solar panels and a room with a battery to make intermittent energy available day and night, the organization opened its doors for the first time to the public for an open house on Friday.

“The building is meant to be a model of how we can eliminate emissions from operating the building,” Kevin Emerson, director of building efficiency and decarbonization at Utah Clean Energy said on Friday. “So there’s zero emissions that come from running the building. It’s all electric and all solar powered.”

Not only does the center produce enough energy to power its operations and even electric vehicles in its parking lot with about 39 kilowatts of solar capacity, but it has the ability to help utilities optimize their operations with a 90 kilowatt hours capacity battery.

That battery, sitting in a small room alongside a heat pump water heater, is part of Rocky Mountain Power’s Wattsmart batteries program, which pays users to incorporate their energy storage into the utility’s smart power grid.

“We think it’s important for our building to be kind of a flexible, interactive, kind of extension of the grid,” Emerson said. “And because ultimately, we want that to be a standard practice, where batteries are located across the electric grid to incorporate more effectively all the renewable energy that you will keep adding.”

Additionally, there’s no gas combustion in the premises. All water features use conservation systems and even the washer and dryer machine installed in the janitor’s closet uses a heat pump.

Outside, the small garden in the facade is highly drought tolerant, full of native and pollinator-friendly plants, as well.

Buildings play a big role in carbon emissions, Emerson told the group of climate and technology enthusiasts who showed up for the tour. According to the environmental nonprofit Architecture 2030, about 40% of carbon emissions come from built environments, either from its operations, or the pollution brought by construction activity itself, including mining, extraction, transportation and manufacturing materials.

That’s why, Emerson said, during the construction process, the team meticulously chose materials with smaller carbon footprints — from the carpets to the countertops and tiles.

Embarking in this project saved emissions by opting to preserve many of the features of the building that sat in the lot prior to the nonprofit’s arrival — and also, the staff repurposed wood pieces from the organization’s previous headquarters for this building.

A lot of the center’s energy efficiency comes from its insulation, as well, with contractors paying special attention to a correct airtight construction, Emerson said. Another team also supervised the space’s variable refrigerant flow heat pump, essentially a mechanical system that works like a large air conditioning unit that can provide cooling when it’s warm, and work in reverse to extract warmth out of the air, even on cold winter days.

The organization’s next step is to document all of these features by pursuing third-party certifications for the building, including a zero energy validation, focusing on the emissions it is not producing, and a zero carbon one to certify the materials used in retrofitting the space.

All of those lessons learned while designing and executing the building were included into climateinnovationcenter.org, a website, so others can incorporate non-polluting practices in new constructions or renovations.

“One of the goals that Utah Clean Energy has is to help all the folks involved in construction across the state realize that building zero emissions as a standard practice is possible,” Emerson added. “And that’s our vision, is that zero emission buildings become a standard practice here in Utah that supports energy affordability.”

Hopefully, he said, more buildings become a big part of solutions for climate and better air quality days in Utah.",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/s3/files/styles/social_large/s3/articles/feeds-state-47642/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/053025_utah-clean-energy_08-1024x6831748866037.jpg?h=199d8c1f&itok=IYH2n_8l,N,,2025-06-02 10:03:29.424335

The Biden years saw the sharpest increase in U.S. investment in clean energy and clean transportation in the country’s history, creating the potential for sizable future progress toward reducing climate-warming emissions and creating tens of thousands of new jobs in the process.

The good news is that 2025’s first quarter saw solid growth in that space, up 6.9% from a year ago to $67.3 billion, according to data compiled by the Rhodium Group and MIT's Center for Energy and Environmental Policy Research. The bad news is it’s probably the year’s high-water mark. That’s because the budget bill making its way through Congress, if passed in its current form, eviscerates federal support for renewable energy, electric vehicle tax credits and EV charging infrastructure–and all the jobs they’ve created.

Though the quarterly figure rose year over year, it was down 3.8% from the final quarter of 2024, according to the study’s authors. Still, clean investment activity accounted for just under 5% of overall private investment in structures, equipment, and durable consumer goods in the first quarter. Most of the gains in the quarter came from consumer spending on things like heat pumps and electric cars. In fact, it would have been stronger had it not been for Tesla’s 9% sales drop in the period, even as overall electric vehicles posted an 11% sales gain.

However, there was a notable drop in new investments in utility-scale clean power and industrial decarbonization tech, which fell 7.7% from a year ago. New utility-scale solar and battery power projects remained relatively stable, but new industrial decarbonization projects plunged to $79 million in the quarter from $16 billion a year earlier. Additionally, six clean technology manufacturing projects worth about $7 billion were canceled in the first quarter.

The controversial “One Big Beautiful Bill” passed the House by a single vote. If it’s not significantly revised in the Senate, the outlook for expanding clean energy gets pretty ugly as the year unfolds.

Forbes Sustainability Leaders 2025: Nominations Are Open

We’re once again seeking nominations from founders, policymakers, investors, organizers, artists, scientists and others driving meaningful impact in climate and sustainability efforts around the world. Is this you or someone you know? Sign up here: Sustainability Leaders 2025

Deadline for nominations is 9:00am ET on Friday, June 13, 2025.

The Big Read

Meet The Net Zero Leaders 2025

Achieving net zero, or the reduction or off-setting of greenhouse gasses to as close to zero as possible, by 2050 will cost nearly $300 trillion (about 7.5 percent of global GDP annually, on average), according to research by the consulting firm McKinsey & Co. Not achieving it, though, could cost double that, according to global reinsurance company Swiss Re.

“If we understood that alternative more, the benefits of climate leadership would be more clear, and the markets would be pricing in these risks and these opportunities,” says Vit Henisz, vice dean of the ESG Initiative at The Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania. Not addressing emissions, Henisz says, would incur costs “bigger than the great financial crisis, bigger than the housing crisis, bigger than the dot-com crisis.”

To identify which companies have performed best in reducing or offsetting their greenhouse gas emissions, Forbes partnered with data providers Sustainalytics and Morningstar to create the third annual Net Zero Leaders list. Roughly 15,000 companies were evaluated for their efforts to achieve their net-zero targets within three ways in which a company can affect greenhouse gasses: emissions within the company’s direct control, such as using energy to manufacture a product (known as Scope 1); emissions from purchased energy (Scope 2); and lastly, supply-chain emissions as well as emissions released from consumer use of the company’s product (Scope 3). Firms are also assessed on how much of the emissions are managed by the company, their organizational preparedness, governance and financial strength to withstand challenges.

At the top of this year’s ranking are three electronic vehicle (EV) companies: Lucid Group at No. 1, followed by Rivian and Tesla. (Lucid and Rivian jumped to the top of the list after not even appearing on it last year.) The reason for EVs’ dominance is strong Scope 3 emissions performance, says Alex Osborne-Saponja, Sustainalytics’ director of ESG methodology and climate solutions. “Essentially, their product use is close to zero, and we only expect that to continue as they invest in the manufacture of electric vehicles.”

Hot Topic

Peter Davidson, CEO of Aligned Climate Capital, on the budget bill’s potential impact on renewable energy

What’s your take on how the clean energy space will fare if the budget bill passes with its current language that eliminates federal incentives for solar power?

This is a big topic of discussion all around. It’s really kind of two, two prongs. I think the first is there’s a full-on hardcore press with the Senate to get them to do something that’s more rational. The good news is Trump has said he wants to sign something by July 4, and the debt ceiling hits in August. So this whole thing is going to be resolved before then. It’s really just kind of madness for the next month or two, and then we should have some form of resolution.

We’ve been talking throughout [the process] with Republicans in the House, and they’ve all said that where it ended up is kind of crazy. But they all voted for it.

I think the conventional wisdom, which I am choosing to agree with, is that the House just punted on the issue. They felt the pressure just to get something out, kick it over to the Senate, and now they know the Senate is going to come back with a bunch of issues

that are different–and more kind of favorable to the IRA. Then the real reconciliation process is going to have to happen. So all that groundwork is what everybody’s doing now.

I’m going to DC to lobby a few senators, bringing some of the portfolio companies we’ve invested in. We’re putting a lot of money into Pennsylvania, so we’re bringing one of our CEOs from the Pennsylvania solar farms we’re developing, hoping to meet Senator McCormick and his staff. We’ve invested in a geothermal company in Texas, XGS, and we’re bringing the CEO of that company. Hopefully, we’re going to meet with one or two of the Republican senators.

That lobbying is going on everywhere. We hope everyone feels we get some positive movement.

The overwhelming amount of IRA spending for factories and everything is going into red districts, so there’s just the basic economic self-interest of Republicans in those districts. … You have to believe people who believe in rational economic policy, trade policy, tax policy, would somehow come out. They’ve been awfully quiet so far. But all the discussions we’ve had, and we’re talking to senior Republicans in leadership, they all get it.

If the bill were to pass in its current form, I think the answer I’d want to give, which is actually what I believe, is it would just slow down what’s happening. It doesn’t get in the way of any trends, because 90% of everything built last year was wind, solar and battery in the United States. Everything that was built globally was wind, solar and battery. … Why solar and wind coupled with batteries? It’s cheaper, it’s cleaner, and it’s faster to deploy. That’s why there’s so much distributed solar going on, which we’re very focused on. That’s not going to change.

Solar is cheaper than gas now on an unsubsidized basis. If all the tax credits are gone, it totally screws up the industry, because you’ve got guys who are developing projects based on a 30% or 40% [Investment Tax Credit]. A lot of those deals would just are no longer financeable because of what people are going to pay for the assets. So a lot of deals will die.

Do startups die if all federal incentives for clean energy go away?

It's certainly not good for anything that's dependent on the incentives to get down the cost curve.

I was at the Department of Energy when we were having to finance, the government was having to give loans, for utility-scale wind and solar projects because they were out of the money. It cost 20 cents to produce it. For the first offshore wind, the offtake agreement was 25 cents a kilowatt hour. It was too expensive to compete in the marketplace, and they were untried technologies, so people had to get comfortable, but it was too expensive.

Wind and solar are now the cheapest, so they're fine. What needs that help are things like nuclear power certainly, and that's kind of under threat too, although they're trying to figure out how to keep some money going for that. But geothermal, hydrogen, nuclear, all those are out of the money and they're the ones that need the tax incentives to get down below the cost curves. So they're the ones that are going to suffer, those technologies.

Why is Hard Rock Mining the Dominant Lithium Source?

Hard rock mining has become the dominant source of lithium in the world today due to its capacity to deliver reliable and stable production. It involves the production of lithium from spodumene and other lithium-bearing minerals in solid bodies of rock. Hard rock deposits contain higher concentrations of lithium compared to other sources, which contributes to efficiency in extraction despite increased operational costs. Additionally, hard rock mining has established processing techniques and fewer cycles of extraction, making it easy to boost production in a short time to counter increased demand. The Metalica nature of the ore leads to highly regulated mining operations. which is one reason that it predominates as a source of lithium supply.

How Does Brine Extraction Contribute to the Global Lithium Supply?

Brine extraction is the second largest source of lithium in the world prized for its affordability and reduced environmental impact over hard rock mining. This technique recovers lithium from brine filled underground water reservoirs by bringing in lithium-laden brine to the surface and evaporating water to concentrate lithium. Although the extraction process is longer due to evaporation schedules. Brine deposits tend to spread over a greater area and hold enormous reserves of lithium. Technological innovations, such as direct lithium extraction (DLE), are improving efficiency and environmental sustainability, making brine a major secondary source of lithium despite its relatively slower production cycles.

Carmakers and vehicle parts suppliers have welcomed a congressional move to revoke California’s authority to enforce stricter vehicle emissions standards, marking a major victory for industry groups that have long pushed back against the state’s transition towards electric vehicles.

The Senate’s May 22 vote mirrors efforts by President Donald Trump to undercut progressive states’ regulatory powers, and escalates the ongoing federal state clash over climate policy.

The measure will head to the president’s desk, with a signature expected, given Trump’s past efforts to limit what he views as state over-reach on climate policy — though it is not clear exactly when this will happen.

Although the Joe Biden-era Inflation Reduction Act provided generous consumer tax incentives for EV purchases, the transition has been considerably slower in the US than in Europe and China. Around 1.3mn units were sold in 2024 in the US, giving EVs an 8 per cent market share. In the EU, around 3mn units were sold.

Republican efforts to rescind these credits will raise costs, slow the transition to cleaner transport even further, and keep up to 40mn more petrol-only cars on the road by 2035, say analysts.

Among those facing repeal is California’s Advanced Clean Cars II rule, which mandates that 35 per cent of new car sales in the state be zero-emission or plug-in hybrids starting from 2026, moving to a full statewide ban on the sale of diesel and petrol-only cars by 2035.

Also on the chopping block are state laws requiring manufacturers to boost annual sales of zero-emission trucks and setting tighter emissions limits for new diesel truck models.

The laws are authorised through waivers granted to California under the 1967 Clean Air Act that allow the state to set vehicle emissions standards that go beyond federal requirements due to its chronic struggles with air pollution.

Conservative lawyers and politicians have long criticised the waivers, arguing they restrict consumer choice and act as a de facto nationwide EV mandate. The rule phasing out the sale of new petrol-only cars, which had also been adopted by 11 other states and Washington, DC, has drawn particularly strong opposition.

“This is not just a California problem, it is a nationwide assault on gas-powered cars,” Republican Wyoming Senator John Barrasso said in a statement, warning the ban would affect nearly 40 per cent of the US car market.

The global adoption of EVs is very nearly a question of life or death for the oil industry, and they’re responding accordingly, joining their political allies to launch a full-scale attack on EV manufacturing and consumer choice in the US

Trevor Higgins, Center for American Progress

On the same day as the Senate’s vote, the House of Representatives passed President Trump’s sweeping tax package, which calls for the cancellation of a number of consumer tax credits for zero-emission vehicles — cost-saving measures intended to help middle and low-income households switch to EVs.

The removal of tax credits would prevent roughly one-third of US households from changing to EVs, says research and advocacy organisation the Center for American Progress.

“The global adoption of EVs is very nearly a question of life or death for the oil industry, and they’re responding accordingly, joining their political allies to launch a full-scale attack on EV manufacturing and consumer choice in the US,” CAP vice-president for energy and environment Trevor Higgins tells Sustainable Views.

California governor Gavin Newsom and attorney-general Rob Bonta have pledged to challenge the vote in court, with Newsom describing the move as “illegal” and “unconstitutional”.

But it is unclear whether any legal challenges will succeed, given different interpretations of the Congressional Review Act, the law invoked by senators to roll back the waivers.

Industry backs repeal

Perhaps unsurprisingly, the move has drawn broad support from the car industry, which has generally been slow to begin producing EVs.

“These EV sales mandates were never achievable,” said Alliance for Automotive Innovation chief executive John Bozzella in a statement. “There’s a significant gap between the marketplace and these EV sales requirements.”

Zero-emission vehicles accounted for around 25 per cent of new car sales in California in 2024. Recent data from the California Energy Commission shows the industry’s growth to be stalling, with the state’s EV market share dipping slightly in the first quarter of 2025.

The commission notes this dip was driven by a 21.5 per cent drop in new Tesla registrations, with non-Tesla registrations growing by 14 per cent.

The Speciality Equipment Market Association, a trade group representing the vehicle parts industry, has also praised the Senate vote to repeal California’s waivers, framing it as a necessary check on the state’s influence over national car policy.

“Automakers would either sell fewer cars to meet California’s requirements, or withdraw from the ACC II states — either way consumers lose, and roughly 30 per cent of the automotive after-market industry was marked for death because of a single state’s government action,” says Sema senior vice-president for public and government affairs Karen Bailey-Chapman.

She argues a “technology-neutral government” is necessary to support innovation and ingenuity in the nation’s automotive industry.

“By eliminating mandates, Congress preserved Americans’ rights to vehicle choice and place their faith in the automotive after-market industry’s ability to design, manufacture and bring to market products that help solve the emissions challenge,” says Bailey-Chapman.

Other car trade associations and manufacturers contacted by Sustainable Views declined to comment.

State-level climate action to persist

While the federal rollbacks will undermine regulatory certainty for climate action at the state level, University of California law professor Ann Carlson says: “States have significant powers to regulate emissions that are not subject to federal limitation.”

She highlights policies including California’s cap-and-trade programme and Low Carbon Fuel Standard as key tools for supporting the state’s transition to EVs.

The lack of federal action will further empower states to determine pathways to protect their residents from the impact of not only climate change, but also poor air quality and high transportation fuelling costs that are impacting drivers’ wallets

Kathy Harris, Natural Resources Defense Council

While Trump has expressed interest in targeting these policies too, lawyers say his efforts to undermine state powers is unconstitutional and unlikely to succeed when challenged in court. The constitution dictates that the president’s remit is largely limited to federal law.

Zachary Pilchen, environmental and regulatory attorney at law firm Holland & Knight, adds that rather than halting climate action altogether, Democrat-led states are likely to pivot to less direct strategies for cutting vehicle emissions, such as regulating traffic-generating facilities like warehouses and ports through requirements that avoid the need for Clean Air Act waivers, or expanding state-level incentives for zero-emission vehicles.

Following the Senate vote, the US Climate Alliance, a group of 24 governors committed to climate action, launched its Affordable Clean Cars Coalition — an initiative made up of 11 states that aims to make cleaner vehicles more affordable and accessible across the country.

“The building is meant to be a model of how we can eliminate emissions from operating the building,” Kevin Emerson, director of building efficiency and decarbonization at Utah Clean Energy said on Friday.
Buildings play a big role in carbon emissions, Emerson told the group of climate and technology enthusiasts who showed up for the tour.
A lot of the center’s energy efficiency comes from its insulation, as well, with contractors paying special attention to a correct airtight construction, Emerson said.
“One of the goals that Utah Clean Energy has is to help all the folks involved in construction across the state realize that building zero emissions as a standard practice is possible,” Emerson added.","When they’re out of the office, the Utah Clean Energy staff is often found in energy hearings, discussing policy with Utah leaders and advocating for more sustainable solutions to power the state. At their headquarters, on a small scale, they show how it’s done.

With the Climate Innovation Center, inaugurated in Salt Lake City last summer, the nonprofit not only searched for a facility that reflected its decarbonization efforts, but one that would create “a teaching tool and living laboratory,” inviting Utahns to watch the workings of a real-life, ultra-efficient, zero-emissions building.

After receiving many industry professionals to showcase the two-story building, with its extensive solar panels and a room with a battery to make intermittent energy available day and night, the organization opened its doors for the first time to the public for an open house on Friday.

“The building is meant to be a model of how we can eliminate emissions from operating the building,” Kevin Emerson, director of building efficiency and decarbonization at Utah Clean Energy said on Friday. “So there’s zero emissions that come from running the building. It’s all electric and all solar powered.”

Not only does the center produce enough energy to power its operations and even electric vehicles in its parking lot with about 39 kilowatts of solar capacity, but it has the ability to help utilities optimize their operations with a 90 kilowatt hours capacity battery.

That battery, sitting in a small room alongside a heat pump water heater, is part of Rocky Mountain Power’s Wattsmart batteries program, which pays users to incorporate their energy storage into the utility’s smart power grid.

“We think it’s important for our building to be kind of a flexible, interactive, kind of extension of the grid,” Emerson said. “And because ultimately, we want that to be a standard practice, where batteries are located across the electric grid to incorporate more effectively all the renewable energy that you will keep adding.”

Additionally, there’s no gas combustion in the premises. All water features use conservation systems and even the washer and dryer machine installed in the janitor’s closet uses a heat pump.

Outside, the small garden in the facade is highly drought tolerant, full of native and pollinator-friendly plants, as well.

Buildings play a big role in carbon emissions, Emerson told the group of climate and technology enthusiasts who showed up for the tour. According to the environmental nonprofit Architecture 2030, about 40% of carbon emissions come from built environments, either from its operations, or the pollution brought by construction activity itself, including mining, extraction, transportation and manufacturing materials.

That’s why, Emerson said, during the construction process, the team meticulously chose materials with smaller carbon footprints — from the carpets to the countertops and tiles.

Embarking in this project saved emissions by opting to preserve many of the features of the building that sat in the lot prior to the nonprofit’s arrival — and also, the staff repurposed wood pieces from the organization’s previous headquarters for this building.

A lot of the center’s energy efficiency comes from its insulation, as well, with contractors paying special attention to a correct airtight construction, Emerson said. Another team also supervised the space’s variable refrigerant flow heat pump, essentially a mechanical system that works like a large air conditioning unit that can provide cooling when it’s warm, and work in reverse to extract warmth out of the air, even on cold winter days.

The organization’s next step is to document all of these features by pursuing third-party certifications for the building, including a zero energy validation, focusing on the emissions it is not producing, and a zero carbon one to certify the materials used in retrofitting the space.

All of those lessons learned while designing and executing the building were included into climateinnovationcenter.org, a website, so others can incorporate non-polluting practices in new constructions or renovations.

“One of the goals that Utah Clean Energy has is to help all the folks involved in construction across the state realize that building zero emissions as a standard practice is possible,” Emerson added. “And that’s our vision, is that zero emission buildings become a standard practice here in Utah that supports energy affordability.”

Hopefully, he said, more buildings become a big part of solutions for climate and better air quality days in Utah.",https://utahnewsdispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/053025_Utah-Clean-Energy_08-2048x1365.jpg,N,,2025-06-02 09:11:19.015271

Congress was on vacation last week, but both chambers are back by Tuesday, and with their return comes another two weeks of discussion on the One Big Beautiful Bill Act. The House passed the bill before leaving for a Memorial Day recess, and now it’s before the Senate for approval.

I’ve already told you about proposed cuts to Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program and a raised tax on private colleges and universities.

Sen. Thom Tillis has been open that he does not support portions of the current version. He’s been most vocal about cuts to clean energy tax credits. The current version of the bill deters clean energy producers from working with China, limits and then ends tax credits on wind and solar projects and quickly eliminates tax credits for electric vehicles.

“Sen. Tillis wants to make sure nothing in the bill impedes jobs or growth,” said Daniel Keylin, Tillis’ senior adviser. “It’s not necessarily about keeping those credits, but it’s about providing those businesses with a soft landing.”

Sen. Ted Budd, a Republican from Davie County, hasn’t spoken publicly about the bill, and doesn’t often push back on Republican legislation.

The Hill reported Budd was among senators who met with Senate Majority Leader John Thune and Senate Finance Committee Chairman Mike Crapo about Medicaid cuts and what they would mean for rural communities.

President Trump asked the Senate to get the bill passed as soon as possible.

The Senate wants to finish work on the bill before its Fourth of July recess begins on June 28. That would leave the House an additional 12 days to review any changes the Senate made before lawmakers begin their monthlong annual August recess, which starts July 25.

,EVs,2025-06-02 12:08:41+00:00,The Denver Post,Republican budget bill would strike blow to clean energy efforts in Colorado,Noelle Phillips,,,,,https://www.denverpost.com/2025/06/02/trump-big-beautiful-bill-clean-energy-tax-credits/,"That’s because the legislation would cut off millions of dollars of funding for clean energy projects, including taxpayer credits for installing solar panels on houses.
The budget bill eliminates nearly $1 billion in clean energy and transportation investments approved by Congress in the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act.
Seventy-four new clean energy and transportation facilities have begun development, and 43 have begun manufacturing American-made products, according to an analysis by Energy Innovation Policy & Technology, a non-partisan energy and climate policy think tank.
“The federal government is trying to make the transition to clean energy harder and slower,” he said.
The budget bill, as written, jeopardizes that work in multiple ways, said Cameron Dales, Peak Energy’s co-founder.","Layoffs could be coming to Namaste Solar, a Colorado-based company that installs solar panels on homes and businesses, if the Republicans’ federal budget bill is made law in its current form.

That’s because the legislation would cut off millions of dollars of funding for clean energy projects, including taxpayer credits for installing solar panels on houses. And that would almost sink Namaste’s business in Denver and Boulder.

“They don’t want any residential solar after December of this year,” Jason Sharpe, Namaste’s chief executive officer, said of the bill, which is supported by President Donald Trump. “Sixty-five percent of the jobs in the solar industry come from the residential market, and so what we’re looking at is the lack of a residential market of any kind, leasing or direct-to-consumer, and that means significant layoffs for our business.”

While the Republican budget bill, which narrowly passed the House of Representatives on May 22, has received much attention for drastic cuts to Medicaid and SNAP benefits that would fund tax breaks, it also rolls back tax credits and low-interest loans for a wide variety of clean energy projects.

The bill’s budget cuts would repeal or quickly phase out whole categories of tax credits and loans for things such as home improvements for consumers, electric vehicles, wind and solar energy production, hydrogen energy, nuclear energy and carbon capture.

Executives who lead Colorado energy companies, both big and small, said eliminating tax credits will decimate the progress made in recent years in the United States as the country seeks as many sources of energy as possible to supply growing demand. It could also lead to higher electricity bills for consumers and eliminate jobs, sending more jobs to China and other Asian markets where production is cheaper and more advanced.

“I don’t look at what we do as green or blue or red,” said Jon Chase, vice president of government relations for Vestas, a company that makes turbines and other parts for windmills in Windsor and Brighton. “An electron doesn’t have a color. We need all of it to meet the demand that we have.”

Environmentalists are also warning that the cuts would be detrimental to Colorado’s goals of eliminating 100% of greenhouse gas emissions in the state by 2050 because it would increase a reliance on fossil fuels to power the grid and fuel all the cars and trucks on the road. They also warn that the cuts would threaten Colorado’s waterways because of the toxic chemicals that are released by burning them.

“It’s leading to dirtier air and dirtier water — things no one voted for,” said Patrick Drupp, the Sierra Club‘s director of climate policy.

The budget bill eliminates nearly $1 billion in clean energy and transportation investments approved by Congress in the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act.

In the almost three years since the act was passed, 3,800 new jobs have been announced in Colorado, along with nearly $362 million in investments from federal grants and loans. Seventy-four new clean energy and transportation facilities have begun development, and 43 have begun manufacturing American-made products, according to an analysis by Energy Innovation Policy & Technology, a non-partisan energy and climate policy think tank.

Battle brewing over bill

Colorado’s House delegation voted along party lines. Now it goes to the Senate, where the Republican majority leadership hopes to hold a final vote before July 4.

A political battle is expected, and Colorado’s representatives and senators spent the last week meeting with constituents to make their pitch on whether or not it should be approved.

Rep. Gabe Evans, a Republican representing the 8th Congressional District, held a news conference at the state Capitol to praise the bill he voted for, saying it “delivers the resources to protect our country, to protect our border, to get violent criminals out of our community.”

But U.S. Sen. Michael Bennet, D-Colorado, warned that “the stakes are really, really high for Colorado.”

Bennet met last week with executives from 10 Colorado companies to discuss the budget cuts. The tax credits were “doing the job that they were supposed to do and doing that, I think, very, very well in Colorado. Now we’re at risk of them being basically completely ripped away and dismantled.”

Will Toor, executive director of the Colorado Energy Office, which promotes clean energy programs in the state, said the bill would drive up the cost of electricity in Colorado, force people to pay more for cars and trucks, and reduce the amount of money people can receive through tax credits to improve the energy efficiency of their homes.

Colorado started its path toward reducing greenhouse gas emissions during the first Trump administration, and then the Biden-era plans for boosting alternative energies gave the state more momentum, Toor said. He said the state can still reach its climate goals, but it will have to work harder to do so.

“The federal government is trying to make the transition to clean energy harder and slower,” he said.

Uncertainty cripples planning

Robert Kenney, president of Xcel Energy’s Colorado operations, said the repeal of the Inflation Reduction Act would not stop his company from moving away from coal. But Xcel would be forced to push the expense of moving to renewable sources onto customers as the company tries to keep up with a growing demand for electricity.

“These projects are made, I won’t say made possible, but they’re made more affordable for our customers by virtue of production and investment tax credits,” Kenney said. “And I like to emphasize the fact that what this means is that our customers are able to achieve our collective climate goals at the lowest possible cost, and the loss of production and investment tax credits would increase the cost of these projects for our customers.”

He also said the budget bill is injecting instability and uncertainty into the construction industry, and Xcel plans its major construction projects as far out as 10 years.

“That makes it impossible to be able to plan in any kind of meaningful way,” he said.

Peak Energy, a sodium-ion battery systems manufacturer, runs a research and development center in Broomfield where scientists and engineers are working to develop technology that can be built and used in the United States. The batteries, which are bigger than an SUV, are used to store the electricity generated by solar or wind so that there is a power supply when the sun sets or the wind stills.

The budget bill, as written, jeopardizes that work in multiple ways, said Cameron Dales, Peak Energy’s co-founder.

Twenty years ago, no large-scale batteries were made in the U.S. Now, a handful of companies are building them here, but they are foreign-owned, Dale said.

“Our mission is to be the first American-owned, American-made battery company in the United States,” Dales said. “And the IRA started that process and has been incredibly successful in actually catalyzing investments in those factories.”

Peak Energy is planning to build a $1.5 billion, 1,500-employee factory to build the batteries in the U.S., with four Wall Street investment firms reviewing the proposal even as the budget bill winds its way through Congress, he said. The bill would penalize companies for buying those Chinese-made parts, which would lead them to keep their manufacturing facilities offshore to avoid those extra financial costs.

“I can tell you, if it passes the way it is today, I will cancel the project,” Dales said.

‘Kneecap our progress’

As for Colorado’s plans to eliminate greenhouse gas emissions, the tax bill would “kneecap our progress,” said Katie Belgard, a Conservation Colorado vice president.

All of the renewable energy plans help Colorado reduce the amount of greenhouse gases — carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide and other chemicals — that trap heat in the atmosphere. That increased heat raises global temperatures and creates climate change, which leads to more drought, more intense wildfires and extreme weather.

Increasing the supply of renewable energy also helps reduce ozone pollution — a problem that plagues the Front Range during the summer when nitrogen oxides and volatile organic compounds bake in the sun and create a brown smog.

“It is the most anti-environmental bill we’ve seen in the history of the country,” she said. “This has been a giveaway for polluters and the fossil fuel industry here in Colorado.”",https://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/161184624.jpg?w=1024&h=681,N,,2025-06-02 09:10:07.929283

“It basically forced Democratic politicians to run around for an entire cycle saying ‘inflation, inflation, inflation.’ The point was inflation reduction.
For example, there was a clean energy performance standard that would have required utilities across the country to get to 80% clean energy by 2030.
And I wish more of those people could get back in the political world.” Climate wasn’t the focus Most messaging about the IRA focused on economic benefits, rather than climate.
The biggest hurdle in marketing something like the IRA or another climate policy isn’t the exact message, Marshall says.","When Dustin Mulvaney teaches a class in environmental law at a California university, he always asks a simple question: Who’s heard of the Inflation Reduction Act? Over the last three years, he says, only around 10 students out of hundreds have raised their hands.

His students aren’t alone. When the IRA passed in 2022, it was the largest climate investment in American history. But while climate nerds may know the law well, most people know little about what it includes. In one survey last year, only 10% of Americans who said climate change was a “very important” issue to them had heard much about what the Biden administration had done to try to tackle it. Another survey found that around a quarter of voters had never heard of the IRA at all.

“I consider myself to be a highly engaged voter,” says Britton Taylor, a brand strategist with more than two decades of experience working with big brands. “I take in tons of political media. And whatever Democrats did to message this or talk about climate, even I didn’t see it. Or if they did do stuff, nothing resonated with me.”

The law’s climate ideas are broadly popular—most people support extended tax credits for electric cars, incentives for American solar panel factories, and a slew of other programs designed to slash U.S. emissions 40% by 2030. Most Americans are also worried about climate change and how it’s affecting their lives, from extreme weather to home insurance rates. But the IRA was a marketing failure. Now it’s on the chopping block, as the Senate considers a bill that would eliminate or phase out almost all of it—despite the fact that it has benefitted red states and districts the most.

The problems started with the name

The bill was originally called “Build Back Better”—not a particularly creative name, since it had been used multiple times in the past after disasters like Hurricane Sandy. But it captured the basic idea: as the country recovered from the pandemic, the right policies could help the economy recover while also cutting pollution and improving workers’ rights.

Then came Joe Manchin, the West Virginia senator whose vote was necessary for the bill to pass. Manchin wanted a name focused on inflation. “The audience we were marketing to was a single man,” says Holly Burke, vice president of communications for the nonprofit Evergreen Action. The bill was renamed the Inflation Reduction Act.

Critics said the name was misleading. Manchin was right that voters cared about inflation, but the bill hadn’t been designed to directly address it. Models from the Congressional Budget Office and Penn Wharton projected that it would have little short-term impact on inflation. And while it would help reduce the price of energy and could help with inflation over time, the name didn’t really reflect what the bill was about.

It also set up the wrong conversation, some critics say. “The Inflation Reduction Act was, as a name, possibly one of the silliest self-owns I can recall,” says Anat Shenker-Osorio, a progressive strategist who does public opinion research and message testing. “It basically forced Democratic politicians to run around for an entire cycle saying ‘inflation, inflation, inflation.’ The point was inflation reduction. But people don’t listen to details, and you’re literally saying the word inflation over and over again, thereby reminding them of their pain point.”

Inflation did decrease, largely driven by other factors like Federal Reserve interest rate hikes, and the easing of pandemic-related supply chain disruption. But people couldn’t see those impacts in their own lives. “Americans struggle with math, and many of them don’t understand inflation to be a rate of change,” says Shenker-Osorio. “So when they’re told inflation is reduced and prices are not reduced, they say, ‘I don’t know what you’re talking about. I go to the grocery store every week. There’s no inflation reduction.’ So, there’s a disconnect.”

Voters tend to trust Republicans more on economic issues, whether or not that’s justified. So Democrats may have been better served by framing the bill around something other than the economy, Shenker-Osorio says.

“If, for illustration, they had named this the ‘God Bless America’ bill or ‘We Love America Act,’ suddenly we’re having a conversation about what does it mean to love America, to do right by America? That allows you to talk about things like ensuring we have clean, renewable energy and that the places you loved to go with your grandparents as a kid will be the places you take your grandkids in the future. What you have to do is figure out, what is my brand advantage? What is the conversation where voters trust me most, regard me most highly?”

It also didn’t help that the acronym “IRA” already had multiple associations, including retirement accounts and the Irish Republican Army. “When the bill first passed, I Googled something about it, and all I got was information about the ‘Troubles’ in Ireland,” says Burke. “I was like, I could have seen that coming.” (And while laws often don’t have catchy names, “IRA” is particularly dull.)

Other laws have been rebranded after passing. The Affordable Care Act, for example, became widely known as Obamacare. (The name was initially used pejoratively, though the Obama administration eventually embraced it.) But no one attempted to find a different way to talk about the IRA.

The complexity didn’t help

The law, at 273 pages long, isn’t easy to concisely describe. There are at least 21 different tax provisions for clean energy alone, for example. It also goes beyond energy and climate to include things like lowering the cost of medicine.

Some of the programs also take time to roll out, making the direct benefits to voters harder to communicate. The tax credits for consumers were also somewhat hard to market—you probably don’t think about getting a discount on an efficient water heater until your current water heater breaks. And if you do eventually buy an appliance and get a tax credit, you might not realize where it came from. It also might not be obvious that a particular factory opened in your town because of the law.

“You have to connect a lot of dots to get from we passed this tax incentive, that had this additional bonus credit that incentivized companies to invest in your community, and create that job,” Burke says. “That’s a lot of leaps to make for an average voter who does not care about tax credits.”

There’s a lesson, she argues, for different policy design. “That’s not to say that we shouldn’t do abstract, wonky policies that make real impacts on people’s lives,” she says. “But if you want to have a politically durable victory, I think making sure that you’re incorporating things that are really understandable to the general public, and there’s a clear line from point A to point B: the government did this thing, and here’s how it supported my community.”

Some programs like this were in the original bill but eliminated, she says. For example, there was a clean energy performance standard that would have required utilities across the country to get to 80% clean energy by 2030. That’s “a more clear cut and intuitive way to understand how the Biden admin was delivering on climate than something with a fuzzier impact like ‘hundreds of billions in investments into clean energy,'” she says. “Both of those policies are good, to be clear, but saying we’re getting our entire grid to 80% clean electricity is a more immediately understandable impact.”

Boring stats don’t sell ideas

The Biden administration and supporters often focused on abstract statistics, like the fact that the IRA could create or support more than a million jobs nationwide. Those types of messages don’t really land. “The more conceptual and distant it is, the worse it does,” says John Marshall, a marketing executive who left the corporate world to launch Potential Energy Coalition, a nonprofit focused on climate. “The more local and human it is, the better it does.”

advertisement

Creativity was also often missing in the messaging, which was typically driven by political consultants rather than creatives. “I thought about this a lot as someone who works in the more traditional advertising and branding world, as opposed to someone who’s anchored in the political space,” says Taylor, the brand strategist. “I feel like Democrats have fallen into a rut in terms of the way that they message . . . Like, ‘we have to explain stuff to people.’ It’s just boring and it does not resonate with people, especially young people.”

Being boring comes at a steep cost, as marketing studies have proven. “When you’re dull, it’s both ineffective and expensive,” Taylor says. “In the political context, being dull is extremely perilous for the Democrats, if you think about what’s at stake in terms of our democracy and our republic. You end up having to spend a lot more in media dollars in order to achieve the same amount of effectiveness than you would have with more compelling campaigns.”

There are exceptions. Potential Energy Coalition, for example, ran an ad for clean school buses that features a grimy bus driver handing out cigarettes to children—not boring. But Taylor argues that the Democratic Party would do better if it worked with a wide swath of experienced marketers.

“There’s been this firewall between the creative community and the political community,” he says. “I really wish that firewall would come down, because I think there’s so many people in the world of advertising that would love to help. Every brief that I get from brands now is, how do you make a dent in culture? Or how do you get talked about? It’s all about generating fame for your brand like press, earned media. That’s what we’re good at, or at least the really talented people in advertising. And I wish more of those people could get back in the political world.”

Climate wasn’t the focus

Most messaging about the IRA focused on economic benefits, rather than climate. The economic benefits are significant, to be clear. The tax credits for consumers, for example, help pay for appliances that can slash energy bills. “I think part of the conversation that we collectively should be having right now is, what are the best ways to reduce energy costs for American families?” says Ari Matusiak, co-founder and CEO of the nonprofit Rewiring America. “An obvious way to do that is by people having more efficient machines in their homes that use less energy and deliver better performance. And that’s exactly what these tax credits are helping to pay for.”

Surveys showed that Americans were worried about daily costs. That’s obviously a very real concern. Still, that doesn’t mean that the dominant messaging should have necessarily been about inflation or the high cost of living, says Shenker-Osorio. “You have to decide what the conversation is going to be about,” she says.

Climate change ranks lower when people are forced to compare it with the economy. Still, Americans do care about climate impacts, and they respond to strong messages about it. “We’ve done hundreds and hundreds of tests on this,” says Marshall from Potential Energy Coalition. “There is a latent, easily [activated] concern in the minds of almost all citizens that something is wrong with the planet and that we should be addressing it. That is a concern that touches people of all political persuasions. And so when you message the fact that we need to stop that from happening, it is very motivating.”

The dire threat to the planet is really the main reason for people to support clean energy. “It’s a pretty major reason—it’s actually bigger than the other things,” Marshall says. “And so we are chickening out of our big ‘why.'”

As Potential Energy Coalition tests different messages, the most effective are about the direct consequences of climate change on people’s lives. “The messaging needs to move from morality to materiality,” he says. “It shouldn’t be something one does because of my particular values. It should be something that one gets behind because it materially affects their lives . . . how it’s affecting your life, your kids, your farm, your insurance costs.” In the group’s testing, the least effective messages were promises of economic benefit.

How much does marketing matter for policy?

Even if most Americans don’t know the details of what’s in the IRA, the incentives have been popular. “We’ve seen massive uptake of the various programs,” says Matusiak. Taxpayers claimed more than $8 billion in credits on their 2023 returns—more than twice what the government had projected. Millions of people have used a tool that Rewiring America created to help households calculate how much they could save through tax credits and rebates. Companies invested hundreds of billions in new factories to make electric cars, solar panels, and other clean energy tech (though billions in planned investments have now been cancelled since Trump changed the direction of federal policy). The majority of the investment in clean manufacturing went to red states, despite the fact that no Republican voted for the legislation.

If the IRA’s initiatives had stayed in place as long as they were intended to—10 years—it wouldn’t matter so much whether most people knew that they existed. If you found out about a tax credit through a contractor, or TurboTax, and didn’t know where it originated, you’d still be able to use it. But if voters still aren’t making the connection between the programs and how they benefit their own lives, they probably won’t feel motivated to advocate for them now that they’re under threat. And name recognition isn’t enough on its own—even Medicare is at risk in the current version of the budget bill. But arguably, better marketing could have helped.

The biggest hurdle in marketing something like the IRA or another climate policy isn’t the exact message, Marshall says. Even though some messages perform better than others, climate messaging in general resonates. But it’s harder to make sure that those messages are actually reaching voters. “The major challenge on climate legislation is a distribution challenge rather than a messaging challenge,” he says. “We don’t have nearly enough spokespeople, we don’t have nearly enough faces of the movement. We need a lot more people talking about it.”

Political will for climate action could easily grow. “We, the citizens, haven’t changed,” he says. “The government changed . . . but the regular people haven’t changed. They’re getting the same limited amount of information. They still care a lot about this issue, and they’re phenomenally moveable on the issue.”","https://images.fastcompany.com/image/upload/f_webp,q_auto,c_fit,w_1024,h_1024/wp-cms-2/2025/05/p-1-91342814-ira-marketing-failure.jpg",N,,2025-06-02 09:10:17.522934

In May, Gov. Stein announced several businesses coming to North Carolina. In Charlotte, it was AVL Manufacturing, promising to build a new production facility resulting in 325 new jobs. In Holly Springs, it was biotechnology company Genentech, announcing plans to build a new manufacturing plant with 420 jobs. In Goldsboro, it was transformer manufacturer Prolec-GE Waukesha, also with a new manufacturing plant, and 330 jobs.

Those are just three of a slew of businesses coming to the state this year. So, it was no surprise that when Stein delivered a speech at the Emerging Issues Forum on energy at N.C. State University this week, the subject went beyond policy to talk about the economy and business.

In his speech at N.C. State on Wednesday, Stein said that while the state has more work ahead to reduce pollution and have a clean tech economy, “in many ways, the market demands that we do.”

“Nearly half of the leading companies in the world have a net zero emissions target. Many of these companies want to call North Carolina home. In fact, many of them already do: Amazon, Google, Meta, Toyota, Honeywell. When these companies decided where to invest, they were looking for a strong workforce, a favorable business environment, an excellent quality of life and places where they could get inexpensive, clean and reliable electricity,” Stein said.

Stein talked about another one of his economic development announcements, held in April in Greenville, when Boviet Solar opened a new solar module factory. “Boviet is a powerful addition to our supply chain that includes a roster of 220 solar companies that are helping to provide more low-carbon energy sources,” Commerce Secretary Lee Lilley said at the time.

“They have already hired 400 employees, nearly, and they’re going to keep hiring. If things progress as they fully expect, when they get to phase two, that number should increase to over 1,000 employees, making them one of the largest private sector employers in the county of Pitt,” Stein said in his energy speech this past week.

“We are a top 10 state in the nation in the number of clean energy jobs, more than 100,000 workers in the clean energy sector. Unfortunately, some in Congress want to slow our growth,” Stein said, referring to the gutting of clean energy tax credits in the huge U.S. House bill passed this month.

Talking to reporters after his speech, Stein said he’s told North Carolinian members of Congress about “the urgency that we keep those tax credits.” “Here’s the thing. Companies make investments based on policy, and there has to be certainty, there has to be settled expectations, or else they do not know how to invest,” he said.

“They were told that these credits existed. Many of them have made major business decisions about investing in North Carolina. We’ve got to preserve those credits so that the companies get the bargain that they struck.”

And speaking of taxes, I asked him about the current tax battle between the House and Senate budget plans, which you can read about in my recent story.

Siemens and Hirano Tecseed, a Japanese machine builder, are collaborating to improve battery manufacturing. The partnership aims to standardize and digitalize battery coating machines to enhance process efficiency, reduce material waste, and support consistent product quality and operator effectiveness.

The battery market is expanding alongside the global move toward sustainable energy, particularly with the rise of electric vehicles and large-scale energy storage. To meet demand, companies like Hirano aim to scale up production and reduce costs while maintaining quality and safety. One key step in battery manufacturing involves coating foil strips with multiple active layers to create electrodes. Defects during this stage can impact battery performance and durability, making careful control of speed and tension during coating essential.

A key component of the collaboration has been the development of a digital twin for battery manufacturing equipment. Using Siemens’ Simcenter software, Hirano successfully simulated and tested a digital twin of its battery coating machine. Drawing on real-time data from a Simatic controller and Sinamics drives, which automate the pilot machine, the simulation provides a highly accurate virtual model for performance testing. By leveraging Simcenter Amesim, a systems simulation software from the Siemens Xcelerator platform, Hirano’s design engineers can virtually assess and optimize the machine’s web handling system for maximum throughput.

In the past, parameters for Hirano’s machines were set based on experience, which could lead to defective products due to incorrect settings. Using Siemens’ comprehensive digital twin technology has enabled Hirano to configure and simulate a machine in a virtual environment before committing to physical production. This allows Hirano to significantly reduce the need for physical prototypes and predict potential product defects. Development engineers can evaluate and optimize machine settings five times faster in the virtual environment compared to physical operation. Additionally, up to 80 percent of the machine simulation and digital twin can be constructed using pre-configured, standard function blocks, resulting in shorter implementation and commissioning times, as well a reduction in development costs.",https://www.engineering.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Siemens-Hirano-Tecseed-partner-to-improve-battery-production.webp,N,,2025-06-02 11:25:49.071103

However, Tesla's brand image has taken some hits recently as CEO Elon Musk has been active in American and global politics, polarizing consumers, who have more options than ever to choose from on a robust EV market.

According to Yahoo Finance, the first three months of 2025 were Tesla's worst quarter since the second quarter of 2022. With dropping sales, Tesla has worked on incentivizing consumers to buy its cars.

The perks, detailed by Electrek, include discounts for a variety of customers, credit opportunities for Lyft drivers, and subsidized interest rates.

One commenter noted that the company is ""truly pulling all demand levers.""

""I am being contacted by Tesla representatives asking if I would like to come in and take a test drive so it appears Tesla Advisors are being asked/told to reach out to anyone who showed interest in Tesla in the past,"" they added. ""I will say Tesla has improved the quality of the Model 3/Y greatly and the service is very good in my area so it saddens me when I think the CEO has done so much hurt the hard working Tesla employees globally by his actions (with zero accountability).""

This all comes in the wake of Tesla benefiting as the sole exemption from a large automotive tariff, since it is the only automaker at this time that meets the required criteria.

Watch now: How bad is a gas stove for your home's indoor air quality?

Ultimately, EVs (regardless of brand) remain a great choice for someone interested in cutting down on fuel consumption. EVs are great choices for environmental purposes. The cars do not emit any pollutants while running and account for less overall pollution when considering other factors.

While some EV opponents note that mining the materials to create the batteries is bad for the environment, the mining processes are getting more efficient, and battery technology is advancing to last longer. It is also less polluting than harvesting dirty fuels.

There are also financial benefits to driving an EV. For one, you can save a lot of money charging your car compared to filling it with fuel at the pump. According to the Southwest Energy Efficiency Project, this could be around $1,000 per year.

You can further those savings (and slash potential charging pollution) by using solar to power your vehicle, and EnergySage's free tools can help you save up to $10,000 on installation. They allow you to compare quotes from vetted local installers to save the most money possible.

You can also still get tax credits from purchasing an EV through the Inflation Reduction Act. However, the Trump administration is considering eliminating these benefits. If you want to take advantage of the tax breaks, you may have to act soon.

While Tesla's sales are down in the United States, overall EV sales have been increasing. All in all, Electrek suggests the influx of incentives from the automaker has ominous undertones.

""This is not a great sign for Tesla,"" Electrek wrote. ""These are end-of-quarter level incentives when we are just about halfway through the quarter.""

Courts should, instead, defer to federal agencies as much as is reasonable when reviewing a NEPA study.
When federal agencies write environmental studies under NEPA, courts should broadly defer to the decisions that they make.
“By comparison, nature based restorations have enormous apertures,” Chi told me.
And then they have to go fix it,” Chi told me.","It could reshape the scale of legal challenges that projects could face in the future, giving the Trump administration — and any successive administration — greater leeway to approve energy projects.

Under NEPA, federal agencies must study the environmental impacts of their decisions before they make them. The strictest studies can run into the hundreds of pages, and they can take years to complete.

But in what was essentially an 8-0 decision, the Court ruled that federal agencies almost never need to analyze the second-order environmental effects of their decisions. In other words, an agency need only study the environmental impact of a project itself — be it a pipeline, a solar farm, or, in the case at issue, a railroad — and not its metaphorically downstream consequences. That remains the case even if a given project might indirectly make it much easier to do something with a big environmental footprint, such as drilling for oil or natural gas.

That is the clearest effect of the ruling. But Justice Brett Kavanaugh, writing for the court’s conservative majority, went much further than that summary alone suggests. In a broad and forceful ruling, he told lower courts that they should stop nitpicking the environmental studies that federal agencies must publish under NEPA to justify their own decision-making. Courts should, instead, defer to federal agencies as much as is reasonable when reviewing a NEPA study. “The goal of the law,” he writes, “is to inform agency decision-making, not to paralyze it.” (Justice Neil Gorsuch recused himself from the case because of his connection to an oil magnate who could have benefited from the ruling.)

That suggests a significant change is coming to how the court system interprets NEPA, a law that is little known to the general public but that plays a defining role in how federal agencies make decisions or approve infrastructure projects. NEPA creates a procedural requirement that federal agencies study the environmental impact of any “major decision,” but that category is so broad that it affects virtually everything the federal government does — spend money, write a new regulation, or approve a new project on federal land. The law and the yearslong lawsuits that it spawns have been blamed for delays in building solar farms and transmission lines, but also oil refineries and gas pipelines.

Kavanaugh’s ruling is “pretty striking for just how strident it is, and how assertively it tries to shut the door on further NEPA litigation,” Nicholas Bagley, a University of Michigan law professor who studies the permitting system, told me. Kavanaugh’s message to lower courts is, in essence, “We keep telling you to knock it off. You keep not listening. So knock it the fuck off,” Bagley said.

At the very least, the ruling suggests that a new phase in the effort to reform the country’s permitting laws has arrived. Now that movement has, in essence, been blessed by the Supreme Court.

The case in question — Seven County Infrastructure Coalition v. Eagle County, Colorado — concerns an 88-mile railroad proposed to connect the Uinta Basin in eastern Utah to the national freight rail network. In 2021, the Surface Transportation Board, a federal agency that regulates railroads, approved the project after completing a roughly 3,600-page study of the railroad’s potential environmental impact.

Almost immediately, environmental groups argued that the board’s study did not go far enough. The ground beneath the Uinta Basin is rich in a waxy and particularly carbon-intensive crude oil; right now, very little of that oil is extracted because the only way to get it out is by truck, along windy mountain roads. The railroad, if built, would allow for much larger volumes of crude to be transported out of the basin and sent to Gulf Coast refineries. Building the railroad, in other words, would indirectly increase local oil extraction, and thereby raise global greenhouse gas emissions.

The board argued that its NEPA study did not need to consider these downstream effects because the board itself does not regulate oil extraction — that is, it regulates the building of railroads, not what gets moved on them.

The eight justices agreed that the board was right: It didn’t have to consider the effects of second-order oil drilling when it approved the railroad. (The railroad remains on hold for other reasons, Sambhav Sankar, a senior vice president at Earthjustice, told me.) But by going further in his ruling, Kavanaugh entered into a running debate about the role of NEPA and other permitting laws in the American economy.

NEPA was never meant to play the commanding role that it does today, Kavanaugh writes. When it was first signed into law in 1970, NEPA was meant to act as a “purely procedural” check on federal decision-making. Agencies were supposed to conduct environmental studies, make their decisions, then move on. But in a famous 1971 ruling concerning a proposed nuclear power plant in Maryland, Judge Skelly Wright of the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals transformed the law. He found that agencies had to carry out NEPA’s procedural requirements “to the fullest extent possible,” and crucially that courts could reject agencies’ analysis for lack of completeness.

Over the years, as hundreds of cases following Wright’s have added up, NEPA has turned into a “fearsome project killer,” Bagley said. Agencies spend decades of person-power and hundreds of thousands of dollars to prepare fastidious environmental reviews of their decisions. Any new infrastructure project or new policy change — even New York City’s congestion charge — requires some form of NEPA study.

Many conservatives have long opposed the modern NEPA process. But in recent years, some liberals have joined them, arguing that the law primarily slows down clean energy infrastructure and encourages NIMBYism. In practice, they say, NEPA acts as more of hindrance to the clean economy than the old fossil fuel economy: Because of a 2005 law, most oil and gas drilling has been exempt from the NEPA process, while wind farms, solar plants, and other forms of zero-carbon energy infrastructure still have to face it. Environmental groups rebut that the law is a useful tool to slow down fossil fuel pipelines, which do not generally get a NEPA exemption.

Data supports the idea that NEPA holds back clean energy projects, but that is partly because it holds back so many kinds of projects. The R Street Institute, a center-right think tank, has found that 42% of projects stalled by NEPA involved green infrastructure or conservation. Another analysis from the Center for Growth and Opportunity at Utah State University found that it takes more than two years on average for federal agencies to complete environmental reviews of solar and wind projects. Reviews for new hydroelectric or nuclear power plants take even longer.

Kavanaugh, in essence, rejects all of this. NEPA was never supposed to block or hinder large-scale energy or infrastructure projects, he writes; it was meant to “inform agency decision-making, not to paralyze it.”

“A 1970 legislative acorn has grown over the years into a judicial oak that has hindered infrastructure development ‘under the guise’ of just a little more process,” he says. When federal agencies write environmental studies under NEPA, courts should broadly defer to the decisions that they make. And even if an agency gets something wrong in its study or omits something important, that does not mean the entire study — and the decision that it justifies — should be thrown out. (There’s some irony to Kavanaugh’s call for deference to agencies here, given that the Supreme Court rejected the idea that agency regulations deserve deference last year.)

“What’s notable for me is that they didn’t just rule on the case,” Sankar, the Earthjustice lawyer told me. (Earthjustice participated in the case.) “They decided to take a broad swipe at NEPA itself, really unnecessarily.”

Alexander Mechanick, a senior policy analyst at the Niskanen Center and former White House regulatory lawyer, agreed with Sankar about the scope of the ruling. The court’s decision “does communicate over and over again, with a heavy hand, a real desire to get lower courts out of the business of fly specking the environmental impact assessments,” he told me.

It’s this forthrightness that seems to announce a new era of NEPA jurisprudence — one where the courts will accept a level of environmental review that they may have once rejected. In a way, Kavanaugh’s ruling is a fitting sequel to Wright’s 1971 decision in that both set the tone and capture the overarching environmental concerns of their respective eras, Bagley said.

Half a century ago, Judge Wright wanted to make sure that the American public could slow the wave of infrastructure that threatened to overwhelm the country’s landscape. NEPA represented “the commitment of the government to control, at long last, the destructive engine of material ‘progress,’” he wrote, asserting that judges must make sure the law’s goals are not “lost or misdirected in the vast hallways of the federal bureaucracy.”

Now, Kavanaugh seems to fear that progress itself has been held up. He writes that the modern NEPA process, with its cycles of “speculation and consultation and estimation and litigation,” has slowed down infrastructure projects and driven up their cost. He can sound more like an op-ed writer than a legal scholar as he lays out the law’s consequences in the ruling:

Fewer projects make it to the finish line. Indeed, fewer projects make it to the starting line. Those that survive often end up costing much more than is anticipated or necessary, both for the agency preparing the EIS and for the builder of the project. And that in turn means fewer and more expensive railroads, airports, wind turbines, transmission lines, dams, housing developments, highways, bridges, subways, stadiums, arenas, data centers, and the like. And that also means fewer jobs, as new projects become difficult to finance and build in a timely fashion.

In this declaration, Kavanaugh seems to put himself on the side of a growing and tenuously bipartisan movement to reform NEPA. A 2023 debt ceiling bill, signed by President Biden, included modest reforms to the NEPA process, imposing page limits and deadlines on the strictest forms of environmental studies. A more sweeping bipartisan effort to change the law failed last year. Now, House Republicans are taking their own crack at revising NEPA, creating an optional and more expensive permitting “fast track” for developers in the reconciliation bill.

Sankar, whose organization has championed NEPA, argues that the ruling’s practical upshot will be to allow the Trump administration greater leeway to build fossil fuel infrastructure. Kavanaugh’s ruling exhibits “a shocking disregard for the realpolitik of what's going on with this administration in particular,” he said.

“As we’ve been saying all along, NEPA gets demonized as the problem,” Sankar said. With the law’s role reduced, “I think people will see that there are a lot of other things that are the problem here, and taking federal agency expertise out of the equation is not going to hurry things up.” He added that state and local governments often rely on federal NEPA reports for their own analyses, and now those reviews may be less trustworthy.

Bagley, who has generally supported permitting reform efforts, agreed that NEPA is just one of several laws holding back clean energy projects nationwide. But it is an important one, he said, and reducing its scope will likely allow more projects to happen. He added that by changing it, advocates will learn of additional bottlenecks that are holding back construction — including laws that nobody has noticed yet because they were previously less important than NEPA. Advocates can also now focus their attention on state and local barriers to building.

“If you want to look at the permitting burdens across the United States, probably 80% to 90% of them are state and local. This [ruling] isn’t going to inaugurate a new era of American dynamism,” Bagley said. “It’s a small step in the right direction.”

Most of the cancelled projects were part of the Industrial Demonstration Program, which was created by the Inflation Reduction Act and designed to help commercialize decarbonization solutions that were past the early experimental stage, but were also not quite ready for mass deployment.

Proponents of the program found the DOE’s decision outrageous. “They’re not building an economy — they’re dismantling it and giving away the future of manufacturing,” Evan Gillespie, a partner at the advocacy group Industrious Labs, said in a statement. Canceling these projects is “handing the competitive advantage to Europe, China, Canada, and other nations that are making significant investments in clean manufacturing while leaving the U.S behind,” he added.

The Kraft Heinz Food Company, for example, was supposed to get $172 million to swap out fossil fuel-fired boilers and other heating equipment for electric heat pumps and solar thermal systems at 10 of its factories. “This project seeks to help a major American brand achieve deep decarbonization and serve as an example for other U.S. food and beverage companies to reduce emissions from process heat while reducing energy costs,” the original award from the DOE said. Diageo, the liquor conglomerate, and Kohler, the kitchen and bathroom appliance brand, were also among the awardees.

Cement production is one of the biggest sources of industrial emissions in the world, and also among the most difficult to decarbonize due to an integral chemical reaction that releases carbon into the atmosphere regardless of whether the plant burns fossil fuels. Experts aren’t sure yet what the best solution will be, and the DOE program awarded a variety of projects to test different pathways.

Heidelberg Materials, one of the largest cement companies in the world, was going to get $500 million to demonstrate the first cement plant to capture and sequester its carbon emissions in the U.S. A company called Sublime Systems that’s using an alternative chemistry and electric currents to make cement was supposed to receive $87 million to build its first commercial-scale factory in Holyoke, Massachusetts. Just last week, Sublime signed a deal to supply 623,000 metric tons of zero-carbon cement to Microsoft, in part to support the tech giant’s data center buildout. Another company called Brimstone was awarded $189 million to produce low-carbon cement alongside alumina, the base material used to make aluminum.

“Given our project's strong alignment with President Trump's priority to increase U.S. production of critical minerals, we believe this was a misunderstanding,” a spokesperson for Brimstone told me. “Brimstone's Rock Refinery represents the only economically viable way to produce the critical mineral alumina in the U.S. from U.S.-mined rocks. As the first U.S.-based alumina plant in a generation, our project — which would also make Portland cement — would clear a 'mine-to-metal' path for U.S. aluminum production, fortifying the U.S. critical mineral supply chain and creating thousands of jobs.”

Sublime also shared a statement asserting that its technology would enable the Trump administration’s priorities. “We continue our bipartisan appeal to leaders who recognize that investing in American-invented breakthrough industrial technologies can address multiple policy priorities in tandem to the benefit of Americans from all walks of life,” Sublime said. The company added that it has “prepared for the possibility of this disappointing outcome” and is “evaluating various scenarios that leave our scale-up unimpeded.”

Oil and gas companies were also hit. A $332 million grant to help Exxon switch to low-carbon hydrogen at one of its refineries was canceled, as were $540 million in grants for the energy company Calpine to install carbon capture on its natural gas plants.

“It is hugely disappointing to see these projects canceled — projects that had already progressed through a rigorous, months-long review process by technical experts at DOE,” Jessie Stolark, the executive director of the Carbon Capture Coalition, said in a statement. While Wright said the terminations would generate taxpayer savings, Stolark argued they were depriving Americans of economic benefits. “Every dollar invested by the American taxpayer can lead to up to $4 in economic output through additional supply and material orders, job creation, and broader economic benefits to regional economies,” she wrote, citing a Department of Energy-authored analysis.

None of the awardees responded to my inquiry as to whether they would consider pursuing legal challenges. According to the law under which the program was created, the funding was to be awarded “on a competitive basis,” based on the expected greenhouse gas emission reductions from the project and its potential to provide the greatest benefit to the greatest number of people. Additional criteria in the agency’s application process said it would evaluate projects based on the “degree to which the applicant assesses and demonstrates potential market competitiveness and sustainability for the proposed project, technology, and manufactured product(s) through market analysis and offtake agreements.”

Notably absent from the list of canceled projects is a grant for the steelmaking company Cleveland Cliffs. Earlier this month, I reported that the company was renegotiating its award under the Industrial Demonstration Program. On an earnings call, its CEO said it was abandoning plans to use clean energy and instead looking to use the funds to extend the life of its fossil fuel-fired blast furnace.

If gone unchallenged, the funding is not likely to be re-awarded to other projects. The budget bill that is currently working its way through Congress would rescind any money from the Industrial Demonstrations Program that isn’t under contract.

He’s obviously not the first to realize this. DAC companies and their scientists are well aware of the challenges they face. But investors are generally comfortable taking on risk across a host of different technologies and industries on the premise that at least a few of their portfolio companies will hit it big. As such, a nascent market and challenging physics are not inherent reasons to steer clear. DAC’s potential to secure cash-rich oil and gas industry buyers is pure upside.

Most prominent climate tech venture capital firms — including Lowercarbon Capital, Breakthrough Energy Ventures, Prelude Ventures, and Khosla Ventures — have at least one DAC company in their portfolios. At One Ventures itself has backed everything from producing oxygen on the moon (while also decarbonizing steel) to indoor solar cells and thorium-powered nuclear reactors, a hobbyhorse of techno-optimist nuclear bros and former presidential candidate Andrew Yang. So the fact that Chi won’t touch DAC is no small deal.

His hesitation stems from a matter of scale.To capture that 0.04% of atmospheric carbon, many DAC companies use giant fans to pull in large volumes of air from the atmosphere, which then pass through either a solid filter or a liquid solution that chemically captures the carbon dioxide. Although some companies are pursuing alternate approaches that rely on passive air contact rather than energy-intensive fans, either way, the amount of air that reaches any DAC machine’s so-called “collection aperture” is minuscule “relative to the scale of planet Earth,” Chi told me.

He views this as the core pitfall of the technology. “Half of the [operating expense] of the system is just trying to go after a technical disadvantage that you took on from day one,” Chi said. “By comparison, nature based restorations have enormous apertures,” Chi told me. “Think about the aperture of all the forests on the planet. Think about the aperture of all the soils on the planet, all the wetlands on the planet, the ocean.” His preferred methods of carbon removal are all nature-based. “In addition, their sequestration tends to be photosynthesis-powered, which means we’re not burning natural gas or using grid electricity in order to go make that thing work.”

Nature-based solutions often raise eyebrows in the carbon removal and reduction space, though, bringing to mind highly questionable carbon offsets such as those earned via “avoided deforestation.” The inherent counterfactual — would these trees really have been cut down if we didn’t buy these credits? — is difficult to measure with any certainty, and a 2023 investigation by The Guardian found that the majority of these types of credits are essentially bogus.

This same essential question around measurability plagues everything from afforestation and reforestation to soil carbon sequestration, biochar application, and wetland restoration. It’s extremely difficult to measure how much carbon is stored — and for how long — within complex, open ecosystems. On the other hand, engineered solutions such as direct air capture or bioenergy with carbon capture and storage are simple to quantify and promise permanent storage, making them attractive to large corporate buyers and easy to incentivize via mechanisms such as the federal carbon sequestration tax credit.

When I put all this to Chi, his response was simple. “It’s not an advantage to be able to measure something that can’t solve the problem,” he told me. For a moment, it seemed as if we had hit an intellectual dead end. For now, carbon removals and reductions are mainly driven by the voluntary carbon market, where prices are based on the exact tonnage of carbon removed. Reputable buyers don’t want to be burned again by investing in difficult to quantify offsets, and the current administration certainly doesn’t seem likely to step in with nature-based removal mandates or purchasing commitments anytime soon.

Chi’s answer to this conundrum is “financial enclosure,” essentially a fancy way of saying we need to monetize the value of nature-based systems. In many cases, he admitted, we don’t quite yet know how to do that, at least in a way that benefits the common good. “We figured out how to financially enclose a forest, clear cut it in order to go make board feed and paper and pulp,” he explained. But we don’t know how to financially enclose the benefit of preserving said forest, nor many other ecosystems such as wetlands that serve as highly effective carbon sinks.

At One Ventures has backed companies that work with a variety of buyers — from national governments to mining companies and farmers — that have a financial stake in (or are legally required to care about) ecosystem preservation and restoration. “Sometimes people break nature hard enough that it becomes that obvious. And then they have to go fix it,” Chi told me. “We’re going to invest in the companies that make it possible to go do that at incredibly low cost structures.”

One portfolio company, Dendra Systems, uses robots, drones, and other automated methods to do large scale ecosystem restoration, such as replanting mangroves in parts of the world such as Myanmar and Abu Dhabi where they’ve been cleared for property development or industrial use. The governments of both countries are paying Dendra to do this after realizing that removing mangroves had catastrophic consequences —- destroying subsistence fishing, wrecking erosion breaks — that would cost more to ameliorate than simply replanting the trees.

Then there’s Dalan Animal Health, which is developing vaccines for honeybees as hives become more vulnerable to disease. While not directly focused on carbon removal, the company has successfully “financially enclosed” pollination, as industrial farmers whose crops depend on pollinators will pay for the vaccine. This helps restore healthy ecosystems that can ultimately draw down more carbon. Chi told me that insurance companies have also shown a willingness to pay for nature-based solutions that can help lessen the impact of disasters such as floods or hurricanes.

While the carbon benefits of these companies are simply a bonus, the firm has invested in one pure play removal company, Gigablue. This startup releases engineered particles into the ocean that attract carbon-absorbing phytoplankton. As the particles accumulate more plankton, they sink to the ocean floor, where the carbon is then stored. Using onsite sampling and other advanced techniques, Chi told me that this tech is “very measurable” while also having an “aperture [that] is as wide as the ocean area that we’ve sprinkled things onto.”

Though Chi dislikes the illogical nature of the voluntary carbon market — he would much prefer a “polluter pays” system where money is directed towards nature-based sequestration — he knows that with the markets we have, precise measurability is paramount. So At One Ventures is throwing money at this, too. Portfolio company Chloris Geospatial combines satellite data and machine learning to measure biomass from space and track changes over time, helping legitimize forest-based removals. And Miraterra is focused on novel sensing tech and advanced modeling that allows farmers to calculate the amount of carbon in their soil.

But even if the carbon stored in natural ecosystems never becomes quite as measurable as engineered carbon removals, Chi thinks investors, companies, or governments should still be going all in. “When your volume is so much larger, then you can even throw big error bars around your measurability and still be miles ahead,” he told me.

Many investors say they want it all. You’ll see them funding nature-based and engineered carbon removal companies alike in an effort to take a “portfolio approach” to carbon removal. Chi, unsurprisingly, thinks that’s hogwash. “It’s weasel words to be like, it’s an important part of this portfolio,” he told me. The United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change also advocates for a diversified approach, without saying DAC itself is strictly necessary. DAC is “not going to do 1%, and it’s going to be massively more expensive than your other 99%,” Chi said. “At some point you’re going to be like, why is this in the portfolio?”

It’s certainly a more blunt assessment of the industry’s viability (or lack thereof) than I’ve heard any investor hazard before. But there may be more folks starting to come around to Chi’s perspective. With government support for DAC in question and the utility of carbon capture tax credits — which only benefit engineered removals — deeply threatened, venture funding for DAC is down over 60% from this time last year, Bloomberg reported.

Rajesh Swaminathan, a climate tech investor at Khosla Ventures told the publication that while many investors have taken bets on direct air capture, “Now, people are stepping back and saying, ‘Why didn’t I look at the economics there?’” Khosla itself is an investor in the DAC company Spiritus.

So what’s a longterm skeptic like Chi to do in this moment of doubt? As he told me, “I’m just going to keep on giving talks on it, and I know that physics is on my side.”",https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81OTgwNjYwMS9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc2ODQ3Mjc1Nn0.vfqr1uzX4ulM_uSBkkrgvJsN9jfuRvw0UzE29xz-H-s/image.jpg?width=1200&height=600&coordinates=0%2C100%2C0%2C100,N,,2025-06-02 08:05:47.725378

As nations double down on bioeconomy investments, a coordinated, international approach will be essential to harnessing biomanufacturing’s potential and ensuring a resilient future.

The industrial application of biotechnology to produce a huge variety of products – ranging from food ingredients to speciality chemicals and advanced biomaterials – could accelerate the transition to a more resource-efficient, resilient global economy. It’s estimated that up to 60% of the physical inputs to the global economy could, in principle, be produced biologically, offering a transformative opportunity to reshape industrial production.

But, to realize the full potential of a bio-based economy, bioindustrial manufacturing must scale significantly. Bioproducts targeting mainstream applications, like fermented ingredients, still face challenges in achieving the unit economics necessary for widespread adoption. To bring down costs and increase output, major investments are needed to improve microbial fermentation processes, develop next-generation bioproduction technologies and build out regional biomanufacturing capacity.

In a world marked by supply chain shocks, trade disputes and global health threats, biomanufacturing is more than an economic opportunity – it’s a strategic imperative.

Governments around the world are increasingly recognizing this imperative. Countries such as the United States, the United Kingdom, China and India are ramping up national bioeconomy strategies that offer targeted support for domestic biomanufacturing. These include investments in R&D infrastructure, bioprocessing facilities, workforce development and regulatory streamlining. Such efforts aim to accelerate commercialization and to ensure that essential bioproducts can be reliably produced at home, buffering economies against international disruptions.

The industries primed for a bioindustrial revolution

1. Food

Traditional agricultural systems are deeply intertwined with global trade, making them vulnerable to both biological threats and geopolitical instability. The recent rapid spread of highly pathogenic avian influenza, which has affected over 169 million poultry worldwide, drove egg prices to record highs and exposed the fragility of supply chains. When coupled with trade disruptions, these effects can magnify into issues of national food security.

Biomanufacturing addresses this risk by enabling the domestic production of key food components like ovalbumin – the main protein in egg whites – using precision fermentation. Engineered microbes generate these proteins in bioreactors, offering a scalable, disease-resilient complement to traditional animal agriculture. This approach strengthens food security and provides a more stable foundation for food systems in the face of future disruptions.

2. Chemicals

Global chemical supply chains are exposed to geopolitical risk, largely due to the concentration of chemical production in a few key regions, including Germany, China and the Middle East. The reliance on cross-border transport to access critical materials heightens the risk of disruption, with the potential to impact entire manufacturing ecosystems. Biomanufacturing provides a compelling bio-solution: engineered microorganisms can be used to produce specialty chemicals at scale. This offers a path to domestic self-sufficiency in chemical manufacturing, reducing dependency on volatile international trade routes.

3. Critical minerals

The demand for lithium, cobalt and rare earth elements is skyrocketing, driven by the clean energy transition and the expansion of electric vehicles, batteries and modern electronics. Yet, extraction and refining of these minerals is concentrated in a handful of countries, often under geopolitical risk. Through biomining – an advanced mineral recovery technique that uses engineered microbes to extract metals from low-grade ores or mining waste – countries can produce these critical minerals more efficiently than traditional methods. By investing in domestic biomining capacity, nations can diversify their mineral sourcing and insulate key industries from external shocks.

In conclusion, biomanufacturing is emerging as a cornerstone of the global economy at a time of increased focus on building more resilient and diversified supply chains. As nations double down on bioeconomy investments, a coordinated, international approach – bolstered by public-private collaboration – will be essential to harnessing biomanufacturing’s full potential and ensuring a resilient future for all.",https://assets.weforum.org/article/image/responsive_large_r9ZvhUEmKFXgOpY2AUrrPG-ZwZ_C4FwiXKQtGbJxZyE.jpg,N,,2025-06-02 08:05:52.834636

Tariffs in Motion

Trump’s trade war is starting to bring to mind the boxing style of Muhammad Ali, who used unconventional stances and swift dodges to make opponents hit nothing but air.

That admittedly imperfect comparison comes up because once again the president has turned a tariff policy into a moving target.

Earlier this year Trump’s tactic was to impose and then pause. Now he has landed a surprise hit on the global steel and aluminum industry, declaring that a 25% tariff is about to go up to 50%. Read More

As for the tariffs Trump levied on China, what had seemed to be a move toward top-level bilateral negotiation may not be going that way just yet.

China is accusing the US of violating their existing trade deal — specifically mentioning AI chip export controls and the revocation of student visas — and says it will defend its interests. Read More

‘Administrative Errors': A federal appeals panel ordered officials not to deport a 31-year-old to El Salvador. Minutes later, it happened anyway, the New York Times reports.

The government had previously given the court what the judges called “express assurance” that it would not schedule a deportation for that migrant until the next day.

Showing the Receipts: ProPublica and the Texas Tribune cast a wide net in search of criminal records of the Venezuelan migrants deported to a maximum-security prison in El Salvador.

Their conclusion: the US government’s own data shows that officials knew that only 32 of the 238 deportees had been convicted of U.S. crimes and that most were nonviolent offenses, such as retail theft or traffic violations.

The response from White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson: “ProPublica should be embarrassed that they are doing the bidding of criminal illegal aliens who are a threat.”

How Well Do You Know Washington?

Each senator has the power to launch surgical strikes on that chamber’s version of the “big beautiful” tax-debt limit-spending cuts legislation.

They can do that by formally objecting on the Senate floor to anything unrelated to raising or spending money, such as the 10-year ban on states regulating artificial intelligence and limiting enforcement of judicial contempt citations — provisions that made it into the House-passed version (H.R. 1).

This week’s mini quiz: What’s the Capitol Hill shorthand for the power to raise that kind of objection?

When States Say No Thanks

More power isn’t an enticing prospect for states that don’t see an easy way to take over the care of battlefields, historical parks, and protected areas — a possibility that’s wrapped into the White House’s cost-cutting proposal for the National Park Service.

Of all the federal land managed by the Park Service, 63 have “national park” in their name and roughly 370 are called something else, Bobby Magill reports. To achieve the proposed $900 million cut from park operations, about 350 of those monuments, historic sites, and other protected areas would have to be offloaded, according to the National Parks Conservation Association.

Such moves would raise legal questions as well as the possibility of future generations missing out as states close sites with which they can’t afford to keep up. Read More

Did You Ace the Quiz?

The correct response is Option B – the Byrd Rule, named after its chief backer, the late Sen. Robert Byrd (D-W.Va.), known for his parliamentary procedure expertise. Give yourself a bonus point if you know where to look up the Byrd Rule: Section 313 of the Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974 (Public Law 93-344.)

When legislation advances under the fast-track reconciliation process, Byrd Rule guardrails require that all provisions change the level of federal spending, revenue, or the debt limit. Anything policy-focused with only incidental budgetary impact can be challenged on the floor. Then the Senate parliamentarian determines whether it’s on-point or extraneous.

Invalid language gets tossed out.

Lillianna Byington reports that even before the House voted, Senate Majority Leader John Thune (R-S.D.) was talking about complying with the Byrd Rule. “There’s a lot of pre-Byrd work that’s been done, but there will still have to be some scrubbing,” he said before the Memorial Day recess.

It’ll take at least a couple weeks to get a reconciliation bill (or bills) ready for the Senate floor. When the legislation comes up, Democrats from Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) on down say they’ll be ready to raise multiple Byrd Rule points of order. When you hear mentions of a Byrd bath, that’s what they’re talking about.

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is transforming the energy sector. From detecting faults in infrastructure before they happen, to improving the way power flows across the grid, AI is becoming an essential tool for power utilities transitioning to smarter and more sustainable energy system operations.

Unlocking efficiency gains for power utilities

AI and machine learning can already unlock significant operational benefits for power utilities. For example:

Detecting non-technical losses, such as electricity theft, using anomaly detection models.

Supporting faster connection assessments by analysing connection request patterns and automating some of the assessment processes.

Optimising maintenance schedules based on asset condition and usage, not just calendar dates.

These applications of AI have the potential to save our clients time, reduce costs, and increase reliability across their networks. Ricardo is already supporting organisations, including UK DNOs, to do just this.

AI in action

One of the biggest opportunities lies in how we maintain our energy infrastructure. Extreme weather, particularly heatwaves, can cause a spike in faults across power systems. But what if we could predict where and when those failures are likely to happen?

In a recent project for the Department for Energy Security and Net Zero (DESNZ), Ricardo developed a machine learning model to do just that. By analysing historical fault and weather data, an AI algorithm was trained to spot patterns between temperature spikes and asset failures.

Our approach

We used the National Fault and Interruption Scheme (NaFIRS) dataset, which records faults reported by Distribution Network Operators (DNOs) from 2018 to 2022, alongside historical UK temperature data. We established the relationship between temperature and fault rates using supervised machine learning (specifically, Extreme Gradient Boosting or XGBoost), looking at a range of factors including maximum daily temperature, minimum daily temperature, and daily rainfall.

The results

This resulted in a predictive model that forecasts fault risk during heatwaves with reasonable accuracy – giving network operators valuable time to prepare and respond. This is illustrated in the figure below, showing fault prediction results at low voltage.

Key lessons learned:

We learned important lessons along the way to improve the accuracy and reliability of such predictive models going forward:

The accuracy of the predictive models increases not just with the size of the dataset, but also and more significantly with its locational granularity and precision. Specifically, the closer and the more central the temperature sensor to the fault area, the easier it was to establish a relationship between fault occurrence and ambient temperature. Predictive AI models such as this one would benefit from tapping onto more localised temperature measurements, including at substations, for example.

Although we initially relied on one single dataset (REMIT, i.e. self-reported faults data from generation, transmission and consumption units in the GB wholesale market) we quickly established this was not sufficient. Expanding to more datasets including those privately recorded by distribution network operators was lengthy but instrumental in achieving better performance for the predictive AI model. Collaboration and partnerships between power utilities to pool historical dataset and thereby increase the accuracy of predictive models used by all would undoubtedly bring mutual benefits.

Benefits for power utilities

Overall, such an approach enables smarter maintenance, improves system resilience and ultimately helps to keep the lights on during some of the most challenging conditions caused by climate change.

The future of AI

AI is set to play an even more significant role going forward. Emerging techniques such as deep reinforcement learning, federated learning, and digital twins have significant potential to transform not just the digital tools used by power utilities, but their operating model altogether.

Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) is a branch of artificial intelligence where algorithms learn to make decisions by interacting with an environment and receiving feedback in the form of rewards or penalties, using deep neural networks to handle complex input data. DRL can be applied to optimize real-time grid operations, such as balancing electricity supply and demand or integrating renewable energy sources efficiently.

Federated learning is a machine learning approach that enables model training across multiple decentralised devices or servers while keeping data localised, thus preserving privacy and security. Federated learning could allow power companies to collaboratively develop accurate forecasting models or detect faults using data from multiple locations without sharing sensitive information.

Digital twins are virtual models of physical systems or assets that are continuously updated with real-time data, allowing for simulation, analysis, and optimisation. Digital twins enable utilities to simulate and predict the behaviour of the grid under various conditions including in real-time conditions, test new approaches and technologies including virtual power plants, and proactively address maintenance needs or system failures, thereby improving reliability and resilience.

Why Ricardo?

Our strength lies in combining deep technical expertise with a systems-thinking approach to sustainable energy solutions. We not only understand how AI tools can benefit the power system, but how they can help to solve our clients’ challenges in the wider transition. We bring together specialists in data science, energy systems, digital infrastructure and regulation, and tailor our expertise towards supporting our clients’ goals.

That tight timeline could be bad news for lawmakers and lobby groups wanting major changes, including energy companies eager to ease aggressive tax credit rollbacks in the House-passed “Big Beautiful Bill Act.”

Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) proved naysayers wrong when he helped convince the vast majority of his caucus to support the tax cut, energy and border spending megabill, with assistance from President Donald Trump. Now, he wants the Senate to keep changes limited.

“I’ve encouraged them to do as little reworking as possible because we have a very delicate balance that we’ve maintained in the House and the Senate,” Johnson told Fox News. “We both have small majorities.”

But Senate Majority Leader John Thune (R-S.D.) recently said that “the Senate will have its imprint on it,” noting the House needs to get 218 votes while his chamber has to secure 51.

With Republicans coalescing around cutting back climate-related grants and increasing oil and gas drilling, the fate of Inflation Reduction Act tax credits will continue being a point of contention.

A new report spells bad news for renewable energy development. Companies canceled or delayed more than $14 billion in investments since January, jeopardizing thousands of jobs, according to the group E2.

“This so-called ‘big, beautiful bill’ is nothing short of a big, bad blow to America’s clean energy economy and a huge amount [of] jobs across the country,” Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) said at an event in New York last week.

“It’s a job killer, a cost raiser and a giveaway to Big Oil billionaires — all at the expense of workers and American families.”

Schumer on Sunday released a letter to colleagues against what he called the “One Ugly Bill,” touting increased collaboration with House Democrats and plans to challenge provisions before the Senate parliamentarian, who decides what can pass by simple majority under the budget reconciliation process.

The legislation also includes provisions to accelerate National Environmental Policy Act reviews and natural gas project approvals, plus new fees on electric vehicles and hybrids.

Here are six things to watch:

Lobbying will intensify

Some renewable energy lobbyists say they have been saving their firepower for the Senate, where they may get more traction than in the House.

Still, it’s far from certain they will get much more. After all, more then 20 House lawmakers at one point said they wanted to keep at least some IRA credits.

Advocates did get a boost last week when Elon Musk — who just wrapped up his special government assignment — amplified a social media post from Tesla saying, “Abruptly ending the energy tax credits would threaten America’s energy independence and the reliability of our grid.”

It was something of a 180 for the world’s richest man — Tesla’s CEO — who had previously called for ending all federal subsidies. Musk also pointed out that credits benefiting fossil fuels would not be touched.

Abigail Ross Hopper, president of the Solar Energy Industries Association, seized on the newfound advocacy.

“Elon Musk and Tesla hit the nail on the head — the energy tax credits are critical to ensuring the U.S. has the power it needs to lead the world in AI and innovation,” she said in a statement.

“Rolling back credits for residential solar, utility-scale solar, and manufacturing would put our grid’s reliability at risk and dismantle one of the greatest industrial revivals in American history.”

She added, “We hope the Senate is listening.”

In recent weeks, Senate Finance Chair Mike Crapo (R-Idaho) has been meeting with lawmakers to gather input but has not been forthcoming about his plans.

Lobbyists have their eyes on a number of senators, including Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska), Thom Tillis (R-N.C.), John Curtis (R-Utah) and Jerry Moran (R-Kan.).

But others, like Cramer, have supported the House energy tax provisions, though he said he would prefer faster terminations of wind and solar incentives, calling them mature sectors.

“I think they did pretty well,” he said.

Will nuclear incentives get more generous?

Nuclear was the biggest energy winner of the House budget reconciliation package, meant to bypass the Senate filibuster, but that doesn’t mean the industry’s boosters are satisfied with the current picture.

Last-minute negotiations produced a generous carve-out for nuclear. Reactors that start construction by 2031 will continue qualifying for production tax credits. In contrast, other low-carbon energy generation like wind and solar would have to be built and plugged into the grid by 2028.

Still, nuclear advocates say the legislation’s allowances likely won’t be enough for next-generation reactors. Those technologies are a long way from becoming economically viable, and almost all of them won’t be constructed until well into the 2030s.

“You may have one or two of the leading projects be able to qualify with the new phase out dates, but in all likelihood, nothing will qualify,” said Alan Ahn, deputy director for nuclear at the center-left think tank Third Way.

Luckily for nuclear, the energy source can lean on powerful friends in the Senate, including Kevin Cramer of North Dakota and Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia, chair of the Environment and Public Works Committee.

“They definitely need more time than that,” Cramer told POLITICO about the timeline for nuclear energy tax incentives. “It’s too short for truly new technologies. We’ll have to change that. I don’t think it’s fair to treat an emerging technology the same as a 30-year-old technology.”

The industry is also pushing to preserve funding for the Department of Energy’s Loan Program Office, which is widely seen as the only lending body willing to fund nuclear projects.

The House bill would claw back “the unobligated balance” of IRA funding for the Loans Program Office. But Energy Secretary Chris Wright has urged lawmakers to protect the money.

Michael Flannigan, vice president of government affairs at the Nuclear Energy Institute, said, “Our attention now turns to the Senate where [we] will work to secure the tax credits and protect federal programs like the Department of Energy Loan Programs Office authority necessary to usher in the next generation of nuclear technologies.”

Is 45V done?

Despite the currently bleak picture for renewables like wind and solar, it was actually hydrogen that received the worst deal from House reconciliation legislation.

The bill would completely eliminate a generous hydrogen-specific production credit for any projects that don’t begin construction by the end of the year, a tall task for an industry that is widely seen as still in its infancy.

“It’s gonna be trying to get from 2025 to the full 2031 phase-out date and defend why that was a good thing in the first place,” said Frank Wolak, president of the Fuel Cell and Hydrogen Energy Association. “It’s challenging times, but it’s not game over, and there’s good optimism the Senate will make these changes.”

Capito has been a defender of the hydrogen industry and has specifically advocated for a broadening the hydrogen credit in the past under the Biden administration. Many Republicans have hydrogen projects in their states, including Sens. Bill Cassidy of Louisiana and John Cornyn of Texas.

Still, hydrogen hasn’t received the same level of support from Republicans on energy sources like nuclear. If the Senate doesn’t make any changes to the House hydrogen provision, the nascent industry will be in a tough spot going forward.

“The industry stalls under the current picture, it’s pretty simple,” Wolak said. “The U.S. is going to vacate the playing field and the Chinese and Europeans are going to kind of fill whatever gaps there are in technology.”

Foreign entity rules

Renewable energy lobbyists have for weeks argued the House bill’s changes to supply chain requirements — known as the Foreign Entity of Concern (FEOC) provisions — are “unworkable.”

Last week, a group of battery and critical minerals advocates said while they supported barring China and other adversaries from gaining access to government incentives, the House-passed mandates are “prohibitive and confusing.”

Observers suspected House Republicans intentionally made the FEOC policies so restrictive to render the climate law credits unusable even faster.

“The Foreign Entities of Concern (FEOC) requirements in the bill are overly restrictive, effectively serving as a repeal,” said a statement from the Battery Materials & Technology Coalition, American Critical Minerals Association and the Battery Advocacy for Technology Transformation group.

“In addition, implementing these requirements at the IRS would be nearly impossible and at the very least require additional agency resources to enforce.”

But rewriting the FEOC provisions would not amount to an easy fix, industry observers noted. And what’s more, manufacturers trying to access a scaled-back 45X manufacturing credit would be hurt by the aggressive phase-downs of other incentives.

“You can make all the manufacturing here in the U.S., but if there’s no market to sell it to, there’s no credit,” said a solar advocate granted anonymity to speak candidly. “You saved 45X in name only.”

Will public land sales reappear?

Public lands sales are out of the budget reconciliation bill — for now. But Republicans in the Senate could still add them back in if there’s political will to do so.

Energy and Natural Resources Chair Mike Lee (R-Utah.) is a longtime fan of land sales. Lee told POLITICO’s E&E News that he thought provisions in the initial House bill were “great.”

Other senators, too, have said land sales were at least being discussed in the upper chamber as an offset for the legislation’s price tag. Even so, the proposition would likely run into the same problems that killed it in the House.

Sen. Steve Daines (R-Mont.) is staunchly opposed to selling off bits and pieces of the federal estate to pay for the megabill. With only a three-vote majority, Senate leadership likely won’t want to inject any additional uncertainty by selling public lands.

Other natural resources provisions are also likely to crop up in the Senate — namely, two Alaska sections that were scrapped from the House bill.

The House cut a provision to speed approval for the Ambler mining access road and language to ramp up drilling in Alaska’s National Petroleum Reserve. Leaders did so as a precaution against running afoul of Senate rules governing the budget reconciliation process.

But House Natural Resources Chair Bruce Westerman (R-Ark.) has been hopeful the measures will reemerge. That’s likely to happen, given that Alaska’s two senators are both proponents of more drilling in NPR-A and the Ambler project.

Will ‘REINS Act’ become law?

Senate hard-liners will also be working to get regulation-slashing provisions back into their version of the megabill.

Early iterations of the House’s reconciliation package would have targeted agencies’ rulemaking powers, giving Congress final approval over any “major rule that increases revenue” and expanding mechanisms for undoing existing rules.

But the deregulatory portion of the megabill, based on the “Regulations from the Executive In Need of Scrutiny (REINS) Act,” was cut just hours before the final House vote.

It was replaced with a blanket $100 million appropriation to the White House’s Office of Management and Budget to “pay expenses associated with improving regulatory processes and analyzing and reviewing rules issued by a covered agency.”

Lee, a fan of the “REINS Act,” said the last-minute change came from concerns about Senate rules surrounding the budget reconciliation process.

The House passed their bill with “placeholder” language, he said, so that Lee could re-insert deregulatory policies with language that will not run afoul of the Senate parliamentarian.

Lee spent the recess week speaking out on social media about his qualms with the megabill, saying it needs to be more forceful on spending cuts and reducing the size of the federal government. He said he is a “no” on the package, as of now.

“It isn’t yet as beautiful as it needs to be, but there’s still time to fix it,” Lee said of the bill during a podcast appearance last week. “The Senate version is going to be more aggressive.”",https://static.politico.com/dims4/default/55a1666/2147483647/resize/1200/quality/100/?url=https://static.politico.com/8e/7d/57c7c6e04918849f91e9bb628896/u-s-congress-13093.jpg,N,,2025-06-02 08:06:12.172492

From coal to solar in Navajo Nation

First-of-a-kind philanthropic funding

Mobilizing private capital for climate solutions from the Global South

Featured: Agents of Impact Podcast

Navajo Power is building a pipeline of utility-scale solar projects to model a just climate transition (podcast). A 750-megawatt solar project near the Painted Desert on Navajo Nation in Arizona is a model for a just climate transition. The project, led by Indigenous-owned and -led renewable energy Navajo Power, is based near the site of the Navajo Generating Station coal-fired power plant, which for 45 years generated power for Phoenix, Los Angeles and other cities. “The Navajo Nation was the battery for the Southwest,” Navajo Power’s founder and CEO Brett Isaac says on the latest Agents of Impact podcast on ImpactAlpha. The coal-fired plant’s closure in 2019 killed one of the biggest job providers on the Navajo Nation – and opened an opportunity for an economic reset. “Indigenous communities have the resource potential to site projects of the size and scale that we need,” Isaac explains. “There are not a lot of places in the country that can host [developments] like that and also have the auxiliary infrastructure – transmission lines and interconnection points – that would make them feasible.”

Community benefits. Navajo Power set out to leverage Indigenous communities’ abundant land and resources for green growth in the US, while ensuring those communities are finally able to make the call on how those resources are used, who benefits and how. The Painted Desert project is Navajo Power’s starting point for “utilizing the economic opportunities, investment and ownership to address social issues [like] high unemployment and access to infrastructure,” says Isaac (for background, see “Native-led Navajo Power leans into the just transition with community benefits and local jobs”).

Permits and approvals. It’s been a six-year journey to assemble not only the financing, but leases and approvals for the 4,500-acre project and, crucially, community support, including from dozens of grazing permit holders. Navajo Power has five projects in development, totaling more than two gigawatts, with four Tribal nations, representing about $4 billion in investment into those communities. Navajo Power has deployed about $25 million in concessionary debt and project development financing to date; it reached a $4 million first close in its Series A equity financing last December. Says Navajo Power’s COO Michael Cox, “This has never been done before by a private company. We’re carving the path.”

Dealflow: Catalytic Capital

Prime Coalition’s Trellis Climate raises capital for first-of-a-kind projects. Prime Coalition is looking to help meet the financing needs of climate tech startups on the brink of commercialization. Government funding cutbacks and a slowdown in climate tech investment have hampered companies building their first commercial plants, known as first-of-a-kind projects, or FOAKs, that don’t fit the venture capital funding model and are often deemed too risky for commercial infrastructure and debt investors. Trellis Climate, launched last year by the Boston-based nonprofit climate investor Prime Coalition, is stepping in with catalytic capital to help advance promising high-impact technologies. Prime says the impact-first, catalytic capital investment program has raised philanthropic capital from nearly two-dozen private foundations, donor-advised funds, family offices and other donors. Donors have the option to structure their contributions as recoverable grants or program-related investments extending philanthropic dollars by recycling capital when projects generate financial returns.

Made in California. Trellis has inked two deals this year, backing San Francisco-based Nitricity, which is developing a plant-based, climate-smart alternative to expensive and energy-intensive synthetic nitrogen fertilizer; and San Jose-based Tandem PV’s solar panels, which combine conventional silicon solar cells with thin-film perovskite layers for higher efficiency. Trellis backed Tandem’s $50 million Series A equity and debt round to finance a Silicon Valley demonstration plant. Trellis invested in Nitricity’s $10 million project financing round, also backed by Elemental Impact, for its California manufacturing facility that will produce organic nitrogen fertilizer using recycled almond shells and renewable energy.

SAEL Solar raises $132 million for a 300 megawatt solar plant in India. Indian developer of solar and agricultural waste-to-energy projects, SAEL Solar, has raised $132 million in debt from the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, French financial services group Societe Generale and New Development Bank, which serves “BRICS” nations. The funding will finance a 300-megawatt solar power plant in Andhra Pradesh state, which SAEL won with a competitive bid from the Solar Energy Corporation of India. The company secured $1 billion early last year from Norfund, Tata Cleantech, the US Development Finance Corporation and the Asian Development Bank to expand its solar and biomass projects.

Renewable energy uptick. India is building renewable energy generation capacity at a fast clip. It added nearly 30 gigawatts of energy to reach 220 gigawatts for the financial year of 2024 to 2025. Nearly half the growth was driven by solar; wind, bioenergy and small hydropower are picking up. Power generated from SAEL’s new plant will be sold to the solar energy corporation through a 25-year power purchase agreement. SAEL’s parent company SAEL Limited, and five subsidiaries last year raised $305 million from a US dollar-denominated green bond, which was oversubscribed by more than six times.

Signals: Climate Finance

Global Climate Finance Forum seeks to mobilize capital for locally-led solutions in the Global South. Call it the Montego Bay manifesto. In late April, a group of impact investors, policymakers and entrepreneurs gathered in Jamaica to map strategies for channeling private capital from the Global North to climate solutions in the Global South. In their sights: the COP30 global climate talks coming up in November in Belém, Brazil. The role of private capital will be even more urgent this year, with public funding, not to mention political leadership, for climate action in retreat in the US and around the globe. “The regions most vulnerable to climate shocks – yet where targeted investments could generate outsized benefits for communities and ecosystems – continue to be severely under-resourced in their climate efforts,” says Marilyn Waite of the Climate Finance Fund, a philanthropic fund is supported by the William and Flora Hewlett Foundation and hosted by the European Climate Foundation. That’s especially true, she said, for small businesses that operate in capital-scarce environments.

‘MoBay’ to Belém. Waite’s fund underwrote the inaugural Global Climate Finance Forum to workshop strategies for mobilizing private finance for climate-focused small- and mid-sized businesses, or SMEs, and develop an action plan for the COP30 proceedings. The three-day forum generated some three-dozen recommendations and commitments. Among them: tax incentives to encourage institutional and retail investors to invest in Global South-listed equities, bonds, and private funds, and a registry of investable climate-focused small businesses and regional aggregators to facilitate deals. Other ideas included piloting blended finance structures that pair local asset managers with Global North institutional investors, and addressing currency mismatch through fund-level innovations and cross-border learning. The ideas will inform a “Montego Bay Letter” to COP30 organizers that aims to elevate Global South SMEs in the talks.

Global majority. Jamaica was chosen as a location in part for its accessibility. Climate advocates from emerging markets now face even more onerous visa requirements for events in the US and, if they can get in, steep costs (disclosure: Climate Finance Fund picked up the cost of accommodations for attendees). Jamaica is visa-free for nearly 100 countries. “Global conversations should not happen in places the Global Majority cannot access,” says Waite. The 50 or so delegates to the form hailed from 17 countries, including Bangladesh, Brazil, China, India, Nepal and Rwanda, Trinidad, and Tobago. “SMEs are the engine of our economy and their role in climate action is pivotal,” said BRAC Bank’s Tashmeem Muntazir Chowdhury who attended from Bangladesh.

The Republican backed tax-package being considered in Congress includes provisions that would repeal clean energy tax credits that some say have been transformational for a state like Arizona. It's all part of the huge budget bill that looks to advance President Donald Trump's agenda on several issues and includes provisions that would phase out a number of clean energy tax investments passed because of the Biden era Inflation Reduction Act.

Christian Stumpf, director of external affairs of The Nature Conservancy, said billions of dollars and thousands of jobs in Arizona are in jeopardy.

""The IRA has truly been a catalyst for infrastructure investments across Arizona. We've really increased our state's leadership position in the clean energy economy and we are providing good paying jobs that are putting Arizonans to work. We just can't afford to let that go away,"" he explained.

Since the passage of clean energy investments in 2022, companies have announced dozens of clean energy projects and created over 13,000 jobs in rural and urban Arizona communities - many of which are 'red' districts. But some provisions in Trump's ""big, beautiful"" bill have sparked concerns among Republicans who feel the repealing of credits would negatively impact energy production and the economy. If changes are made in the Senate, the legislation will need to be passed by the U.S. House again.

While some Republicans in Congress have questioned the impacts of the IRA and have opposed it because they claim it would raise taxes without helping curb inflation, Stumpf said it has been ""nothing but a success so far,"" and encourages local elected officials to advocate for the clean energy investments that have been made possible.

""We're having really positive conversations on both sides of the aisle and we're hopeful that both sides can come to meaningful compromise. We are trying not to see this through a Republican or Democrat lens,"" he explained. ""We really think that there is a strong case to be made for economic vibrancy and supporting sustainable communities.""

The company has not yet confirmed the plant’s fate, though the likelihood of sustained operation seems slim. PV Tech has contacted Meyer Burger for confirmation of the plant’s future.

Taken together, the two German subsidiaries employ over 600 people: 331 at the Thalheim manufacturing plant and 289 in “mechanical engineering and technology development” in Hohenstein-Ernstthal, in Saxony.

Meyer Burger Switzerland – the company’s headquarters, in the city of Thun, which employs 60 people – and Meyer Burger Americas, which recently laid off all its staff, will apparently continue to exist as companies.

Meyer Burger also said it is requesting an extension of the deadline for its 2024 financial report, which was due on 31st May. It already asked for an extension earlier this year.

What’s left of Meyer Burger?

A slow decline which began last year accelerated into collapse last week. On Thursday, following sustained net losses over the first half of 2024, PV Tech reported that Meyer Burger had laid off employees at its module manufacturing facility in Goodyear, Arizona. The following day, the company confirmed the end of operations at the site and the termination of its US jobs.

With the insolvency of its German subsidiaries, and crucially the Thalheim cell production plant, Meyer Burger has a very small footprint remaining. With no employees at the US business (though it will remain in existence), the company may soon effectively just have its headquarters in Switzerland to its name.

Meyer Burger’s downfall reflects difficult solar manufacturing conditions in both the US and the EU. In recent months, uncertain tariff and trade policies, as well as the possible rollback of Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) incentives by the Trump administration, have made the future of US solar manufacturing uncertain, where until recently it was a favourable investment environment.

However, some see Meyer Burger’s loss as a specifically European problem. Former CEO of the company, Gunter Erfurt, said that the news of German insolvencies left him “shocked, deeply moved and very sad”.

In a post on LinkedIn, Erfurt said: “With great courage, energy and creative drive, a unique team from Saxony and Saxony-Anhalt has set out to rewrite an important European chapter: the reconstruction of its own, resilient solar industry.

“However, this courage and determination was once again countered by political hesitation in Berlin and Brussels. Despite widespread agreement in the solar industry, it has once again not been possible to effectively counter China’s market-distorting efforts for dominance in the solar industry with a clever industrial policy and to support the development of its own strong industry.

“At Meyer Burger, this led to the closure of what was then Europe’s largest solar module production facility – brand new, state-of-the-art, fully automated. All other European competitors also had to give up or take a break.”

The European Commission recently announced additions to its Net Zero Industry Act (NZIA) legislation to support domestic clean energy manufacturing, including solar PV.

Last week, the Commission confirmed that state renewables auctions must include “non-price criteria” for the equipment they procure, with a mandate for 30% of annual auction volumes to be met by “resilient” supply. The head of the European Solar Manufacturing Council (ESMC) called this a “major step forward” towards rebuilding European solar supply.

But the European industry is still floundering, with little meaningful solar manufacturing capacity. Meyer Burger’s cell and, formerly, module facilities in Germany had historically been a leading light of the European PV manufacturing industry; its collapse will be a blow.

It’s probably because federal incentives may be going away soon, and the price of the units is likely heading north.

Despite what the name suggests, heat pumps both cool and heat buildings by exchanging the air within a building with an outside source, such as the air, water, or ground. They have a strong track record of using less electricity than central cooling systems and window air conditioners, and they don’t directly burn fossil fuels like furnaces. Shipments of new heat pumps actually surpassed gas furnaces in 2022 as the leading source of heating and cooling systems. That popularity has been supercharged this year, as building owners are now rushing to install heat pumps out of concerns over the impact of tariffs on prices, as well as fears the federal tax incentives will sunset in the new bill being put forth in Washington, D.C., as WBJ Managing Editor Eric Casey reports in his “Cooler & warmer” story.

The version of President Donald Trump’s Big Beautiful Bill passed by the House of Representatives basically does away with clean energy incentives, including those supporting heat pump installation, as well as solar and battery storage, which is the fastest-growing source of electricity in the U.S. Given the damage this will do to thousands of small businesses and jobs, it feels like we’re shooting ourselves in the foot.

The U.S. Senate still has to take up the legislation, and the Senate would be wise to eschew the short-term thinking surrounding Trump’s anti-clean energy wave and consider the long-term impact of scuttling so many initiatives that have helped build this important sector, with the majority of those incentives going to Republican-leaning states. Our country will need to generate enormous amounts of energy over the next couple decades, and supporting clean energy projects is not only good for the economy and job growth, but also our long-term future.

Why this matters:

By leveraging biogenic sources of CO2 and modular designs, this technology could avoid use of coal-fed plants, especially in countries like China where most of today’s formates are produced. It also opens the door to new uses for CO2 that would otherwise be released into the atmosphere.

EVs will continue to be costly if battery prices, which are the largest expense of any electric car, continue to rise.
Prices for lithium-ion battery packs fell 20% in 2024, the largest drop since 2017, according to a study from the International Energy Agency (IEA).
Cheaper batteries mean cheaper EVs, and electric cars and trucks remain the main driver of battery demand.
According to the survey, China is also responsible for about half of the worldwide EV battery market, which is made up of LFP batteries.","The good news is that EVs get cheaper when batteries get cheaper. The bad news is that battery prices in China continue to decline more quickly than in the US.

Batteries are at the centre of the battle for a transportation system with zero emissions. EVs will continue to be costly if battery prices, which are the largest expense of any electric car, continue to rise. However, prices will drop if batteries can be produced or obtained locally and at a low cost.

With its Gigafactory in Nevada, Tesla was able to work this out early on. This is also the reason why automakers like Ford, Toyota, and General Motors are planning their own battery facilities, with differing degrees of success thus far.

Prices for lithium-ion battery packs fell 20% in 2024, the largest drop since 2017, according to a study from the International Energy Agency (IEA).

Cheaper batteries mean cheaper EVs, and electric cars and trucks remain the main driver of battery demand.

China’s price advantage is widening over the rest of the world.

However, there is some good news as all automakers, battery suppliers, and energy providers race towards that future: a recent study by the International Energy Agency (IEA) found that global prices for lithium-ion battery packs dropped 20% in 2024. Since 2017, that is the largest single price decrease.

This predicament can be attributed to heightened competition, greater supply, and rising demand. “Lithium prices, in particular, dropped nearly 20% in 2024, reaching similar prices to those at the end of 2015, despite lithium demand in 2024 being about six times bigger than in 2015,” claimed the paper.

Current surpluses are the cause of the cheap prices of essential minerals, which is excellent for EV costs now but may result in underinvestment later.

According to the survey, battery pack prices decreased across all markets. However, China saw the largest declines, which should come as no surprise. In terms of supply chain security and general technological advancement, that nation is far ahead in the battery race.

“China was responsible for 80% of global battery cell production in 2024, while the remainder was produced in the United States, the European Union, Korea and Japan,” according to the research. “The faster pace of battery cost reduction and innovation in China has been enabled by fierce competition that has driven down profit margins for most producers (though not all), at the same time as driving up manufacturing efficiency and yields, as well as access to a large, skilled workforce.”

It’s interesting to note that, although being much smaller than EV batteries, hybrid batteries are more costly, against popular belief. “The price of such components is spread across fewer battery cells, increasing the price per kilowatt-hour,” according to the research. “In 2024, the average price of a 20 kWh PHEV battery pack—roughly the global sales-weighted average for standard plug-in hybrids—was about the same as a 65 kWh BEV battery pack.”

The market is also being significantly impacted by China’s near-total lead in lithium iron phosphate (LFP) batteries. Long regarded as a less expensive alternative for EVs, LFP batteries’ performance has greatly increased as a result of ongoing development, making them far more appropriate for mass-market automobile use than before.

According to the survey, China is also responsible for about half of the worldwide EV battery market, which is made up of LFP batteries. Because to anti-China tariffs, their use in the US stayed at 10% in 2024, although growing by almost 90% in the EU. Meanwhile, the rest of the world is being mostly dominated by LFP batteries.

“Market penetration of LFP batteries is moving even faster in other markets,” according to the research. In 2024, over 50% of electric vehicle batteries in Southeast Asia, Brazil, and India used LFP. While locally made automobiles, primarily from Tata Motors, are the main driver of LFP uptake in India, imports from China, primarily from BYD, are the main driver in Southeast Asia and Brazil. Meanwhile, Japan and South Korea are also accelerating the development of LFP batteries.

Let’s move on to more good and negative news. The United States is slowly catching up on the first front. “Manufacturing capacity in the United States grew by almost 50%, led by Korean companies attracted by tax credits, which accounted for nearly 70% of the growth in 2024,” according to the research. “This led installed capacity in the United States to surpass that in the European Union, which nonetheless increased by 10% in 2024 despite the Northvolt plant in Sweden being halted following its bankruptcy.”

However, if President Donald Trump’s budget package is approved into law, those tax benefits may soon disappear. Both EV tax subsidies and tax incentives for domestic battery manufacturing are about to be eliminated by the so-called Big, Beautiful Bill. Both are being cut in a current version that was approved by the US House of Representatives and is currently making its way through the Senate.

In the end, the worldwide battery boom is here to stay. However, it is still unclear if America wishes to be included.",https://www.evmechanica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/EV-Battery-Prices-Dropped-20-Over-Last-Year.jpg,N,,2025-06-02 09:10:52.322026

Mumbai: India's green economy is growing rapidly and is expected to reach a value of $1 trillion by 2030, and a staggering $15 trillion by 2070, a new report said on Monday.

With this massive growth, India is also set to create a huge number of green jobs -- around 7.29 million by the financial year 2027-28 and 35 million by the year 2047, according to a NLB Services report.

NLB Services CEO Sachin Alug said: ""In the past 4-5 years, we've seen green jobs evolve from niche roles to mainstream opportunities across renewable energy, EVs, and sustainable infrastructure. What's changed pragmatically is the skillsets.""

""Today's green workforce needs both sustainability know-how and digital fluency, and the increased integration of AI, IoT, blockchain, GIS, and data-driven tools are laying the foundation for progressive, new-age green careers,"" Alug mentioned.

As the green sector expands, industries are not just investing in green technology and renewable energy, but also focusing on building a skilled workforce to meet the rising demand.

This shift is driving companies to change their hiring strategies. Rather than relying only on traditional degrees, employers are now giving more importance to practical green skills and hands-on experience.

Many companies are also working closely with colleges and universities to equip young people with sustainability-related skills, while also investing in inclusive hiring and re-skilling programmes, the report stated.

The new employment outlook is stronger than earlier predictions. In 2024, the green sector was expected to grow at a pace of 15-20 per cent annually in terms of job demand.

However, new estimates show an even faster increase, especially in fields like renewable energy, electric vehicles, green construction, waste management, and sustainable textiles.

Most green jobs are still based in big cities like Mumbai, Bengaluru, and Delhi. But smaller cities such as Jaipur, Indore, Visakhapatnam, Coimbatore, Bhubaneswar, Chandigarh, and Ahmedabad are also becoming key green job hubs.

Advt

Tier II and Tier III cities are expected to create 35-40 per cent of the projected 7.29 million jobs by FY28, helped by the growth in sustainable agriculture, logistics, and warehousing, as per the report.

Green job roles are also becoming more diverse. Demand for professionals in areas such as ESG (Environmental, Social and Governance) analytics, climate data analysis, and green technology is growing fast, with a projected 20-30 per cent yearly rise.

GRAMERCY — For several months, a River Parishes refinery unlawfully discharged industrial toxic waste containing arsenic, cadmium, chromium and other toxic heavy metals into public areas and waterways, state records show.

The company, Atlantic Alumina, also known as Atalco, has so far racked up 23 violation notices from the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality after inspectors first discovered the pollution in August. It involves a slurry of industrial “red mud” byproduct that has eroded through the giant levees surrounding the facility’s waste containment lakes and spilled onto public property. The toxic sludge has killed vegetation and contaminated the land along its path to a local drainage system that flows to the Blind River Swamp of Lake Maurepas, according to a 606-page LDEQ inspection report finalized in March.

The incident marks the first known case of red mud levee breaches at an American bauxite refinery. When asked for details, LDEQ spokesman Gregory Langley had little information to share about the prolonged discharge other than to say it is currently under investigation with the agency’s enforcement division. The only enforcement action taken as of May 29 is a warning letter LDEQ sent to Atalco.

A review of thousands of pages of state and federal documents and interviews with scientists and area residents indicate that Atalco polluted public land and state waterways with the most toxic non-radioactive elements on the planet and allowed that pollution to continue for months — never notifying the outside community.

Atalco’s refinery occupies roughly 3 square miles of land where St. James and St. John the Baptist parishes meet on the Mississippi River’s east bank. The site specializes in refining bauxite, a rust-colored powder of raw metals and minerals, into aluminum oxide or “alumina” in the form of an ultra-fine white powder. Atalco sells the alumina to metal smelters that need it to make finished aluminum. Opened in 1958 as Kaiser Aluminum, the Gramercy facility is the only remaining bauxite refinery in the United States and therefore the nation’s only domestic source of a critical metal feedstock.

Atalco produced 669,261 metric tons of aluminum oxide last year, state records show. For every ton of aluminum produced from Atalco’s work, bauxite refining generates an estimated 2.5 tons of waste byproduct, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.

One of the main problems in refining bauxite is there are not many good options for what to do with all that waste, most of which takes the form of a thick red mud.

The waste comes from a part of the process in which bauxite is heated in a pressurized vessel with sodium hydroxide, a highly caustic chemical. The alumina compounds are then filtered out and separated, while the toxic byproduct is stored in the facility’s six red mud lakes. The lakes are open-air ponds, each roughly 150-200 acres in size surrounded by large earthen levees, some as high as 50 feet, meant to contain the thick liquid waste.

Four of the lakes, including a “surge” or overflow basin, were constructed in the early 1970s without any liners that would help prevent the heavy metals and chemicals from seeping into the soil below.

“It is very dangerous,” said Slawomir Lomnicki, an environmental scientist at LSU. “There can be a lot of toxic metals leaching out of it and getting into the groundwater.”

Groundwater contamination from leaching is a constant risk that exists when Atalco’s systems are operating normally. The public drinking water system in St. James Parish regularly monitors for that kind of contamination, according to Parish President Peter Dufresne. Officials with the St. John Parish water system did not answer multiple phone calls last week.

A greater risk to the community from bauxite refineries in general is the rare case of a levee breach at a red mud lake, which can cause toxic waste to directly contaminate public waters and soils, scientists said.

Until this reporting, the last known breach at a bauxite refinery occurred in Hungary in 2010. The failure of a red mud reservoir sent 35 million cubic feet of waste into nearby villages, killing 10 people and injuring 150 others.

In the wake of that incident, industry officials told the American public that a levee breach at Louisiana’s bauxite refinery would be unlikely because the levees are “periodically checked by state and federal regulators,” according to a news report from that time.

That unlikely event has happened at Atalco. With a caustic level higher than drain cleaner and elevated concentrations of heavy metals, Atalco’s waste slurry eroded through levees in multiple locations at multiple lakes, forming canyons as deep as 10 feet that allowed the toxic waste to escape, records show.

A water sample LDEQ had tested from a public ditch outside the plant detected arsenic at a concentration nearly 1,400% higher than the level considered safe by state groundwater and EPA drinking water limits. The sample also contained cadmium at levels above those same limits.

A soil sample taken from the same ditch contained mercury, beryllium, cadmium and chromium — all at concentrations above the average background levels found in U.S. soils. The cadmium was nearly 400% higher, and the chromium was 900% higher than LDEQ’s standard limits for soil. Chromium is the most toxic non-radioactive element on earth and is about three times more poisonous than arsenic, according to EPA toxicity factors.

Historic water quality data for the Blind River, recorded from 1979-99, show heavy metal concentrations nowhere near those levels.

When the levees broke

“With this kind of facility, the worst major accident that can happen is a breach of the lake [levees],” said Corinne Gibb, a chemist who works with the environmental watchdog Louisiana Bucket Brigade. The group has monitored incidents at the alumina refinery for years.

It is unknown when the mud lake levees first began to erode, but state and federal records show the pollution lasted for months and continued even after Atalco became aware of the problem.

The company has not responded to the Illuminator’s multiple requests for an interview.

Federal inspectors with the Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) documented several hazards at Atalco’s levees last summer and voiced concerns about the risks they posed to the workers at the plant.

“There were several mud lakes at the facility that was (sic) not being maintained,” MSHA inspector Brandon Olivier wrote in a citation dated June 25, 2024.

Trees and shrubs obscured sections of the levees, making thorough inspections impossible, Olivier added.

A few weeks later, on Aug. 14, the MSHA issued Atalco another citation after inspectors discovered caustic waste “seeping through various locations on the east and west side of Mud Lake #4” and flowing downhill “into the roadway and ditches.”

LDEQ later noted the Aug. 14 citation was the first formal written notice Atalco received about the levees having a breach with dangerous toxic waste escaping from its facility.

Other dangers present at the Atalco plant had already drawn regulators’ attention at that time.

Just days prior, on Aug. 4, the public was reminded just how dangerous the chemicals at Atalco could be when 45-year-old Curtis Diggs, a contract worker from Waste-Pro USA, fell into a pit of sodium hydroxide at the plant because a grate that covered the pit was missing and the entire floor was flooded with several inches of the caustic cloudy liquid. The chemical, the same that is stored in the red mud lakes, left Diggs with severe burns from which he did not recover, according to LDEQ records. He died in a New Orleans hospital on Sept 2.

MSHA investigated the fatality and learned that Atalco personnel had removed the grate on July 30, 2024, to try to pump out the flooded area and failed to put anything in its place or even a warning marker, creating a dangerous pitfall left open for five days and virtually invisible. MSHA charged Atalco with three regulatory violations and charged Waste-Pro USA with two, faulting both companies for “aggravated conduct” that involved an extraordinary pattern of negligence, though it’s unclear if any fines or penalties have been issued as of May 30, according to federal records.

Atalco uses sodium hydroxide to refine bauxite into alumina. After the refinement process, it stores the used sodium hydroxide in the lakes with the other waste.

Despite the heightened scrutiny from state and federal regulators at the time, by mid-September Atalco still had not repaired the levee breaches to Red Mud Lake 4 that federal inspectors cited the month before. Nor did the company thoroughly inspect its other lakes to look for similar breaches because, as the records indicate, similar breaches were there — if only the company had looked.

On Sept. 17, MSHA inspectors found a breach in the levee around another lake, Red Mud Lake 1 East, with a stream of hazardous waste flowing freely across the roadway.

“The caustic was observed seeping through the side of the levee for approximately 50 yards across the roadway and to the ditch,” the citation states. “The mud lake is access[ed] by the plant operators daily and contractors for service, and this condition exposes them to injuries if there is a dam failure due to the seepage.”

Based on further inspections that same day, MSHA cited Atalco for a third levee break — at Red Mud Lake 2.

On that single day, three of Atalco’s six waste lakes had confirmed breaches with streams of poisonous chemicals flowing freely to areas they weren’t permitted to go, including the Blind River Swamp — a popular recreational fishing spot in the Lake Maurepas backwaters.

LDEQ officials first arrived at the plant Sept. 20 to initiate a routine compliance inspection. Agency records show state officials met with Atalco managers, conducted an interview and toured parts of the facility. However, they were unable to inspect some of the lakes and levees because the plant manager told them the access roads were too wet to travel on.

LDEQ first documented the levee breaches five days later when they were contacted by the federal inspectors, according to state records. Atalco had still not officially notified LDEQ of the levee breaches — something the company should have done immediately upon learning of them in accordance with Atalco’s permit requirements as well as state and federal laws.

Local officials have also been kept in the dark. When asked about the events during an impromptu meeting with a reporter Thursday at the State Capitol, St. James Parish President Peter Dufresne said he was unaware of Atalco’s levee breaks that contaminated neighboring land and drainage with toxic waste. Dufresne declined an interview but asked the Illuminator for copies of LDEQ’s inspection reports.

In October, the records show, state inspectors discovered erosion channels in the levee of a fourth lake, Red Mud Lake 3. They also saw for themselves the levee breaches that federal inspectors documented two months before. The erosion channels were still there, and the caustic waste was still escaping from those lakes.

So much waste had escaped that it also overwhelmed the facility’s secondary containment system, which is a network of interior ditches just outside of the levees used to catch any chemical spills or leaks from the lakes. The backup ditch at one location had overflowed, sending the toxic slurry across the highway just north of the Veterans Memorial Bridge.

Atalco was also, as a matter of protocol, unlawfully using a stormwater ditch as a backup containment ditch. Three company officials, apparently unaware that they weren’t permitted to use the ditch for toxic waste disposal, told LDEQ inspectors that they routinely used it for containment, according to the inspection files.

In other areas, LDEQ inspectors saw that the waste slurry had accumulated to “nearly the height of the levee” in some of the lakes, the agency’s files note. The waste level in the lakes should never be allowed to rise higher than two feet from the top of the levee.

Ultimately, in site visits over the next three months, LDEQ inspectors viewed and documented levee breaches at four of Atalco’s six lakes, prompting the state agency to cite Atalco multiple times for failing to inspect and failing to repair the levees.

Erosion of the levees was a very real possibility that Atalco had long known about. In its 2010 permit renewal applications with the state, the company had addressed the topic at length, promising to prevent erosion by conducting daily inspections of the levees and keeping written logs of those inspections. The state included those as specific ongoing requirements in the final permit issued to Atalco. At that time, the company was in the process of raising its levees from 30 feet to 50 feet high, according to the permit application.

By the time state and federal officials began prodding the company last August, Atalco had not consistently inspected its lakes and levees in over three years and was missing hundreds of daily inspection records from July 30, 2021, to Dec. 18, 2024, according to LDEQ’s summary of violations.

On Oct. 23, state officials noted the company was constructing a new berm to contain the breach at Red Mud Lake 4, which Atalco had known about since at least Aug. 14.

The breach at Red Mud Lake 3 continued until Dec. 4, according to the LDEQ file. On that day, Atalco managers accompanied state inspectors into the field when they noticed multiple streams emerging near an access road and traced it back to “one erosion channel with an estimated depth of at least 10 feet.”

The chemistry of Atalco’s toxic waste

During their site visits in October, the state inspectors took pH readings from various pools of standing waste that had escaped from the lakes

The pH scale ranges from 0 to 14, with water having a neutral pH of around 7. Lower values indicate acidity, while higher values indicate alkalinity. Substances at the extreme ends of the scale in either direction can eat through solid materials such as steel and concrete and are very dangerous to most life forms.

The LDEQ detected high pH at every location, with one puddle logged at a high of 12.49 — the same alkalinity as most caustic drain clog removers and ammonia-based cleaners. The inspectors also photographed dead or dying vegetation, petrochemical sheens, and white and yellow chemical residues in many of the locations where the slurry had traveled.

“Just the pH by itself is concerning … That is very high,” Gibb, the chemist, said. “You would definitely get injuries and skin burns from it. The plants and any fish in the area would die from that. You can’t survive that high of a pH.”

State inspectors had testing done on water and soil samples from off-site locations in the public drainage system and on-site locations near the erosion streams. Simultaneously, Atalco personnel collected their own batch of samples and sent them to a separate lab for independent testing.

LDEQ’s soil samples contained significantly elevated levels of cadmium, chromium and nickel — all toxic carcinogens. Atalco’s samples reaffirmed the LDEQ’s lab results and detected even higher levels at one location. The company’s sample taken from public property outside the facility contained cadmium at roughly 1,000% higher than what the state considers safe for people. Additionally, the levels of chromium and nickel measured 1,700% and 300% above their respective state standards, the lab reports show.

Gibb and Lomnicki, the LSU scientist, said these three heavy metals, along with arsenic, are among the most dangerous non-radioactive substances on the planet. Exposure to excessive levels can cause a range of serious health issues, including cancer and blood poisoning.

Ganga Hettiarachchi, a Kansas State University professor of soil and environmental chemistry, said cadmium could pose the greatest long-term risk because it spreads easily and accumulates in living organisms over time. Enough small doses during a given time period can add up to a fatal dose, she said.

Cadmium is highly toxic to humans in short- and long-term exposure settings. Small concentrations ingested or inhaled can cause gastrointestinal or respiratory illness, while higher concentrations can cause cancer, cell death, neurological damage and organ system failure, according to the National Institutes of Health.

Increasing the risk from cadmium is that it can be easily spread across far distances and transfer from soil into crops, Hettiarachchi said, posing risks to humans and animals if they eat those crops.

“It could easily end up in our food,” she said. “That has been historically the main pathway for cadmium.”

If cadmium gets into surface water or groundwater, it can become an even bigger problem, especially if that water is used for irrigation, she added.

“The area of damage can expand further and further over time,” Hettiarachchi said.

Cadmium was present at elevated levels in two of Atalco’s water samples and four of LDEQ’s. The highest concentration was 400% above the level considered safe in a water sample taken from an erosion channel within the perimeter of the facility. It also had high levels of chromium and lead.

All seven water samples that LDEQ had tested contained elevated levels of arsenic. One of them taken from outside the levee of a red mud lake detected arsenic at a level 9,000% higher than state and federal safe limits, and it contained high levels of cadmium, nickel and thallium. Six out of the seven samples Atalco personnel collected contained arsenic at levels beyond what is considered safe.

LDEQ has yet to address the risks Atalco’s red mud runoff could pose to the community. Langley, the agency’s spokesman, said it has yet to determine what the public impact might be.

“Obviously those are things we don’t want going into state waterways,” Langley said.

Part Two: For some nearby residents, the levee breaches at Atalco are just the latest incident in a familiar pattern. The second story in this series reveals why the incident at Atalco was foreseeable based on the history of the plant and the many accidents and environmental exposures to the nearby communities.

“They’re turning a blind eye to it,” said Gail LeBouef, who’s lived near the plant since 1999.",https://lailluminator.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Atalco-1.jpg,N,,2025-06-02 07:14:50.306713

Now, the incentive programs that attracted Panasonic to Kansas are jeopardized by the Trump administration’s attacks on clean energy, and the De Soto plant may be the last of its kind.

3, with renewable energy producing enough energy in Kansas to meet 74% of the state’s electricity consumption.","The $4 billion Panasonic battery factory in De Soto should have been a first-of-a-kind project for Kansas and the Midwest.

In addition to the estimated 4,000 new jobs coming to town, Panasonic and the state expected another 4,000 jobs to come from suppliers they anticipated would move to Kansas to provide additional goods and materials the plant would need for its operations. And in 2024, there was momentum based on growing demand for electric vehicles and low-cost renewable energy to have this kind of growth replicated in states throughout the Midwest.

Now, the incentive programs that attracted Panasonic to Kansas are jeopardized by the Trump administration’s attacks on clean energy, and the De Soto plant may be the last of its kind. Already, more than $14 billion in new energy projects (and the loss of 10,000 potential new jobs because of it) have been canceled or delayed as spending on new projects is paused.

Attracting what will be the largest battery factory in the world to the heart of the Midwest required big incentives — including more than $800 million from the state and the promise of billions in tax incentives from the federal government. These batteries are intended to support the growing domestic manufacturing of electric vehicles and expansion of low-cost renewables for utilities that are experiencing load growth for the first time in decades as a result of the AI boom.

The incentive programs were crafted to ensure that America could remain competitive in a 21st-century global economy that will increasingly be electrified and powered by clean generation from geothermal, nuclear, solar and wind energy, with batteries as the backup. And importantly, the benefits of these incentives in the form of new manufacturing plants and well-paid manufacturing jobs would be shared across America.

‘Saudi Arabia of wind energy’

The Midwest has been dubbed the Saudi Arabia of wind energy. Five Midwest states rank among the Top 10 nationwide for the percentage of total state electricity consumption that is generated by renewables. Notably, Kansas stands out at No. 3, with renewable energy producing enough energy in Kansas to meet 74% of the state’s electricity consumption. Battery plants to support the consumer demand for electric vehicles are popping up in Ohio and, of course, Kansas — and were meant to be built in more towns like De Soto.

And yet, the renewable energy and electric vehicle industries, driven in large part on two key technologies developed in the United States — photovoltaic cells and lithium-ion batteries — are facing an all-out attack by the Trump administration. These irrational headwinds from the administration and Republican-controlled state legislatures in the Midwest are likely to impede the ability of the region to benefit from the expansion of clean energy manufacturing plants and the data center growth for the artificial intelligence industry, which will locate where there is cheap land and low-cost energy.

My parents grew up in the Midwest. My grandfather was an executive at Kansas City Power & Light Co. (now Evergy) and my father grew up in Flint, Michigan, during the Depression. The opportunity and transformation that new manufacturing like the Panasonic plant represented for the Midwest region gave me hope that the government and industry were finally investing in the hometowns my parents had left behind.

Although I may have values based on my Midwest roots, I was born and raised in the Bay Area and had a front-row seat as the innovation engine that is Silicon Valley created enormous opportunities and wealth for California and the San Francisco area. The expansion of low-cost renewable energy and the manufacturing plants to support that expansion present an opportunity for the Midwest to participate in the next major innovation cycle. In addition, the rich renewable energy resources of the heartland, along with available land, has made the region an epicenter of the data center build-out that will power the AI revolution.

For the United States to compete in a global market for energy supplies, the global transition to electric vehicles and the new world of AI, we need policies that support innovation and where market economics and a level playing field determine the best solutions. Policies that impede the expansion of renewable energy projects and defund research to further drive down the cost of these clean energy resources will not create economic development in the Midwest, and will hinder U.S. competitiveness in the markets that will drive the global economy throughout the 21st century.

Midwesterners should unite in support of the policies that are now under threat. They can build a future of economic abundance and prosperity for the region that our parents and grandparents would be proud of.",https://www.kansascity.com/latest-news/5b5jsj/picture307465371/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1140/panasonic%20battery%20plant%20de%20soto.JPG,N,,2025-06-02 07:13:24.421073

From the Poconos to the Jersey Shore to the mouth of the Delaware Bay, what do you want to know about climate change? What would you like us to cover? Get in touch.

The state of Delaware is aiming to reduce toxic PFAS chemicals in public drinking water as the Trump administration threatens to weaken federal regulations on the so-called “forever chemicals.”

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency implemented regulations last year requiring water providers to test and treat the “forever chemicals” to almost zero by 2029. But the agency pivoted last month, proposing to rollback certain PFAS restrictions, while extending the compliance deadline to 2031.

Delaware lawmakers say restricting PFAS in drinking water statewide is crucial to ensure that residents’ health is protected. The legislation years in the making passed Delaware’s Senate in May, and awaits a House vote this month.

“This is a serious health issue, so we need to make sure that we’re doing everything we can here in the state of Delaware, regardless of what is done at the federal level,” said state Sen. Darius Brown, the bill’s sponsor.

PFAS, widely used in consumer products such as nonstick cookware and waterproof clothing, as well as in firefighting foam, have been linked to serious health problems, including some cancers, thyroid disease, developmental delays in children and other health conditions.

The health risks associated with PFAS, which can stay in the human bloodstream for years, have sparked numerous lawsuits against chemical manufacturers, such as DuPont and 3M.

Delaware is no stranger to PFAS contamination. Its largest city, Wilmington, is known as the chemical capital of the world and is home to DuPont, which used PFAS chemicals to manufacture its products, such as Teflon. However, PFAS chemicals have been detected across the state, including in the cities of Dover and in Blades, as well as in rivers and streams.

Senate Bill 72, introduced in March, would require Delaware water providers to begin testing for PFAS in January 2026, and reduce PFAS levels in drinking water by 2029. The legislation mirrors the EPA’s regulations adopted last year, restricting two types of PFAS — PFOA and PFOS — to 4 parts per trillion.

The EPA last month pivoted from its Biden-era PFAS regulations, proposing to give water providers another two years to comply. The agency also plans to scrap limits entirely for three other types of PFAS — PFHxS, PFNA and GenX — as well as limitations on a mixture of several types of forever chemicals.

The change comes after water providers sued the EPA last year, arguing that the treatments required to meet the regulations are too costly, and would hit the pockets of ratepayers. While former President Joe Biden set aside billions of dollars to address PFAS, water providers say more resources are needed, and several utilities have sued polluters to help pay for the cost of treatment.

Though PFOA and PFOS are most commonly detected across the U.S., chemicals such as PFHxS are frequently found in communities near airports and military bases, where firefighting foam has been discharged.

Residents who live near the Wilmington Airport in New Castle have exceedingly high levels of PFHxS in their blood from drinking contaminated water, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The contamination is associated with the National Guard’s use of firefighting foam on a base at the airport.

Al Fidance is among the New Castle residents with high PFAS levels in their blood, and said he was concerned about the EPA’s proposal to scrap restrictions on certain chemicals.

“The things that you think are in place to protect you, look like a lot of that’s going away,” he said. “It’s going to be a mess. I don’t like it.”

Clean water advocates say the legislation in Delaware, which would restrict PFHxS, PFNA and GenX to 10 parts per trillion, is critical. The state would use funds from a DuPont settlement to help water providers reduce PFAS over the next decade.

“The higher the amount of concentration of PFAS in people’s blood increases their risk for developing a disease that’s linked to these PFAS,” said Tracy Carluccio, deputy director of the Delaware Riverkeeper Network. “It’s more important than ever if the EPA is weakening and backing out [of regulations], the states step up in order to protect the public health of the residents of the state.”",https://whyy.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/bigstock-Pouring-Drinkable-Water-Into-G-407464253.jpg,N,,2025-06-02 07:14:53.754334

LEXINGTON, Ky. (June 2, 2025) — The demand for accurate chemical monitoring sensors is rising globally, as industries continue to grapple with the legacy of manufacturing waste.

New commercial mobile monitoring platforms can be part of the solution to this rising challenge, provided they meet the same high standards as previous monitoring technology. Industry-academic partnerships are making this possible, advancing state-of-the-art detection science.

Globally, more than 5 billion sites exist that are contaminated with legacy industrial wastes and require remediation before they can be reused and/or redeveloped. Despite recent efforts to change manufacturing practices, the legacy of waste contamination and generation persists.

“Chemical wastes are part of our society,” says Kelly G. Pennell, Ph.D., the Earl Parker Robinson Chair Professor of Environment and Sustainability in the UK Stanley and Karen Pigman College of Engineering.

“The idea of zero-waste is both an aspirational goal and an elusive goal,” said Pennell. “We know that manufacturing ecosystems are being rapidly disrupted. As a result, there will be unintended, unimagined and uneven consequences of industrial waste that impact the health and environment in communities in various geographic locations.”

That’s why Pennell’s team at the University of Kentucky Superfund Research Center, which was funded by the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, collaborated with Entanglement Technologies, located in the San Francisco Bay Area, over the past decade to create meaningful solutions to the chemical waste challenge.

A recent study, published in the journal ACS Omega, describes the research team’s quality assurance/quality control (QA/QC) framework to advance the technology readiness-level of mobile chemical monitoring instruments as they become commercially available.

UK graduate student Herman Tay led the work, with Pennell and a leading expert from GSI Environmental Inc., to use Entanglement’s AROMA-VOC sensor — a chemical analyzer — as the model for this QA/QC systematic framework.

“We are excited to be part of such an important collaboration that enables mobile monitoring to grow and fill the gap in characterizing the impact of manufacturing waste on local communities,” said Tony Miller, CEO of Entanglement Technologies. “Our AROMA instruments have evolved to meet the rapidly changing needs of industry and communities worldwide.”

The instrument the research team discussed in this recent publication — AROMA-VOC — has transitioned considerably since Pennell first met Miller to collaborate on a 2016 field study of a superfund site in the San Francisco Bay area.

During the 2016 study, Pennell and Miller maintained close interactions with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), community stakeholders and collaborated with environmental consultants from Clearwater Group and chemical analysis experts at Beacon Environmental.

“The field study provided an opportunity for Entanglement to conduct measurements and make discoveries within the context of a regulated hazardous waste site. The field study with Kelly and her students came at a pivotal time for us. We were transitioning AROMA-VOC towards a mobile design and the field study provided an opportunity to learn in real-time about users’ needs, challenges and opportunities,” said Miller.

Now, AROMA-VOC fits neatly and compactly in the back of a vehicle and can be driven to various locations for chemical monitoring.

Entanglement Technologies has experienced tremendous growth, fueled, in part, by strategic partnerships. Its new mobile technology is used by dozens of groups in the United States — including regulatory bodies conducting air quality monitoring such as the EPA, California Air Resources Board, Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment, industry monitoring fenceline, indoor air and stack emissions, and other universities like Stanford, Baylor and Colorado State. The use of AROMA has even extended overseas and internationally to Canada, the Netherlands and South Korea.

Since 2021, when Entanglement Technologies developed the most sensitive analyzer to measure the critical air toxic ethylene oxide in the ambient environment, the company has outgrown its manufacturing space and significantly expanded its team and operations.

The partnership between Pennell’s team and Entanglement shows how vitally important research collaboration is to the global economy — enabling sustainable growth and innovation across industry sectors.

That carbon capture requirement also applied to new natural gas-fired power plants.
The Trump administration has swiftly reversed course, reportedly planning to eliminate any caps on greenhouse gas emissions from coal-fired and natural gas-fired power plants.","A federal award funding a collaboration between Kentucky’s largest utility, the University of Kentucky and other partners to implement a new system capturing greenhouse gas emissions is among two dozen energy-related awards the Trump administration terminated last week.

The $72 million award terminated by the U.S. Department of Energy funded the testing of a carbon capture system on a natural gas-fired turbine operated by electric utility Louisville Gas and Electric and Kentucky Utilities at its Cane Run Generating Station in Jefferson County.

Carbon capture refers to technologies that seek to reduce climate-warming carbon dioxide emissions from burning fossil fuels by capturing and storing carbon dioxide before it’s released into the atmosphere. The utility described the project last year as an “important step in assessing the future viability” of carbon capture technology for natural gas-fired power plants. LG&E and KU, which serves more than 1 million customers in the state, would have captured a portion of carbon dioxide emissions to be potentially reused by a nearby manufacturer, according to a press release.

Liz Pratt, a LG&E and KU spokesperson, in a statement said the utility was “disappointed” the award was terminated but remained “focused on driving innovation and important research and development in this space.”

“​​Together with our project partners, we will review our options for advancing this important research project,” Pratt said.

Among the other awards terminated Friday by the DOE included a number of other carbon capture and storage projects and a project by multinational alcoholic beverage company Diageo that sought to add batteries to decarbonize production facilities including in Shelbyville, Kentucky.

U.S. Secretary of Energy Chris Wright in a Friday statement said canceling the approximately $3.7 billion in total awards was “in the best interest” of Americans.

“While the previous administration failed to conduct a thorough financial review before signing away billions of taxpayer dollars, the Trump administration is doing our due diligence to ensure we are utilizing taxpayer dollars to strengthen our national security, bolster affordable, reliable energy sources and advance projects that generate the highest possible return on investment,” Wright said in a statement.

Investment into carbon capture systems played a large role in the energy policy of the former Biden administration, which sought to require utilities with coal-fired power plants operating past 2039 to capture 90% of carbon dioxide emissions from the plants or have those plants retire by 2032. That carbon capture requirement also applied to new natural gas-fired power plants. The Trump administration has swiftly reversed course, reportedly planning to eliminate any caps on greenhouse gas emissions from coal-fired and natural gas-fired power plants.

Supporters of carbon capture technologies generally say it’s necessary in transitioning to clean energy and addressing industries that are hard to decarbonize, while skeptics, including environmentalists, question whether the technologies will allow for the further burning of fossil fuels.

Byron Gary, an attorney with the environmental legal organization Kentucky Resources Council, told the Lantern the award termination fits into the Trump administration’s “broader strategy” of “trying to undermine climate regulation.”

E&E News reported Friday that the Trump administration is expected to argue the U.S. power sector, a major contributor of greenhouse gas emissions, doesn’t contribute “significantly” to climate change.

Gary said while his organization would rather see investment into zero-emission renewable energy paired with utility-scale batteries, the award terminations appear to ensure carbon capture technology isn’t a “viable option” for the future.",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/IMG_1095-2048x1365.jpg,N,,2025-06-02 10:03:19.405734

TVA currently operates four coal plants: Kingston, near Knoxville, Cumberland, near Clarksville, Gallatin, about 30 miles from Nashville, and Shawnee, in Paducah, Kentucky.

In 2021, TVA announced a plan to retire all coal plants by 2035. Two of the coal plants, at Kingston and Cumberland, are scheduled to close completely by 2027 and 2028, respectively, and be replaced with equivalent gas generation.

“Substantial performance and cost risk is carried by operating a coal fleet reaching the end of its useful life,” TVA wrote at the time. “Unplanned outage rate, a component of availability, is the primary driver of challenges.” Many Tennesseans experienced this firsthand during Winter Storm Elliott two years ago, when TVA issued rolling blackouts after coal and gas plants failed.

But earlier this month, TVA changed its tune, shortly after President Donald Trump signed executive orders aimed at reviving the coal industry and granted TVA exemptions to Biden-era coal pollution regulations.

“We’re evaluating our coal units’ lifespans,” TVA’s new CEO Don Moul said during a recent board meeting. “We continue to depend on them to help power this region.”

Moul declined an interview request from WPLN News about the possible extensions. Wade White, a member of the TVA Board, the utility’s main regulator, also declined an interview with WPLN News at a meeting in early May.

TVA undermines one of its key arguments for new fossil fuel generation

TVA may find it difficult to extend use of the Kingston or Cumberland coal plants, because the utility would have to get permission to emit two kinds of dangerous fossil fuel pollution simultaneously, as new gas plants at those sites come online. All four of the utility’s coal plants rank among the top five climate polluters in Tennessee and Kentucky — with Cumberland consistently ranking as the top emitter. Air pollution from these plants is also linked to hundreds of premature deaths each year.

Or TVA could burn coal longer if any gas plant construction gets behind schedule. But that undermines one of TVA’s main arguments for building new gas plants in the first place: its self-determined deadline for coal retirement.

When proposing a 1.5-gigawatt gas plant for Kingston, for example, TVA suggested that the gas plant was the only option for generation because of how quickly it needed to shut down the coal plant — an argument scrutinized by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency last year.

“TVA dismisses the lower costs, lower financial risks, and far superior environmental performance of [the solar option] by arguing that solar cells could not be installed by 2027,” EPA wrote in a letter to the utility. “The imperative of 2027 closure of the [Kingston coal plant] is not adequately disclosed. If closure by 2027 is an imperative, then TVA created an alternative that is technically infeasible and therefore not a viable alternative.”

TVA’s own transmission queue challenges this idea. As of January 2025, the utility had about 8.6 GW worth of solar and battery projects, with requested dates of June 2025 or later, waiting to be developed and added to the grid. That is more power than TVA’s entire gas buildout this decade.

Last year, TVA said it takes an average of “5.4 years” for a solar project to come online, but experts say TVA could speed up the rate at which it’s bringing solar projects online.

“If TVA had the proper ambition and motivation, they could be building out solar and storage to scale,” Smith said. “They choose not to, and they choose then to mislead the public that it’s not possible.”

TVA made a similar argument for the Cumberland site a few years ago. That coal plant is the largest in the fleet, providing a capacity of roughly 2.4 GW. TVA plans to add a nearly 1.5-GW gas plant on site and a 0.9-GW gas plant in Cheatham County, about 20 miles from Nashville.

TVA stressed the need to have replacement generation by 2026 to replace the first of the coal plant’s two units.

“If the first Cumberland unit must stay in operation beyond 2026, significant investment would be required to maintain safe and reliable operations and comply with environmental regulations,” TVA wrote in an environmental review. “Operation beyond 2026 would also inject operational risk back into the TVA system due to the deteriorating condition of the coal units.”

So, why would TVA now say it is considering keeping its coal plants running longer?

The U.S. ‘national energy emergency’

President Donald Trump declared a “national energy emergency” on his first day in office.

This was not an effort to mitigate the climate crisis. The Trump administration purged those words from government websites, and reduced or cut scientific reports, data tools like the “billion-dollar disasters” database, and scientists from the federal workforce.

The Senate will also soon consider the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act,” which would repeal tax credits for clean energy development in the nation’s first big climate law — which has a special provision for the Tennessee Valley Authority — and incentives for consumer purchases on items like electric vehicles and solar water heaters. The new bill threatens the national trend: Solar, wind and batteries were forecasted to make up 93% of new electric generation this year. (However, that isn’t the Tennessee trend.)

Trump instead wants to boost fossil fuel production. Many of his executive orders aim to expedite oil and gas projects and reduce regulations on pollution.

For context, the U.S. became the world’s largest producer of gas in 2011, surpassing Russia, and the largest producer of oil in 2018, surpassing Saudi Arabia. The nation reached record fossil fuel production under Biden. Some scientists and environmentalists say the U.S. is now, under Trump, a “petrostate.”

Trump also wants to salvage the declining coal industry, which may partially explain TVA’s willingness to open the conversation on extensions.

“Much of this is a political discussion that TVA is having publicly to send a signal to the Trump administration that they’re responding to some of Trump’s desires,” Smith, the director, said.

Coal use has been waning for over a decade, largely due to cheaper options like gas and renewables. Nearly all coal plants in the U.S. are more expensive to run than the cost of building renewable replacements, according to a 2023 study by Energy Innovation, without factoring in tax credits or environmental regulations.

More coal was retired during Trump’s first administration than during the Biden presidency or Obama’s second term.

Although coal remains the dirtiest fuel for energy, Smith said, Trump has created a pathway for delays.

“We’re seeing lots of things starting to slip in the wrong direction,” Smith said. “The environment doesn’t care about politics. The physics are going to happen, and that’s what we’re most worried about.”",https://wpln.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/06/Cumberland-TVA.jpg,N,,2025-06-02 06:02:29.436124

Line 5 Tunnel Project DEIS Opens Public Comment Period Through June 30

The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Detroit District, published the long-anticipated Draft Environmental Impact Statement (DEIS) for the Line 5 Tunnel Project on May 30, 2025. The document opens a formal 30-day window for public comment that will run through June 30, 2025.

The project, proposed by Enbridge Energy, seeks to build a tunnel beneath the Straits of Mackinac to house a segment of the Line 5 pipeline, which transports crude oil and natural gas liquids through Michigan. The Corps’ DEIS evaluates a range of environmental, cultural, and legal implications associated with the proposal.

The 3.6-mile tunnel would replace the current Line 5 Dual Pipelines, which rest on or are anchored to the lakebed. According to the DEIS, construction activities and the permanent tunnel footprint could result in long-term environmental degradation across up to 38 acres of lakebed, along with measurable impacts on wetlands, air quality, public recreation, and tribal cultural resources.

The full document is available at line5tunneleis.com, and comments can be submitted online, by mail, or during two virtual public hearings scheduled for June 18 and June 25.

Environmental Study Covers Broad Range of Potential Impacts

The DEIS outlines the Corps’ assessment of multiple alternatives to the tunnel, including a No Action option, a rock-and-gravel cover solution for the existing dual pipelines, and several decommissioning scenarios. The Corps analyzed potential effects on water quality, wetlands, endangered species, transportation, air quality, noise, navigation, and tribal treaty rights.

Lt. Col. Wallace Bandeff, Detroit District Commander, emphasized the importance of public input, stating, “Public participation is an important part of the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) process to ensure a thorough environmental analysis, and an effective, consistent and well-informed decision.”

The Corps also affirmed its intent to honor federal trust responsibilities to Tribal Nations and comply with laws such as the National Historic Preservation Act, the Endangered Species Act, and NEPA.

Environmental Risks and Mitigation Measures Addressed in Army Corps Report

The DEIS identifies direct and cumulative impacts that vary depending on the selected alternative. Under Enbridge’s Preferred Alternative—building a concrete tunnel under the Straits—the report anticipates:

Long-term loss of forest land for staging areas and equipment

Permanent alteration of underwater geology and aquatic habitat

Noise and light pollution affecting nearby parks like the Headlands International Dark Sky Park and Colonial Michilimackinac

Risk of spills or fluid releases during tunnel boring and horizontal directional drilling operations

While Enbridge asserts that the tunnel design minimizes explosion risks and offers secondary containment, public comments raised concerns about methane pockets, seismic stability, and contamination from construction and maintenance activities.

To address these risks, the Corps outlines a suite of mitigation measures, including monitoring protocols, stormwater management, and post-construction ecological restoration. However, the draft emphasizes that several decommissioning options could lead to greater short-term disturbance depending on whether pipeline segments are removed entirely or left in place after cleaning.

Treaty Rights and Cultural Impact Under Separate Review

In addition to its NEPA obligations, the Corps is evaluating the tunnel’s potential effect on historic properties and treaty rights in consultation with federally recognized tribes. These findings will be included in the final Record of Decision, expected in fall 2025.

The review includes Section 106 compliance for cultural heritage considerations and a treaty rights analysis to determine whether the project would infringe upon rights granted in historical agreements with Indigenous nations.

Federal Permit Decision Hinges on EIS Findings

The Corps is reviewing Enbridge’s permit application under Section 10 of the Rivers and Harbors Act of 1899 and Section 404 of the Clean Water Act. A final decision on whether to issue a Department of the Army permit will depend on the conclusions drawn in the final EIS and input gathered during the public comment period.

This review process has drawn intense interest across Michigan, where environmental groups, tribes, local governments, and residents have debated the risks and benefits of a tunnel under one of the Great Lakes’ most sensitive areas. Enbridge maintains that the tunnel would reduce the risk of spills and improve pipeline safety. Opponents argue it would prolong Michigan’s dependence on fossil fuels and threaten Lake Michigan’s ecosystem.

According to EPA, methane emissions in the United States decreased by 19% between 1990 and 2022.” Measurements in the field have repeatedly shown that reported methane emissions far understate actual releases.
Elsewhere, the report discusses methane emissions from the gas supply chain, but does not consider methane emissions from coal mines that feed coal-fired power plants.
China, the world’s largest importer of LNG, stopped taking U.S. gas entirely in March in response to U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods.
Symons said the ongoing pipeline buildout could commit the U.S. to significantly larger LNG exports for decades to come.","More than three-quarters of new gas pipeline capacity currently under development in the U.S. would feed additional liquefied natural gas exports rather than supporting domestic energy needs, a new report concludes.

Greenhouse gas emissions tied to that new capacity would be far larger than the current climate pollution from all coal-fired power plants nationwide, according to the report, published Monday by the Center for Energy & Environmental Analysis. CEEA is a recently formed think tank based in Arlington, Virginia, that focuses on energy and environmental policy.

“The money flowing to gas pipeline infrastructure is not slowing and is intended to push US gas production even higher from its current record levels,” Jeremy Symons, president of the CEEA and a former federal climate policy advisor, said in a written statement. “This buildout will extend our dependency on natural gas for decades to come, slowing the transition to cleaner, more affordable alternatives.”

Planned natural gas transmission pipelines would add 99 billion cubic feet per day of additional capacity, a figure just below the total volume of U.S. natural gas production in 2024, according to the report. The 10 largest planned pipelines across the country—and 80 percent of total capacity of active pipeline projects—are intended to export gas overseas as LNG, based on the authors’ assessment of federal data and other public records.

The additional gas shipments would have significant implications for climate change. If all of the pipelines are built and run at full capacity, carbon dioxide emissions from burning this additional gas would be two and half times greater than the CO2 currently released from all U.S. coal-fired power plants, the report found.

This doesn’t include emissions of methane, a climate super pollutant and the primary component of natural gas. Methane emissions occur at every step of the natural gas supply chain—from wellheads and pipelines to LNG vessels and end users—as the gas leaks or is intentionally vented.

Methane emissions from the additional pipelines would pack a climate punch nearly twice that of CO2 emissions from coal-fired power plants over a 20-year period, according to the report.

The amount of gas leaks from the oil and gas sector will likely increase as the Trump administration rolls back the industry’s methane regulations, the report noted.

“We know from hundreds of thousands of aerial and satellite measurements that methane leaks from oil and gas production are far worse than we previously realized, which makes the climate footprint of natural gas as bad as coal in many regions of the country,” said Danny Richter, a senior fellow with CEEA and the report’s lead author. “We had a clear path to clean up the methane problem, including the methane emissions reduction program enacted by Congress in 2022 as well as EPA regulations for the oil and gas industry. But that pathway has been shut down by the current administration.”

A fee on excessive methane emissions from oil and gas producers implemented under the Biden administration was rescinded by the Trump administration on May 12.

“It is clear from the beginning of this ‘report’ that it was created with the outcome already determined and no desire to provide facts,” an EPA spokesperson told Inside Climate News. “U.S. methane emissions have been falling for decades thanks to American innovation, not heavy-handed government regulations, while domestic production of oil and gas has exponentially increased. According to EPA, methane emissions in the United States decreased by 19% between 1990 and 2022.”

Measurements in the field have repeatedly shown that reported methane emissions far understate actual releases.

The American Petroleum Institute, an oil and gas industry group, did not respond to a request for comment.

The report is based on U.S. Department of Energy data on 104 pipeline projects currently under development. It is unclear whether all of the planned pipelines will be built. Fifty-four of the projects, slightly more than half of all pipelines under development, have either not yet been approved or are on hold.

This includes one of the largest proposed pipelines, the $45 billion Alaska Nikiski LNG project. The pipe, which proponents have sought for decades, would transport gas 805 miles from Alaska’s North Slope to an LNG export terminal in southern Alaska. Completing the proposed export terminal, a retrofit of an existing import terminal, is included in the project’s projected cost.

The developer, the Alaska Gasline Development Corp, has applied for permits for the pipeline, many of which were approved during the last Trump administration, but still requires more.

President Donald Trump has directed agencies to speed up permitting and roll back environmental protections. He touted the Alaska Nikiski LNG project in an address to Congress earlier this year as “truly spectacular” and said “the permitting is gotten.”

Arvind Ravikumar, co-director of the Energy Emissions Modeling and Data Lab at the University of Texas at Austin, cautioned that the report included figures for carbon dioxide emissions of gas burned by end users in other countries that import the LNG.

“The way international carbon accounting works in this space is that you count only those emissions that happen within your national border,” Ravikumar said.

However, David Lyon, a senior methane scientist with the Environmental Defense Fund, said including emissions from burning the gas, wherever it occurs, made sense.

“Climate change is global,” Lyon said. “If we are just exporting our emissions to other countries, that’s still going to cause climate change and have impact.”

However, Lyon noted that in some cases, building gas pipelines could actually help reduce emissions. For example, in the Permian basin of West Texas and southeastern New Mexico—the largest oil and gas producing region in the country—gas is often flared, or vented, due to a lack of sufficient pipeline capacity.

In such cases, additional pipelines could help reduce flaring and its associated emissions. But it would be better to avoid drilling new wells in areas that lack sufficient pipeline capacity in the first place, Lyon added.

In comparing greenhouse gas emissions associated with the planned pipelines to those of coal-power plants, the report only compares CO2 emissions between the two fuel sources. Elsewhere, the report discusses methane emissions from the gas supply chain, but does not consider methane emissions from coal mines that feed coal-fired power plants. A recent peer-reviewed study comparing the greenhouse gas emissions of LNG and coal found methane emissions from coal mines were relatively modest compared to coal’s CO2 emissions.

In addition to permitting issues, economic forces could also limit the number of pipeline projects that get built in the coming years, or the extent to which completed pipelines operate at full capacity.

China, the world’s largest importer of LNG, stopped taking U.S. gas entirely in March in response to U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods.

Symons said the ongoing pipeline buildout could commit the U.S. to significantly larger LNG exports for decades to come.

“This locks in more fossil fuel dependency that future presidents won’t be able to make go away,” he said. “Policies like tax incentives come and go, but pipelines are forever.”",https://insideclimatenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/GettyImages-1485086044-1024x683.jpg,N,,2025-06-02 06:02:32.014979

The bill, passed by House Congressional Republicans May 22, effectively kills several investment and production tax credits in the Inflation Reduction Act, former President Joe Biden’s signature climate law.

According to an analysis of information from various websites, including the Climate Investment Monitor, E2 and Weseley, almost 70 projects in the districts of Republican representatives from Virginia—worth $18.2 billion in investments and creating almost 11,000 jobs—have used those credits. The U.S. Congress Joint Economic Committee found 21,642 jobs in Virginia had been announced as a result of the IRA.

The One Big Beautiful Bill’s provisions would require projects seeking to use the tax credits to be under construction within 60 days of enactment of the legislation, and be producing electricity for the grid by 2028. Nuclear sources would still be given a timeline of needing to start construction by 2031 in order to receive a production tax credit.

It’s not immediately clear how the bill would impact all those projects in Virginia, since some of them are operating and under construction. But Mike Town, executive director of the Virginia League of Conservation Voters, asked rhetorically: “Will this bill, if passed by the Senate and signed into law, absolutely harm clean energy development and manufacturing across the country?”

His answer: “Yes. Unquestionably.”

But all, he believes, is not lost. Virginia has a clean energy policy, known as the Virginia Clean Economy Act, to transition to zero-carbon sources by midcentury, Town said, “and the clean energy industry existed before the IRA, and it will continue to exist afterwards.”

The One Big Beautiful Bill is the product of what Trump promised and Republicans have long lobbied for—repealing the IRA and cutting back other social services. But, noting goals to have affordable electricity for growing domestic needs, several House Republicans, including U.S. Rep. Jen Kiggans, who represents the Norfolk area, signed a March 9 letter supporting the preservation of IRA tax credits. Any modifications, they wrote, “risk sparking an energy crisis in our country, resulting in drastically higher power bills for American families.”

While the IRA spurred development of renewable energy around the country, Kiggans represents Virginia’s coastal area where Dominion Energy is constructing the nation’s largest offshore wind project, called Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind, or CVOW. And, the state has spent more than a decade making the region an offshore wind manufacturing hub for the entire East Coast.

LS Greenlink, a Korean company manufacturing subsea cables to connect offshore wind electricity to the grid, is planning on using IRA production tax credits as part of its investment of $680 million in the region, creating jobs and receiving cheers from Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin, a conservative Republican.

“It’s not free money, we have to earn it,” managing director Patrick Y. Shim told Inside Climate News during a groundbreaking in April. “It’s one of the reasons why we chose…the location.”

Kiggans still voted for the One Big Beautiful Bill, citing support for Trump’s 2017 tax cuts for the wealthy, but said in a statement she “remains deeply concerned about other shortsighted provisions.”

“We should be strengthening, not undermining, the clean energy tools that support our economy, power our military, and keep costs down for working families,” Kiggans said.

Conversely, several other congressional Republicans, including U.S. Rep Ben Cline from Virginia’s rural Shenandoah Valley, signed a letter seeking full repeal of the IRA tax credits, stating not doing so could “jeopardize” extension of Trump’s tax cuts “as well as the President’s other tax priorities.”

Despite tax credits in the IRA shoring up domestic supply chains, including manufacturing of modules for solar panels, Cline, who voted for the One Big Beautiful Bill, said in a statement that Biden’s law “promotes projects that increase our dependence on foreign supply chains.”

U.S. Rep. Rob Wittman, a Republican representing the Richmond suburbs, the Hampton Roads area and the so-called Northern Neck, pointed to an online statement and said “he continues to advocate for clean energy through his role as vice chairman of the House Natural Resources Committee,” according to a spokesperson (though the statement makes no specific mention of the investment tax credits). He, too, voted for the One Big Beautiful Bill.

Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill is now in the hands of the Republican-controlled Senate, and members of both sides of the aisle have indicated there could be substantial rewrites before going back to the House and then, Trump hopes, back to his desk for signing. In advance of the May 22 House vote, Virginia’s two Democratic Senators, Mark Warner and Tim Kaine, released a statement saying, “We must protect the investments that are creating jobs and lowering costs for Virginians.”

According to a state report released in 2024, Virginia received $36 billion in investment from data centers across 2022 and 2023, $24 billion of which being equipment and software that received sales-tax exemptions. And worldwide, the fossil fuel industry received $7 trillion, or 7.1 percent of GDP in 2022, in subsidies, according to the International Monetary Fund.

Virginia is at the forefront of surging energy demands from the proliferation of data centers. PJM Interconnection, the regional grid serving Virginia, projects summer demand to increase from over 185,000 megawatts across its territory to almost 225,000 megawatts, said Asim Z. Haque Sr., PJM’s senior vice president of governmental and member services, at a recent Virginia Commission on Electric Utility Regulation meeting.

At a time when more electricity generation is needed for the grid, the ones that are “ready to go, the vast majority of those projects are advanced energy. They are solar, they are wind, they are battery storage,” said Harry Godfrey, managing director of Advanced Energy United.

“The answer is unequivocal, if you pull back on these tax policies, it raises costs to consumers,” Godfrey said, referencing a Clean Energy Buyers Association analysis that found removing the tax credits provided under the IRA increases residential electricity costs in Virginia by 5.4 percent. “These are means of helping continueaccelerate the development,” of the clean energy that’s more affordable than fossil fuels, “and lower the costs to consumers.”

Solar and Storage Stalling Out?

Virginia is a net importer of electricity, meaning it relies on other states to generate power and deliver it through transmission lines to meet peak demand at times, which the weekend of June 22 last year reached 21,361 megawatts in Dominion’s service territory.

But given local pushback against solar and storage projects in Virginia, PJM permitting and supply chain issues, the One Big Beautiful Bill’s new timelines are a “big deal,” said Skyler Zunk, co-founder and CEO of Energy Right, a solar advocacy group rooted in conservative principles.

“This essentially would make them all have to go back and refinance completely. That’s essentially pulling the rug out from under very mature projects that have just not started construction,” said Zunk. “This is very important for AI, advanced computing, advanced transportation growth. This bill would be bigger and more beautiful if it truly kept the incentives in place to produce more electrons domestically.”

Zunk pointed to an Energix solar and storage project, and a Dominion Energy solar project, both in Brunswick County, that could generate 200 and 300 megawatts, respectively. The projects had been approved at the local level but still need a state permit, a cultural resource survey and a geotechnical analysis, meaning “it’s going to be probably a year or more before either of those start construction. Those two would be really affected.”

For those who want fossil fuel forms of energy production, natural gas turbines are experiencing years of delay from supply chain issues, energy developers have stated. And, small modular nuclear reactors aren’t likely to come online until the 2030s and may get hurt by the One Big Beautiful Bill wiping out a provision to allow the transferring, or purchasing, of tax credits to investors who want to wipe out their own tax liability, which allows smaller investors to take more risk on emerging technologies, Godfrey said.

The Virginia Clean Economy Act also has targets for Dominion Energy to build out 16,100 megawatts of solar and storage and wind generation technologies. The utility and Appalachian Power Company, which operates under American Electric Power Company and serves rural southwest Virginia, must acquire 100 percent carbon-free generation portfolios by 2050 through a mix of utility and privately-owned resources.

Dominion Energy did not respond to a request for comment, but in a regulatory filing detailed several IRA and Bipartisan Infrastructure Law funding mechanisms it has applied for while stating, “any incremental credit that the Company receives as a result of the IRA will be passed on to customers through lower project costs.”

Appalachian Power, which is facing rising energy bills and a dwindling customer base, said in a statement, “We are continuing to engage members of the Senate as they consider what has been proposed by the House.”

Offshore Wind on Track?

President Trump has been critical of offshore wind projects, but Virginia has been bullish on the technology since the creation of the Offshore Wind Development Board in 2010.

Gov. Youngkin has touted Dominion’s Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind project as “on-time and on-budget,” when it cost $9.8 billion before any recent increases. CEO Bob Blue reiterated in an earnings call earlier this month that project, which would generate about 2.6 gigawatts of electricity, enough to power about 660,000 homes and avoid the emissions equivalent of about a million cars annually, said “let me be clear, CVOW remains one of the most affordable sources of energy for our customers.”

But Blue also shared that Trump’s tariffs, if continued through 2026 when the project is expected to fully come online, would have a “cumulative tariff impact” of “approximately $500 million.”

Following a $900 million increase earlier this year from PJM interconnection costs and actual tariff costs accrued so far and projected through the end of June this year, the project’s cost has risen to $10.8 billion. Because of a settlement agreement between the company and environmental and ratepayer advocates to ensure protections for any shortfalls in electricity production and cost overruns, 50 percent of the cost increase will be borne by ratepayers.

Dominion initially sought in November to recover $11.23 a month from a residential customer using 1,000 kilowatt hours for CVOW costs before customers could begin receiving credits from the project in later years after it comes online. The costs include a 9.35 percent and 9.7 percent profit margins for the last rate period and the current one, respectively. But the PJM and tariff costs increases for the project equate to an additional about $0.48 monthly increase for those residential customers.

“It is worth noting CVOW was not an IRA project; it was in the pipeline well before the IRA was passed. We felt it made economic sense without that,” Bill Murray, Dominion senior vice president of corporate affairs and communications, said during the Virginia commission meeting. The production tax credits, he added, “certainly help mitigate customer costs…but our read of what passed the U.S. House…is that the CVOW project itself would not be affected.”

Manufacturing Halted?

Farther southwest in the deep red districts of Griffith and McGuire, jobs are hard to come by.

The region, largely beholden to coal, has made efforts to use federal government Abandoned Mine Land Economic Revitalization funds, which sought another round of applications in March for $11 million.

But manufacturing jobs are increasing, including Microporous, a battery manufacturer that announced a $1.3 billion investment for a facility in Pittsylvania County, which has benefited from the IRA tax credits.

There’s also Volvo Trucks North America employing 36,000 people at a plant in Dublin, which has benefited from Commercial Clean Vehicle Credits reducing the costs of electric heavy trucks. The two companies did not respond to a request for comment on the One Big Beautiful Bill.

A press secretary for Youngkin, who cheered the Micorporous announcement, declined to address how loss of the credits could impact the company’s operations and instead cheered the work of Trump Energy Secretary Chris Wright and Department of Interior Secretary Doug Burgum for “unleashing safe, secure, and reliable American energy and power,” without mentioning the word clean.

Peter Finocchio,Yougkin’s spokesperson, also touted the Trump administration and Virginia’s efforts on nuclear, including what could be the first nuclear fusion plant in the world and “several active Small Modular Reactor projects in the works.” Called SMR’s for short, small modular reactors can produce 300 megawatts of electricity and are being looked at as a way to provide carbon-free 24/7 baseload power, though critics question if the technology can be affordable.

Godfrey, with Advanced Energy United, wondered what losing the clean energy purchasing credits may do to the Volvo plant’s sales.

“I think it’s really important for policy makers to take into account the impact of pulling back on some of those demand-side drivers in the form of tax credits like for clean commercial vehicles,” said Godfrey. “I don’t know whether folks in the ninth district are driving those vehicles, but I know they’re making them. If we undercut the clean commercial vehicles incentive, does that continue? I don’t know.”",https://insideclimatenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/solar-1-1024x576.jpg,N,,2025-06-02 06:02:35.349025

The decision affects 24 projects across sectors like advanced materials, industrial decarbonisation and chemical manufacturing. Recipients range from giants like Exxon Mobil and Kraft Heinz to startups like Skyven, Brimstone and Sublime Systems.

Brimstone Energy, also working on low-carbon cement and alumina production, responded with cautious optimism. The startup emphasised its alignment with national priorities, particularly around boosting domestic critical mineral output.

“Given our project’s strong alignment with President Trump’s priority to increase US production of critical minerals, we believe this was a misunderstanding,” Brimstone spokesperson Liza Darwin stated to TechCrunch.

She added, “As the first US-based alumina plant in a generation, our project, which would also make portland cement, would clear a ‘mine-to-metal’ path for US aluminium production, fortifying the U.S. critical mineral supply chain and creating thousands of jobs.”

Under the Trump administration, Energy Secretary Chris Wrights labelled the move “due diligence.” While specific project cancellations weren’t explained, a May 15 memo hints at expanded audit powers being used to justify the cuts.

With funding pulled, the future of these clean energy initiatives is uncertain, stalling innovation efforts aimed at reducing industrial emissions and modernising US manufacturing.

The sudden announcement has taken several recipients by surprise. Sublime Systems, a startup developing low-carbon cement, voiced its disappointment over the DOE’s decision.

“Sublime was surprised and disappointed to receive the news about the termination of our Industrial Demonstrations Program award, given the clear progress we’ve made in scaling our American-invented technology, partnering with some of the Western World’s largest cement producers, and generating a bankable customer base,” spokesperson Rob Kreis told TechCrunch via email. The company is now assessing its path forward.

I’ve already told you about proposed cuts to Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program and a raised tax on private colleges and universities.

Sen. Thom Tillis has been open that he does not support portions of the current version. He’s been most vocal about cuts to clean energy tax credits.

The current version of the bill deters clean energy producers from working with China, limits and then ends tax credits on wind and solar projects and quickly eliminates tax credits for electric vehicles (sorry, Elon Musk).

“Sen. Tillis wants to make sure nothing in the bill impedes jobs or growth,” said Daniel Keylin, Tillis’ senior adviser. “It’s not necessarily about keeping those credits, but it’s about providing those businesses with a soft landing.”

Sen. Ted Budd, a Republican from Davie County, hasn’t spoken publicly about the bill. He’s a staunch supporter of Trump’s and doesn’t often push back on Republican legislation.

The Hill reported Budd was among senators who met with Senate Majority Leader John Thune and Senate Finance Committee Chairman Mike Crapo about Medicaid cuts and what they would mean for rural communities.

His staff did not return a request for comment Friday afternoon about any concerns Budd might have about the bill.

Trump asked the Senate to get the bill passed as soon as possible.

The Senate wants to finish work on the bill before its Fourth of July recess begins on June 28. That would leave the House an additional 12 days to review any changes the Senate made before lawmakers begin their monthlong annual August recess, which starts July 25.

If the Senate follows the House and cuts off the clean-electricity tax credits, it will hurt these next-generation technologies most.
Senate Republicans understand that energy abundance is the essential input for the economy, national security and America’s well-being.","Every so often, Americans rely on the Senate to save us from the more ill-considered urges of the House of Representatives. That time has come again. House Republicans have sent an abysmal reconciliation bill to the Senate that would wreak particular havoc on the country’s energy policy and undermine America’s industrial strength. But the Senate can fix it.

The bill would gut the clean-energy tax credits established in the Inflation Reduction Act to fund tax cuts that would largely benefit high-earning households. The energy tax credits, which were passed under President Joe Biden in 2022, were meant to increase the country’s electricity supply, reinvigorate its battery and electric vehicle supply chains and cut its carbon pollution. They have helped drive a clean-energy manufacturing boom across the country.

I think Republicans are making a mistake by trying to repeal much of the Inflation Reduction Act, though I understand why they’ve been frustrated with Democrats’ sometimes contradictory energy policy. Too often, state and local progressives have called for climate action, but then fought off, shut down or lamented the energy sources — especially hydroelectricity and nuclear power — that until recently generated the bulk of America’s clean electricity.

But Republicans are now the ones pursuing a nonsensical energy strategy. The Inflation Reduction Act improved on decades of failed policy by going technology-neutral — its tax credits support any new power plant that doesn’t generate greenhouse gas emissions. That means technologies that Republicans like, including nuclear fission, geothermal power and even nuclear fusion, could benefit.

By unwinding these tax credits in such a ramshackle and disorganized way, Republicans would undermine many of their own goals. Senate Republicans can still salvage a sensible energy policy from the House’s mad dash.

First, they should preserve tax credits that support innovation and recognize the fact that the United States is currently seeding the next generation of world-leading energy technologies.

Take the new class of nuclear startups that are finally ready to deploy their first power plants. Or the entrepreneurs who have figured out how to use fracking equipmentto deliver cheap, zero-carbon electricity by drilling new geothermal wells. Fervo Energy, one of these geothermal startups, has shown that its drilling tiunes are falling, suggesting that its technology can rapidly take off in the same way that fracking, solar and batteries have. There’s even been recent encouraging news on the nuclear fusion front.

These and other clean-energy developments are the reason there’s the potential for a boom in U.S. electricity. For the first time in decades, American electricity demand is soaring, driven by electric vehicles, data centers and manufacturing.

Without a burst of new supply on the market, this demand will drive up power prices. Low electricity costs have long been a strength of American economic competitiveness that we are now at risk of losing.

Like with any new technology, these next-generation American nuclear and geothermal power plants will be hard to plan and hard to finance. That’s why the government should give them a leg up — much like it once helped the solar, wind and fracking industries — with tax incentives that support early projects. But the G.O.P. reconciliation bill would will make this impossible.

If the Senate follows the House and cuts off the clean-electricity tax credits, it will hurt these next-generation technologies most. Nuclear and geothermal developers in the first stages of building cannot rush their early projects to completion. Even if the Senate adopts the House’s provision to allow nuclear plants to use the tax credits until 2028, it will still not be enough — the procedural hurdles will prevent banks from financing nuclear plants. The Senate should give nuclear and geothermal developers the same long-term certainty it once extended to solar and wind developers.

Second, Republican senators should pay particular attention to the risk of a coming electricity and energy price shock. Today, natural gas provides about a third of America’s primary energy, and it is the country’s No. 1 source of electricity generation. But the country’s gas supply is about to come under more pressure. From 2024 to 2028, 10 new liquified natural gas terminals are expected to open across North America, which would roughly double the United States’ export capacity of the fuel. This would, in turn, increase demand for domestic natural gas supplies.

It’s possible that energy companies would respond to this higher demand by drilling for more gas. But if natural gas supply doesn’t rise as fast as demand, then U.S. natural gas prices will rise to something closer to their global average. Natural gas is three to five times more expensive in Europe than in the United States, so there’s a real chance that American consumers will get soaked.

A monster price shock could also hurt American manufacturers and hold back the artificial intelligence industry. This scenario would worsen if new renewable-energy or zero-carbon power plants — which had been planned under the assumption the tax credits would stay on the books — get canceled.

Finally, Republican senators should be careful not to pull the rug out from under electric vehicle factories that have set up shop in their states. Over the past few months, Republicans have seemed dead set on ditching any policies that help support demand for E.V.s — whether they do so through subsidies, such as the $7,500 tax credit for personal E.V. buyers, or through regulations such as California’s 2035 E.V. rules. At the same time, they have mostly left the supply-side subsidies for E.V. and battery manufacturing in place, although they have still made them harder to access.

But Princeton University’s energy modeling shows that yanking away these supports would ultimately kill the economic case for the hundreds of new E.V. and battery factories under construction nationwide. That’s because the demand- and supply-side incentives are designed to work together. By killing the personal E.V. tax credit, lawmakers would also kill demand for the creation of a domestic critical mineral supply chain — even though reshoring mineral production is a Trump administration goal.

So far, batteries have been this century’s essential energy technology. They will be core to the most important industries of the future in information technology, transportation and warfare. Just look at how battery-powered drones have transformed the Ukraine war. American policymakers would be foolish to give up on the industry for essentially ideological reasons. There is plenty of room to improve America’s battery policy — we should ensure that next-generation batteries are developed and made here — but simply surrendering current technology is misguided.

President Trump understands the importance of cheap electricity. During his Inaugural Address, he bragged that the United States can flex its manufacturing muscles because energy is so much cheaper here than elsewhere. Now his policies risk making energy much more expensive while surrendering any leadership in energy technology whatsoever. It is time for senators to act responsibly — to set a long-term strategy for the country’s energy future. Senate Republicans understand that energy abundance is the essential input for the economy, national security and America’s well-being. Now they must act — and save us from the idiocy that would otherwise result.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/06/02/opinion/02meyer/02meyer-facebookJumbo-v5.jpg,N,,2025-06-02 06:03:09.976493

Searching for the word “climate” produces more than 300 research projects that were set to receive more than $230 million.
In April, the university sued the Trump administration over cuts to its research funding and efforts to exert control over its admissions and governance policies.
“We need people from all parts of society who are trained in geoscience and climate science to address all these global challenges that we are facing,” she says.","The Trump administration has terminated National Science Foundation grants for more than 100 research projects related to climate change amid a widening campaign to slash federal funding for scientists and institutions studying the rising risks of a warming world.

The move will cut off what’s likely to amount to tens of millions of dollars for studies that were previously approved and, in most cases, already in the works.

Affected projects include efforts to develop cleaner fuels, measure methane emissions, improve understanding of how heat waves and sea-level rise disproportionately harm marginalized groups, and help communities transition to sustainable energy, according to an MIT Technology Review review of a GrantWatch database—a volunteer-led effort to track federal cuts to research—and a list of terminated grants from the National Science Foundation (NSF) itself.

The NSF is one of the largest sources of US funding for university research, so the cancellations will deliver a big blow to climate science and clean-energy development.

They come on top of the White House’s broader efforts to cut research funding and revenue for universities and significantly raise their taxes. The administration has also strived to slash staff and budgets at federal research agencies, halt efforts to assess the physical and financial risks of climate change, and shut down labs that have monitored and analyzed the levels of greenhouse gases in the air for decades.

“I don’t think it takes a lot of imagination to understand where this is going,” says Daniel Schrag, co-director of the science, technology, and public policy program at Harvard University, which has seen greater funding cuts than any other university amid an escalating legal conflict with the administration. “I believe the Trump administration intends to zero out funding for climate science altogether.”

The NSF says it’s terminating grants that aren’t aligned with the agency’s program goals, “including but not limited to those on diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI), environmental justice, and misinformation/disinformation.”

Trump administration officials have argued that DEI considerations have contaminated US science, favoring certain groups over others and undermining the public’s trust in researchers.

“Political biases have displaced the vital search for truth,” Michael Kratsios, head of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy, said to a group of NSF administrations and others last month, according to reporting in Science.

Science v. politics

But research projects that got caught in the administration’s anti-DEI filter aren’t the only casualties of the cuts. The NSF has also canceled funding for work that has little obvious connections to DEI ambitions, such as research on catalysts.

Many believe the administration’s broader motivation is to undermine the power of the university system and prevent research findings that cut against its politics.

Trump and his officials have repeatedly argued, in public statements and executive orders, that climate fears are overblown and that burdensome environmental regulations have undermined the nation’s energy security and economic growth.

“It certainly seems like a deliberate attempt to undo any science that contradicts the administration,” says Alexa Fredston, an assistant professor of ocean sciences at the University of California, Santa Cruz.

On May 28, a group of states including California, New York, and Illinois sued the NSF, arguing that the cuts illegally violated diversity goals and funding priorities clearly established by Congress, which controls federal spending.

A group of universities also filed a lawsuit against the NSF over its earlier decision to reduce the indirect cost rate for research, which reimburses universities for overhead expenses associated with work carried out on campuses. The plaintiffs included the California Institute of Technology, Carnegie Mellon University, and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, which has also lost a number of research grants.

(MIT Technology Review is owned by, but editorially independent from, MIT.)

The NSF declined to comment.

‘Theft from the American people’

GrantWatch is an effort among researchers at rOpenSci, Harvard, and other organizations to track terminations of grants issued by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and NSF. It draws on voluntary submissions from scientists involved as well as public government information.

A search of its database for the terms “climate change,” “clean energy,” “climate adaptation,” “environmental justice,” and “climate justice” showed that the NSF has canceled funds for 118 projects, which were supposed to receive more than $100 million in total. Searching for the word “climate” produces more than 300 research projects that were set to receive more than $230 million. (That word often indicates climate-change-related research, but in some abstracts it refers to the cultural climate.)

Some share of those funds has already been issued to research groups. The NSF section of the database doesn’t include that “outlaid” figure, but it’s generally about half the amount of the original grants, according to Noam Ross, a computational researcher and executive director of rOpenSci, a nonprofit initiative that promotes open and reproducible science.

A search for “climate change” among the NIH projects produces another 22 studies that were terminated and were still owed nearly $50 million in grants. Many of those projects explored the mental or physical health effects of climate change and extreme weather events.

The NSF more recently released its own list of terminated projects, which mostly mirrored GrantWatch’s findings and confirms the specific terminations mentioned in this story.

“These grant terminations are theft from the American people,” Ross said in an email response. “By illegally ending this research the Trump administration is wasting taxpayer dollars, gutting US leadership in science, and telling the world that the US government breaks its promises.”

Havard, the country’s oldest university, has been particularly hard hit.

In April, the university sued the Trump administration over cuts to its research funding and efforts to exert control over its admissions and governance policies. The White House, in turn, has moved to eliminate all federal funds for the university, including hundreds of NSF and NIH grants.

Daniel Nocera, a professor at Harvard who has done pioneering work on so-called artificial photosynthesis, a pathway for producing clean fuels from sunlight, said in an email that all of his grants were terminated.

“I have no research funds,” he added.

Another terminated grant involved a collaboration between Harvard and the NSF National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR), designed to update the atmospheric chemistry component of the Community Earth System Model, an open-source climate model widely used by scientists around the world.

The research was expected to “contribute to a better understanding of atmospheric chemistry in the climate system and to improve air quality predictions within the context of climate change,” according to the NSF abstract.

“We completed most of the work and were able to bring it to a stopping point,” Daniel Jacob, a professor at Harvard listed as the principal investigator on the project, said in an email. “But it will affect the ability to study chemistry-climate interactions. And it is clearly not right to pull funding from an existing project.”

Plenty of the affected research projects do, in one way or another, grapple with issues of diversity, equity, and inclusion. But that’s because there is ample evidence that disadvantaged communities experience higher rates of illness from energy-sector pollution, will be harder hit by the escalating effects of extreme weather and are underrepresented in scientific fields.

One of the largest terminations cut off about $4 million dollars of remaining funds for the CLIMATE Justice Initiative, a fellowship program at the University of California, Irvine designed to recruit, train and mentor a more diverse array of researchers in Earth sciences.

The NSF decision occurred halfway into the 5-year program, halting funds for a number of fellows who were in the midst of environmental justice research efforts with community partners in Southern California. Kathleen Johnson, a professor at UC Irvine and director of the initiative, says the university is striving to find ways to fund as many participants as possible for the remainder of their fellowships.

“We need people from all parts of society who are trained in geoscience and climate science to address all these global challenges that we are facing,” she says. “The people who will be best positioned to do this work … are the people who understand the community's needs and are able to therefore work to implement equitable solutions.”

“Diverse teams have been shown to do better science,” Johnson adds.

Numerous researchers whose grants were terminated didn’t respond to inquiries from MIT Technology Review or declined to comment, amid growing concerns that the Trump administration will punish scientists or institutions that criticize their policies.

Coming cuts

The termination of existing NSF and NIH grants is just the start of the administration’s plans to cut federal funding for climate and clean-energy research.

The White House’s budget proposal for the coming fiscal year seeks to eliminate tens of billions of dollars in funding across federal agencies, specifically calling out “Green New Scam funds” at the Department of Energy; “low-priority climate monitoring satellites” at NASA; “climate-dominated research, data, and grant programs” at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration; and “climate; clean energy; woke social, behavioral, and economic sciences” at the NSF.

The administration released a more detailed NSF budget proposal on May 30th, which called for a 60% reduction in research spending and nearly zeroed out the clean energy technology program. It also proposed cutting funds by 97% for the US Global Change Research Program, which produces regular assessments of climate risks; 80% for the Ocean Observatories Initiative, a global network of ocean sensors that monitor shifting marine conditions; and 40% for NCAR, the atmospheric research center.

If Congress approves budget reductions anywhere near the levels the administration has put forward, scientists fear, it could eliminate the resources necessary to carry on long-running climate observation of oceans, forests, and the atmosphere.

The administration also reportedly plans to end the leases on dozens of NOAA facilities, including the Global Monitoring Laboratory in Hilo, Hawaii. The lab supports the work of the nearby Mauna Loa Observatory, which has tracked atmospheric carbon dioxide levels for decades.

Even short gaps in these time-series studies, which scientists around the world rely upon, would have an enduring impact on researchers’ ability to analyze and understand weather and climate trends.

“We won’t know where we’re going if we stop measuring what’s happening,” says Jane Long, formerly the associate director of energy and environment at Lawrence Livermore National Lab. “It’s devastating—there’s no two ways around it.”

Stunting science

Growing fears that public research funding will take an even larger hit in the coming fiscal year are forcing scientists to rethink their research plans—or to reconsider whether they want to stay in the field at all, numerous observers said.

“The amount of funding we’re talking about isn’t something a university can fill indefinitely, and it’s not something that private philanthropy can fill for very long,” says Michael Oppenheimer, a professor of geosciences and international affairs at Princeton University. “So what we’re talking about is potentially cataclysmic for climate science.”

“Basically it’s a shit show,” he adds, “and how bad a shit show it is will depend a lot on what happens in the courts and Congress over the next few months.”

One climate scientist, who declined to speak on the record out of concern that the administration might punish his institution, said the declining funding is forcing researchers to shrink their scientific ambitions down to a question of “What can I do with my laptop and existing data sets?”

“If your goal was to make the United States a second-class or third-class country when it comes to science and education, you would be doing exactly what the administration is doing,” the scientist said. “People are pretty depressed, upset, and afraid.”

Given the rising challenges, Harvard’s Schrag fears that the best young climate scientists will decide to shift their careers outside of the US, or move into high tech or other fields where they can make significantly more money.

“We might lose a generation of talent—and that’s not going to get fixed four years from now,” he says. “The irony is that Trump is attacking the institutions and foundation of US science that literally made America great.”","https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/research-cuts.jpg?resize=1200,600",N,,2025-06-02 06:03:50.136964

And it’s not just about California. The move also applies to nearly a dozen states in step with the Golden State’s zero-emissions requirement, set to start phasing in next year.

President Trump has promised to sign the congressional action into law. And as soon as he does, California says, it will sue.

Regardless of the outcome, the revocation is a significant rebuke to states’ self-determination and, more specifically, any state hoping to push the nation to quickly abandon fossil fuels in favor of electrification for vehicles. The scientific consensus says greenhouse gas emissions must be cut dramatically within the next five years to mitigate the worst effects of climate change.

Why We Wrote This

The drive for electric vehicles, in California and beyond, is challenging carmakers to adapt faster than many deem possible or profitable. The Trump administration is pushing back by testing the limits of state governance.

“It will slow down adoption,” says Stephanie Valdez Streaty, of Cox Automotive Inc., a technology provider to the industry.

Here, the Monitor explains why California plays such an outsize role in auto emissions standards, why this has met strenuous pushback, and where things might go from here.

Why is California so important when it comes to auto emissions?

Because California’s smog is so bad, the federal government has, for more than 50 years, allowed the state to set its own emissions limits, resulting in more efficient vehicles and the nation’s most aggressive push toward electric vehicles. Other smoggy states have followed suit. But each new standard or rule requires approval from the Environmental Protection Agency, which has accepted all of the exceptions. Now Congress is saying “no,” not this time. Not for an EV mandate.

Back in the 1960s and 1970s, Los Angeles’ air was so polluted that some folks wore gas masks. Schools regularly sent kids home because of thick smog. You frequently couldn’t see the iconic Hollywood sign.

Vehicles were the main culprit, as was the area’s geography and climate. LA sits in a basin and gets lots of sunshine. When sunlight mixes with tailpipe emissions, it makes dangerous ozone. Smog in the basin has drastically improved, but as of 2020, more than 150 days exceeded the most recent federal ozone standards. Heavy truck traffic has also contributed to terrible pollution in California’s Central Valley. The EPA is considering fining Southern California for failing to meet federal air quality standards.

California’s influence is also due to its size. As the nation’s most populous state, it has the largest auto market. If California were a country, it would be the world’s fourth-largest economy. So when California sets new emission standards – and other states follow – the auto industry is compelled to adopt them.

As a result, the state has frequently exercised that power, driving changes in the nation’s standards and technology, including the adoption of catalytic converters. “California’s ambitious goals are what pushes the industry,” says Ann Carlson, who teaches law at the University of California, Los Angeles, and who helped write tailpipe emission policies for the Biden administration.

Why are Congress, the president, and the U.S. auto industry all pushing back on EVs?

Many people feel that California’s zero-emissions standard is moving toward an EV switchover too fast, and forcing that change on the nation. Climate change politics, too, play a role.

Beginning next year, the California mandate will call for 35% of the state’s new vehicle sales to be zero-emission or plug-in hybrid. That proportion is scheduled to rise to 100% by 2035. Other state rules that relate to medium- and heavy-duty truck sales and engine standards were also revoked by Congress and await the president’s signature.

“Democrats have this delusional dream of eliminating gas-powered vehicles in America,” Republican Sen. John Barrasso of Wyoming said on the Senate floor in May. “They want to force-feed electric vehicles to every man and woman who drives in this country.”

California leads the nation in zero-emission sales and EV infrastructure, with more than 1.25 million electric vehicle registrations and more than 52,000 public charging ports.

But California is behind in meeting its own mandate timetable – so far, EVs are 23% of all sales this year. And the congressional pushback was bipartisan in the House, where 35 Democrats supported the rollback of the mandate, including two from California. The Senate vote fell almost entirely along party lines.

Consumers have concerns about insufficient and unreliable charging stations, battery range and quality, and high prices for EVs. The sense among manufacturers and auto dealers is that “the market isn’t ready for these aggressive goals,” says Ms. Valdez Streaty. Automakers want guidelines for all states, not just some of them, she says.

What’s the outlook for EVs – and California’s role?

First, we’re heading into legal wrangling. Both the Senate parliamentarian and the independent U.S. Government Accountability Office said that the procedure used to block the California waivers was not allowed. That will be one thing California will argue when it sues to keep the mandate.

Republicans are also likely to cut federal infrastructure funds for charging stations and tax credits for purchasing electric vehicles. In April, EV sales took a hit after record sales in the first quarter, according to Cox Automotive. And then there’s the uncertainty around tariffs.

“It’s going to be a bumpy ride this year” for EVs, says Ms. Valdez Streaty, who expects more sales of gas and plug-in hybrids as transitional vehicles. At the same time, new all-electric models are being introduced, and battery range is improving, now averaging around 300 miles per charge.

“Long term, we’re still going to continue towards electrification, but the timeline to get there is going to shift and slow down,” says Ms. Valdez Streaty.

California’s political leaders say revoking the mandate will be expensive. According to the California Air Resources Board, which crafted the mandate, adhering to it would result in 1,287 fewer air-quality-related deaths, 1,110 fewer hospital and emergency visits, and $13 billion in public health benefits. It would also reduce greenhouse gas emissions by nearly 400 million metric tons – the equivalent of 100 coal-fired power plants’ annual output.

The nation, too, will pay a price in global competition, particularly with China, which is on a tear with lower-cost electric vehicles.

“We won’t stand by as Trump Republicans make America smoggy again — undoing work that goes back to the days of Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan — all while ceding our economic future to China,” said California’s Democratic governor, Gavin Newsom, in a statement.

It’s possible to see state authority restored, says Professor Carlson at UCLA. But California and other states “still have a lot of their own authority to try to stimulate electric vehicle demand and supply,” she says. They can build out charging infrastructure, provide tax incentives and subsidies, and favor electric vehicles in parking and carpool lanes. And they can work together, as they plan to in the recently announced 11-state Affordable Clean Cars Coalition.

Technology will continue to advance, with or without the California mandate, concludes Professor Carlson. The world, she adds, is moving in that direction.",https://images.csmonitor.com/csm/2025/05/0530%20NCALEV%20charger%20lede.jpg?alias=standard_900x600,N,,2025-06-02 09:11:03.577701

This approach prevents data centers from overwhelming the broader grid during periods of high demand, making the whole grid more resilient.
Combining these resources can create a reliable energy supply tailored to the unique demands of data centers.
But there’s another critical — and unexpected — benefit to integrating microgrids with data centers: growing healthy, fresh food year-round.","In April, researchers at the International Energy Agency projected that electricity consumption from data centers that power AI and cloud computing will more than double by 2030. They’ll account for an estimated 9% of U.S. energy usage by that time. For our state, this could mean higher energy costs and an electric grid pushed past its limit.

But, for Ohio’s rural communities, this isn’t just a challenge. It’s also an opportunity.

As data centers pull a massive amount of energy from the grid, Ohio is pioneering an innovative solution: building “microgrids” at data center sites. Microgrids are small, self-sufficient energy systems that can run independently from the main electrical grid. They generate and store energy onsite using sources including natural gas and renewables. This approach prevents data centers from overwhelming the broader grid during periods of high demand, making the whole grid more resilient.

Ohio is uniquely positioned to scale up microgrid technology. Our state sits atop abundant natural gas reserves, including the Utica and Marcellus shale formations, providing a stable, low-cost fuel source. Ohio’s growing renewable energy sector offers further flexibility for powering microgrids in a sustainable way. Combining these resources can create a reliable energy supply tailored to the unique demands of data centers. Developing these microgrids also offers an economic opportunity, including good-paying jobs in construction, engineering, energy management, and data infrastructure.

But there’s another critical — and unexpected — benefit to integrating microgrids with data centers: growing healthy, fresh food year-round.

Data centers produce substantial heat and carbon dioxide — byproducts typically viewed as waste. Yet, these resources can be repurposed effectively through controlled-environment agriculture, turning them into powerful growth accelerators for local crops. The idea is simple: excess heat from data center operations can warm greenhouses, while carbon dioxide emissions can boost plant growth, creating ideal conditions for high-quality produce.

Imagine Ohio-grown strawberries, lettuce, and tomatoes harvested freshly in January and February, when there’s still deep snow on the ground, powered sustainably by waste heat from AI-driven computing facilities. This approach drastically reduces transportation emissions, minimizes food spoilage, and lessens dependence on distant agricultural markets.

As a sixth-generation Ohio farmer who has also spent years in energy and technology, I see exciting synergies emerging in how we grow our food and power our economy. New innovations now allow us to transform what was previously considered waste and pollution into productive resources. For Ohio farmers, creatively utilizing waste isn’t a novel concept. We’ve always turned animal waste into nutrient-rich fertilizer and crop residues into sustainable soil amendments.

Our state needs a plan to proactively seize opportunities with the growth of data infrastructure and AI — including the use of local energy, the maximization of local job creation, and other less obvious prospects like the expansion of year-round produce options. This should be a team effort: local and state governments, business leaders, foundations, the tech sector, farmers, and others all have a role to play.

If we fail to strategically plan the growth of data centers in Ohio, we risk higher energy costs and compromised grid reliability without generating meaningful job creation or community benefits. Likewise, if we fail to invest in local, sustainable, healthy food, we risk worsening a crisis of poor nutrition and chronic disease.

Ohio should show the world how to address both challenges at the same time.",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/s3/files/styles/social_large/s3/articles/feeds-state-94/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/gettyimages-982423716-1024x6831748853239.jpg?h=199d8c1f&itok=RE9aFAYD,N,,2025-06-02 10:03:23.163731

Its treatment system is far out of date, posing serious health and environmental risks.
The system is especially bad in underserved parts of the city, Sealy said.
In early April, as the EPA canceled grants for similar projects across the country, federal officials assured Thomasville that their funding was on track.

Thomasville, Georgia, has a water problem. Its treatment system is far out of date, posing serious health and environmental risks.

“We have wastewater infrastructure that is old,” said Sheryl Sealy, the assistant city manager for this city of 18,881 near the Florida border, about 45 minutes from Tallahassee. “It’s critical that we do the work to replace this.”

But it’s expensive to replace. The system is especially bad in underserved parts of the city, Sealy said.

In September, Thomasville applied to get some help from the federal government, and just under four months later, the city and its partners were awarded a nearly $20 million Community Change grant from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to make the long-overdue wastewater improvements, build a resilience hub and health clinic, and upgrade homes in several historic neighborhoods.

“The grant itself was really a godsend for us,” Sealy said.

In early April, as the EPA canceled grants for similar projects across the country, federal officials assured Thomasville that their funding was on track. Then on May 1, the city received a termination notice.

“We felt, you know, a little taken off guard when the bottom did let out for us,” said Sealy.

Thomasville isn’t alone.

Under the Trump administration, the EPA has canceled or interrupted hundreds of grants aimed at improving health and severe weather preparedness because the agency “determined that the grant applications no longer support administration priorities,” according to an emailed statement to Grist.

The cuts are part of a broader gutting of federal programs aimed at furthering environmental justice, an umbrella term for the effort to help communities that have been hardest hit by pollution and other environmental issues, which often include low-income communities and communities of color.

In Thomasville’s case, the city has a history of heavy industry that has led to poor air quality. Air pollution, health concerns, and high poverty qualified the surrounding county for the Biden administration’s Justice40 initiative, which prioritized funding for disadvantaged communities. Thomasville has some of the highest exposure risks in Georgia to toxic air pollutants that can cause respiratory, reproductive, and developmental health problems, according to the Environmental Defense Fund’s Climate Vulnerability Index. The city’s wastewater woes don’t only mean the potential for sewage backups in homes and spills into local waterways but also the risk of upper respiratory problems, according to Zealan Hoover, a former Biden administration EPA official who is now advising the advocacy groups Environmental Protection Network and Lawyers for Good Government.

“These projects were selected because they have a really clear path to alleviating the health challenges facing this community,” he said.

Critics argue there’s a disconnect between the Trump administration’s attack on the concept of environmental justice and the realities of what the funds are paying for.

“What is it about building a new health clinic and upgrading wastewater infrastructure … that’s inconsistent with administration policy?” Democratic Georgia Senator Jon Ossoff asked EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin at a recent hearing.

Zeldin repeatedly responded by discussing the agency’s review process intended to comply with President Donald Trump’s executive orders, particularly those related to diversity, equity, and inclusion policies, but Ossoff cut him off, pushing for a specific answer about Thomasville’s grant. “Is a new health clinic for Thomasville, Georgia, woke?” he asked.

Thomasville’s Sealy said she understands that the federal government has to make hard funding decisions — that’s true locally too — but losing this grant has left her city in the lurch. In addition to the planned work on the wastewater collection system, the city needs to update its treatment plant to meet EPA standards. That overhaul will likely cost $60 million to $70 million, she said.

“How do you fund that?” Sealy asked. “You can’t fund that on the backs of the people who pay our rates.”

The funding cuts have left cities across Georgia — including Athens, Norcross, and Savannah — as well as nonprofit groups, in a state of uncertainty: some grants terminated, some suspended then reinstated, some still unclear. This puts city officials in an impossible position, unable to wait or to move forward, according to Athens-Clarke County Sustainability Director Mike Wharton.

“Do you commit to new programs? Do you commit to services?” he said. “Here you are sitting in limbo for months.”

Like Thomasville, Athens was also awarded a nearly $20 million Community Change grant. The city was going to use the money for backup generators, solar power, and battery storage at its public safety complex — ensuring 911, police, the jail, a domestic violence shelter, and other services could all operate during a power outage. That grant has been terminated.

The problem, Wharton said, goes beyond that money not coming in; the city had already spent time, resources, and money to get the grant.

“We spent $60,000 in local funding hiring people to write the grants,” he said. “Over a period of 14 months we invested over 700 hours of local personnel time. So we diverted our services to focus on these things.”

These frustrations are playing out for grant recipients throughout the state and country, according to Hoover. He said it’s not just confusing — it’s expensive.

“They are causing project costs to skyrocket because they keep freezing and unfreezing and refreezing projects,” he said. “One of the big drivers of cost overruns in any infrastructure project, public or private, is having to demobilize and remobilize your teams.”

Thomasville and Athens officials both said they’re appealing their grant terminations, which require them to submit a formal letter outlining the reasons for their appeal and requesting the agency reconsider the decision. They’re also reaching out to their elected officials, hoping that pressure from their senators and members of Congress can get them the federal money they were promised.

Other cities and nonprofits, as well as a group of Democratic state attorneys general, have sued, arguing that terminating their grants without following proper procedures is illegal. But that’s a difficult step for many localities to take.

“Suing the federal government to assert your legal rights is very daunting, even if the law is on your side,” Hoover said.",https://grist.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/wastewater-2.jpg?quality=75&strip=all,N,,2025-06-02 06:03:55.054504

Only in recent months has the mine become able to chemically separate the rare earths in more than half its output.","Two decades ago, factories in Indiana that turned rare earth metals into magnets moved production to China — just as demand for the magnets was starting to soar for everything from cars and semiconductors to fighter jets and robots.

The United States is now reckoning with the cost of losing that supply chain. The Chinese government abruptly halted exports of rare earth magnets to any country on April 4 as part of its trade war with the United States.

American officials had expected that China would relax its restrictions on the magnets as part of the trade truce the two countries reached in mid-May. But on Friday, President Trump suggested that China had continued to limit access.

Now, American and European companies are running out of the magnets.

American automakers are the hardest hit, with executives warning that production at factories across the Midwest and South could be cut back in the coming days and weeks. Carmakers need the magnets for the electric motors that run brakes, steering and fuel injectors. The motors in a single luxury car seat, for example, use as many as 12 magnets.

The Chinese government has said little lately about its rare earth export restrictions. Kevin Hassett, the director of the White House National Economic Council, said on ABC’s “This Week” on Sunday that Mr. Trump and China’s leader, Xi Jinping, could speak about trade as soon as this week, though no date had been set.

After China stopped all exports, it said that future shipments would require separate export licenses. China’s Ministry of Commerce has struggled since then to issue licenses. It gave a handful to European companies in mid-April and a few more for American companies last week, but world supplies are dwindling fast.

“There are a few approvals coming through, but they are far from being sufficient to prevent imminent production halts,” said Jens Eskelund, the president of the European Union Chamber of Commerce in China. “We are still facing a major disruption of supply chains.”

To make matters worse, some Chinese rare earth magnet makers have stopped producing while waiting for permission to resume exports. The weekslong gap in magnet production is moving through supply chains and may soon reach manufacturers.

“China could bring America’s automotive assembly plants to a standstill,” said Michael Dunne, an automotive consultant specializing in China.

China produces 90 percent of the world’s nearly 200,000 tons a year of high-performance rare earth magnets. Japanese companies produce most of the rest in Japan and Vietnam, mainly for Japanese manufacturers.

The United States produces practically none, although small factories will start full production this year in South Carolina and Texas. A succession of administrations has tried to restart the industry ever since China drew attention to its dominance by imposing a two-month embargo on shipments of rare earths to Japan during a territorial dispute in 2010.

Worldwide sales of mined rare earths total only $5 billion a year. That is minuscule compared with $300 billion industries like copper mining or iron ore mining.

China has a formidable competitive advantage. The state-owned industry has few environmental compliance costs for its mines and an almost unlimited government budget for building huge processing refineries and magnet factories.

Processing rare earths is technically demanding, but China has developed new processes. Rare earth chemistry programs are offered in 39 universities across the country, while the United States has no similar programs.

China refines over 99 percent of the world’s supply of so-called heavy rare earths, which are the least common kinds of rare earths. Heavy rare earths are essential for making magnets that can resist the high temperatures and electrical fields found in cars, semiconductors and many other technologies.

The sole American rare earths mine, located in Mountain Pass, Calif., stopped producing in 1998 after traces of heavy metals and faintly radioactive material leaked from a desert pipeline. Chinese state-controlled companies tried three times without success to buy the defunct mine before it was acquired by American investors in 2008.

A $1 billion Pentagon-backed investment program followed in 2010 to improve environmental compliance and expand the mine and its adjacent refinery. But the costly complex was unable to compete when it briefly reopened in 2014, and closed again the next year.

MP Materials, a Chicago investor group that included a minority partner company partly owned by the Chinese government, bought the mine in 2017. The mine reopened the next year, but shipped its ore to China for the difficult task of separating the various kinds of rare earths.

Only in recent months has the mine become able to chemically separate the rare earths in more than half its output. But this loses money because processing in China is so inexpensive.

MP Materials built the new factory in Texas that will turn separated rare earths into magnets.

A considerable bottleneck lies in transforming separated rare earths into chemically pure metal ingots that can be fed into the furnaces of magnet-making machines. A New England start-up, Phoenix Tailings, is addressing that shortcoming, but its small scale underlines the challenge.

Phoenix Tailings has taken over much of the staff and equipment of Infinium, a start-up that had tried to do the same thing. Infinium ran out of money in 2020, when American policymakers were more focused on the Covid-19 pandemic than rare earths.

With Chinese rare earth minerals hard to get, Phoenix makes the metal from mine tailings: leftover material at mines that has already been processed once to remove another material, like iron.

Phoenix Tailings has four machines each the size of a small cottage at its factory in Burlington, Mass. Each one produces a 6.6-pound ingot every three hours around the clock. The operation’s overall capacity is 40 tons a year, said Nick Myers, Phoenix’s chief executive. He declined to identify the buyer but said it was an automotive company.

Phoenix is installing equipment at a larger site in Exeter, N.H., to produce metal at a rate of 200 tons a year — still tiny compared with Chinese factories that produce more than that in a month.

Thomas Villalón Jr., Phoenix’s chief technical officer, said that ramping up production quickly was important during a trade war: “It’s a race right now.”

The US Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) of 2022 launched a 10-year clean energy industrial policy, but core elements now face repeal under the “Big, Beautiful Bill.” The House of Representatives approved the bill, and the Senate will vote next.

Unprecedented announcements in US clean energy followed the 2022 law. E2 tracks these announcements in its Clean Economy Works report. Since the IRA was passed, over 390 clean energy projects in 42 states representing over $130 billion in investment and 120,000 jobs have been announced, according to the report.

However, if the Senate passes the budget resolution as-written, core elements of the IRA, including the Investment Tax Credit and Production Tax Credit, will be repealed for projects not placed in service by 2028. This ends critical clean energy industrial policy support about five years ahead of schedule.

This uncertainty, combined with uncertainty surrounding tariff rates and enforcement, has led to a growing number of cancelled projects and factories. E2 said $14 billion in clean energy projects and 10,000 jobs have been cancelled in 2025. About $4.5 billion in cancellations occurred in April alone, said E2.

“Now is not the time to raise taxes on clean energy and compound the business uncertainty that is clearly taking a greater and greater toll on US manufacturing and jobs,” said Michael Timberlake, director of communications at E2.

Most of the canceled investments occurred in Republican districts. Democratic House members unanimously voted against the budget bill, but it was approved by a razor-thin majority due to strong Republican support.

More than $12 billion in investment and 13,000 jobs have been cancelled in Republican voting districts thus far, said E2. Through April, over 61% of all clean energy projects announced – along with 72% of all jobs and 82% of all investments – are in congressional districts represented by Republicans.

“Businesses are now counting on Congress to come to its senses and stop this costly attack on an industry that is essential to meeting America’s growing energy demand and that’s driving unprecedented economic growth in every part of the country,” said Timberlake.

Eddystone generating station was to shut down its last operational units on 31 May 2025 but is now mandated to remain online due to an order from the Energy Department, as reported by Bloomberg.

The directive invokes a provision of federal law that is typically reserved for emergencies, including extreme weather events and wartime situations.

Owned and operated by Constellation, the Eddystone generating station began operations in 1960.

With a capacity of 820MW, it is located on the Delaware River in Eddystone, Pennsylvania, south of Philadelphia.

The plant has two remaining units capable of burning either natural gas or oil during times of high power demand.

The latest order comes after a department mandate on 23 May 2025 that the JH Campbell coal-fired power plant in West Olive, Michigan, remain active past its planned shutdown date of 31 May.

The Trump administration states that these actions were prompted by various factors, including an electricity shortage. This decision faced criticism from the chair of the Michigan Public Service Commission, who argued that there was no actual emergency.

Natural Resources Defence Council managing director Kit Kennedy was quoted by the media outlet: “The Department of Energy’s move to keep these zombie plants online will have significant public health impacts and increase electricity costs for people in Michigan and Pennsylvania.

“These dirty and expensive fossil plants were slated to close because they could not compete with cheaper, cleaner alternatives.”

The Energy Department issued a second order following PJM Interconnection’s acceptance of Constellation’s retirement notice for its Eddystone plant following an evaluation of whether the plant’s closure would impact grid reliability. However, in a statement released on 31 May, PJM, which oversees the largest US grid stretching from Washington DC to Illinois, expressed its support for the Energy Department’s order.

On Saturday 31 May, following the order, Constellation announced immediate actions aimed at maintaining operations at last units at its Eddystone power plant throughout the summer months while exploring options for extended functionality until work can be completed at Pennsylvania’s closed Three Mile Island nuclear plant.

Constellation is collaborating with PJM in plans to restart the nuclear reactor by 2027. Constellation had originally expected it to become operational in 2028.",https://www.power-technology.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/21/2025/06/Eddystone-Generating-Station.jpg,N,,2025-06-02 06:03:17.893945

In all, North Carolina boasts over 109,000 clean energy jobs, the ninth most in the country, per the national nonprofit E2.
This 10-year runway of economic certainty sparked a wave of clean energy development across the country.
“Removing these credits would pull the rug out from under the auto and aligned battery industries at a critical time, immediately putting North Carolina jobs at risk,” he said.
Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, Jerry Moran of Kansas, and John Curtis of Utah — echoes concerns flagged by clean energy advocates and businesses.","Now that the U.S. House of Representatives has passed a measure to kill nearly every federal tax credit there is to support the clean energy transition, gobsmacked advocates and industry leaders in solar, wind, and electric vehicles are looking desperately to the Senate to amend it.

In North Carolina, that means all eyes turn to senior U.S. Sen. Thom Tillis, a second-term Republican up for reelection next year in this steadfast purple state, which is already reaping benefits from the clean energy economy.

“Sen. Tillis is going to be so important, along with other voices,” said Stephen Smith, executive director of the nonprofit Southern Alliance for Clean Energy, ​“because he has indicated that we don’t want to whipsaw 180 degrees back and forth between approaches to energy policy.”

Tillis is among four Senate Republicans who signed an April letter urging a targeted approach to reforming renewable energy tax incentives rather than a wholesale repeal. The four signatories alone could sink the House measure if they joined Senate Democrats in opposing it.

The senator’s stance, the economic benefits of clean energy, and bipartisan support among voters for solar, wind, and efficiency all give advocates in the state some cause for cautious optimism. So does the reality that solar and batteries are the quickest, cheapest way to solidify the nation’s ​“energy dominance,” a frequently stated goal of President Donald Trump.

“We need energy today and tomorrow,” said Chris Carmody, executive director of Carolinas Clean Energy Business Association, a trade group. ​“Not only are renewables and storage the lowest-cost option, they’re also the fastest to build.”

The clean energy economy has an intricate foothold in North Carolina. Largely owing to its acres upon acres of solar fields, the state was home to the fourth most solar capacity in the country last year, supporting over 7,000 jobs, according to the Solar Energy Industries Association. And the region doesn’t just use solar equipment, it also makes it: Vietnamese panel manufacturer Boviet Solar opened its first U.S. plant in Greenville, North Carolina, in April, with plans for expansion next year that would create over 1,300 local jobs.

The Tar Heel State is also a leader in the emerging electric vehicle supply chain, with lithium mines, Toyota’s massive battery plant in Randolph County, and EV factories all in the works. Its robust manufacturing sector already produces a number of renewable energy components. In all, North Carolina boasts over 109,000 clean energy jobs, the ninth most in the country, per the national nonprofit E2.

The federal tax credits that helped spur this economic activity were first enacted decades ago with bipartisan support. Combined with favorable state policies, that means that wind, solar, and battery storage were on the rise during the first Trump administration and before. But the incentives were undoubtedly supercharged by the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022.

The landmark climate law extended the tax credits for large wind and solar projects and rooftop solar through 2032, then tapered them down over several years. It enacted new and expanded incentives for rooftop solar, EV purchases, and energy-efficiency improvements, set to end around the same time. It also included an advanced manufacturing incentive, designed to spur domestic production of minerals, battery components, and more.

This 10-year runway of economic certainty sparked a wave of clean energy development across the country. After the passage of the climate law in August 2022, E2 says 27 new projects were announced in North Carolina alone, representing an investment of over $21 billion.

House bill takes sledgehammer, not scalpel, to clean energy incentives

Experts say the House Republicans’ budget measure, which cleared the chamber by just one vote, would imperil all of these economic gains. The tax credits that benefit large clean energy projects will last until 2028, but only for those that begin construction within 60 days of the bill’s passage, an impossibility for most.

“Unless your project is shovel-ready and has gotten every permit, there’s no project, in any type of energy, that can go from zero to begin in 60 days,” Carmody said.

The rare developer who can begin construction that quickly faces another seemingly insurmountable hurdle: It must document that no component of its project, no matter how small, is linked to a ​“Foreign Entity of Concern” such as China. That requirement also applies to the advanced energy manufacturing tax credit, rendering that incentive all but useless even though it’s extended beyond 2028.

“It’s never been done before for any industry. It’s incredibly onerous,” said John Szoka, CEO of the Conservative Energy Network. ​“We have a global interconnected economy. We definitely want more manufacturing back in the U.S., and I agree with the president 100% on that. But the way that [provision] is worded, it’s almost impossible to meet.”

The House bill abruptly eliminates at year’s end an array of tax credits for EVs and charging infrastructure. Combined with the poison-pill provision on foreign components in advanced manufacturing, the termination of those incentives could kneecap the state’s burgeoning EV sector.

“The bill passed by the House takes a sledgehammer to North Carolina’s EV industry and undermines efforts to build secure and reliable access to critical minerals,” said Ben Prochazka, the North Carolina-based executive director of the Electrification Coalition, a national nonprofit.

“Removing these credits would pull the rug out from under the auto and aligned battery industries at a critical time, immediately putting North Carolina jobs at risk,” he said.

Individual consumers are dealt perhaps the sharpest blow by the House bill. Like the EV incentives, the credits for rooftop solar, energy-efficiency improvements, and the like would be eliminated at the end of this year. Studies show the resulting spike in demand for gasoline and increased electricity use will raise costs for everyone.

Tillis says budget bill will undergo changes in the Senate

Tillis’ office didn’t respond to a request for comment. But the letter he penned in April — along with Sens. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, Jerry Moran of Kansas, and John Curtis of Utah — echoes concerns flagged by clean energy advocates and businesses.

“For energy credits that provide a direct passthrough benefit to ratepayers, repeals would translate into immediate utility bill increases, placing additional strain on hardworking Americans,” the senators warn.

They advocate a ​“balanced” approach to reforming the tax incentives. ​“We caution against the full-scale repeal of current credits, which could lead to significant disruptions for the American people and weaken our position as a global energy leader,” the letter says.

Noting the ​“substantial” investments American companies have already made ​“based on the current energy tax framework,” the senators also write that a complete repeal would inject uncertainty into the market — jeopardizing capital allocation, long-term project planning, and job creation.

After the passage of the House bill just before Memorial Day weekend, Politico reported that Tillis wasn’t backing away from his letter.

“We have a lot of work that we need to do on the timeline and scope of the production and investment tax credits,” the incentives that mostly benefit large wind and solar projects, he told Politico. ​“Undoubtedly, there’s going to be changes.”

Carmody says the comments fit with Tillis’ track record.

“We applaud his position so far and his effort to support a stable and predictable tax system here,” Carmody said. ​“Sen. Tillis is long acquainted with energy business in North Carolina, and he understands the need for certainty for all kinds of industries.”

Polls show Tillis would be on firm political ground if he stood up for the state’s clean energy economy. The most recent survey from Conservatives for Clean Energy shows 72% of all voters in North Carolina, including 55% of Republicans, favor politicians who ​“support policies that encourage renewable options.”

Asked specifically about ​“President Trump’s American energy dominance policy,” only a quarter of the state’s voters, including just under half of Republicans, said they agreed with his plan to ​“expand fossil fuel production while limiting … renewable energy sources like wind and solar.”

The conservative case for extending renewable energy tax incentives is straightforward, said Szoka, who is a former Republican legislator in the North Carolina House of Representatives.

“All forms of energy generation are subsidized in the United States. Every single one — some that have been around longer than newer technologies,” he said, noting that the oil and gas sector has access to tax deductions worth up to 80% of drilling costs.

“I’ve got nothing against the oil and gas industry,” Szoka added. But there’s no reason it should continue to receive tax benefits while those for renewables are so abruptly axed, he said.

Szoka and other conservatives say renewables shouldn’t get incentives indefinitely, and they aren’t committed to the timelines in the Inflation Reduction Act. They also say the fact that the law was passed with only Democratic votes makes it susceptible to attack from the Republican trifecta.

As the world intensifies its efforts to combat climate change, industries under mounting scrutiny are being challenged to innovate or become obsolete. Cement production, responsible for approximately 8% of global CO₂ emissions, is a prime target for transformation. Now, a pioneering solution from UK-based company RockFuel promises to revolutionise the sector: a Carbon Negative cement process that doesn’t just lower emissions – it reverses them.

With a patented closed-loop manufacturing system that produces ‘carbon neutral CO₂’, RockFuel’s approach offers a scalable, economically viable, and truly climate-positive alternative to conventional cement. This development marks a significant milestone in sustainable construction and positions RockFuel as a key player in the decarbonisation of the global construction materials industry.

Cementing a new future with carbon capture

At the heart of this innovation is RockFuel’s Carbon Neutral Lime Kiln, a high-efficiency system that produces quicklime (CaO) while capturing the CO₂ released during the process. Traditional cement kilns vent this CO₂ directly into the atmosphere. RockFuel’s closed-loop kiln, powered entirely by renewable energy sources – including solar, wind, hydroelectric, or energy recovered from other RockFuel processes – collects over 500 cubic metres of hot CO₂ per cubic metre of limestone rock processed, storing it in a dedicated tank for reuse.

The captured CO₂ is not simply stored or sequestered, it is reintegrated into the production cycle in a novel way, forming the basis of RockFuel’s Carbon Negative cement solution. By closing the loop and incorporating carbon capture at the manufacturing stage, RockFuel offers a blueprint for next-generation industrial processes.

From emission source to carbon sink

In RockFuel’s Carbon Neutral cement process, the cement begins as quicklime (CaO – Calcium Oxide), produced in the company’s kiln from CaCO3, powered by Carbon Neutral energy. It is then blended with clay to create cement, while the captured CO₂ undergoes electrolysis, using excess energy from the system, which contributes towards a carbon-neutral process. This yields solid carbon and carbon-neutral oxygen, both valuable industrial byproducts.

Solid carbon can be used in advanced materials such as carbon fibre and graphene, while oxygen finds applications in steel manufacturing, wastewater treatment, medical technology, and the chemical industry. This multi-output system ensures minimal waste and creates new revenue opportunities, enhancing commercial appeal for investors and manufacturing partners.

Crucially, when RockFuel’s cement is used in construction and the resultant concrete begins to cure, it absorbs additional atmospheric CO₂, turning infrastructure into long-term carbon sinks. This makes the product not just Carbon Neutral, but Carbon Negative across its lifecycle — a critical differentiator in the race toward global decarbonisation in the built environment and infrastructure projects worldwide. While some governments do not generally accept the figures for this natural carbon curing effect, the RockFuel Carbon Negative Cement Process includes a very small fraction of calcium oxide used in ocean projects, where around double the amount of CO₂ is absorbed, which ensures the whole process is Carbon Negative.

Meeting global market demands

The cement industry is forecast to grow from $316.3bn in 2020 to over $463bn by 2026, driven by infrastructure investment, population growth, and urbanisation across all continents. As nations introduce stricter carbon policies, the demand for climate-positive materials is rapidly increasing.

While the Asia-Pacific region continues to dominate production volumes, North America and Europe are leading in regulatory pressure and innovation-driven sustainability strategies. Both public and private sectors, governments, investors, and project developers are searching for materials that offer verifiable carbon reductions without compromising performance, compatibility, or cost-effectiveness. RockFuel’s solution addresses all three.

The chemical properties of the cement remain identical to traditional formulations, meaning it can be used in existing applications, such as poured concrete or precast components, without altering construction methods or regulatory standards. This makes it an ideal drop-in alternative for infrastructure projects, from transport networks to commercial buildings and renewable energy installations, such as the cement foundations for wind turbines and electricity transmission towers.

Verified, patented, and ready for global partnerships

RockFuel’s technology has undergone independent chemical engineering validation and financial modelling, demonstrating both technical feasibility and commercial viability. The company holds multiple international patents, with further applications pending, ensuring that this innovation is protected and ready for global licensing and industrial adoption.

The company is now seeking strategic partnerships with:

Cement, lime, concrete producers, and lime kiln manufacturers looking to decarbonise operations and ensure their long-term viability in a climate-positive world;

Universities and research institutes interested in co-operating on materials science, industrial chemistry, or sustainability innovations, e.g. via Horizon Europe collaboration;

Government agencies focused on green infrastructure, industrial transition, a climate-positive built environment and clean energy policy;

Impact investors and clean-tech funds seeking scalable, commercially sound climate solutions that are profitable and ready for upscaling.

Building toward a truly sustainable planet

The cement industry has long been seen as incompatible with true sustainability goals. RockFuel is overturning that perception. With a technology that turns CO₂ emissions into valuable outputs and cement-based infrastructure into carbon sinks, RockFuel is not just reducing the impact of cement, it is transforming it into one of the most climate-positive building materials available.

This innovation has the potential to reframe how construction contributes to environmental targets, no longer as a reluctant emitter, but as an active agent in atmospheric carbon reduction. It allows built environments to become tools in the fight against climate change, offering governments and industries a real, scalable way to build better and cleaner.

As the world races to decarbonise, RockFuel offers a ready-to-implement ‘Real Zero’ solution for one of the hardest-to-abate sectors. For policymakers, researchers, and industry leaders, it represents a beacon of what’s possible when circular design, energy transition, and practical innovation converge.",https://www.innovationnewsnetwork.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/ROCKFUE1-29632-Profile-ONE-shutterstockElnur_1396873844-1024x576.jpg,N,,2025-06-02 03:02:15.685580

These politicians offer baseless false narratives about solar and wind power generation that media outlets find difficult to effectively counter.

Alternative energy, particularly renewables such as solar and wind, are increasingly competitive with traditional fossil fuels. This is why conservative politicians relentlessly malign alternative energy.

It should come as no surprise that politicians who vote to maintain the fossil fuel status quo receive significant campaign contributions from fossil fuel industries.

A bill was recently introduced in the PA Senate (Senate Bill 349) that would place decommissioning requirements on solar energy installations. At first glance, this may seem sensible enough, as the panels in large solar systems will eventually–that is, in 25 to 30 years–need to be replaced. However, the emphasis on decommissioning solar projects, which are non-toxic and contribute nothing harmful to the environment, is misplaced when compared with other energy sectors. Consider the extensive negative environmental impacts associated with coal mining, oil production, and natural gas extraction. These same legislators conveniently ignore the short- and long-term impacts of fossil fuel energy, often to the detriment of their own constituents.

Coal strip mining has long had bonding requirements, but the bond amounts have been a fraction of what is needed to reclaim abandoned mines. When coal companies go bankrupt or fail to adequately bond their operations, as they often do, Pennsylvania taxpayers pick up the tab.

Similarly, decommissioned oil and gas wells are expensive to cap or plug, costing tens- to hundreds-of-thousands of dollars per well. Well bonds are only a few thousand dollars, mandated to remain at a low amount by other recent legislative action. Oil and gas operators walk away from these wells, forfeiting the tiny bond amount, and frequently declare bankruptcy.

Pennsylvania has hundreds of thousands of such abandoned wells. Permanently capping or plugging these wells prevents methane gas from leaking into the atmosphere and polluting our air and water. Taxpayers are most often left to cover the costs of capping and plugging.

The senators who sponsored and support this proposed legislation that unfairly targets producers of alternative energy should be ashamed, but that’s unlikely. They know which side their bread is buttered on.

Senate Bill 349 is an onerous, vindictive proposal, and Senators Yaw, Dush, Brooks, Hutchinson, Vogel, and Stefano — whose districts host oil and/or gas wells — should reflect on their obligation to the people of Pennsylvania.

Despite vast renewable energy potential, Pennsylvania currently ranks 49th in the U.S. for renewable energy growth. Our failure to promote alternative energy, combined with the inevitable price increase in natural gas, will cost electric ratepayers billions of dollars in the coming years. Pennsylvania has an immense, largely untapped opportunity when it comes to clean energy. It’s past time our elected representatives stop impeding cheaper and non-polluting energy sources, and begin to represent their constituents and not the fossil fuel industry.

Green campaigners said a condition of any extension should be that Drax published a key report by KPMG into its operations and sourcing.
Ofgem has said KPMG shows Drax has not breached rules on sourcing trees for burning from environmentally sustainable forests.

A delegated legislation committee will decide on Monday whether to pass the government’s plans to extend billpayer-funded subsidies to the country’s biomass power generators, of which Drax is by far the biggest.

Green campaigners said a condition of any extension should be that Drax published a key report by KPMG into its operations and sourcing. Reports by the auditor have been provided to the government and the energy regulator Ofgem but not the public.

Ofgem has said KPMG shows Drax has not breached rules on sourcing trees for burning from environmentally sustainable forests.

However, in separate incidents, Drax had been found to have supplied inaccurate data for subsidies in the past, leading to a £25m fine. Media investigations also found Drax using wood from old-growth forests in the US.

Drax is expected to receive more than £10bn in renewable energy subsidies between 2012 and 2027, the current regime period, according to the thinktank Ember.

Kingsmill Bond, an energy strategist at Ember, said: “Burning trees for electricity is extremely inefficient and expensive, and is not effective at mitigating climate change.

“The collapse in the price of solar, wind and batteries in the last five years means that burning trees for electricity is now an obsolete technology. Before we pour any more subsidy into Drax, MPs need to see the KMPG report on where the wood has been coming from.”

Dale Vince, founder of Ecotricity, a green energy company, said: “If Drax don’t come clean about their operations, how can we trust them? They don’t deserve further public money.”

The government plans to halve the subsidies available for biomass power generation under a revised regime from 2027. MPs on the delegated legislation committee are expected to vote on Monday on the statutory instrument enabling this.

Almuth Ernsting, the co-director of the campaign group Biofuelwatch, said: “If those subsidies are approved, it would result in more carbon emissions, more destructive logging of wildlife-rich forests in the south-eastern US and elsewhere, and more pollution suffered by communities living next to pellet plants in that region – pollution which community activists have denounced as ‘environmental racism’.”

Mark Campanale, the founder of the Carbon Tracker Initiative, added: “At a time when renewables powered by wind, solar with back up batteries are growing exponentially around the world, it seems remarkable that the UK still needs to rely on dirty combustion like Drax to reach its climate targets. Instead of importing and burning wood, with all its associated emissions, the UK should be doubling down on natural sources of energy available to us, wind and solar.”

A spokesperson for Drax said: “In their investigation Ofgem found no evidence that our biomass failed to meet the sustainability criteria of the RO [renewable obligation] scheme, nor that the ROCs [renewable obligation certificates] we received for the renewable power we produced had been provided incorrectly.

“Their new statement on the reports we commissioned from KPMG, as well as the prior comments in a public accounts committee hearing by Ofgem’s director of audit and compliance, confirm that they reviewed these documents as part of their investigation and found no evidence within them that we were in breach of our sustainability obligations and therefore wrong to receive RO funding.”

The spokesperson added: “Drax provides secure renewable power to millions of homes and businesses when they need it, not just when the wind is blowing, or the sun is shining. The science underpinning biomass generation is supported by the world’s leading climate experts, including the UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and the UK’s Climate Change Committee.”

A spokesperson for the Department for Energy Security and Net Zero said: “We are halving the amount of support for Drax, saving money on people’s energy bills and contributing to our energy security. Drax will operate for less of the time under a clean power system and will need to use 100% sustainably sourced biomass, with not a penny of subsidy paid for anything less.”

However, we must remain consistent in implementing this by considering our capabilities, energy availability levels, and economic factors,” Lahadalia said.

The RUPTL aims to support the country’s state-owned electricity company, PLT, in delivering 69.5GW of new energy generation by 2034.

Of the 69.5GW figure, 42.6GW will come from renewables. Specifically, solar PV will make up the bulk of this with 17.1GW targeted, hydropower comes second with 11.7GW, and wind generation comes third with 7.2GW. 5.2GW of geothermal and 0.9GW of bioenergy generation is also targeted as part of the wider figure.

The remaining 69.5GW capacity will be filled by gas and coal plants, totalling 10.3GW and 6.2GW, respectively, and two small modular nuclear reactors, totalling 0.5GW, planned for Sumatra and Kalimantan.

In addition, 10.3GW of energy storage is also targeted to support grid stability.

This means that 76% of the country’s new energy generation capacity will be comprised of renewable energy sources, contributing to an uptake in the overall electricity mix to 35% by 2034. For reference, this currently stands at 12%.

Inclusion of coal and gas-fired plants attracts criticism

The inclusion of coal and gas-fired generation has drawn criticism from the Institute for Essential Services Reform, an Indonesian energy sector think tank.

Indeed, its executive director, Fabby Tumiwa, said the inclusion of 2.8GW of coal-fired power plants that will still be operational after 2030 is inconsistent with the country’s net zero emissions target of achieving this by 2060 or sooner.

Tumiwa added that the 42.6GW figure is lower than the Just Energy Transition Partnership (JETP) commitment of 56GW by 2030 and is not in line with the need to limit global temperature increases to 1.5 degrees Celsius according to the Paris Agreement.

“PLN is currently facing difficulties in meeting the availability of gas for its generators. If demand increases two to three times in the future, the threat and risk to meeting PLN’s gas needs will be even greater. In this situation, the development of larger renewable energy is a lower risk option because it not only strengthens the reliability of the energy system, but also contributes to the creation of more affordable energy costs for the community,” Tumiwa said.

‘Massive grid upgrade’ is the backbone of Indonesia’s transition

Alongside the massive uptick in potential renewable energy generation, perhaps one of the most significant announcements made by the government is plans for a “massive grid upgrade” forming the backbone of the country’s energy transition.

Indonesia is one of the largest archipelagos in the world and has roughly 17,508 officially listed islands within the territory of the Republic of Indonesia. This creates geographic complications when trying to develop a nationwide grid infrastructure.

As part of the RUPTL, PLN will develop nearly 48,000km of new transmission lines, larger than the circumference of the Earth (roughly 40,000km), and with 108,000MVA in substation capacity.

This will help Indonesia develop a sufficient grid to connect communities and provide a just transition for its citizens.

Lahadalia emphasised that providing energy access to villages currently cut off from the grid is a priority for the Indonesian government.

“For me, energy is not just about needs, but also a form of equity and justice that we must implement from Aceh to Papua. President Prabowo Subianto’s directive is to immediately install electricity in villages that don’t have it yet. So we will complete this by 2029, and we will do this gradually starting from now,” Lahadalia said.

Via the RUPTL, PT PLN aims to power over 5,700 remote villages and connect nearly 780,000 households via the Village Electricity Program.

Nuki Agya Utama, executive director of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) Centre for Energy, explained on LinkedIn that Indonesia’s grid has been “historically segmented by necessity: each main island or region operates its electrical system, isolated by seas” in comparison to the more traditional continental grids in the US, China, and Europe.

As such, Indonesia’s dispersed island structure makes nationwide grids costly and complex. To achieve this, Utama said the country must utilise long-distance inter-island connections via submarine cables, which are resource-intensive and often face environmental and logistical constraints.

Macron in attendance for TotalEnergies, RGE solar-plus-storage deal

Last week, the French president, Emmanuel Macron, was in attendance as TotalEnergies and Indonesia’s Royal Golden Eagle (RGE), via its equally-owned joint venture Singa Renewables, agreed to co-invest in a solar-plus-storage project in Indonesia.

The size of the project has not been disclosed. PV Tech has reached out to TotalEnergies for confirmation of the project size but has not received a response at the time of reporting.

The agreement was signed at the Indonesian Presidential Palace in Jakarta, with Indonesian president Prabowo Subianto and Emmanuel Macron in attendance.

Little has been disclosed about the project as yet, except that it will be constructed in phases and located in the Riau Province of Indonesia, on the central eastern coast of Sumatra.

The companies have also secured a conditional licence from Singapore’s Energy Market Authority (EMA) to import 1GW of the project’s energy to the city-state.

“Our utility-scale project underscores TotalEnergies’ commitment to supporting the region’s energy transition efforts, while ensuring energy security. This project aims to drive the development of regional renewable energy infrastructure and advance the ASEAN Power Grid vision,” said Helle Kristoffersen, president of Asia and member of the executive committee at TotalEnergies.

Trump's Republican administration is supporting the development of fossil fuels in contrast to his Democratic predecessor Joe Biden, who had massively supported the production of renewable aviation fuels through tax credits.
- 'Entirely achievable' - The air transportation industry has faced growing pressure to deal with its contribution to the climate crisis.
To achieve net-zero emissions, airlines rely on non-fossil sources known as Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF).
""This represents only 0.7 percent of total aviation needs,"" IATA Director General Willie Walsh said.","The airline industry's flagship goal of decarbonising by 2050 is now ""in peril"" due to climate-sceptic policies, including those of US President Donald Trump, the leading airline association IATA warned on Sunday.

The emergence of leaders favouring fossil fuels and recent regulatory rollbacks are ""obviously a setback... it does imperil success on the 2050 horizon"", Marie Owens Thomsen, the International Air Transport Association's senior vice president for sustainability, told reporters.

""But I don't think it's going to halt or reverse progress. I think it will just slow progress,"" she said at the IATA annual industry conference in India.

Trump's Republican administration is supporting the development of fossil fuels in contrast to his Democratic predecessor Joe Biden, who had massively supported the production of renewable aviation fuels through tax credits.

UN aviation agency members, from the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), have set the year 2050 as their goal for achieving net-zero carbon emissions for air travel -- an industry often criticised for its outsized role in climate change.

- 'Entirely achievable' -

The air transportation industry has faced growing pressure to deal with its contribution to the climate crisis.

Currently responsible for 2.5 percent to three percent of global CO2 emissions, the sector's switch to renewable fuels is proving difficult, even if the aeronautics industry and energy companies have been seeking progress.

To achieve net-zero emissions, airlines rely on non-fossil sources known as Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF).

However, SAF biofuels are still three to four times more expensive than petroleum-based jet fuel.

""Another problem, which is related, is the fact that oil is so cheap,"" Owens Thomsen said. ""I think that also diminishes the sense of urgency that people have.""

A barrel of Brent North Sea crude, the international benchmark, stands below $65 as a result of Trump's tariffs, his call to ""drill baby drill"" and especially a decision by OPEC+ to hike crude output quotas.

This represents an immediate boon for airlines, whose fuel costs represent between a quarter and a third of operating expenses.

SAF is seen as a crucial ingredient in hitting emissions targets. The biofuel produces lower carbon emissions than traditional jet fuel and is made from plant and animal materials such as cooking oil and fat.

European Union rules require carriers to include two percent of SAF in their fuel mix starting this year, rising to six percent in 2030 before soaring to 70 percent from 2050.

Owens Thomsen estimated on Sunday that $4.7 trillion in investment is needed to establish SAF sectors capable of meeting the needs of air transport by 2050.

""It is entirely achievable,"" she said, adding that the raw materials and technology already exist and simply need to be developed.

""The money involved is very comparable to the money that was involved in creating the previous new energy markets, notably obviously wind and solar,"" she said.

That money could be found just by stopping subsidies to oil producers, she said.

""The world is subsidising large oil companies to the height of $1 trillion per year,"" she said.

""With that money, if it were redirected in its totality, we could solve our energy transition in less than five years.""

IATA also indicated on Sunday that it expects global SAF production to double this year compared with 2024 to 2.5 billion litres -- slightly down from its previous projections of 2.7 billion litres.

""This represents only 0.7 percent of total aviation needs,"" IATA Director General Willie Walsh said.

""But if we reduce greenhouse gas emissions, we will reduce the rate and magnitude of the damage, and gain time for adaptation"".
This becomes a vicious circle, with less sea ice allowing more solar energy to reach and warm the water, leading to more ice melting.","Oceans have absorbed the vast majority of the warming caused by burning fossil fuels and shielded societies from the full impact of greenhouse gas emissions.

But this crucial ally has developed alarming symptoms of stress -- heatwaves, loss of marine life, rising sea levels, falling oxygen levels and acidification caused by the uptake of excess carbon dioxide.

These effects risk not just the health of the ocean but the entire planet.

- Heating up -

By absorbing more than 90 percent of the excess heat trapped in the atmosphere by greenhouse gases, ""oceans are warming faster and faster"", said Angelique Melet, an oceanographer at the European Mercator Ocean monitor.

The UN's IPCC climate expert panel has said the rate of ocean warming -- and therefore its heat uptake -- has more than doubled since 1993.

Average sea surface temperatures reached new records in 2023 and 2024.

Despite a respite at the start of 2025, temperatures remain at historic highs, according to data from the Europe Union's Copernicus climate monitor.

The Mediterranean has set a new temperature record in each of the past three years and is one of the basins most affected, along with the North Atlantic and Arctic oceans, said Thibault Guinaldo, of France's CEMS research centre.

Marine heatwaves have doubled in frequency, become longer lasting and more intense, and affect a wider area, the IPCC said in its special oceans report.

Warmer seas can make storms more violent, feeding them with heat and evaporated water.

The heating water can also be devastating for species, especially corals and seagrass beds, which are unable to migrate.

For corals, between 70 percent and 90 percent are expected to be lost this century if the world reaches 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) of warming compared to pre-industrial levels.

Scientists expect that threshold -- the more ambitious goal of the Paris climate deal -- to be breached in the early 2030s or even before.

- Relentless rise -

When a liquid or gas warms up, it expands and takes up more space.

In the case of the oceans, this thermal expansion combines with the slow but irreversible melting of the world's ice caps and mountain glaciers to lift the world's seas.

The pace at which global oceans are rising has doubled in three decades and if current trends continue it will double again by 2100 to about one centimetre per year, according to recent research.

Around 230 million people worldwide live less than a metre above sea level, vulnerable to increasing threats from floods and storms.

""Ocean warming, like sea-level rise, has become an inescapable process on the scale of our lives, but also over several centuries,"" said Melet.

""But if we reduce greenhouse gas emissions, we will reduce the rate and magnitude of the damage, and gain time for adaptation"".

- More acidity, less oxygen -

The ocean not only stores heat, it has also taken up 20 to 30 percent of all humans' carbon dioxide emissions since the 1980s, according to the IPCC, causing the waters to become more acidic.

Acidification weakens corals and makes it harder for shellfish and the skeletons of crustaceans and certain plankton to calcify.

""Another key indicator is oxygen concentration, which is obviously important for marine life,"" said Melet.

Oxygen loss is due to a complex set of causes including those linked to warming waters.

- Reduced sea ice -

Combined Arctic and Antarctic sea ice cover -- frozen ocean water that floats on the surface -- plunged to a record low in mid-February, more than a million square miles below the pre-2010 average.

This becomes a vicious circle, with less sea ice allowing more solar energy to reach and warm the water, leading to more ice melting.

This feeds the phenomenon of ""polar amplification"" that makes global warming faster and more intense at the poles, said Guinaldo.

These policy levies mean the UK pays some of the highest energy bills in the world, and are simultaneously disadvantaging British industry and stifling the efforts of households to transition to lower-carbon heating systems, according to industry trade groups.

Make UK has warned that the government’s long-awaited industrial policy is at risk of being derailed by the high energy prices charged to UK manufacturers, which the lobby group states make the sector’s energy bills 46% higher than the global average.

The trade organisation has called on the government to cut industrial energy costs as part of Labour’s long-awaited industrial strategy, which is due later this month, by reforming “the complex and unfair policy levies that make low-carbon energy more expensive than fossil fuels”.

Its plan includes the state underwriting a fixed energy price for manufacturers. Under the scheme, manufacturing firms would receive top-up payments from the government if energy wholesale costs rise beyond the set price – but they would repay the difference to the exchequer if the wholesale price falls below the agreed price.

Stephen Phipson, Make UK’s chief executive, said: “If we do not address the issue of high industrial energy costs in the UK as a priority, we risk the security of our country. We will fail to attract investment in the manufacturing sector and will rapidly enter a phase of renewed de-industrialisation.”

“UK manufacturers have faced energy prices far above those of European competitors for many years, undermining their ability to invest, grow, and compete globally,” Phipson said.

Another trade organisation, Energy UK, blamed the government’s levies, which predominantly fall on electricity bills, for making cleaner alternatives such heat pumps artificially expensive in comparison with gas.

The energy sector trade body, which represents energy suppliers, has proposed “rebalancing” the charges currently levied on electricity bills on to gas bills, saving homes using electric heating £400 a year. State subsidies should then be used to ease the burden on low- and middle- income gas-using households that would face an extra annual cost of £40 under its proposal, it said.

Overall the scheme would make the government’s move from gas heating to electric heating about £40bn cheaper by 2040 compared with a situation in which policy costs are not removed from bills.

A government spokesperson said: “Through our clean power mission, we will get off the rollercoaster of fossil fuel markets – protecting business and household finances with clean, homegrown energy that we control.”

The spokesperson said that it was bringing energy costs for UK industries closer in line with other major economies through its British Industry Supercharger, a government energy cost-cutting programme for firms in sectors such as steel, metals and chemicals, which is expected to save businesses £5bn over the next 10 years.

“We are also looking at a range of options for longer-term energy market reform, including the rebalancing of gas and electricity prices, with the impact on consumers at the heart of our approach,” the spokesperson added.

The comments about the government’s imminent industrial strategy proposals come as British business faces a string of challenges over the coming months.

The business and trade secretary, Jonathan Reynolds, is expected to urge Donald Trump’s administration to cut a deal to reduce taxes on UK steel exports to zero this week, after the US president vowed to double his global steel tariff to 50%.

Elsewhere, private sector companies expect activity to fall in the three months to August to their weakest level for three years, according to the CBI’s latest growth survey.

The grid operator maintains a balance between power demand and supply and a stable electrical system.

The wind and solar output is reduced by price signals or through an order to reduce output. This reduction is generally implemented during periods of congestion when transmission lines lack sufficient capacity to deliver the available energy or during oversupply when generation exceeds demand.

In 2024, CAISO curtailed 3.4 million MWh of utility-scale wind and solar output, a 29% increase from the electricity curtailed in 2023.

CAISO also curtails solar generation to leave room for natural gas generation. A certain amount of natural gas generation must remain online throughout the day to comply with North American Electric Reliability Corporation reliability standards and to have sufficient generation available to ramp up in the evening hours.

In 2024, solar energy accounted for 93% of all energy curtailed by CAISO. The highest amount of solar energy was curtailed during spring, when solar output was relatively high, and electricity demand was low, as moderate spring temperatures reduced the need for space heating or air conditioning.

In 2014, California had a total of 9.7 GW of installed wind and solar photovoltaic capacity. By the end of 2024, this figure had increased to 28.2 GW.

Solar energy supplies almost half of CAISO’s electricity demand between 8 AM and 4 PM. However, demand rises during the later evening hours as people return home from work and switch on appliances such as air conditioners, electric heaters, lights, ovens, computers, and televisions.

This demand is particularly noticeable on hot summer evenings after sunset when solar power is no longer being generated.

Ways of Curtailment

CAISO is trying to reduce curtailments in the following ways:

Trading with neighboring balancing authorities to try to sell excess solar and wind power

Incorporating battery storage into ancillary services, energy, and capacity markets

Including curtailment reduction in transmission planning

Additionally, companies are planning to use excess renewable energy to make hydrogen, some of which will be stored and mixed with natural gas for summer generation at the interstate Intermountain Power Project’s new facility, scheduled to come online in July.

CAISO is also promoting the addition of flexible resources that can quickly respond to sudden changes in demand.

Battery storage may also come online, allowing some renewable energy to be stored and used four to eight hours later in the day. CAISO’s battery capacity was 11.6 GW in 2024, rising 45% from 8.0 GW in 2023.

EIA said it is common for daily electricity generation to outpace consumption during the springtime. Without increased transmission capacity or long-term storage solutions, significant curtailments may still happen during this season.

Incorporating battery storage into ancillary services, energy, and capacity markets

Including curtailment reduction in transmission planning

Additionally, companies are planning to use excess renewable energy to make hydrogen, some of which will be stored and mixed with natural gas for summer generation at the interstate Intermountain Power Project’s new facility, scheduled to come online in July.

CAISO is also promoting the addition of flexible resources that can quickly respond to sudden changes in demand.

Battery storage may also come online, allowing some renewable energy to be stored and used four to eight hours later in the day. CAISO’s battery capacity was 11.6 GW in 2024, rising 45% from 8.0 GW in 2023.

EIA said it is common for daily electricity generation to outpace consumption during the springtime. Without increased transmission capacity or long-term storage solutions, significant curtailments may still happen during this season.

The U.S. installed a record 50 GW of new solar capacity in 2024, a 21% year-over-year increase, according to the Solar Energy Industries Association’s U.S. Solar Market Insight 2024 Year in Review report. The country added 5.4 GW of wind capacity in 2024.",https://d382rz2cea0pah.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/California-Grid-Operator-Curtails-Solar-and-Wind-Power-to-Maintain-Grid-Stability-1.jpg,N,,2025-06-02 02:06:05.632892

The manufacturing plant, located in France, will produce these lightweight modules for rooftop installations on roofs with low bearing capacity. The modules are considered ideal for buildings with flat rooftops.

These modules utilize ultra-thin glass measuring 1 mm in thickness.

They can be installed without needing any mounting structures. Heliup’s modules are directly glued to waterproofing membranes using adhesives.

The company’s lightweight module, the Stykon, uses crystalline silicon module cells and is resistant to impact and tearing from natural forces. Heliup claims the module can withstand wind speeds of up to 270 km/h.

The new modules are expected to reduce the weight of rooftop solar systems by 60% compared to conventional systems. Heliup said that the modules weigh roughly 5 kg/m² less than the average module weight of 15 kg/m².

The company claims that the module does not compromise on energy efficiency despite its lighter weight.

The module manufacturing plant received funding of €3.2 million (~$3.61 million) under the Innovation Fund 2024.

Heliup was one of the 18 cleantech projects that signed grant agreements to receive €173 million (~$195.67 million) from the Innovation Fund for their projects. Under the funding program, the Commission can allocate up to €3.4 billion (~$3.84 billion) for these projects.

The Innovation Fund aligns with the EU’s target to produce 40% of its green technology domestically by 2030. In February 2024, the EU reached a provisional agreement on legislation aimed at boosting the bloc’s production of green technologies needed to achieve its goal of cutting carbon emissions by at least 55% by 2030 compared to 1990s levels.

In a recent congressional hearing, EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin signaled that the future of Energy Star could soon be in private hands.
“Multiple entities have already reached out to the EPA because they want to take over Energy Star,” he said.
Energy Star also serves as a critical gateway to federal energy efficiency tax incentives.
The private sector is eager to step up, but the question remains: Could the industry rebuild energy benchmarking consensus as quickly as it may lose it?","The Energy Star program has quietly served as the foundation of tracking energy efficiency for over thirty years. Launched as a voluntary initiative to help consumers and businesses identify energy-efficient products, the program has evolved into a widely recognized standard woven deeply into commercial real estate operations, compliance reporting, and investment strategy. The Trump administration has proposed to eliminate Energy Star as part of broader cuts to the Environmental Protection Agency and now the commercial property sector is prepping for what could become a significant operational shake-up.

Created in 1992 under President George H.W. Bush, Energy Star was envisioned as a market-friendly alternative to more rigid environmental regulation. Since then, it has become the central energy benchmark for the residential and commercial property sectors. Its Portfolio Manager tool measures building performance across more than a quarter of all U.S. commercial floor space, with certifications frequently serving as shorthand for ESG reporting, municipal compliance, and capital planning.

The Trump administration’s fiscal year 2026 budget proposes eliminating the EPA’s Atmospheric Protection Program, the umbrella under which Energy Star operates. Officials argue that the program represents unnecessary government intervention and imposes avoidable costs on industry by prioritizing climate goals over economic growth. In a recent congressional hearing, EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin signaled that the future of Energy Star could soon be in private hands. “This program is an example of one that can be run outside of the government,” Zeldin told members of the House Energy and Commerce Environment Subcommittee.

Zeldin questioned the consumer savings delivered by the program and suggested it has grown too reliant on public resources. “Multiple entities have already reached out to the EPA because they want to take over Energy Star,” he said. “It’s a program that requires a big staff, a big taxpayer-funded staff, and a whole lot of tax dollars.” The comments mark the strongest indication yet that the EPA under Zeldin is open to offloading one of its most recognizable energy efficiency initiatives.

A high-voltage shock to the system

Energy Star’s elimination would have far-reaching consequences for the commercial real estate industry. In cities such as New York, Boston, and Washington, D.C., local energy disclosure and benchmarking laws are closely linked with Energy Star’s Portfolio Manager.

Many U.S. building performance standards (BPS) and local benchmarking laws, such as New York’s Local Law 97 and Boston’s BERDO 2.0, rely heavily on Portfolio Manager and its 1–100 scores to measure and enforce compliance with energy efficiency mandates. These scores provide a de facto national benchmarking tool for energy use, and in many jurisdictions, they’re central to evaluating compliance and triggering upgrade requirements.

If the Energy Star program were to be disrupted, these local building performance standards could face challenges in terms of compliance, data access, and enforcement, especially in jurisdictions that rely explicitly on Energy Star scores to classify building performance tiers. In many jurisdictions, this could lead to amendments to the regulations to incorporate other benchmarking standards, resulting in further compliance complications.

Energy Star also serves as a critical gateway to federal energy efficiency tax incentives. Certifications issued through the program are directly linked to high-value provisions in the tax code, most notably the Section 45L tax credit for energy-efficient residential construction and the Section 179D deduction for commercial buildings.

Under Section 45L, homebuilders and developers can claim up to $5,000 per dwelling unit for constructing energy-efficient homes that meet specific performance criteria that are benchmarked in part using Energy Star’s standards. Section 179D allows commercial building owners to deduct up to $1.88 per square foot (indexed for inflation) for properties that achieve reductions in energy use. Compliance verification often depends on benchmarking data and documentation generated via Energy Star’s Portfolio Manager.

Any disruption to Energy Star would create uncertainty for property owners relying on these incentives. Without a trusted framework for verifying building performance, owners may face delays in accessing credits or risk being audited over insufficient documentation. This comes at a time when capital for energy retrofits is already constrained, and when energy efficiency has become a linchpin strategy for preserving net operating income, improving ESG metrics, and hedging against future regulatory penalties.

Energy Star’s elimination would likewise disrupt the certification processes for LEED and other green building certifications. For years, Portfolio Manager has served as the backbone of benchmarking for LEED for Existing Buildings, providing a standardized, third-party-verified score that helps buildings demonstrate compliance with minimum energy performance.

LEED isn’t alone. Programs like BREEAM, Fitwel, and the WELL Building Standard also rely on Energy Star to evaluate operational energy use, verify sustainability claims, and award performance points. These systems rely on Energy Star because it provides consistent, transparent metrics across various building types and climates. Without Energy Star, certifying bodies would be forced to revise scoring systems. The result could be a potential loss of credibility in sustainability reporting, particularly at a time when ESG scrutiny and decarbonization mandates are intensifying.

Will the future be fragmented?

Supporters of Energy Star argue that its reliability and accessibility make it irreplaceable. A 2022 EPA report estimated that the program helped avoid $42 billion in energy costs and prevent four billion tons of greenhouse gas emissions. That sentiment is echoed across much of the commercial real estate industry. In April, a coalition of 13 major real estate organizations, including BOMA, NAIOP, and Nareit, sent a letter urging the EPA to preserve the program.

Stephanie Grayson, co-founder and CEO of Cambio, a New York-based provider of real estate operations software, agrees that the impact of losing Energy Star would cause a massive disruption. In response, Cambio quickly launched Cambio Vault in early May, a free benchmarking platform designed to back up data and mirror, as well as modernize, the core functions of Portfolio Manager. The tool offers secure data storage, ESG-aligned emissions tracking, and compliance-ready outputs. It is intended as an emergency backup but also as a potential long-term replacement should Energy Star go dark.

While Cambio Vault checks the technical boxes, the symbolic gap left by losing a federally backed standard may be harder to fill. “No private platform can immediately replicate the decades of trust built by a government program,” Grayson said. “But by offering our solution for free and committing to ongoing data ownership by our users, we believe we can provide the technical replacement while building trust over time.”

The larger concern is fragmentation. A single federal platform has long provided a uniform standard across jurisdictions. Without it, cities and states could adopt conflicting systems, creating a compliance patchwork that’s expensive and difficult to navigate. The fragmentation would lead to duplication of effort, inconsistent data quality, and higher costs for compliance teams.

Grayson said Cambio Vault has already attracted interest from municipalities looking to preserve benchmarking continuity. While she declined to name names, she said many city and state agencies are vigorously evaluating Energy Star backup options. “If federal support for Portfolio Manager were to fade, we absolutely expect local jurisdictions to take action to protect the data infrastructure that underpins their laws,” she said.

Measurabl, one of the most prominent ESG data providers for the real estate industry, is also positioning itself as a successor to Energy Star. The company has sustainability data spanning over 20 billion square feet, more than half of Energy Star’s total coverage. Measurabl already supports over 100,000 buildings with real-time data updates and benchmarking tools. According to CEO Matt Ellis, the company can replicate and improve upon Energy Star’s 1-100 scoring methodology, offering more nuanced, dynamic performance tracking.

Still, Ellis said, “The potential elimination of Energy Star is like a heart attack for the real estate industry in terms of how data works, how regulation works, and how green loans work.” Measurabl is guiding clients through contingency planning, providing step-by-step instructions to export and safeguard Portfolio Manager data.

But while losing Energy Star would be a disruption, Ellis believes this could be an inflection point for benchmarking in real estate, leading to innovations that could surpass the capabilities of Portfolio Manager. “There’s no reason we can’t offer more and more nuanced and real-time benchmarks,” Ellis said. “I think the industry has taken a second look at this and said, huh, maybe we should be doing things differently. Maybe the status quo isn’t in the best interest or service of the industry.”

If Energy Star were eliminated, companies like Cambio or Measurabl would vie to become the private-sector default for energy benchmarking, particularly among institutional real estate portfolios that already use their platforms. With automated data collection, robust ESG analytics, and compliance tracking baked in, these firms are well-positioned to absorb the technical and operational functions that Energy Star currently performs.

Replacing Energy Star entirely is a different matter. What private companies offer in technological sophistication, they lack in public-sector credibility. Ultimately, a post-Energy Star landscape may require a broader coalition of municipalities, certifiers, and ESG platforms to unite and establish a new, standardized energy benchmarking framework. “If the private sector is to take on more responsibility, we need clear standards, open protocols, and a credible certification process to ensure data quality and interoperability,” Cambio’s Grayson said.

She added that it could be similar to financial reporting, where private platforms handle the software, but Generally Accepted Accounting Principles and SEC oversight ensure accountability. “We believe energy data should be treated the same way,” Grayson added.

In the meantime, commercial real estate firms are busy backing up data, reevaluating compliance pathways, and monitoring developments in Washington, D.C. Absent a clear federal standard, the future of building performance tracking would be more competitive but also more complicated. The private sector is eager to step up, but the question remains: Could the industry rebuild energy benchmarking consensus as quickly as it may lose it?",https://propmodo.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/energy-efficiency.jpg,N,,2025-06-02 02:06:40.362419

In March, the Trump administration imposed a 10% tariff on imported electricity from Canada — a move that immediately drove up prices and rattled confidence in our energy supply.
New Jersey families deserve a system that works for them, not for entrenched energy interests.","Everyone in New Jersey is feeling the pinch. This summer, electric bills are projected to spike by 20 to 30%. That’s not an abstract statistic — it’s an extra $30 a month for working families already stretched thin. That increase is set to hit monthly utility bills starting in June, but the underlying cause runs deeper, rooted in the decisions of the electrical grid operator for our region, PJM Interconnection, and the federal government.

Let me explain, and provide some solutions.

PJM: The quiet giant behind your electric bill

PJM Interconnection, an organization many New Jerseyans probably have never heard of, manages the electric grid for New Jersey and 12 other states. It’s the largest power grid in North America and is responsible for transmitting electricity, operating a competitive wholesale market and ensuring grid reliability.

Every three years, PJM runs a “capacity auction” — a wonky term for the process that sets the price power generators are paid to keep energy ready for use three years down the line. These decisions determine the utility rates passed on to consumers. In 2023, the amount paid to generators was $28.92 per megawatt-day. Last summer? It skyrocketed to $269.92 — nearly 10 times higher, an outrageous increase. What happened?

PJM claims it’s a simple case of supply and demand — the supply of energy is dwindling, while the demand is surging, which causes prices to increase. But that’s only part of the story. The real issue is that supply has been deliberately obstructed, and demand has been artificially inflated — both by a flawed PJM auction and poor leadership by the Trump administration.

A market rigged against clean energy

PJM claims that higher electricity costs are because of a severe energy supply shortage, but 286 gigawatts, the equivalent of nearly 300 new power plants, are stuck in PJM’s queue for new energy generation. This backlog in required approvals reduces the supply side of the energy equation, resulting in upward pressure on costs. While families are forced to make room in their budgets for rising electricity bills, the energy supply we need to bring costs down is literally sitting there, waiting for PJM to act. Even worse, over 90% of those projects are from clean, renewable energy.

The data shows that clean-energy sources such as solar and wind are over 50% cheaper to run than fossil fuels, but PJM’s bias against clean-energy producers keeps that less expensive power off the table. The result? Ratepayers get stuck footing the bill for older, dirtier, more expensive energy while the cheaper, greener alternatives are left waiting on the sidelines.

Since January, things have only gotten worse.

Trump’s energy sabotage

In President Trump’s first week in office, the administration took steps to halt green energy innovation across the country. That single move killed three major wind projects in New Jersey that would have generated enough energy to power more than 2 million homes. It also dealt a devastating blow to New Jersey’s economy — thousands of potential clean-energy jobs gone.

Then came the tariffs. In March, the Trump administration imposed a 10% tariff on imported electricity from Canada — a move that immediately drove up prices and rattled confidence in our energy supply. While some tariffs were later rolled back amid political pressure, the pattern of sudden imposition, partial repeal, and renewed threats created a cloud of uncertainty over our electricity markets. This instability disrupts long-term infrastructure planning and leaves ratepayers footing the bill.

Blocking clean-energy projects while propping up fossil fuels and imposing tariffs on electricity from our allies (like Canada) is a recipe for instability and higher costs. That’s exactly what we’re experiencing now and that’s what we will continue to experience under this federal administration.

The data center boom

Meanwhile, electricity demand is skyrocketing, driven not just by natural population growth or seasonal usage during an increasingly warmer summer but by a rapid, under-regulated surge in AI-driven data center development across the PJM region. Data centers now consume 5% of New Jersey’s total electricity — a number expected to more than double by 2030. That spike in demand directly contributed to the sky-high auction prices we’re now paying for.

But here’s the problem: PJM is operating without a clear understanding of how much electricity is being consumed by rapidly expanding AI-driven data centers — or where that demand is most concentrated. This lack of transparency distorts demand forecasts, which leads to inflated capacity prices, and leads to overbuilt, overpriced infrastructure. By failing to collect and share accurate data, PJM is planning in the dark — and we are paying a premium for it.

So what do we do?

First, we need to expand existing programs that help families immediately, because no one should have to choose between keeping the lights on and putting food on the table. Right now, only 20% of eligible New Jerseyans are enrolled in the Universal Service Fund (USF), a program administered by the Department of Community Affairs that provides up to $180 per month to low-income ratepayers. We need to make sure all eligible people are aware of the program while we consider ways to expand it — especially at a time when the Trump administration has gutted the federal Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP), creating even more uncertainty and depriving families of the energy assistance they need to stay warm in the winter and cool in the summer.

Meanwhile, PJM must act quicker to approve and connect the existing projects in their queue. PJM must review projects faster, adhere to federal guidelines mandating study deadlines of 150 days, and adopt binding deadlines to cut through red tape. If PJM refuses to fix its broken system, New Jersey must be ready to take bold action — even if that means pursuing an exit from the capacity market entirely. We can’t wait any longer.

At the same time, we must work for more timely remedies that hold PJM accountable for the harm already done. That’s why I support New Jersey’s Division of Rate Counsel in calling on the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to order a rerun of PJM’s last capacity auction. The results weren’t just outrageous; they were unjust. PJM’s flawed rules allowed market manipulation, excluded low-cost resources and drove up costs unnecessarily. If FERC intervenes, ratepayers could see over $5 billion in savings. New Jersey families deserve a system that works for them, not for entrenched energy interests.

At the same time, we must modernize our grid so the power lines can carry more electricity. That’s why I’m introducing a legislative package focused on Advanced Transmission Technologies (ATT). These technologies can dramatically increase grid capacity, allowing utilities to deliver more electricity to their customers. The greater availability of energy will help hold down consumer costs. The legislative package will also require utilities to evaluate and integrate these tools in their long-term plans, protect vulnerable ratepayers and streamline permitting to make these upgrades faster and more efficient.

Clean energy is not the problem; it is the solution. Solar, battery storage and smart transmission technologies are the fastest path to long-term energy affordability and independence. They reduce emissions, create jobs, lower prices and prepare the grid for the demands of the 21st century.

The system must change. The success of our economy depends on a state-of-the-art energy infrastructure that meets the demands of the future while lowering costs for working families. Clinging to dirty, inefficient fossil fuels simply won’t cut it. Now is the time to pave the way for affordable energy independence, booming economic growth and a full embrace of our state’s clean-energy potential.

We owe it to every New Jersey family to stop playing politics and start making progress.",https://www.njspotlightnews.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/123/2025/05/Andrew-Zwicker-16X9.jpg,N,,2025-06-02 02:06:12.144815

From 2020 to 2024, the United States began building the outlines of a serious national industrial strategy.

They are structural setbacks, undermining the very concept of regional economic governance that these programs were designed to support.
That alignment must not unravel because a federal funding stream has been delayed or redirected.","The U.S. Department of Commerce has rescinded $48 million in funding for the Spokane-Coeur d'Alene aerospace tech hub, a regional initiative already months into implementation. Five other regional projects, including a $44 million life sciences initiative in Birmingham, Ala., saw their previously announced awards pulled.

These were not symbolic projects. They were competitively selected, congressionally authorized under the CHIPS and Science Act, and structured to anchor America’s leadership in critical sectors like semiconductors, aerospace, biotechnology and clean energy. Each hub has a regional strategy, a coalition of partners and a plan to leverage public investment into long-term economic transformation. Now they are being told to reapply under a different set of rules, for a smaller pool of funds and with entirely different evaluation criteria.

From 2020 to 2024, the United States began building the outlines of a serious national industrial strategy. The CHIPS and Science Act, the Inflation Reduction Act and the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law were not just funding vehicles. They marked a broader shift: a recognition that free markets alone could not deliver resilient supply chains, regional equity or technological leadership in an era of global competition. What emerged was a place-based model grounded in public investment, regional coordination and strategic sector focus.

The Tech Hubs Program, administered by the Economic Development Administration, exemplified that approach. It asked communities and regions not just to apply for funding but to imagine themselves as global innovation centers. The response was overwhelming — and generative. Regions like Spokane and Birmingham assembled coalitions of universities, small businesses, workforce boards, tribal governments and anchor institutions to design 10-year strategies grounded in production, not just research.

The federal pullback raises the stakes for states and regions, which must now decide whether these coalitions will dissolve or evolve into lasting civic infrastructure. This moment — where implementation-ready projects are being clawed back midstream — raises a broader question: What happens to regional industrial planning when federal alignment disappears? The answer will depend on how local and state actors respond, and whether they treat these coalitions as temporary grant-seeking teams or as permanent civic infrastructure.

That momentum is now under threat. What is being framed as a procedural reset is, in fact, a reversal in values and direction. New funding rules explicitly exclude priorities like equity, labor partnerships or climate resilience. The Good Jobs Principles are gone. References to inclusive workforce pipelines have been removed. Even implementation grants already awarded and publicly announced in January are being recompeted without guarantee of reapproval. Birmingham’s biotech hub — built on collaboration among health systems, historically Black colleges and universities, and emerging biomanufacturing firms — has seen its project placed in limbo just as hiring and infrastructure work was ramping up.

These are not minor adjustments. They are structural setbacks, undermining the very concept of regional economic governance that these programs were designed to support.

The pullback comes at a moment of deep uncertainty in global trade. A patchwork of tariffs, retaliatory measures and shifting import restrictions has re-entered the policy landscape, leaving manufacturers, exporters and local planners with few reliable signals. But tariffs alone cannot secure a national industrial base. They must be paired with deliberate investments, workforce strategies and innovation infrastructure. Without that, we do not have industrial policy — we have industrial improvisation.

Which is why this moment demands leadership, and not just from Washington. Local and regional actors must continue the work they have begun. The coalitions formed through tech hubs and other place-based initiatives were never just vehicles for federal dollars. They are governance structures. They have brought together economic development leaders, university research centers, small and medium-sized businesses that support supply chains, and state agencies around shared long-term plans. That alignment must not unravel because a federal funding stream has been delayed or redirected. It must be deepened and expanded.

Regions should continue convening across sectors, sharing playbooks and aligning supply chain strategies. States must step in where needed with bridge financing and policy consistency. And Congress must act to ensure that competitive, awarded funds cannot be unilaterally withdrawn. Guardrails matter. So does institutional trust.

What is at stake is not just a few regional grants. It is the question of whether the United States can build again — intentionally, inclusively and with strategic clarity. The industrial strategy of the past four years gave us a glimpse of what is possible: onshored semiconductor fabs, biomanufacturing capacity in the South, clean-energy clusters in former coal regions. It showed that growth does not have to be coastal, extractive or zero-sum. And it reminded us that planning — real planning — is a form of power.

If we walk away now, we don’t just abandon funding. We abandon the institutional muscle it took to build these coalitions. We send a signal that industrial policy is conditional and that national strategy ends where partisan cycles begin. But if we stay the course — if we protect the vision and continue the work — the results will endure.

In 2019, the project represented Eni’s first venture into the Australian renewable energy market.

Eni further expanded its presence by acquiring the Batchelor and Manton Dam solar PV power plants in late 2019. These plants, which have a generation capacity of 12.5MW and were completed in 2020, were completed in 2020.

Jacana Energy CEO Rod Hayes said the contracts will increase the share of renewables in the energy mix at a larger scale than previously seen in the Territory.

“At Jacana Energy, we’re about leading smart energy solutions for the Territory. New sources of energy, including renewables, must be brought into the mix where it makes sense,” Hayes said.

“We’re focused on lowering the total costs of the energy system. We’re grateful to Plenitude for their patience under challenging circumstances, and we look forward to continuing to work with them in the future.”

Jacana’s move to secure solar PV energy will likely be welcomed by the broader energy industry in the Northern Territory, as the technology is regarded as one of the cheapest forms of energy generation.

It will also be welcome as a positive spin on the renewable energy transition in the Territory following a turbulent start to the year. Indeed, earlier this year, the Northern Territory government confirmed it would be scrapping the region’s 50% renewables by 2030 target, deeming it “reckless”.

However, solar PV will continue to play an integral role in decarbonising the Territory and ensuring low-cost bills for households and businesses.

For instance, the government is supporting the development of the AU$400 million (US$258 million) Darwin Renewable Energy Hub, which would connect directly to the Darwin-Katherine grid.

The hub involves co-locating up to six large-scale solar PV power plants, capable of generating 180-210MW of renewable energy, alongside a BESS on a single site near existing network infrastructure.

Enter Savic Motorcycles: Aussie-made, electric-powered Featured in Episode 1 of Energy Matters, Savic Motorcycles is leading the electric motorbike revolution in Australia.
Innovators like Savic Motorcycles are showing that electric transport can be thrilling, stylish, and sustainable.","Australia’s clean energy future isn’t just about where our power comes from, but also how we move. Electric mobility, or e-mobility, is powering ahead, offering smarter, cleaner ways to travel that cut emissions, reduce noise, and fit neatly into our modern lifestyles.

From electric cars to e-scooters and e-bikes, e-mobility is no longer just a buzzword, it’s a genuine shift in the way we think about transport. Right at the forefront of this movement is Savic Motorcycles, an Australian company building head-turning electric motorbikes that are as stylish as they are sustainable.

Let’s unpack how e-mobility fits into Australia’s clean energy story, what it means for our environment, health and way of life, and why brands like Savic are worth watching.

What is e-mobility and why does it matter?

E-mobility refers to electric-powered transport – think electric vehicles (EVs), bikes, scooters, buses and even trucks. These alternatives to internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles are powered by electricity stored in rechargeable batteries, rather than petrol or diesel.

What’s driving the e-mobility trend? Several key factors:

Climate action: Transport is Australia’s third-largest source of emissions. E-mobility helps slash that.

Cost savings: EVs are cheaper to run and maintain over time.

Health benefits: Zero tailpipe emissions mean cleaner air.

Tech appeal: Modern e-vehicles are smart, fast and surprisingly fun to drive or ride.

As more Aussies choose to electrify their commutes, road trips and work vehicles, the demand for charging infrastructure, renewable electricity, and smarter transport planning grows alongside it.

Pros and cons of e-mobility in Australia

Like any shift, going electric isn’t all smooth riding. Let’s break it down.

Pros

Lower emissions: EVs produce up to 70% fewer emissions over their lifetime than ICE vehicles, especially when powered by renewables.

Cheaper to run: Fewer moving parts, less servicing, and electricity is cheaper than fuel.

Energy resilience: E-mobility fits into a decentralised energy system, especially when vehicles can feed power back to the grid.

Better for health: Reduced exhaust fumes improve air quality and reduce respiratory illnesses.

Quiet and clean: No engine noise or petrol smell – a win for city dwellers and suburban streets.

Cons

Upfront cost: EVs and e-bikes still carry a higher sticker price, although rebates are helping.

Charging access: Regional Australia is still catching up on EV infrastructure.

Battery materials: Mining and manufacturing can carry social and environmental impacts, but these are improving.

How e-mobility fits Aussie life

E-mobility is well-suited to the Australian lifestyle. Our love of wide open roads, weekend escapes and daily commutes makes us ideal candidates for electrified transport, particularly as battery range and infrastructure improve.

E-bikes and scooters are perfect for short trips around town or replacing the second car. Families are switching to EVs for school runs and holidays. And e-motorbikes? Well, that’s where style meets sustainability.

Enter Savic Motorcycles: Aussie-made, electric-powered

Featured in Episode 1 of Energy Matters, Savic Motorcycles is leading the electric motorbike revolution in Australia. Founded by engineer Dennis Savic, the company hand-builds high-performance electric motorcycles that look like café racers but hum with futuristic tech.

The Savic C-Series delivers punchy acceleration, a top speed of 160 km/h and a real-world range of around 200 kilometres – more than enough for most weekend rides or city commutes. They’ve taken the grunt and growl of a traditional motorbike and swapped it for instant torque and quiet confidence.

But Savic isn’t just about making a statement. Their bikes are designed for net-zero riders, those who care about performance and the planet. Each model reflects the best of Aussie engineering and design, with the benefit of lower maintenance and zero tailpipe emissions.

Dennis summed up the e-motorbike experience in our recent Road to ZERO podcast:

“You kind of get into this mode when you’re riding – you’re not really thinking about anything else… you’re just gliding through the air.”

What stood out in Energy Matters was Savic’s commitment to local manufacturing and sustainability. They’re not importing bikes and slapping on a logo – they’re building a new standard for two-wheel travel right here on home soil.

Environmental impact: EVs vs ICE vehicles

On average, an EV emits 3–5 times less CO₂ over its life than a petrol vehicle, even when accounting for manufacturing and battery production. When powered by renewables, emissions drop even further.

Motorbikes aren’t always better by default – many ICE motorbikes emit more pollutants per kilometre than cars. So switching to e-motorbikes like Savic’s offers an outsized benefit, especially in urban environments.

Battery recycling is a challenge, but advances in reuse and repurposing are improving outcomes. As the industry matures, the environmental case for e-mobility only gets stronger.

The social and health upside

Cleaner air isn’t just good for the planet – it’s good for people. Reduced air pollution from tailpipes means:

Fewer asthma attacks

Lower cardiovascular disease rates

Reduced noise pollution, improving mental wellbeing

E-mobility also brings social equity benefits. E-scooters and e-bikes offer cheap, accessible transport. Public EV buses reduce noise and fumes in lower-income areas. Over time, electrified transport helps build healthier, fairer cities.

Final thoughts: E-mobility is here, and it’s electric

Australia’s journey to net zero won’t be won in the power station alone – it’s also won on the road. E-mobility is changing how we move, how we live and how we think about energy.

The team at Energy Matters is so excited to see e-mobility taking off in Australia and, even better, with Aussie brands and manufacturers stepping up. Innovators like Savic Motorcycles are showing that electric transport can be thrilling, stylish, and sustainable. The future is pretty exciting! We cannot wait to see what other innovators will step up in this space.

Whether you’re riding a Savic through the city or plugging in your family EV, you’re part of a shift that’s cleaner, quieter and better for all of us. If your daily commute allows for a change, consider riding, scooting, or driving in or on an electric alternative.",https://www.energymatters.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/The-Role-of-E-mobility-in-Australias-Clean-Energy-Future.png,N,,2025-06-02 00:02:10.833723

Or not.

A possible rollback of federal incentives for solar and other clean energy technologies threatens to derail the project before it starts. Such action also would undercut other major investments, including GreenSpark Solar’s plan to build a new 4½-story headquarters north of downtown.

“We're going to need a home, and I intend for it to be that building,” GreenSpark CEO Kevin Schulte said. ""I don't know when the time will be to pull the plug or not.”

Recent action, or inaction, at the federal and state level has clouded the future of the growing industry – spurred on by government incentives encouraging investment by consumers and providers alike.

President Donald Trump and his administration have sought to undo much of his predecessor’s clean energy agenda. Trump has mocked solar farms as “ridiculous.” And a House spending bill approved last month would rapidly phase out tax credits for solar, wind and electric vehicles.

The solar credits allow businesses to deduct 30% of new system costs from their federal taxes.

“I think that this version of the bill is worse than what people had anticipated,” said Anne Spaulding, the city’s manager of environmental quality.

Schulte called it “worse than my worst-case scenario.”

The deadline for companies to respond to the city’s request for rooftop solar proposals is Friday.

Plans are for a chosen company “to finance, design, install, own, maintain and operate rooftop solar” on the three downtown buildings, and possibly the terminal building at the Port of Rochester in Charlotte. The city would commit to buying all of the electricity that is generated.

“We don't know ... what the developers are, how they're going to react, and what type of proposals we're going to receive,” Spaulding said. “So we'll just have to wait and see.”

There had been an expectation that Biden-era clean energy incentives would be cut ever since the November election.

Solar, wind and battery storage accounted for 93% of new energy that came online last year, according to The American Clean Power Association. The threat of losing those benefits has led to a surge in business as homeowners and others rush to do installations and claim the federal tax credits – which can translate to a $8,000 to $9,000 savings for a typical homeowner.

“We've actually beat our residential solar sales goals for the year so far, and we have a lot of interest in our commercial business as well,” said Schulte, who is booked into the fall. “But, you know, when we go into 2026, the forecast is just going to be different.”

The House bill would eliminate tax credits for residential rooftop solar and battery storage at the end of 2025. Most larger projects would need to start construction within 60 days of the enactment of the bill, and be put in service by Dec. 31, 2028.

Many, including Schulte, had looked to New York state to fill the gap.

For starters, solar advocates hoped surplus funds in the NY-Sun program would be used to expand investment. Instead, most of it got reallocated this spring to other energy efficiency measures. And while the newly adopted state budget included a dedicated $1 billion climate action fund – focused on a shift toward electrification – a proposal to expand the residential solar tax credit was left out.

“Are they making it harder to make this kind of investment?” Schulte asked. “Yeah, they sure are.”

Schulte joined other solar advocates last week at the state capitol building in Albany to rally support for what’s called the ASAP act – or Accelerate Solar for Affordable Power. It’s a bill that would redouble the state’s support for growing solar capacity across New York.

“This is a go-big-or-go-home moment,” said Noah Ginsburg, executive director with the New York Solar Energy Industries Association, a trade group representing the state’s rooftop and community solar industry. ""We need the New York state Legislature to go big.”

All this unfolded in roughly a month’s time – as Schulte moved his employees and equipment from Ontario, Wayne County, into temporary space in downtown Rochester, anticipating the new headquarters. And the city put out its request for rooftop solar proposals.

The city buildings were chosen for the large open roof spaces unobstructed by tree cover. Each has high electricity usage, and “they’re very visible,” Spaulding said.

“So it's kind of a visible statement of our commitment to sustainability in the city,” she said.

The city’s project outline emphasizes that point, stating that beyond expected taxpayer savings from reduced electricity costs, the hope is to “encourage other municipalities, commercial entities, non-profit organizations, and residents to consider installing solar.”

To further that effort, and “to enhance public education,” the city document states, “each facility with rooftop solar installed must have a display describing the project and showing in real time the quantity of renewable energy generated by the solar system and the associated impacts of that generation.”

An increasing number of communities and government agencies have been installing solar panels on public buildings. Louisville, Kentucky, placed panels on a fire station, branch library and community center last year. San Antonio, Texas, is working on solar installations at 42 sites, including rooftop and parking facilities.

The city of Rochester has two small-sized rooftop solar systems, one on the Arnett branch library and the other at the Public Market. A third is planned for the future Maplewood Nature Center. And, back in 2017, the city installed a 2-megawatt solar field on the former Emerson Street landfill, helping to power City Hall and the city’s operations center on Mt. Read Boulevard.

When it comes to the city’s latest and largest rooftop project, GreenSpark’s Schulte said, “we have every intention of winning the bid to put up those projects.”

“Becoming unoptimistic is not going to be my strong suit as a business leader. If I end up being Captain Ahab and going down with the ship, I will,” he said.

“The reality for us is the Earth is still baking. The grid still has constraints. We still have work to do, and we will find a way to do it – whether the government of the state of New York or the federal government support us or not.”",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/0b55fc1/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4000x2100+0+450/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fc7%2Fbc%2F9cea33864733af3b9c649cfd74b3%2Fsolar-farm-10.jpg,N,,2025-06-02 01:02:16.739057

The global debate over China’s so-called renewable energy “overcapacity” has grown increasingly heated, largely driven by policymakers in the United States and the European Union. This criticism is puzzling: for over a decade, leaders around the world, including from the West, have called for exactly the kind of rapid green expansion China is now delivering.

“Let’s stop subsidising fossil fuels and start supporting the renewables revolution.” That has been the battle cry at nearly every major forum I have attended, from the UN and the World Bank, to the World Economic Forum, since the late 2000s.

Despite these calls, western governments have been slow to ramp up their green industries. Some western car companies even chose to cheat on emissions targets rather than accelerate the shift to electric vehicles (EVs). We in the west should take a long, honest look in the mirror before blaming China for doing exactly what we called for.

From criticism to collaboration

For developing countries, cheap Chinese solar panels mean that, for the first time in global history, there is a green path to prosperity. Historically, countries – starting with the United Kingdom during the industrial revolution – built their economies on fossils fuels, mainly coal. But today, solar power is cheaper than coal in key markets such as China, the US, India and Germany. A developing nation can now save money by switching from coal to solar, facilitating economic growth without assistance from richer nations. Over the past decade, the price of solar energy has fallen by nearly 90%. No one predicted this, and even fewer thought it feasible. This transformation has been driven by fierce competition among leading Chinese solar companies, including Tongwei, Longi, Trina, Jinco and Ja.

When Janet Yellen, US treasury secretary under the Biden administration, described Chinese government subsidies as contributing to excess production and undermining global market resilience, she overlooked the reality of global demand. During recent economically challenging times for China, few industries have remained as attractive to investors as clean energy. Business leaders have closely monitored the sector’s rapid growth, especially in solar production. From a global demand perspective, we face green under-capacity, not overcapacity. As long as products were expensive, demand remained naturally low, but now, with scale, costs have come down and demand continues to rise.

Chinese companies have undoubtedly benefited from the government’s green strategies. However, their investments and expansion are grounded in careful assessments of both domestic and international markets. When Chinese products succeed at home and abroad, the term “overcapacity” becomes irrelevant. On the contrary, there is an urgent need for even greater green investment and stronger demand globally.

China does not suffer from “overcapacity”; rather, it possesses productive capabilities that can greatly benefit the world. The country’s green industrial revolution offers unprecedented opportunities for global climate action. So instead of viewing China’s leadership in green industries as a threat, other countries should recognise it as a powerful engine accelerating the global energy transition – and step up to compete with it.

A global green pathway

Regions like Southeast Asia urgently need pathways to sustainable economic growth. China’s remarkable expansion in solar and EV sectors has been primarily driven by significant technological innovation, which has dramatically reduced costs in response to rising global demand.

A recent visit to Nepal strongly reinforced this viewpoint. The streets of Kathmandu were bustling with electric vehicles, placing Nepal alongside Norway and China as global leaders in EV adoption. Chinese EV dealerships line the city’s main avenues, offering affordable yet advanced technology, powered entirely by domestic hydropower. Replacing imported oil with domestic green energy is a triple win for Nepal: it reduces pollution, combats climate change and frees up funds that could be better spent on health or education.

According to the United Nations, developing countries require approximately USD 1.7 trillion annually in renewable energy investment, yet only USD 544 billion was invested globally in 2022. Far from having too much renewable energy capacity, we urgently need more affordable solutions to bridge this significant investment gap. Renewables must become abundant and cheap enough to silence the outdated “drill, baby, drill” mindset.

As Harvard economist Dani Rodrik puts it: “A glut in renewables and green products is precisely what the climate doctor ordered.”

In Indonesia, collaboration between China’s Trina Solar and local partners has led to the construction of one of Southeast Asia’s largest solar manufacturing plants. This USD 100 million facility has not only created hundreds of local jobs, but has also swiftly advanced Indonesia’s transition to clean energy.

Similarly, Chinese EV plants in Indonesia, Thailand, Türkiye, Uzbekistan, Brazil and many other developing countries are driving industrial upgrading and technology transfer. These partnerships clearly illustrate how China’s vast renewable capacity can empower developing economies, fostering shared prosperity rather than dependency.

Navigating legitimate concerns

Nevertheless, we must also carefully address legitimate concerns. Leaders in both developing and developed countries have shared apprehensions with me about becoming overly reliant on Chinese clean technology, which could potentially stifle local manufacturing and create long-term trade imbalances. These are valid points. It is only natural and necessary that heads of state prioritise jobs for their own citizens.

The solution lies not in protectionism, but in expanding international cooperation

The solution lies not in protectionism, but in expanding international cooperation. Through meaningful technology transfers, local manufacturing partnerships and capacity-building efforts, China can help other nations develop their own green industries and avoid one-sided reliance while advancing a more equitable global transition.

We need far greater global investment from Chinese clean-tech leaders – from EV and battery giants like BYD and CATL, to renewable energy companies such as Goldwind, Envision, China Three Gorges and all the major solar manufacturers. Last year, Tongwei alone produced more solar cells than the entire historical output of all but five nations. CATL and BYD now dominate the most critical component of the green revolution: electric batteries.

Parallels with global giants like Apple and Samsung help illustrate this point. Apple became the world’s most valuable company by efficiently supplying markets far beyond the US. Likewise, Samsung’s global leadership would have been impossible if it relied solely on its small domestic market in South Korea. Both companies operate with huge “overcapacity” – a key reason why the world has been able to buy their products.

Similarly, China’s renewable energy industry thrives precisely because it serves global markets, not just domestic demand.

China should export more EVs and batteries, build more solar and wind plants, and construct more high-speed rail systems and 5G networks as these technologies are essential to help meet urgent global demand. At the same time, this should be based on mutually agreed trade practices, and nations should legitimately expect technology transfer.

When I visited CATL’s headquarters in Ningde, southern China, it was discussed at length how instrumental BMW had been in the company’s rise. The German carmaker was a demanding customer, sharing best practices and technologies that helped shape CATL’s development. Today, CATL is a global leader and now it, too, should share its technology with the world, including Germany.

It remains unclear what impact trade wars will have on the green transition. Such conflicts make us all poorer and stall urgently needed innovation. There is, however, no indication that China, Europe, India or indeed any other major power will follow the US down this path. They are unlikely to embrace trade wars or slow the momentum of the green transformation. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi recently expressed the opposite view, declaring that India can now combine economic growth with ecological responsibility, growing its economy while protecting Mother Earth.

Over time, both the public and businesses in the US will act as counterweights to trade war policies. Companies like Ford and General Motors understand that the future of cars is electric. If they allow themselves to be confined to a domestic market of gasoline SUVs shaped by Trump, they will be the big losers in this technological revolution. Chinese companies will simply capture the global market. After all, no monarch in history could force people to ride horses once cars and trains had been invented.

Ultimately, true climate leadership today is not just about being a manufacturing hub; it is about becoming a committed partner in global development. The urgent transition to a green economy requires tools, technology, financing and expertise – resources China possesses in abundance. But delivering products alone is not enough. China must offer comprehensive solutions tailored to local contexts, creating jobs and opportunities where they are most needed.

The vibrant streets of Kathmandu, filled with EVs, represent not only Nepal’s progress, but also a vision for a greener future across Asia – the continent home to 60% of the world’s population. Rather than erecting barriers or fearing competition, nations should embrace collaboration, drawing on China’s industrial strengths to meet critical global climate goals. The task ahead demands creativity, international cooperation and a shared commitment to a sustainable future. Far from being “overcapacity”, China’s renewable energy potential should be seen as one of our greatest global opportunities.

Besides the Advanced Clean Trucks rule, Congress also revoked waivers for California’s Advanced Clean Cars II rule and its Heavy-Duty Engine Omnibus NOx rule.
Turning the clock back on both cleaner combustion engine requirements and zero-emission technology is an attack on clean air,” Randolph said.
Granting a California waiver has nationwide consequences.
Once the EPA issues a waiver to California, other states can adopt the California standards as their own.","WASHINGTON, DC, June 1, 2025 (ENS) – President Donald Trump is expected to sign two Congressional resolutions that will revoke the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency waivers from federal standards for California car and truck emissions rules.

Besides the Advanced Clean Trucks rule, Congress also revoked waivers for California’s Advanced Clean Cars II rule and its Heavy-Duty Engine Omnibus NOx rule.

Under the Clean Air Act of 1970, California’s emissions regulator, the California Air Resources Board, CARB, must request and receive an EPA waiver for each state regulation that exceeds federal standards.

The Advanced Clean Trucks rule is a manufacturers sales requirement for zero emission vehicles and a one-time reporting requirement for large fleets. It would require the majority of Class 8 big-rigs sold in California to be zero-emission vehicles by 2035.

The Advanced Clean Cars II regulations take the state’s growing zero-emission vehicle market and robust motor vehicle emission control rules and augments them to meet more aggressive tailpipe emissions standards and ramp up to 100 percent zero-emission vehicles. By 2035 all new passenger cars, trucks and SUVs sold in California will be zero emissions, says CARB.

The EPA’s California waiver for the Advanced Clean Cars II regs allows California, and the 11 other states that have opted to follow California’s lead on these regs, to require that all new passenger vehicles sold by 2035 be zero emission. Together, these states represent roughly 40 percent of new vehicle registrations in the United States.

On December 18, 2024, in the last weeks of President Joe Biden’s term, EPA granted formal federal approval of California’s NOx regulation for heavy-duty vehicles. California and adopting states can now enforce the record-low NOx and particulate matter standards for medium- and heavy-duty engines and vehicles.

But automakers insist that these goals are not feasible.

On May 21, the U.S.-based Alliance for Automotive Innovation, representing 44 car and truck manufacturers from around the world, released a statement by its President and CEO John Bozzella.

“The fact is these EV sales mandates were never achievable,” Bozzella declared after the Senate reversed the EPA’s approval of a waiver to California and 11 states to ban the sale of gas-powered vehicles by 2035 under the Advanced Clean Cars II regs.

“Automakers warned federal and state policymakers that reaching these EV sales targets would take a miracle, especially in the coming years when the mandates get exponentially tougher,” he said.

“There’s a significant gap between the marketplace and these EV sales requirements. In reality, meeting the mandates would require diverting finite capital from the EV transition to purchase compliance credits from Tesla. This doesn’t help EV adoption or build charging infrastructure but does create a domino effect leading to job and manufacturing losses, higher auto prices and fewer vehicle choices,” Bozzella said.

The Advanced Clean Trucks rule has been adopted in other states as encouraging a quicker transition to electric trucks than that set by the federal government. Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, Oregon, and Washington incorporated the requirements in the 2025 model year, according to the RV Industry Association.

“By the way, the problem really isn’t California. It’s the 11 states that adopted California’s rules without the same level of readiness for EV sales requirements of this magnitude,” he said. “The Senate (and the House before it) deserve enormous credit. Instead of kicking the can down the road or waiting for regulatory failure and its consequences, they voted to restore a degree of balance to U.S. vehicle emissions regulations.

“The auto industry has invested billions in electrification and has 144 electrified models on the market right now. Again, the concerns were about the mandate – not the technology. You can be against the ACC II EV mandates (we were) and believe that transportation is trending toward a range of electrified products like battery electric vehicles, hybrids and plug-in hybrids (it is),” Bozzella said. “That’s what balance looks like. And balance is not only good for consumers, but essential for the U.S. auto industry to remain healthy and globally competitive.”

EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin was pleased with the Congressional resolutions. “We are glad to see that Congress recognized the truth, that EPA’s California waivers are rules that would create a negative impact on all Americans by driving up costs while limiting consumer choice, and acted accordingly,” he said. “This action, once signed by President Trump, not only prevents California from implementing their attempt at EV mandate actions but ensures that they can never do something similar again.”

But Chair of the California Air Resources Board, Liane Randolph, called the Congressional resolutions “unconstitutional, illegal and foolish,” in a statement following the vote. She promised more action in the coming days and said the state agency would continue working with truck manufacturers on zero-emissions vehicles.

“California will pursue every available remedy to challenge these actions and defend our right to protect the public from dangerous air pollution. Turning the clock back on both cleaner combustion engine requirements and zero-emission technology is an attack on clean air,” Randolph said.

Certification for the 2026 model year is already well underway, said Steven Cliff, PhD, CARB Executive Officer, in a statement. “Assuming the disputed resolutions are signed by the President, CARB will continue to accept and process certification applications for model year 2026. This is necessary to provide certainty to affected parties and consumers, provide consistent treatment of regulated entities, maintain stability in the market, facilitate meeting the commitments of the Clean Truck Partnership, ensure the requirements of certification are met to enable lawful vehicle sales in California under [the] Health and Safety Code…” Cliff explained at length.

California will fight to keep its ability to win waivers from the EPA that allow the state to impose stricter emissions standards than the national ones. The state has some of the highest levels of pollution in the country, especially in dense urban areas such as Los Angeles and the Central Valley.

Saying the waiver revocations are a move that will “Make America Smoggy Again,” Governor Gavin Newsom and Attorney General Rob Bonta announced that the state will file a lawsuit challenging the Congressional resolutions.

The Clean Air Act authorizes only the federal government to regulate emissions from new motor vehicles and expressly preempts states from adopting or enforcing competing emissions regulations. The State of California is the lone exception.

The EPA has granted waivers over the decades as California has demonstrated its need for stricter-than-federal standards based on heavy smog that collects in the Los Angeles Basin and the Central Valley, according to the California Air Resources Board, which says, this is still the case.

“California has a serious smog problem, exacerbated by climate change, and still needs stricter-thanfederal standards to address it and many other climate and air quality issues. In fact, air quality in many parts of the state faces major threats as climate change worsens, leading to more smog, more wildfires, and increased risk. Climate change itself poses a severe threat to Californians,” CARB explains.

Air pollution in California today has improved under the state’s stricter emissions standards, but CARB says, “California’s unique geography means air quality goals still require continued progress on vehicle emissions. Seven of the 10 cities with the worst air pollution nationwide are in California. Ten million Californians in the San Joaquin Valley and Los Angeles air basins currently live under what is known as “severe nonattainment” conditions for ozone.”

“People in these areas suffer unusually high rates of asthma and cardiopulmonary disease. Zero-emission vehicles are a critical part of the plan to protect Californians,” CARB maintains.

“Climate change makes air quality worse and poses many other threats to Californians. It is already increasing the number of hot days that can result in smog events, impacting precipitation and snowpack, and exacerbating wildfires,” the state ageency warns.

“California’s geography – with its population in deep valleys, along the rising sea, and in fire-prone forests, makes the state especially climate vulnerable,” CARB states on its website. “In the future, sea level rise will imperil the coast, and hotter temperatures statewide will lead to higher levels of pollution in our cities.”

California argues that it has demonstrated that its standards are feasible, and that auto manufacturers have enough lead time to develop the technology to meet them. It has done so for every waiver it has submitted. The greenhouse gas and zero-emission electric vehicle standards underwent a midterm review that confirmed that the industry was on track.

“In a massive handout to special interests, the Senate today took a radical action that creates enormous policy uncertainty for the entire transportation industry,” said John Boesel, president and CEO of Calstart, an industry organization focused on transportation decarbonization.

“This move concedes the industries of the future to global competitors, will increase air pollution, accelerate global warming and result in significant job loss,” he said.

“This vote upends decades of policy that has successfully resulted in cleaner air and the growth of a robust clean transportation industry. It is a brazen, yet futile, attempt to bring the clean transportation industry to a sudden halt,” Boesel alleged. “Calstart will continue to partner with the states working to fill this gaping void left by today’s federal action.”

Republicans Originated the California Waiver

The California waiver was established by Republicans at both the state and federal levels. Since 1970 when Ronald Reagan as Governor of California initially requested the waiver authority from the federal government, and President Richard Nixon signed the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1970, granting California waiver authority, the state has used its own air quality needs to lead the country toward cleaner air.

Granting a California waiver has nationwide consequences. Regulatory requirements in California, the most populous state, can affect markets nationwide. Once the EPA issues a waiver to California, other states can adopt the California standards as their own. To date, 17 states and Washington, DC, have opted in to standards for light-duty vehicles and 10 have done so for heavy-duty vehicles.

The automakers argue that this move could undermine the country's push for cleaner, zero-emission transportation.

EV Makers Advocate for Pure Electric Solutions

In letters to the Ministry of Heavy Industries, companies like Tata Motors and Mahindra & Mahindra have urged the government to limit incentives and policy support strictly to fully electric vehicles.

They contend that hybrids, which combine internal combustion engines with electric propulsion, still rely on fossil fuels and produce tailpipe emissions, albeit lower than conventional vehicles. This reliance, they argue, could derail the momentum and investments dedicated to EV development, especially with India’s ambitions to scale EV adoption.

""Our plea is for government policy and incentives to stay firmly focused only on EVs,"" Mahindra stated in its correspondence to the ministry.

Policy Uncertainty and Investment Risks

The potential shift in policy has raised concerns about creating confusion among car buyers, companies, and investors. With only 5,384 of the 847,544 government fleet vehicles being EVs in 2022, the opportunity for EV growth is significant. However, support for hybrids could introduce policy uncertainty, deter critical investment, and impact India's global image as an investor-friendly destination.

Tata Motors, which has raised substantial capital for its EV push, emphasised that the commission's move could undermine current and proposed EV investments. The company highlighted the importance of a consistent and predictable policy environment to attract long-term investors, particularly in high-capex, technology-intensive sectors like EVs.

Diverging Industry Perspectives

The opposition from EV manufacturers also pits them against hybrid advocates like Toyota and Maruti Suzuki. These companies have been promoting hybrids as a practical solution to reduce emissions, especially in regions with inadequate charging infrastructure. The debate underscores a key policy divergence in India's automotive strategy, with different stakeholders advocating for varying approaches to achieve cleaner transportation.

States Add Complexity to the Policy Mix

Adding to the complexity, some Indian states have taken steps that favour hybrid vehicles. For instance, Uttar Pradesh has decided to maintain a waiver on registration taxes for hybrid cars, a decision beneficial to Toyota but unfavourable to Tata Motors and Mahindra & Mahindra. Similarly, Karnataka plans to implement tax waivers and financial incentives to promote the clean mobility sector, including a significant tax cut for hybrid cars.

Tata And Mahindra On Why Betting on EVs Alone is the Right Move

India does not have the luxury of time or the financial leeway to hedge its bets across too many parallel technologies. Supporting strong hybrids may appear practical, but it risks diverting attention and resources from the long-term goal of full electrification.

Unlike EVs, hybrids still burn fossil fuels and contribute to tailpipe emissions. Their existence prolongs dependence on a fuel supply chain India largely imports, weakening the country’s energy security ambitions.

More importantly, hybrids are a stopgap technology whose window of relevance is fast closing. Many developed countries are already transitioning from hybrids to pure EVs. If India chooses to support hybrids today, it risks building an ecosystem that may become obsolete within a decade.

The focus instead should be on scaling charging infrastructure, localising battery manufacturing, and incentivising cleaner grid energy — efforts that will directly strengthen EV adoption.

The argument isn't that hybrids have no place, but that government fleets, meant to set an example, must prioritise zero-emission vehicles. A decisive push for EVs sends a clearer, stronger message, both to consumers and to the industry. The time to double down on electrification is now, not later. Hybrids belong in the past. India’s future should be unapologetically electric.",https://cdn.cartoq.com/photos/052025/mahindra_tata_govt_hybrid_cars_purchase_opposition_featured_9f0637e9d2.jpg,N,,2025-06-02 01:02:22.405310

In April, The New York Times reported on a global drop in sales for Tesla — and now, more specific elements of that drop are coming into focus, along with the companies that stand to benefit from Tesla’s issues.

Among the emerging winners in the EV market is GM, who recently displaced Tesla as the top EV seller in Canada for the first quarter of 2025. Writing at Electrek, Peter Johnson has more on the news, including that the electric versions of the Chevrolet Equinox and Silverado were the two top-selling EVs from the company for the quarter.

“The entire Cadillac portfolio grew by 63.5 per cent, compared to first quarter 2024, our trucks and midsize SUVs continue to lead the competition, and more new customers are choosing GM electric vehicles for performance and affordability,” said GM Canada’s Vice President for Sales, Service and Marketing, Shane Peever, in a statement.

There are some other good reasons for GM’s rise to the top of Canada’s EV sales charts. One of them has to do with Canadian governmental policy — like its neighbor to the south, Canada has restricted the sales of Chinese EVs from companies like BYD. There’s also the fact that Tesla hasn’t exactly given buyers a lot of new options to choose from recently, Cybertruck aside — and the Cybertruck is the kind of vehicle that isn’t designed to get a neutral reaction.","https://www.insidehook.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/gm-ev.jpg?resize=1200,800",N,,2025-06-02 01:02:36.082775

HÀ NỘI — Việt Nam's energy transition presents challenges in the years ahead, but it also offers clear opportunities to establishing stable and long-term foundations for a sustainable economic future.

The challenges include the need for advanced digital and AI technologies, robust energy storage systems and substantial upgrades to grid infrastructure, in order to manage the increased load from renewable energy sources.

Speaking with Việt Nam News on the sidelines of a recent high-level technical seminar, Tok Kian Seng, head of Section for Offshore Infrastructure SEA & Japan, Energy Systems APAC at DNV, pointed out the challenges in the energy transition process.

Many countries also face obstacles in upgrading and expanding their grid systems to accommodate more renewable energy sources while maintaining a stable balance between supply and demand, he said.

Trần Hoài Trang, deputy director general of the Electricity Regulatory Authority under the Ministry of Industry and Trade, said that energy plays a pivotal role in laying the groundwork for Việt Nam’s socio-economic development.

Resolution No. 55 of the Politburo on the national energy development strategy to 2030, with a vision towards 2045, said that energy supply, particularly electricity, has broadly met the demands of economic and social growth.

However, the energy sector still faces considerable limitations, he said at the seminar titled 'Supporting Việt Nam’s Energy Transition Journey', co-organised by the Electricity Regulatory Authority and the Norwegian Embassy in Hà Nội.

Ensuring national energy security remains a pressing issue, as domestic supply sources fall short and reliance on imported energy continues to rise, he said.

Thus, developing renewable energy, especially wind power and solar power, is an inevitable direction, in line with the country's potential and strengths and the world's development trends.

Despite global investment in energy projects showing signs of decline, the Asia–Pacific region, (including Việt Nam), is expected to maintain stable demand for large-scale energy infrastructure, said the APAC Offshore Wind Segment Lead at DNV Energy Systems, Zhang Minghui.

Offshore wind power in the region is evolving. The APAC market is not just expected to overtake other markets but also evolving to keep up with the trends such as energy security, he said.

In Việt Nam, the revised National Power Development Plan VIII (PDP8), approved on April 15, 2025 via Decision No. 768/QĐ-TTg, marks a bold turning point in the country’s energy strategy to 2050.

The plan clearly outlines a shift away from coal, instead prioritising the development of renewable energy, energy storage, nuclear power and emerging fuels such as green ammonia and hydrogen.

With an estimated offshore wind potential of 600GW, the highest in Southeast Asia, Việt Nam is positioning itself as a regional leader in clean energy.

The plan sets ambitious targets, including 6 to 17GW of offshore wind capacity by 2035, alongside major investments in grid infrastructure and battery storage.

Việt Nam is also strengthening its role in the regional supply chain, especially in manufacturing offshore substations and foundation structures.

There is vast potential for offshore wind development in Việt Nam due to its long coastline and consistent wind speeds, ideal conditions for offshore wind projects, Tok added.

According to Tok, digital technologies are key to the energy transition.

They can significantly improve efficiency, reduce costs and minimise environmental impacts.

Tools such as predictive maintenance and real-time monitoring enable strategic decision-making, while AI offers valuable insights for navigating system uncertainties.

Energy companies should embrace innovation through digital transformation while managing cybersecurity risks with structured diligence frameworks like SeSAM, he said.

DNV provides advisory, assurance and risk management services.

“We will leverage our global advantages together with local resources to tackle challenges and unlock new opportunities, in order to accelerate the progress of energy transition together.

“So we look forward to be the trusted partner for Việt Nam to achieve a sustainable and resilient energy of future,” he said.

Solutions

Senior Vice President - Special Projects at DNV Energy Systems, Jeffrey Lim, pointed out five key solutions to advance the energy transition in the Asia-Pacific region.

The first solution is to increase investment in renewable technologies such as solar and wind. The second solution is to scale up the deployment of energy storage systems.

Another solution is to strengthen carbon credit pricing mechanisms, including carbon taxes and emissions trading schemes.

Enhancing international cooperation and financial support for clean energy projects was one of the solutions, he said.

The fifth solution is to develop stable, technology-neutral policies that enable fair competition among all energy sources.

Meanwhile, Zhang emphasised the decisive role of collaboration, not only within regional supply chains but also through knowledge transfer and digital integration.

“The lessons learnt from other regions are important as well - not just about sharing of new technologies but also about embracing digitalisation,” he added.

Ambassador of Norway to Việt Nam, Hilde Solbakken, stressed the importance of a well-defined Government framework for innovation and research and development.

In Norway, a key role of the Government in achieving the green energy transition is to provide the framework for innovation, research and development, including also some finance instruments for the private sector.

“But it is the private sector that will be able to find the actual solutions and implement them, and not least to make them cost-effective,” she said.

Trang, from the Electricity Regulatory Authority, said to firm up the Party and State’s policies on renewable energy development, the ministry has advised on the content of reports submitted to the Prime Minister for presentation to the National Assembly regarding the promulgation of the Law on Electricity.

In November 2024, the Government and the ministry issued a number of subordinate legal documents to finalise key policies for the power and renewable energy sectors, particularly with regard to offshore wind power, paving the way for large-scale deployment of renewable energy projects in the near future.

Additionally, the ministry actively coordinated with other ministries, sectors and local authorities to implement the drafting of Power Development Plan VIII.

The plan prioritises the vigorous promotion of clean, green energy sources, aims to minimise environmental impact and gradually reduce the negative effects of climate change, he said.

It is underpinned by a strategic vision to fully harness the nation’s potential and advantages in energy development, with a special emphasis on renewable energy across three core objectives of meeting domestic energy demand, facilitating the direct power purchase mechanism, and supporting electricity exports.

The revised plan puts forward 11 groups of solutions, with several key measures highlighted.

Firstly, it proposes the continued improvement of mechanisms and policies to establish a clear and enabling legal corridor for the implementation of power projects.

Secondly, it calls for regular engagement with local authorities to support and facilitate power project developers in ensuring that implementation proceeds according to schedule.

Thirdly, the plan advocates for diversifying funding sources and mobilisation channels, ranging from Government and banking finance to aid capitals.

It also seeks to attract both domestic and foreign investment, encouraging broad participation across economic sectors in the energy industry.

“With synchronous solutions from management methods of power development and project implementation, I believe that investors will have enough legal framework to implement power projects in general, renewable energy projects in particular, contributing to the implementation of Việt Nam's Energy Development Strategy,” Trang added.

This innovation marks a significant leap in the realm of energy production, potentially igniting a technological revolution with far-reaching economic and geopolitical implications. The hybrid nature of Xinghuo, combining both fusion and fission reactions, promises to maximize energy output while minimizing radioactive waste, setting a new benchmark in nuclear power efficiency and sustainability. As the world eagerly watches China’s ambitious endeavor, the implications for global energy dynamics are profound.

The Science Behind Fusion and Fission

At the core of current nuclear power technology is fission, a process that involves splitting heavy atomic nuclei such as uranium to release energy. In contrast, fusion is the reaction that powers our sun, where two lighter atomic nuclei combine to form a heavier nucleus, releasing a massive amount of energy in the process. Fusion, in theory, can produce four times more energy per kilogram of fuel compared to fission, making it an incredibly efficient energy source.

The unique feature of the Xinghuo plant is its ability to merge these two reactions. The high-energy neutrons produced by the fusion process are used to initiate fission in surrounding materials, creating a self-sustaining cycle that maximizes energy production. This dual-stage reactor system is ingeniously designed to utilize every particle to its fullest potential, potentially revolutionizing how we harness nuclear energy.

Financial and Technical Ambitions

The Xinghuo project comes with a hefty price tag of approximately $2.7 billion, aiming for a continuous production capacity of 100 megawatts. Although this output is akin to a small nuclear reactor, Xinghuo’s ambition lies in achieving a Q factor greater than 30. The Q factor is a measure of the ratio of energy produced to energy consumed in heating the plasma. For comparison, the ITER project in France is targeting a Q of 10, while recent achievements in the U.S. boast a Q of 1.5. Such ambitious goals underscore China’s determination to lead in next-generation nuclear technology.

The plant will be constructed on Yaohu Island in Jiangxi province, an area rich in copper resources essential for the superconducting cables needed in plasma confinement. This strategic location aligns with China’s vision to integrate scientific advancement with resource availability, ensuring the project’s success and sustainability.

Environmental Considerations and Strategic Positioning

Before the Xinghuo plant can begin operations, it must pass a comprehensive environmental impact assessment. This evaluation will include analyses of air and water quality, noise emissions, and the potential impact on local ecosystems. Moreover, the report will feature a risk management plan and long-term monitoring strategy, reflecting the project’s commitment to adhering to public opinion and health standards.

If construction proceeds as planned, China could connect its hybrid plant to the power grid by 2030, potentially outpacing the ITER project, which aims for an operational date of 2035 at the earliest. This strategic advancement not only positions China as a leader in nuclear innovation but also challenges other nations to accelerate their efforts in clean energy technology.

China’s Broader Energy Strategy

China’s energy strategy extends beyond the Xinghuo project, as it concurrently develops the China Fusion Engineering Test Reactor in Hefei, focusing solely on fusion technology. This initiative could propel China to the forefront of nuclear energy innovation, offering a pragmatic and less bureaucratic alternative to projects like ITER.

China’s energy consumption is immense, and as the world’s largest energy consumer, the country is rapidly transitioning from coal to renewable and nuclear energy sources. By 2030, China plans to install 1,720 gigawatts of solar and wind capacity, surpassing its initial targets. The nation also aims to increase its natural gas demand and achieve 20% non-fossil energy consumption by 2025, with a goal of carbon neutrality by 2060. Investments in energy storage and green hydrogen further support this ambitious transition.

As China boldly moves forward with the Xinghuo hybrid reactor, the world watches with anticipation. This project not only represents a technological milestone but also raises questions about the future of global energy leadership. How will other nations respond to China’s advancements in nuclear technology, and what role will hybrid energy systems play in the global pursuit of sustainable power?

Any attempt to build out RE to replace coal power plants faces regulatory difficulties, including procurement and tariff mechanism challenges.
Ember notes that 26.8GW of new coal capacity could be added by 2031, and captive coal capacity could reach 31.5GW.","Asia, the world’s largest continent, is home to the biggest fleet of coal plants, burning the most carbon-intensive fossil fuel.

China, Japan, South Korea, and Indonesia, housing more than a quarter of the global population, have all increased coal power capacity since 2020. Their additions account for 57% of the world’s 2024 coal-fired capacity of 2,143 gigawatts (GW). China alone, for example, is adding 95GW capacity – equaling almost half of the European Union’s (EU) total coal fleet and 55% of the U.S.

Despite capacity addition, the utilization hours of the coal plants have fallen across all four countries, highlighting the potential to shut down inefficient plants. At the same time, each country has increased its share of energy generated from renewables. The new plants could run for lower hours, and rapid renewable energy (RE) buildouts could be prioritized. Solar and wind, in particular, are cheap and quickly deployable energy sources.

Given each country’s diverse economic structures and energy policies, scaling finance and managing risks for coal phaseouts means negotiating different priorities and pathways. The rapid buildout of renewables in these countries will further erode the share of coal generation in the power mix.

Changes in fossil and renewable energy 2020-23/24

Coal has remained a stubborn component in each country’s national energy supply. China and Indonesia remain the most coal-dominant, with over half of all energy sourced from the fuel. Japan and South Korea rely mainly on imported fossil fuels, doing little to reduce coal reliance. Coal use has remained unchanged and is at the core of the generation mix in both countries. The use of liquefied natural gas (LNG) varies due to its fluctuating high cost; however, it has remained relatively unaffected.

Despite pledges to decarbonize in all four countries, coal-fired capacity has increased (Table 1).

In 2023, Japan and South Korea had a higher share of gas-fired capacity in total fossil fuel generation at 54% and 46%, respectively, compared to 24% for Indonesia and 10% for China (Table 2).

Meanwhile, all four countries have increased the share of energy sourced from renewables. China had the highest rise in absolute terms, with a 0.65GW increase per capita from 2020 to 2024, almost entirely driven by solar and wind (0.61GW). Japan added 0.14GW per capita of mainly solar energy from 2020 to 2023.

From 2020 to 2023, China recorded the largest increase in RE generation per capita, rising to 0.39GW. Japan and South Korea registered increases of 0.27GW and 0.3GW, respectively. China’s RE generation per capita was 46% of its fossil fuel generation, while Japan’s was higher at 69%. Indonesia had a minimal increase, which aligns with its limited increase in RE capacity.

Coal usage in the four countries

In 2024, China reported 4,392 utilization hours for its coal plants – an increase of 4% from 2020. This implies a 48% utilization rate of coal-fired power plants (CFPPs) for 8,760 total annual hours. In 2023, Indonesia’s utilization hours were 4,204, a decrease of 13% from the previous year, with a 38% increase in coal power capacity. For the same year, Japan’s coal utilization hours declined by 15% to 5,905, presenting a utilization rate of 67%. Meanwhile, in 2024, South Korea’s utilization hours were 5,110, a decrease of 10% from 2020, signifying a 58% utilization rate.

Compared with 2020, Japan and South Korea reduced their coal utilization hours in 2023 by 15% and 10%, respectively. However, both countries boosted their coal power capacity over the same period. Japan added 14%, and South Korea added 9% more coal capacity. Two units of 650MW capacity each were completed at Japan’s Yokosuka plant in June and December 2023.

These utilization rates are low for all four countries. Ultra-supercritical (USC) coal plants, used for the most recent builds, should have utilization rates of above 80%, while older subcritical plants should be able to operate at 65% and above. Low utilization rates imply that these countries may have overbuilt coal capacity. Thus, there could be substantial room to retire the oldest, least efficient plants. As RE additions progress, these rate dynamics are likely to evolve further.

RE eroding the share of coal generation in China’s power mix

Since 2020, China has added enough wind and solar capacity to have the flexibility to reduce fossil fuel reliance. Wind and solar account for 42% of total power capacity in 2024 (Table 7), and RE accounts for 35% of electricity generation.

Recent events, such as the withdrawal of the U.S. from the Paris Agreement in January 2025, have directed the focus to China. Some commentators have presented China as a climate leader and emphasized the buildout of its RE capacity, while others stress that the country is still increasing its coal capacity.

The building of both RE and coal power capacity could be viewed as complementary. Currently, RE capacity is underutilized due to transmission constraints resulting in an urgency to upgrade the grid. The Lantau Group, a consultancy specializing in the China power sector, has stated that the country’s coal generation hours could peak during 2025. However, this is dependent on the availability of hydropower which in 2022 accounted for just 14% of power generation compared to 18% in 2020. Additionally, some of China’s new coal capacity additions are flexible USC coal plants, able to operate at rates as low as 30% utilization, giving priority to RE.

Global Energy Monitor’s Sustainability by Numbers states, “China is building more coal plants but might burn less coal”. In 2023, China added 50GW of coal but retired 4GW. Also, these coal plants are more likely to be approved at the provincial rather than the central level as this improves the economic scorecard for provinces. These conflicting decision-making priorities between central-based renewable capacity and provincial-based coal capacity have yet to be resolved.

There are two positive developments. First, the rapid buildout of solar and wind capacity from 2020 to 2024 provides the flexibility to use additional RE. Second, the current tariff pricing discourages growth in gas generation compared to competitively priced RE.

In 2020, China’s wind power generation capacity was 329GW, while solar power was 307GW. By the end of 2024, wind power capacity had increased by 85% to 521GW, and solar capacity had risen by more than twofold to 887GW. During this period, coal capacity grew by 15%, or 157GW, and total thermal capacity was 219GW, or 18%, compared to an 872GW increase in wind and solar power.

There are concerns that wind and solar power additions will slow in 2025. S&P Global reports that the National Energy Administration (NEA) has targeted 60% of non-fossil fuel capacity additions in 2025. 430GW of capacity additions are expected, and RE additions are estimated to be around 200GW. This is comparable with 275GW in solar and 88GW in wind power generation in 2024. Reuters reports that the China Photovoltaic Industry Association has forecast a range of 215GW to 255GW with the power pricing mechanism in June 2025 for new RE plants to sell power on a market basis. This new pricing could mean less generous subsidies for new solar farms. Carbon Brief reports that China started work on 94.5GW of coal power in 2024.

Wind and solar power accounted for 9.5% of total power generation in 2020, increasing to 14.4% in 2024. The estimated utilization hours for solar capacity in 2024 were 473 compared to 1,030 hours in 2020. This suggests that there is room to increase solar power generation subject to transmission grid upgrades. The State Grid of China has estimated capital expenditure at RMB650 billion (bn) or USD89bn for 2025.

Tariffs are a significant reason for the increase in RE generation and the limited growth of gas power. The Shenhua Group’s (one of China’s largest utilities) 2024 annual report shows that the average coal tariff that year was USD55 per megawatt-hour (MWh) compared to USD44 per MWh for solar. The gas tariff was USD77 per MWh, which is 39% higher than coal and 74% higher than solar (Table 9). High gas tariffs are the primary reason that LNG is unable to displace coal in China’s power mix.

Despite rising Chinese imports over the last decade, LNG has not displaced coal and has been used for industrial purposes. RE has eroded the share of coal generation in the country’s power mix. China relies on domestically produced resources, not LNG, for energy security and reliability.

Starting from June 2025, China will move towards a market-based tariff for RE, resulting in higher tariffs and limited utilization for new projects. Existing RE projects will retain their current pricing, while new projects will shift to the new market-based rates. This could mean a surge in RE projects being completed ahead of the 2025 price changes.

Captive coal and RE transition challenges in Indonesia

Coal accounted for 56% of Indonesia’s 93GW power capacity in 2023, while gas constituted 22%. The country is emerging as the world’s top nickel supplier, used in steel and EV battery production.

11.2GW, or 20% of Indonesia’s total coal-fired power generation capacity, is used to support nickel smelters. There are approximately 20GW of new captive coal plants in the pipeline. Any attempt to build out RE to replace coal power plants faces regulatory difficulties, including procurement and tariff mechanism challenges.

Indonesia faces three challenges in its transition to RE. First is the issue of captive coal plants. Ember estimates that out of the current 49.7GW of CFPP capacity, 11.2GW is from captive coal plants, mainly supporting nickel smelters, with an additional 20GW of captive coal-fired capacity proposed. The second issue is finding ways to mobilize the USD20bn from the Just Energy Transition Partnership (JETP). While the U.S. has withdrawn from the program, Germany and Japan are stepping into co-leadership roles. The third issue is that RE projects face policy risks such as granting equity stakes to the national electricity utility, PT Perusahaan Listrik Negara (PLN), procurement transparency, carbon credits surrendering, and low RE tariffs.

Indonesia’s coal capacity increased by 14.3GW from 37.3GW in 2020 to 51.6GW in 2023. Ember notes that 26.8GW of new coal capacity could be added by 2031, and captive coal capacity could reach 31.5GW. Over the same period, gas power capacity increased from 1.6GW to 20.7GW. Total RE (hydro, bio, geothermal, wind, and solar) rose from 10.5GW to 13.1GW, while solar power increased by only 0.4GW, with a negligible increase in wind capacity. The share of RE only accounts for 14% of Indonesia’s total power capacity in 2023, compared to 56% for coal and 22% for gas.

Overcoming hurdles to reduce coal-fired capacity and boost RE in Indonesia

The demand for electric vehicle (EV) batteries has driven Indonesia’s nickel output growth. According to industry consultant Roskill, nickel demand for batteries is forecast to rise from 6% in 2020 to 33% in 2030. Indonesia imposed an export ban on nickel ore in January 2014 and encouraged the building of new smelters for processing.

According to Statista, Indonesian nickel production was 770,000 tonnes in 2020, but by 2024, S&P Global calculates that production reached 2.1 million (mn) tonnes. Indonesia’s global nickel share has grown from 16% in 2019 to 43% in 2024. China-led investment made this increase possible. According to China’s Ministry of Commerce, the country’s total direct investment in Indonesia was USD4.4bn in 2021, and USD4.5bn in 2022. Chinese investment in the Indonesian nickel sector is estimated to be USD30bn, and there are currently 43 nickel smelters operating in Indonesia. These plants are powered by 11.2GW of captive coal power.

Private companies would be responsible for replacing these plants with RE projects. However, if RE plants have excess capacity to replace captive coal, that would need to be discussed with PLN.

The Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air and the Global Energy Monitor highlight that other industries, such as glass and aluminum, may also require captive coal plants, identifying that an additional 15.2GW could be added by 2026.

The JETP incorporates ambitious national plans designed to support select developing economies, providing the financing to retire high carbon-emitting power plants and developing RE generation. There are currently four countries covered by the JETP - South Africa, Senegal, Indonesia, and Vietnam. The latter two are valued at USD20bn and USD15bn, respectively. The funding consists of grants, guarantees, and concessional and commercial loans and includes public financing from countries and regions such as the EU, United Kingdom, Japan, and Germany. Private funders include multilateral development banks and climate investment funds. Given current U.S. efforts to boost LNG exports, its exit from JETP may increase the scaling up of RE capacity without using gas as a transition fuel.

Indonesia has not included private captive coal power in its decarbonization commitments under JETP. This risks the program’s funding and support, given that supporting countries, businesses, and philanthropies are unlikely to assist in shuttering older coal plants in one area only to see new ones built elsewhere.

Current Indonesian policies and onerous bidding and contractual requirements that deter solar and wind power are the most significant challenges in replacing coal power in the long term. These raise costs and discourage private investment. In 2023, Indonesia attracted only USD1.5bn in RE investment but needs to secure USD146bn in the near term to meet the country’s 2030 climate target.

Several regulatory challenges are holding back renewable energy development in the country. First, either PLN or its subsidiary has to own at least 51% equity interest in RE projects. Second, ceiling tariffs for RE projects are too low, making achieving profit targets difficult. Third, under recent power purchase agreements, any carbon credits must be fully allocated to PLN, and independent power producers cannot benefit from them. Finally, the procurement procedures are not transparent. Revising RE project regulations can create an investor-friendly environment for Indonesia and accelerate the energy transition.

South Korea and its LNG “power tariff trilemma”

In 2023, coal accounted for 33%, and gas comprised 27% of South Korea’s power capacity. Due to increased solar power, RE (solar, wind, and bioenergy, excluding pumped hydro) constituted 23% of total capacity. The country is in a “power tariff trilemma” where interconnected challenges of energy security, competitiveness, and sustainability have contributed to rising electricity bills due to the high share of LNG-based gas power generation.

The country has also pushed to build new LNG import terminals and storage facilities despite having some of the lowest utilization rates for its existing terminals.

The country’s coal capacity accounted for 28% of the total power capacity in 2020 and 27% in 2023, while LNG constituted 33% of capacity share in 2020 and 31% in 2023. RE (solar, wind, and bioenergy, excluding pumped hydro) increased from 18% in 2020 to 23% in 2023, driven by a 10GW increase in solar power. This is half of China’s 36% wind and solar share of total capacity in 2023.

The share of coal in power generation declined from 36% in 2020 to 33% in 2023. The share of gas also dropped slightly from 28% in 2020 to 27% in 2023. In 2022, South Korea incurred USD17bn additional costs for LNG-fired power generation due to the over-reliance of utilities on fossil fuels. The slow adoption of RE is a missed opportunity to reduce power prices. The share of wind and solar in South Korea’s power generation increased from 7% in 2020 to just 9% in 2023.

South Korea pursued fossil fuel-oriented energy security, assuming it would guarantee an affordable electricity supply. This approach faced headwinds as the Russia-Ukraine war disrupted gas and coal markets. Soaring fossil fuel prices, especially LNG, and South Korea’s heavy reliance on fossil fuels (58.5% in 2023) led to total fuel costs of USD25bn during this period.

Due to South Korea’s regulated power pricing mechanism, the national utility Korea Electric Power Corporation (KEPCO) sold electricity to consumers at prices that did not cover fuel costs. KEPCO had to issue more debt to cover the revenue gap. At the time, the utility’s RE capacity was only 2% of total power capacity.

South Korea could benefit by reducing reliance on fossil fuels in the power mix and expediting the transition to clean energy sources. Power pricing should also be reformed to reflect actual costs.

Japan could benefit from reducing its reliance on gas

In 2023, coal accounted for 34% of Japan’s generation, while gas contributed 36%. RE sources (hydro, solar, wind, and bioenergy) constituted 23% in 2023 due to increased solar power.

Japan has the third-highest installed solar capacity globally due in large part to attractive feed-in-tariff policies instituted in 2012 in the wake of the 2011 Fukushima disaster.

The country’s LNG consumption has fallen 25% in the last decade as nuclear facilities have restarted and RE sources have developed.

Japan’s Seventh Strategic Energy Plan emphasizes a “self-development ratio”, encouraging Japanese companies to invest directly in fossil fuel development abroad. Shifting from fossil fuels to RE would reduce the risks of continued reliance on fossil fuels. Although the country has increased solar capacity from 2020 to 2023, the shares for coal and gas remain at a combined 44% for 2023. The share of RE (including hydro, solar, wind, and bioenergy) in the total capacity rose from 35% in 2020 to 39% in 2023.

The share of coal in power generation has remained steady at 34% from 2020 to 2023. Gas share in power generation declined from 41% in 2020 to 36% in 2023. In 2022, surging LNG prices and a weakened Yen drove Japan’s annual electricity price to JPY20.4 per kilowatt-hour (kWh) (USD0.14/kWh) compared to the 2005-2024 range of JPY6.5-16.5/kWh (USD0.04-0.11/kWh).

Japan aims to increase vertical integration in fossil fuel procurement and delivery and the self-development ratio from 35% to 50% by 2030. This ratio represents the share of the offtake amount of oil and natural gas controlled by Japanese entities. Notably, LNG projects in Mozambique, Canada, and the Middle East resulted in losses for Japanese companies.

RE development could help enhance energy security and affordability in Japan. The utility-scale sales rate for RE was JPY9.9/kWh in 2023, less than half of JPY22.3/kWh for gas and JPY18.6/kWh for coal in the same year. Japan, with its technological leadership, is well-positioned to integrate RE and grid-scale battery storage.

The economics of RE prevails despite unique challenges

From 2020 to 2023, all four Asian countries reduced coal and fossil fuel use and increased RE capacity. Despite renewables being the most cost-effective energy source, these countries are finding it difficult to break coal’s grasp. Japan and South Korea appear reluctant to write off the sunk cost of coal, while China and Indonesia are reticent to let go of a domestic but expensive energy source.

Despite each country’s unique challenges, expediting the transition to clean energy sources connects logically with economic and climate commitments. For Japan, South Korea, and Indonesia, where fuel costs are denominated in U.S. Dollars, accelerated RE deployment can create a natural near-term hedge against global volatility.

Mark Westfall, who led a team of 50 engineers working on energy products, announced in April that he had left Tesla, Electrek reported. He worked on such projects as Supercharger, Powerwall, and Megapack.

Westfall had worked at the electric vehicle pioneer for 10 years.

""It's hard to put into words what Tesla has meant to me,"" Westfall wrote on LinkedIn. ""I never imagined the places this job would take me, or the impact I would be able to have.""

According to Electrek, Westfall left to become director of engineering at Redwood Materials, which itself has many ties to Tesla. The company buys scrap materials from Tesla's battery-manufacturing process, which it then recycles to create new battery materials.

Tesla co-founder and board member JB Straubel founded Redwood, and several of its executives are former Tesla employees.

Westfall became the latest high-ranking employee to leave Tesla so far in 2025. It has also said goodbye to the head of its Indian market, a vice president of software engineering, the technical program manager for its Cortex supercomputer, and two of its top automotive designers.

This mass departure of talent comes at a time when Tesla's business has been slipping. The company's 2025 first-quarter sales numbers are down globally, and its net income dropped 71% from Q1 2024.

Overall, however, EV sales continue to grow as more people discover the environmental and economic benefits of switching to an EV. Although some models cost more up front than their gas-powered counterparts, EVs typically have much lower maintenance costs and don't require regular, costly fill-ups.

The ownership costs can come down even more when an owner pairs their EV with solar panels, which allow EV drivers to rely less on public charging stations and avoid reliance on the grid for recharging at home. Those interested in solar can save up to $10,000 on installation costs by using EnergySage's free service to compare local, vetted installers.

Conclusion: A Paradox of Peace and Peril The shift to renewable energy promises a cleaner, more sustainable planet.
If not, the age of renewables could become not the end of energy conflict—but its green reawakening.","As the world races to transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy, a new energy order is beginning to emerge—one that promises cleaner air and climate resilience but also portends fresh geopolitical tensions.

The shift to solar, wind, hydrogen, and rare earth-powered technologies is not merely a technological revolution; it is a profound geopolitical reordering with the potential to ignite a new spectrum of global conflict. From the strategic control of critical minerals to green technology rivalry, energy access disputes, and economic power realignment, the green transition may ironically generate new fault lines even as it attempts to heal the planet.

The End of Oil Wars?

For much of the 20th and early 21st centuries, access to oil and gas has been a key driver of global conflict. The 1991 Gulf War, the 2003 Iraq War, and Russia’s strategic hold over Europe via gas pipelines all reflect the centrality of hydrocarbons in world politics. As Daniel Yergin, author of The Prize: The Epic Quest for Oil, Money, and Power, notes, fossil fuels have underpinned not only energy security but also military logistics, alliance structures, and strategic coercion.

With the rise of renewables, some analysts, such as Meghan O’Sullivan in her book Windfall: How the New Energy Abundance Upends Global Politics and Strengthens American Power, argue that energy geopolitics will soften. Renewables are decentralized, locally producible, and harder to weaponize. However, this optimistic view overlooks a critical reality: while fossil fuels are geographically concentrated, the raw materials and technologies required for the green transition are also limited and unevenly distributed, introducing new battlefronts.

The New Strategic Commodities: Lithium, Cobalt, and Rare Earths

Unlike oil, which is pumped and transported via tanker or pipeline, renewable energy infrastructure is built with minerals—vast amounts of them. The International Energy Agency (IEA), in its 2021 report The Role of Critical Minerals in Clean Energy Transitions, warned that a single electric vehicle requires six times more mineral inputs than a conventional car, and a wind power plant requires nine times more mineral resources than a gas-fired plant.

This demand has turned materials like lithium, cobalt, nickel, graphite, and rare earth elements into the new “black gold.” These minerals are geographically concentrated: 60% of global cobalt comes from the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), 50% of lithium from Australia, 80% of rare earth processing from China. This imbalance introduces both supply chain vulnerabilities and potential zones of competition.

As noted by Foreign Policy (July 2023), China’s near-monopoly on rare earth processing gives it leverage over the West, similar to OPEC’s role in the 1970s. In 2020, Beijing threatened to cut off rare earth exports to Lockheed Martin amid tensions over Taiwan. The U.S. has since responded with the CHIPS and Science Act, and new mining initiatives in Australia and Latin America, seeking to “de-risk” rather than decouple from China.

Resource Nationalism and Green Colonialism

The strategic importance of these minerals has led to renewed interest in resource-rich nations, particularly in Africa and Latin America. Bolivia’s vast lithium reserves—dubbed the “Saudi Arabia of lithium”—have become the center of global bidding wars. Elon Musk’s 2020 tweet about “couping whoever we want” in Bolivia (later deleted) after a pro-lithium government was ousted sparked accusations of “green imperialism.”

As The Guardian (Feb 2023) reported, indigenous communities in Argentina, Chile, and Bolivia are increasingly protesting lithium extraction projects over water depletion, environmental degradation, and lack of benefit-sharing. The so-called “green transition” risks replicating the exploitative dynamics of past resource rushes, inflaming local unrest and geopolitical tensions as states compete for strategic access.

Moreover, as Nick Buxton and Ben Hayes argue in The Secure and the Dispossessed, there is a risk that climate action becomes securitized—framed as a zero-sum struggle over dwindling resources—leading to militarized responses to local opposition and migration pressures. In this framing, environmentalism itself could become a justification for conflict.

The Hydrogen Race: New Rivalries in Old Geographies

Beyond minerals, green hydrogen—produced from renewable electricity—has emerged as the next frontier in clean energy. Countries like Germany, Japan, and South Korea, short on solar landmass, are looking to import green hydrogen from sun-rich nations like Namibia, Morocco, and Australia.

This shift introduces new geopolitical dependencies. For instance, Germany’s multi-billion euro hydrogen agreements with North African states could tie its future industrial competitiveness to the political stability of regions that have historically seen unrest. As Der Spiegel (April 2024) warned, over-reliance on green hydrogen imports from politically unstable regions may reproduce the same energy insecurity that plagued Europe’s dependence on Russian gas.

Moreover, Gulf countries like Saudi Arabia and the UAE are pivoting from oil to green hydrogen, using their capital and geopolitical clout to dominate future energy markets. NEOM’s green hydrogen project in Saudi Arabia is being positioned as a global hub. As highlighted in The Financial Times (March 2024), this could reshape regional power hierarchies and revive competition among Gulf states for energy hegemony, potentially destabilizing an already fragile Middle East.

Infrastructure Conflicts and Grid Colonialism

Control over electricity transmission infrastructure could also become a source of conflict. Unlike oil, which is stored and traded in tankers, solar and wind energy require extensive grid interconnectivity to stabilize supply. Initiatives like the EU’s “SuperGrid,” the African Union’s “Desert to Power” initiative, and China’s “Global Energy Interconnection” plan reflect growing ambitions to build transnational electricity networks.

However, as scholar Andreas Goldthau points out in The Geopolitics of the Global Energy Transition, such mega-grids require political alignment, technical interoperability, and shared regulatory norms. If these grids are dominated by a few players—China in Asia, the EU in Africa—they risk becoming tools of political influence. Nations left out of these infrastructures may become energy-insecure and marginalized.

Conflicts may also arise within states. In India, land acquisition for solar parks in Rajasthan and Gujarat has led to protests by farmers and indigenous communities. As Al Jazeera (January 2024) reported, the clash between national climate goals and local livelihoods is emerging as a new axis of internal tension.

Technological Protectionism and Green Trade Wars

The green race is also spurring techno-nationalism. The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) passed by the U.S. in 2022, which includes subsidies for domestically produced electric vehicles and solar panels, has provoked backlash from allies like the EU and South Korea. Brussels responded with its own Green Deal Industrial Plan to defend European industry.

As the New York Times (October 2023) reported, this has triggered a green trade war between the West and China, which still dominates the global solar panel, battery, and electric vehicle markets. In 2024, the U.S. imposed new tariffs on Chinese EVs over alleged “overcapacity,” while Beijing filed WTO complaints, threatening retaliatory action.

These skirmishes could escalate as countries compete not just to go green, but to own the green economy. Intellectual property disputes, export restrictions on key technologies, and investment screening in critical sectors are likely to rise, creating an environment of suspicion and economic fragmentation.

Water and Climate Security Intersections

Renewable energy is also highly water-dependent. Hydropower, green hydrogen production, and even lithium extraction consume significant water resources. In water-stressed regions like Central Asia, North Africa, and the Middle East, this may intensify competition over transboundary rivers and aquifers.

For instance, Ethiopia’s Grand Renaissance Dam, intended to supply renewable hydropower to millions, has triggered regional tension with Egypt and Sudan. As noted by the Carnegie Endowment (2022), the dam’s completion could lead to prolonged geopolitical friction if water-sharing mechanisms fail.

Climate change will act as a conflict multiplier, creating migration flows, agricultural decline, and energy demand spikes. In this volatile context, renewable energy infrastructure becomes both a lifeline and a target—vulnerable to sabotage, cyberattacks, and geopolitical leverage.

Who Controls the Narrative?

Lastly, the question of global leadership in the energy transition is itself a geopolitical contest. China has positioned itself as the green manufacturing superpower. The EU sees itself as the norm-setter, pushing for global standards through its Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM). The U.S. is attempting to lead on innovation and capital allocation.

But the Global South, often cast as a supplier of resources or a site of carbon offsetting, is demanding a voice. At COP28 and beyond, countries like India, Brazil, and South Africa have argued for “just transitions” that include technology transfers, debt forgiveness, and inclusive governance.

As Jason Bordoff of Columbia’s Center on Global Energy Policy argues, the green transition could either entrench existing hierarchies or democratize energy access. Which path is chosen will depend on whether energy justice becomes a serious global commitment—or an afterthought.

Conclusion: A Paradox of Peace and Peril

The shift to renewable energy promises a cleaner, more sustainable planet. Yet, as with all transformative technologies, it will redistribute power, provoke competition, and—if mismanaged—ignite conflict. From critical mineral rushes and techno-protectionism to hydrogen geopolitics and infrastructure rivalries, the green revolution carries risks that mirror and magnify existing global tensions.

Policymakers must anticipate these flashpoints. Strategic stockpiling, diversified supply chains, fair mining practices, and multilateral coordination over technology and standards are essential. But perhaps most critically, the world must ensure that the energy transition uplifts rather than exploits. If not, the age of renewables could become not the end of energy conflict—but its green reawakening.",https://www.eurasiareview.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/b-148.jpg,N,,2025-06-01 22:02:39.643225

BILLINGS, Mont. – Today, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) released a revised Coal Combustion Residuals (CCR) rule that no longer exempts inactive impoundments at inactive facilities, also known as “legacy units”. The proposed new rule would address the over half billion tons of coal ash and the decades-old ash ponds that have escaped inspections and leaked toxic chemicals into the drinking and stock water of surrounding communities.

The 2015 CCR Rule, also known as the Coal Ash Rule, set forth national minimum safeguards for existing and new CCR landfills, in addition to new CCR surface impoundments, protecting groundwater and air resources in communities across the country. The initial 2015 rule, however, failed to include legacy units. When the new rule takes effect, operators who profited from burning coal for decades will not be allowed to walk away from their hundreds of inactive landfills and legacy ponds, poisoning drinking water, and leaving the mess for taxpayers to clean up. In addition to making drinking water supplies safe again, ash pond remediation provides jobs to local workers.

In response to the new safeguards, Bob LeResche, Chair of the Western Organization of Resource Councils said,

“Western Organization of Resource Councils and our thousands of members across the western U.S., applaud EPA for taking the long-overdue step to include legacy ponds and inactive landfills in the CCR Rule. From Colstrip to Wyodak to Stanton, our members have experienced firsthand the impacts of unregulated ponds and landfills. We do applaud EPA for taking this step to strengthen the CCR rule, but want to emphasize that the changes will be useless without proper implementation by EPA. We hope that the agency’s oversight and enforcement will greatly improve so that frontline communities throughout the West and the nation that are now dealing with groundwater contamination from legacy ponds can finally return to a more habitable way of life within a healthy community.”",,N,,2025-06-02 00:03:06.744123

The regulator certified the design in January 2023, making it the first SMR design to be cleared by the regulator for use in the USA.
NuScale subsequently uprated the capacity of the power unit to 77 MWe and in January 2023 submitted an application for NRC approval of a six-unit configuration based on the uprated design.
“The standard design approval is based upon the staff’s final safety evaluation report, issued 28 May,” it said.
“The US NRC’s uprate approval of the NuScale SMR technology now strengthens ENTRA1 Energy to produce and deliver energy as the most near-term American SMR power solution via ENTRA1 Energy Plants with NuScale SMR technology inside,” NuScale said.","The US Nuclear Regulatory Commission has approved the 77 MWe version of NuScale Power’s NuScale Power Module small modular reactor design. The regulator had previously approved a 50 MWe version of the design.

The Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) accepted NuScale’s design certification application for a plant comprising up to twelve 50 MWe power modules in March 2017. The regulator certified the design in January 2023, making it the first SMR design to be cleared by the regulator for use in the USA.

NuScale subsequently uprated the capacity of the power unit to 77 MWe and in January 2023 submitted an application for NRC approval of a six-unit configuration based on the uprated design. The application was accepted for NRC review in July 2023.

The NRC has now announced that it has approved the uprated SMR design. “The standard design approval is based upon the staff’s final safety evaluation report, issued 28 May,” it said. “This completes the NRC’s technical review ahead of schedule and under budget, demonstrating the agency’s commitment to safely and efficiently enable new, advanced reactor technology.”

A standard design approval indicates that a proposed reactor design meets applicable NRC safety requirements. Companies that seek to use the design would have to file applications seeking permission to construct and operate a nuclear reactor using the approved design.

NuScale said its uprated design features the same fundamental safety case and passive safety features previously approved by the NRC with “a power uprate and select design changes to support growing capacity needs”.

“The US NRC’s uprate approval of the NuScale SMR technology now strengthens ENTRA1 Energy to produce and deliver energy as the most near-term American SMR power solution via ENTRA1 Energy Plants with NuScale SMR technology inside,” NuScale said. “ENTRA1 Energy is NuScale’s partner and independent power plant development platform, which holds the global exclusive rights to the commercialisation, distribution, and deployment of NuScale’s SMRs.”

It added that NRC approval of the uprated design enables ENTRA1 Energy to “provide a wider range of off-takers and consumers with reliable, carbon-free energy”.

“We are thrilled that the NRC has approved our second SDA application, this time for our 77 MWe design,” said NuScale President and CEO John Hopkins. “This marks a historic moment not only for NuScale, but the entire industry, as NuScale and ENTRA1 move closer to meeting the demands of clean energy users.

“For more than a decade, our team has proudly worked alongside the NRC to achieve the successful approval of our designs. The NRC is domestically and internationally recognised and respected for its rigorous safety standards, and this approval is a crucial step toward meeting our goal of providing clean, reliable, and, most importantly, safe energy to off-takers and consumers.”",https://www.eurasiareview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/b-13.jpeg,N,,2025-06-01 22:02:46.640962

Meanwhile Make UK, the manufacturing lobby group, said industrial energy costs in Britain were four times as high as those in the US and 46 per cent above the global average.
“The upcoming industrial strategy will be fatally flawed unless sky-high energy costs are tackled,” it said.
“If we don’t address the issue of high industrial energy costs as a priority, we risk the security of our country,” Stephen Phipson, Make UK’s chief executive said.","Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has been warned by British business that his vaunted industrial strategy, to be published this month, will be “fatally flawed” unless it deals comprehensively with the country’s very high energy costs.

Ministers accept that high energy costs — which manufacturers claim are 46 per cent higher than the global average — must be addressed in the industrial strategy, according to government officials.

But business groups fear the government will be too timid, targeting help at only the most energy-intensive sectors — such as steel and ceramics — rather than a wider range of companies struggling with power bills.

Ministers are looking to increase the generosity of the “British Industry Supercharger” scheme, set up by Rishi Sunak’s Conservative government in April 2024, which cut bills for 370 energy-intensive companies, according to people briefed on the plans.

Rain Newton-Smith, director-general of the CBI employers’ federation, told the Financial Times: “Unless the industrial strategy delivers a solution to the UK’s high energy costs for industry, it will have failed.”

Newton-Smith said a “more comprehensive” solution had to be found, rather than just focusing on the biggest energy users, adding that the chemicals, aerospace and car industries were among those suffering most from high power bills.

Meanwhile Make UK, the manufacturing lobby group, said industrial energy costs in Britain were four times as high as those in the US and 46 per cent above the global average.

“The upcoming industrial strategy will be fatally flawed unless sky-high energy costs are tackled,” it said.

Starmer’s industrial strategy is prioritising eight “growth” sectors: advanced manufacturing, clean energy, creative industries, defence, digital and technologies, financial services, life sciences, and professional and business services.

Officials close to business secretary Jonathan Reynolds said: “Johnny has said that energy is always something that comes up. He is alive to the fact that the industrial strategy needs to have some good answers on energy.”

Industry officials briefed on government thinking expect ministers to take a more generous approach to the British Industry Supercharger, which Sunak’s government said would save energy intensive users, such as steelmakers, some £410mn in 2025.

They said ministers were looking at increasing the cut in network charges for eligible companies from 60 per cent to close to the 90 per cent compensation offered by France and Germany to industrial users for these network charges.

But business groups want the reductions in energy bills to be distributed more widely, including by removing levies such as the “renewables obligation” and “climate change levy” from bills.

“If we don’t address the issue of high industrial energy costs as a priority, we risk the security of our country,” Stephen Phipson, Make UK’s chief executive said.

Alan Johnson, senior vice-president at the Japanese carmaker Nissan, said: “The Nissan Sunderland manufacturing plant has the highest energy costs of all Nissan plants across the globe.”

The industrial strategy is due to be published at around the same time as the Treasury’s comprehensive spending review on June 11.

The Department for Business and Trade declined to comment on “speculation” on the strategy’s contents.",https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fd1e00ek4ebabms.cloudfront.net%2Fproduction%2Fa3196eea-6d00-4b38-a12e-2046fe762bff.jpg?source=next-article&fit=scale-down&quality=highest&width=700&dpr=1,N,,2025-06-01 20:04:16.011194

As the energy transition progresses, the industry must balance the benefits of digitalization with the need for robust cybersecurity measures.","When you glance at your smart meter to see how much electricity you’ve used that day, a cyberattack is likely not front of mind. And yet, Internet of Things (IoT) devices such as these can be an easy access point for cybercriminals.

There was a 200% increase in attacks on utilities(link is external) in 2023 and the average cost of data breaches in the energy sector is over $4 million(link is external). Europe alone saw a doubling of cyberattacks in the power sector(link is external) between 2020 and 2022, while in the US, there was an almost 70% hike in cyberattacks on utilities during 2024(link is external), compared to the previous year.

So it’s a huge issue, and one that utility companies — and governments — are keen to address.

And within this landscape, the renewables sector has become a prime target(link is external). To keep up with the rapidly unfolding energy transition, digital technology to help integrate and manage renewables is being adopted at pace, which is creating more potential attack surfaces. For example, integrating more renewables projects and battery energy storage systems requires software that allows the technologies to interact and work together(link is external) – introducing cybersecurity risk across the system. Alongside, as renewables develop and scale, the number of stakeholders involved is increasing and includes businesses from a variety of sectors(link is external) alongside power companies. This too could increase the likelihood of cyber threats.

The growing cyber threat to renewable energy

Global renewable power capacity increased by 473 gigawatts (GW) in 2023(link is external), up 14% on the previous year, according to the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA), while the International Energy Agency (IEA) anticipates 5,500 GW to become operational by 2030(link is external).

This is all good news for the environment and global targets to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. But it also presents an opportunity for cybercriminals to exploit vulnerabilities in dispersed and relatively new systems.

Digital technologies such as IoT, artificial intelligence (AI) and middleware, the software that joins all the dots, are now vital additions to utility companies scrambling to keep up with demand.

These technologies enhance efficiency, enable better integration of renewable energy sources, improve demand forecasting and optimize grid performance in real time. In short, they are an indispensable factor in the energy transition. But not an uncomplicated one.

Solar energy alone, which accounted for three-quarters of the world’s renewable capacity additions in 2023(link is external), is susceptible to six different types of cyberattack(link is external); wind farms can be disrupted because the remote control mechanism can be hacked; battery energy storage systems and electric vehicle charging stations can be similarly compromised.

Last year, the Federal Bureau of Investigation issued a warning to the US renewable energy industry that “malicious cyber actors may seek to disrupt power generating operations, steal intellectual property, or ransom information critical for normal functionality to advance geopolitical motives or financial gain”. It cited a 2019 example of a private solar company that suffered a denial-of-service attack(link is external), resulting in the “lost visibility” of 500MW of wind and solar sites in California, Utah and Wyoming.

In the UK, renewables companies experienced around 1,000 attempted cyberattacks every day(link is external) last year, according to cybersecurity analysis. These attempts are not hitting the headlines, however — unlike the renewable energy disruption of 2022, when a cyberattack on a satellite communications network brought 5,800 wind turbines(link is external) in Germany to a standstill.

Protecting the energy transition

Alongside the growing risk of cyberattacks, the shortage of experts in energy cybersecurity(link is external) is further exacerbating the situation. While almost three-quarters of the energy and utilities industry is currently utilizing generative AI for its cybersecurity operations, there is a 42% shortfall in cybersecurity personnel in the sector(link is external), according to a Boston Consulting Group survey.

The new US administration has just taken steps to address the wider cybersecurity skills gap; its proposed Cyber PIVOTT Act(link is external) would introduce scholarship programs in exchange for government service. Meanwhile, Europe introduced the Cybersecurity Skills Academy(link is external) in 2023 to tackle the issue.

The EU has also been focusing on legislation, with its Network and Information Security Directive(link is external) that aims to harmonize cybersecurity regulations across member states, particularly around critical infrastructure such as energy, coming into effect last year.

One thing experts are clear about is that energy companies need to take charge of the situation themselves — and fast. At a basic level, cybersecurity training across organizations is essential. Implementing monitoring systems can help protect critical infrastructure from cyberattacks. This is the idea behind InteRSePT, a Mitsubishi Heavy Industries (MHI) Group cybersecurity solution that can be trained to detect anomalous or suspicious behavior across the control network of power plants and manufacturing facilities.

As the energy transition progresses, the industry must balance the benefits of digitalization with the need for robust cybersecurity measures. As grids become more digital and decentralized, the risk of cyberattacks increases, potentially disrupting energy supply and undermining progress toward a more sustainable power system.

To stay ahead of these threats, utilities, governments and technology providers must work together to strengthen cybersecurity defenses, implement robust regulatory frameworks and invest in next-generation security solutions.",https://spectra.mhi.com/sites/g/files/jwhtju2216/files/styles/crop_freeform/public/Why-the-energy-transition-means-more-cyberattacks.jpeg?itok=xBM4sETC,N,,2025-06-01 20:04:20.760297

***

June 1, 2025

Dear Colleague:

This month, President Trump and Senate Republicans will attempt to jam through Congress their “One Ugly Bill,” — one of the most destructive and shamelessly self-serving pieces of legislation in modern American history. This partisan monstrosity is nothing short of a billionaire hand out paid for by American families and we will fight it with everything we've got. Senate Democrats will make sure the American People see this bill for what it is: a ruthless power grab by the nation’s most wealthy at the expense of American families, millions of Americans’ healthcare, and the very core of our democracy. Senate Democrats will use every tool at our disposal in this battle and we will enlist American families to join this fight.

The Republican plan is simple: sell-out working and middle-class families to pay-off the rich and well-connected. The bill would raise costs and taxes by an average of more than $800 for 40% of American families. 20 million Americans would see their health care costs skyrocket, while almost 14 million would lose their health insurance all together, including millions of children and seniors. 11 million people, including 4 million children, could lose access to safe and affordable food, while every one of the 40 million Americans receiving federal food assistance would get less support every month. All the while, their radical plan would see double digit energy cost increases for American households and businesses, and threaten close to 800,000 good-paying jobs in the clean-energy economy.

Why? To fund massive tax breaks to the nation’s richest, most powerful corporations. In fact, the legislation would gift a tax break of over $250,000 to the wealthiest 0.1% of American households. On this bill, Republicans’ rhetoric doesn’t match reality. The Congressional Budget Office has detailed that the Republican bill give the top 10% of earning households 65% of the benefit of the value of tax breaks while Americans making less than $51,000 a year would see their incomes go down.

Like many of you, I spent the past week hammering away at the Trump/Republican agenda as a betrayal of the middle class. Their entire agenda can be boiled down to this: billionaires win and families lose.

Billionaires win and families lose when Republicans kick millions of Americans off their health insurance by dismantling the ACA and proposing the largest cut to Medicaid in American history. Hospitals and health centers will close and thousands of people will lose jobs.

Billionaires win and families lose when millions of children and families go hungry under Republicans’ plan to cut $300 billion from federal food aid program.

Billionaires win and families lose when Republicans kill clean energy investments that have created hundreds of thousands of related jobs across the country, lowered energy prices, and made the US more competitive with China.

Republicans are hell-bent on making the Trump tax cuts for billionaires permanent, exploding the federal debt by adding over $50 trillion to it in the next 30 years. After crying foul for years about the deficit, Republicans are once again showing their true colors and ignoring the budget-busting cost of their Tax Scam, seemingly content to burden our children and grandchildren to a lifetime of higher interest rates, higher costs, and fewer opportunities. To do so, Republicans are planning to use the Budget Chair’s section 312 authority under the Congressional Budget Act in an unprecedented and illegitimate manner to run rough-shod over the Byrd Rule.

In the Senate, our Committees have been working overtime to prepare for the Byrd Bath, targeting the litany of policies included in the Republican plan that are in clear violation of the reconciliation rules and in some cases, an assault on our very democracy. For example, House Republicans snuck in a devious policy to restrict the authority of federal courts to hold government officials in contempt when they violate court orders. Republican’s naked subservience to a lawless President is gravely dangerous and Senate Democrats won’t stand for it. Should Senate Republicans include this rotten provision, I vow, alongside all of you, to fight tooth and nail to strike this authoritarian attack on our system of justice.

Based on Senate Republicans’ public comments, it’s clear that if this reckless reconciliation bill passes the Senate it is very likely to contain changes, forcing it to be sent back to the House of Representatives. That’s why we must be united with our House Democratic colleagues to fight this assault on working families. Sunday afternoon, I spoke with Leader Jeffries about ways our caucuses can fight back together. This week, DSPC Chair Klobuchar and I invited the House Ranking Members of Ways & Means, Energy & Commerce, and Budget to meet with our caucus and share firsthand insight from their process and key Republican faultlines. When we fight side by side, our voice is louder and our case is stronger – and in this moment, unity isn’t optional, it’s our strongest weapon in defending American families.

But the fight will not just be in the Capitol. Public sentiment is everything. To my core, I know that if the American people truly knew how deeply devastating, damaging, and deceitful this Republican plan is, they will reject it. So we must continue to rally the American people in the shared fight to stop this radical agenda. Our caucus has done in-state events, held numerous Spotlight hearings, engaged earned and social media to push back, taken to the Senate floor, held rallies, and more to educate the American people on what’s happening and to call out Donald Trump and the Republicans’ radical agenda. Their extreme vision is a threat to our democracy, and we’re not backing down. We’re doubling down—and we’re just getting started.

Republicans’ “One Ugly Bill” is a farce; an attack on the values that make America great. We know the first four months of Donald Trump’s presidency have been catastrophic for the American people. It is our duty to fight for American families, to stop the damage, and make certain Republicans are held accountable.

I look forward to returning to Washington this week to keep up the fight.

Sincerely,

Charles E. Schumer

United States Senator

Seoul: LG Energy Solution Ltd (LGES), South Korea's leading battery maker, said on Sunday it has begun mass production of lithium iron phosphate (LFP) batteries for energy storage systems (ESS) at its manufacturing plant in the United States.

The pouch-type LFP batteries for ESS, based on long cell technology, are being manufactured at the LGES plant in Michigan, according to the Korean company, reports Yonhap news agency.

""We are currently in discussions with multiple customers in the North American region for the supply of our ESS batteries,"" LGES officials said, noting that supply to a number of major U.S. energy firms, such as Terra-Gen and Delta Electronics, has already been confirmed.

LGES said it plans to swiftly respond to growing demand for ESS in advanced industries, such as artificial intelligence (AI) data centres and renewable energies.

LGES is the only major global battery maker that started mass production of LFP batteries tailored for use in ESS in the U.S.

Meanwhile, LG Energy Solution has won a lawsuit against China's Sunwoda Group in Germany over the infringement of two patents related to battery separator technology, a company representing LGES in Germany said.

The Munich District Court upheld injunction requests filed by Hungary-based patent management firm Tulip Innovation Kft., barring Sunwoda Group affiliates from selling lithium-ion batteries in Germany, Tulip said in a press release.

The affected companies include Sunwoda Electronic, Sunwoda Mobility Energy Technology, and their German subsidiaries, Sunwoda Europe and Sunwoda Electric Vehicle Battery Germany.

""These appear to be the first injunctions in Germany related to car batteries. There is no 'free riding' for battery manufacturers on technologies developed by innovation leaders like LGES and Panasonic Energy,"" the release said.

The court also ordered Sunwoda's affiliates to recall and destroy any remaining infringing batteries in their direct or indirect possession, pay damages to Tulip in principle, and provide detailed accounting records to facilitate damage assessment.

Sunwoda Group is expected to appeal the rulings, but Tulip said it is ""confident that the decision will stand on appeal.""

The two patents at issue involve battery separators -- a critical component for ensuring the safety and performance of electric vehicle batteries.

President Trump has signed seven CRA resolutions into law.
Implications for State Authority and Environmental Policy The Senate’s action represents a significant shift in the balance of federal and state powers concerning environmental regulation.
This move could set a precedent affecting other areas where states have traditionally exercised autonomy under federal environmental laws.
Conclusion The Congressional disapproval of California’s EPA waivers marks a pivotal moment in U.S. environmental and energy policy, highlighting tensions between federal authority and initiatives led by a few states.","The Senate has approved three Congressional Review Act resolutions initiated in the House of Representatives that overturn Environmental Protection Agency waivers, which had effectively imposed a de facto ban on the future sale of gasoline powered cars in California and 17 states, as well as Washington, DC.

Congressional disapproval of California’s electric vehicle mandates is another step toward ending the electric vehicle mandate on all Americans and now awaits President Trump’s signature.

Background: California’s Emissions Standards and EPA Waivers

Under Section 209 of the Clean Air Act, California has, since 1968, been granted waivers by the EPA to implement vehicle emissions standards more rigorous than federal requirements, citing “compelling and extraordinary circumstances” related to air quality. In December 2024, the Biden administration’s EPA granted such waivers, allowing California to proceed with its Advanced Clean Cars II program, aiming to phase out new internal combustion engine vehicle sales by 2035. Several states, including Maryland and Colorado, adopted the same California standards, collectively influencing a significant portion of the U.S. auto market.

The Joint Resolution

The resolution is short and straightforward:

“That Congress disapproves the rule submitted by the Environmental Protection Agency relating to “California State Motor Vehicle and Engine Pollution Control Standards; Advanced Clean Cars II; Waiver of Preemption; Notice of Decision” (90 Fed. Reg. 642 (January 6, 2025)), and such rule shall have no force or effect.”

Congressional Review Act and Legal Controversy

The CRA enables Congress to overturn federal regulations within a specific timeframe. However, its application to these EPA waivers has been contentious. Both the Government Accountability Office and the Senate Parliamentarian opined that the EPA waivers do not constitute “rules” under the CRA and thus are not subject to its provisions.

Interestingly, to mitigate risk of judicial redress based on the Senate’s Parliamentarian’s interpretation, the Senate set up an elaborate series of procedural votes to allow the Senate to settle the question of what qualifies under the CRA; an action that is typically referred to as the “nuclear option.” Historically used to avoid a filibuster, the nuclear option allows the majority party to use a simple majority vote to overturn a point of order and thus avoid existing procedural constraints. Thus, Republicans avoided a Senate floor confrontation over the Parliamentarian’s interpretation of the CRA by sending the question about what qualifies under the CRA back to the full Senate.

As we blogged about on February 23, 2025, Lee Zeldin, President Trump’s head of the EPA, requested a review of the rule under the CRA. Shortly thereafter, the House voted 246-164 to advance the resolution (H.J.Res.88). The vote largely followed party lines, though 35 Democrats joined Republicans in support of the measure. The Senate then advanced the resolution to President Trump for his signature in a 51-44 vote, also along party lines.

In addition to H.J.Res.88, the Senate passed two related resolutions, H.J.Res 87 and H.J. Res 89, aimed at stopping California from enforcing rules that promote zero emission truck sales and implementing stricter nitrogen oxide limits.

Repeal of Regulations

These three CRAs are among 74 resolutions Republicans in both chambers have introduced that would overturn Biden era climate rules. President Trump has signed seven CRA resolutions into law. Once a CRA resolution is enacted, a federal agency cannot propose a similar rule in the future.

Implications for State Authority and Environmental Policy

The Senate’s action represents a significant shift in the balance of federal and state powers concerning environmental regulation. This move could set a precedent affecting other areas where states have traditionally exercised autonomy under federal environmental laws.

The implications are huge. Consider, by way of example, a state like Maryland that has enacted statutes that the entire state will be greenhouse gas emission free by 2045, largely on the back of the California gasoline powered car ban; the provisions of that state law will now have no force or effect.

Stakeholders Respond

Proponents of the resolutions argue that California’s mandates could lead to increased vehicle costs and limit consumer choice nationwide. Industry groups, including the National Automobile Dealers Association, supported the Congressional action, citing concerns over market fragmentation and regulatory burdens.

Opponents, including California officials and global warming advocates, contend that the revocation undermines efforts to combat climate change and infringes upon states’ rights. California Attorney General Rob Bonta said the state “intend[s] to sue the Trump administration,” again.

But, significantly and dispositively, the CRA expressly bars judicial review of resolutions.

Conclusion

The Congressional disapproval of California’s EPA waivers marks a pivotal moment in U.S. environmental and energy policy, highlighting tensions between federal authority and initiatives led by a few states. Most expect the legal challenges anticipated in response to this action to fail, leaving this CRA saga to shape the future of environmental regulation and state federal relations in the years to come.

While Otto von Bismarck almost certainly never uttered the words, this may be a good example of, “Laws are like sausages. It is best not to see them being made.”

While the agreement delivers clear benefits for industries such as automotive and steel, it also poses serious risks to the UK’s domestic bioethanol industry.
The BCC has welcomed the broader benefits of the new trade agreement, signed by Prime Minister Keir Starmer, but is calling on the Government to ensure that the UK’s bioethanol sector is not left behind.
Representatives from the bioethanol industry are also expected to attend.
“UK bioethanol production supports thousands of jobs and businesses across the supply chain, and the impacts will be keenly felt if the government does not act to support this critical industry.","The British Chambers of Commerce (BCC) has urged the Government to swiftly act to protect Britain’s domestic bioethanol industry.

It follows warnings from the UK’s two largest producers that the removal of tariffs on US imports could leave them unable to compete.

Vivergo Fuels in Hull and Ensus in Teesside are calling for immediate support to safeguard the hundreds of workers they directly employ, and the thousands of livelihoods they support across their supply chains – including farmers, engineers, and hauliers.

The threat stems from the UK-US trade deal, which removed a 19% tariff on US ethanol imports. While the agreement delivers clear benefits for industries such as automotive and steel, it also poses serious risks to the UK’s domestic bioethanol industry.

Ethanol has a range of uses as a raw material for sustainable aviation fuel and a component in unleaded petrol, solvents, cleaning agents and beyond.

Last week, Vivergo Managing Director Ben Hackett cautioned that without targeted support, its Saltend plant could be forced to shut down. The site is a major driver of regional employment, supporting over 4,000 jobs directly and through its supply chain – the majority in the Yorkshire and Humber region. Ensus, based in the North East, plays a similarly vital role in supporting green jobs and supplying sustainable fuels across the UK.

The BCC has welcomed the broader benefits of the new trade agreement, signed by Prime Minister Keir Starmer, but is calling on the Government to ensure that the UK’s bioethanol sector is not left behind. Targeted support is needed, they argue, to preserve thousands of jobs, maintain energy security, and uphold the UK’s transition to low-carbon fuels.

The future of biofuels will feature in the BCC Global Annual Conference this June, where senior politicians and Bank of England Governor, Andrew Bailey, will be among the headline speakers. Representatives from the bioethanol industry are also expected to attend.

Shevaun Haviland, Director General of the British Chambers of Commerce, said:

“Bioethanol production plays a vital role in the UK’s transition to clean energy and supports thousands of jobs across Teesside and the Humber.

“While the recent trade deal with the US brings opportunities for automotive and steel, it also creates challenges for our bioeconomy,

“Targeted government support is needed to safeguard this sector’s future and maintain investor confidence as we work toward our environmental and economic goals.”

Ben Hackett, Managing Director of Vivergo Fuels, said:

“Bioethanol has a vital role to play in transport decarbonisation and clean energy development for decades to come.

“UK bioethanol production supports thousands of jobs and businesses across the supply chain, and the impacts will be keenly felt if the government does not act to support this critical industry.

“We are encouraged by the engagement we have had from ministers and now need to see those warm words matched with concrete support.”

Grant Pearson, Chairman of Ensus UK, said:

“We continue to engage with the government to highlight the significant impact this deal is likely to have on bioethanol production in the UK.

“The consequences will be felt across multiple sectors — including agriculture, the food and drink industry, hospital operating theatres, nuclear power generation, the development of sustainable aviation and maritime fuels, as well as undermining the UK’s potential to decarbonise its chemical industry.”

David Hooper, External Affairs Director for Hull & Humber Chamber of Commerce, added:

“We have worked with Vivergo for years and helped them make their case to the Government, and now we’ve reached another crunch point, because of tariffs, for a business which employs 160 staff locally.

“We need decisive action from the Government now before investments go elsewhere – time is running out fast.”",https://www.britishchambers.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/blog-image-22.jpeg,N,,2025-06-01 19:03:06.799835

Toyota's C-HR+ is the latest EV among an increase in all-electric models across automakers.","Toyota just released its newest electric vehicle — the C-HR+ — in Norway, Electrek reported, and the company has been hyping it for its ""stunning"" appearance and impressive range.

While Toyota announced the vehicle in March, Norway is the first market to receive the 373-mile-range SUV. The C-HR+ could also cost less than other electric SUVs, according to Electrek, which projected it to start in the $30,000 range if it hit the U.S. in 2026.

Piotr Pawlak, president of Toyota Norway, said the C-HR+ is ""more than just a vehicle — it's a statement."" Pawlak said the vehicle was ""stunning"" and that it ""embodies Toyota's vision of blending fun-to-drive excitement with eco-conscious innovation.""

The C-HR+ comes with a 55.7 or 77 kWh battery, featuring the 373-mile range on the larger of the two batteries. The larger battery version is also available with front-wheel-drive or all-wheel-drive, making it ""the perfect electric SUV for Norwegian roads,"" according to Toyota.

Improving upon a gas-powered version of the vehicle, which was discontinued in 2022, the C-HR+ includes a roomier interior with more space for passengers and cargo. The new EV will also be Toyota's most powerful vehicle in Europe, reaching 0 to 62 miles an hour in 5.2 seconds with 343 horsepower.

While EVs can cost more than traditional vehicles initially, the C-HR+ could be more affordable and tax credits up to $7,500 can offset the price of EVs. EVs also cost less over their lifetimes, requiring less maintenance and saving 60% on annual fuel costs, according to a 2020 Consumer Reports study.

Fueling EVs with electricity produced by solar panels can increase these savings further. Installing solar panels, like EVs, may qualify you for tax credits, and EnergySage provides resources and quotes for installation. Solar panels also improve the environmental impact of EVs, since 79% of electricity comes from dirty energy resources like coal and natural gas.

Despite the resources required to charge and manufacture them, EVs are better for the environment. EVs surpass gas-fueled cars as being more environmentally friendly after 13,500 miles, one Reuters study claimed, while another MIT study found gas-fueled cars emit 350 grams of carbon per mile over their lifetimes while EVs emit just 200.

Toyota's C-HR+ is the latest EV among an increase in all-electric models across automakers. The vehicle follows Toyota's 25-year EV history and will launch in other European markets later this year. According to Electrek, ""For those in the US, we'll have to wait for the official word, but if it does arrive, which would likely be in 2026, the C-HR+ would sit below the bZ4X,"" which Electrek said would mean a price range between $30,000 and $35,000.",https://www.thecooldown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Toyota-C-HRimage-rec5Ip9EbUVfLNeXM-1.jpg,N,,2025-06-01 18:04:52.496747

This leaves natural gas and large nuclear plants to run 24/7 to power AI data centers.
AI data centers can be co-located in renewable-rich regions, alleviating stress on the central network.
“It boils down to the power grid,” says Jason Huang, CEO of TS Conductor, during the virtual press event.
The ultimate goal is to ensure that the clean energy supply can meet the real-time demands of data centers.","On a sunny afternoon in April, a massive power outage swept across the Iberian Peninsula. Millions were left in the dark while businesses closed, travelers were stranded, and communication lines were cut. The diagnostics are still pending, but this incident has sparked a conversation about which fuel sources are best suited to guide us as artificial intelligence and data centers experience rapid growth.

Renewables are essential, and their ability to support AI and data center growth is improving due to advancements in energy storage, grid intelligence, and demand-side innovation. However, for the foreseeable future, we must integrate clean energy sources with natural gas to ensure reliability. While green power and nuclear energy will be the backbone over time, the most optimal approach is to combine them right now.

“Thanks to a massive increase in the adoption of renewables and utility-scale battery storage in the U.S., along with the emergence of grid-enhancing technologies, our grid is better equipped to handle these stressors than it was just 5 years ago,” says Jim Spencer, chief executive of Exus Renewables North America, in an email exchange. “Renewables are essential for powering AI data centers to keep up with rapidly increasing demand, keep costs low, and drive the next wave of economic innovation.”

Political partisans blame competing energy sources for previous power outages. Inevitably, advocates of traditional fuels emphasize that wind and solar energy only function when weather conditions allow, necessitating backup from batteries or natural gas, which incurs additional costs.

In this context, renewables provided 70% of the energy during the Iberian Peninsula blackout. However, this outage cannot be attributed to wind and solar but rather to the grid's inability to respond quickly to unexpected issues. Two significant power losses occurred at substations in southwestern Spain, causing a sudden drop in power supply and affecting the grid's voltage and frequency—the heartbeat of the grid.

According to Spencer, green energy is the cheapest and quickest to integrate into the network. It works effectively alongside additional support systems like batteries, demand response, and fast-starting natural gas generation. Indeed, battery costs have dropped by more than 85% since 2010, which has improved reliability. Renewables can be co-located next to modular data centers.

“We must understand commercial readiness and cost,"" relative to when data centers come online,"" adds Ron Schoff, director of R&D for EPRI, during a United States Energy Association virtual press event I participated in. “Our big challenge is that data center demand is coming between now and the next two to three years,"" noting that the system must be able to respond to rapid changes in supply and demand for electricity.

Technically Superior Wind Turbines And Solar Panels

Consider Wind Harvest, which claims its turbines are technologically superior and designed to operate in the harshest conditions. Because its turbines continue functioning when others fail, they can generate electricity even during storms or grid stress, preventing blackouts and maintaining grid stability.

The company states that its wind mills are unique because they are vertical and closer to the ground than conventional tall horizontal turbines. Because they rotate around a vertical pole, they can handle wind from any direction. They can also operate in gusty and choppy conditions, often near the ground, where other turbines struggle.

“No one has yet made a turbine that can handle the gusty, turbulent conditions near the ground,” says Kevin Wolf, CEO of Wind Harvest, during the press event. “They didn't have the aeroelastic modeling. Our turbines can then be integrated into these wind farms, allowing for the establishment of an AI data center in California or other windy locations near the ground. We can utilize the wind when it blows and also when it is calm. This opens up an entirely new resource.”

As it stands now, renewable energy must work with other fuels to meet AI data centers’ urgent and high demands. These centers have enormous power requirements and cannot afford to go offline, necessitating high-quality and affordable battery storage or backup solutions, such as natural gas units that fire up instantly.

Meanwhile, AI is advancing, and various clean energy technologies—including long-duration storage, clean hydrogen, and small modular nuclear reactors—are not yet scalable. This leaves natural gas and large nuclear plants to run 24/7 to power AI data centers. The Trump Administration promotes coal for this purpose, although it cannot compete without substantial subsidies or regulatory favors. Coal is also inflexible and slow to ramp up, making it a mismatch.

“In a global marketplace increasingly challenged by seemingly infinite power demand driven by AI, we need an all-of-the-above approach to energy generation that expands the definition of renewable energy. This means renewable power that’s always on, locally deployable, and designed to scale. Organic waste streams hold untapped energy,” says Cornelius Shields, founder of Kore Infrastructure, in an interview.

The Utility Sector’s Mission Is Reliability

The utility sector aims to provide reliable power at the lowest rates possible. This commitment contradicts coal’s qualities, which is not just dirtier but also more expensive than renewables or natural gas. Most U.S. coal plants are decades old, and retrofitting them is too costly. Utilities make long-term decisions based on 20–40-year cost projections, while coal’s market prospects continue to decline.

Energy consumption is set to soar over the next 5 to 10 years due to the push for decarbonization and electrification and the growth of AI and data centers. To meet this challenge, we need modern grid technologies that can expand the network’s ability to handle the increased demand for electricity. At the same time, we must retire aging coal, nuclear, and natural gas plants that have been in service for four decades. Welcome, renewables, which are stepping up; solar and battery storage accounted for 81% of the electric generation capacity additions last year.

Major AI companies like Google, Microsoft, and Meta have committed to operating entirely on renewable energy. This initiative responds to investor and regulatory pressure to reduce emissions and improve environmental footprints. AI data centers can be co-located in renewable-rich regions, alleviating stress on the central network.

Guess what? Roughly 260,000 megawatts of power are poised to join the U.S. grid—more than double the current output from power plants. And here’s the reality: according to the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, 95% of this power is generated from solar, wind, and battery storage.

“It boils down to the power grid,” says Jason Huang, CEO of TS Conductor, during the virtual press event. “We do not have enough capacity in the power grid. There are plenty of bottlenecks. We have the next-generation advanced conductor available—ready to be deployed on a large scale to address that issue, in a way that brings you affordability.”

Unfortunately, the blackout in the Iberian Peninsula is not an anomaly but rather a consequence of regulatory inadequacies, grid technologies, and extreme weather events. Adding electricity demand to these existing dynamics only heightens the challenges and opportunities, necessitating greater research and development in cutting-edge grid and energy technologies. The ultimate goal is to ensure that the clean energy supply can meet the real-time demands of data centers.",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/681fccc6dadc77fdbda07136/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,N,,2025-06-01 18:05:00.341944

“We need to address environmental issues and then get the site up to grade level and take the fence down so it could actually be used again.","The City of Astoria has received a $2 million Brownfields Cleanup Grant from the Environmental Protection Agency — the latest step in a yearslong effort to address industrial pollution at Heritage Square downtown.

For decades, the site on Exchange Street was a hub for industrial activities, ranging from auto repair and paint sales to drycleaning and print operations. Now, a parking lot and large pit remain, and beneath the surface lie volatile organic compounds and petroleum hydrocarbons well beyond EPA standards.

For years, that pollution has left the site undevelopable and inaccessible to the public.

“Anytime you have a property … if you do have environmental issues that need to be addressed, it’s difficult to redevelop property,” said City Manager Scott Spence.

Over the past two decades, the city has conducted environmental assessments and remedial planning at the site. The new cleanup grant — the largest EPA award in the city’s history — will help pave the way for mitigating pollution and filling the pit to bring it to grade-level.

The work fits into a broader process of envisioning a future for the site as a public gathering space. Last year, the City Council approved a memorandum of understanding with Friends of Heritage Square, a local group that has pushed for a public gathering space. In the months since, the city has worked with First Forty Feet, a Portland-based firm, to create a plan for the development of a public space and help guide a public engagement process.

Ideas for the space have included park amenities, community events and the expansion of the Astoria Sunday Market.

“Really, this is the first step if we’re going to reclaim the space for the community,” Spence said. “We need to address environmental issues and then get the site up to grade level and take the fence down so it could actually be used again. … So by getting this grant, this is a significant initiative to be able to achieve that overall vision.”

Spence said the city will be finalizing the grant agreement in the next few months, and then will begin design work to address environmental remediation at the site.

Economic sustainability ensures a business can withstand short-term market fluctuations and future uncertainties to be resilient and profitable over the long term.
But a company that instills economic, environmental and social sustainability into its operations, products, service and projects will unlock abundant business advantages.
Where do clarity, certainty, stability and sustainability fit in today’s political climate?","Clarity. Certainty. Stability.

That’s what businesses need to grow — and that’s what’s being undermined by federal policy shifts and inaction. Federal clean energy incentives are being cut and tax credits eviscerated. Climate mitigation and adaptation programs are being phased out. Science and environmental safeguards are under attack.

As a corporate D.C. lobbyist during the noughties, I saw policy priorities come and go with every election, but these three little words were baked into every talking point, press release and policy pitch. In a business context, clear laws and regulations instill certainty, confidence and predictability that lead to stable financial conditions, all of which are crucial for making informed decisions and investments.

These bedrocks of business planning are being tested like never before by political mayhem, relentless executive orders and an elevated trade war with more losers than benefits. However, despite politicians trying to disrupt the economic world order, and too many executives and billionaires either leading the charge or staying under cover to avoid the bullets, most U.S. businesses retain these principles at their core to better recognize economic trends, influence consumer behavior and counter competitor activity. Businesses that invest in innovation and adapt to changing market conditions are better positioned to thrive in uncertain times like these, and beyond.

In this world of political chaos and disruption, businesses must embrace a fourth tenet to survive and remain not only economically viable, but profitable and successful. Over the past decade, “sustainability” has graduated from a corporate buzzword to a necessary long-term strategy. I’m not talking just environmental and social sustainability, although both are increasingly important. I’m also talking about economic sustainability.

Economic sustainability ensures a business can withstand short-term market fluctuations and future uncertainties to be resilient and profitable over the long term. Profit should not completely overshadow the environmental and social practices, as a business cannot thrive if natural and human resources are left behind. But a company that instills economic, environmental and social sustainability into its operations, products, service and projects will unlock abundant business advantages.

Operational advantages include improved energy efficiency, waste and water reduction and cleaner vehicle fleets that reduce costs and enrich the bottom line. Sales advantages included enhanced brand reputation and customer loyalty with consumers willing to change their purchasing habits to reduce environmental impact. Investment advantages include better risk planning and management portfolios. Human advantages include more productive and loyal employees.

Where do clarity, certainty, stability and sustainability fit in today’s political climate?

First, when we engage with businesses, policymakers and other decision makers on energy and climate issues, we need to lead with solutions that benefit both the economy and the environment and make that link crystal clear in our communications and strategies. Otherwise, we end up with “big beautiful bills,” such as the mess that recently emerged from the U.S. House of Representatives.

At a business forum I hosted after President Trump’s first election win in 20216, a top energy lobbyist assured the audience, “For those concerned, don’t panic. For those excited, don’t get too euphoric.” The world was already on an irreversible path to cleaner energy and more sustainable business practices. While federal policy may slow the momentum, the progress will continue. After recent environmental rollbacks and energy incentive raids, I might add, “For those motivated, don’t stop!” American businesses are at the forefront of technology and innovation — they are motivated and will not stop.

Second, look to the stats and trends. American consumers are willing to pay, on average, 11% more for sustainable products. Seventy-five percent of executives believe sustainability drives better business results. For every 10% increase in emphasis on material ESG (environment, social, governance) concerns, a company’s value goes up by 1.4%.

Third, after the COVID-19 pandemic, a mere dress-rehearsal for climate change impacts, businesses intensified their efforts to save and make money in a future carbon-constrained economy. Despite congressional efforts to hide and insulate America from world trade, global action will proceed and American companies will need to do more than keep up — they will need to lead.

If we create a sound sustainability business model, and build a movement with all types, sizes and geographic locations of companies with community leaders of all political persuasions, we can make true progress, no matter who sits in the White House or Congress. Rather than assuming a “none of my business” approach to climate and the economy, sustainability helps carve a clear, certain and stable path that can be everyone’s business.",https://w2pcms.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2019/03/AP16272858411559.jpg?w=800,N,,2025-06-01 18:05:33.273908

With the contentious bill now headed for the Senate, some energy experts are warning of dire consequences for some renewable energy industries if it becomes law. To wit, the sweeping policy bill seeks to phase out billions in tax credits for the budding green hydrogen and EV battery industries. Created under the Inflation Reduction Act during the Biden administration, the Section 45V tax credit has been a major boon for low-carbon hydrogen and ammonia projects across the country.

This could be profound: a total of 46 hydrogen and ammonia-related projects were qualified to receive 45V tax benefits in Louisiana alone, including massive builds from Air Products & Chemicals (NYSE:APD), Clean Hydrogen Works and Bia Energy.

Over the past couple of years, Louisiana has emerged as the country’s leading hydrogen hub, focused on industry growth and sustainability. The state is home to some of the largest hydrogen projects in the country, including Clean Hydrogen Works' $7.5 billion ammonia and blue hydrogen project slated to create 1,472 jobs; Air Products' $4.5 billion blue hydrogen plant; Bia Energy Operating Company's $550 million blue hydrogen project and Monarch Energy's $426 million green hydrogen project.

Losing 45V tax credits may seriously erode the economic viability of these companies: according to company filings, Air Products received $19.7 million in federal tax credits in 2024, with the company’s federal tax credit claims jumping nearly 40% between 2020 and 2024. That’s perhaps not a coincidence when you consider that the 45V program kicked off in 2021 after former President Joe Biden passed the IRA.

With over 10 million tons of gross annual output, Illinois-based CF Industries (NYSE:CF) is one of the largest ammonia producers in the world, with Louisiana accounting for half of the company’s output. CF has already secured renewable energy certificates that qualify its pilot electrolyzer project for 45V tax credits when operational. When asked about the impact of the termination of 45V credits, Ryan Stiles, who manages the company’s ammonia production, said that some customers are likely to be less tolerant of paying more for low-carbon ammonia without the 45V subsidies.

The hydrogen sector heavyweight, Plug Power (NASDAQ:PLUG), only began operations in Louisiana a month ago; however, the company has previously flagged the importance of the 45V credit, stating that any limitation “could be materially adverse to the Company and its near-term hydrogen generation projects.”

Yet another provision in Trump’s big bill would spell doom for Section 48 Investment Tax Credit for certain clean energy technologies, ending eligibility for the credits in 2032--three years earlier than the IRA intended.

On a brighter note, the bill still provides tax credits for carbon capture and sequestration under Section 45Q.

“We expect our investment into the Donaldsonville CCS project will increase our free cash flow in the range of $100 million per year due to the United States’ 45Q tax credit for permanently sequestering CO2,” CF Industries said in its annual report.

CF Industries is not the only energy company that will be counting its lucky stars for Trump’s big bill leaving CCS credits intact. Big Oil has invested considerable capital into carbon capture projects, including Exxon Mobil’s (NYSE:XOM) latest CCS project targeting power-hungry U.S. data centers. The Oil & Gas giant has unveiled a groundbreaking plan wherein the company will provide low-carbon power to the U.S. data centers powering the AI boom. Exxon’s proposal outlines a first-of-its-kind facility that will use natural gas to produce electricity while capturing more than 90% of the CO2 emissions. The captured emissions will then be stored deep underground. ExxonMobil’s current CCS technology supports industries involved in steel, hydrogen and ammonia production, with the company having secured agreements to store up to 6.7 million tons of CO2 annually for these sectors.

Meanwhile, last month, Shell (NYSE:SHEL), Equinor (NYSE:EQNR), and TotalEnergies (NYSE:TTE) expanded their Northern Lights CCS project with $714 million in total investments. The decision comes after a deal with Swedish energy company, Stockholm Exergi, which has pledged to send up to 900,000 tonnes of CO? each year over a 5-year span. With the additional investment, Northern Lights is now capable of storing at least 5 million tonnes of CO? per year, more than triple the original target of 1.5 million tonnes.

WASHINGTON, D.C. — In yet another politically motivated abuse of emergency authorities that will raise consumers’ utility bills, the U.S. Department of Energy issued an order late on Friday to force a coal power plant to continue operating. Eddystone, owned by Constellation Energy, operates two coal units just outside Philadelphia. The move is the second time in two weeks that the Trump administration has moved to keep a coal powerplant in a state with a Democratic governor slated as a Presidential front-runner open after it was set to close.

If the tax credits were to go away, what happens to that fight when it comes to climate change?","AYESHA RASCOE, HOST:

There's been a boom in clean energy across the U.S. - solar panels popping up on rooftops, wind farms dotting hillsides. Technology has improved. Prices have fallen, but there's also been hefty federal subsidies. Now, that GOP spending bill of President Trump's that passed the House, that would end federal tax credits for solar and other types of clean energy. We wondered what the effects might be on energy costs for consumers. That's where Doug Lewin comes in. He's a clean energy consultant and host of the ""Energy Capital"" podcast, and he joins us now from Austin. Welcome to the program.

DOUG LEWIN: Hey. Thanks for having me.

RASCOE: So remind us what all these tax credits are about and why do some Republicans - including, you know, all the lawmakers who voted for this bill - oppose these tax credits.

LEWIN: Yeah, so they come in two different flavors. There's the investment tax credit, which is 30% of the cost of an entire project. And then there's what's called a production tax credit. So for every megawatt hour, every unit of energy produced, there's a payment that goes to those sources. Why they don't like them? I mean, you know, there's a number of stated reasons. I think the most usual stated reason is they don't like subsidies. But I don't think we saw in the, you know, quote-unquote, ""big, beautiful bill"" any reduction in tax credits for oil and gas, some of which have been around for over a hundred years. So, you know, it's hard for me to sort of represent what they're thinking on this 'cause I don't think it makes a lot of sense.

RASCOE: Well, how could this affect people's electric bills? Because I think a lot of people, when you think of solar and wind and stuff like that, you think coal is, like, cheap. So if these - you know, if we're using more coal or gas, people might think that might help their electric bills, but how will this actually affect electric bills?

LEWIN: Yeah, so electric bills would go up. There's some really good modeling on this. Jesse Jenkins, out of Princeton at his NEX Lab (ph), did modeling. And I focus on Texas. I look right away at Texas, and electric costs would go up something like 17% in the next four or five years. And the reason for that, Ayesha, is that, like, actually, where we are now, renewables are cheaper than alternative sources of energy like coal and gas. And I use that term alternative very intentionally because we used to refer to renewables as alternative. But if you look globally, last year, 90% of what was installed was wind, solar or storage - globally, 90%. And it's not because of environmental factors that may factor in here or there, but it's mostly because of economics. The International Energy Agency said in 2022 that solar was the cheapest form of electricity ever, and that was three years ago. The costs have come down even more, and we've seen huge cost declines in batteries. So pairing renewables with batteries is really a fantastic solution, just for grid reliability and affordability, to say nothing of having lower emissions.

RASCOE: The White House calls these tax credits a green corporate welfare subsidy. Given that clean energy is a pretty mature industry now, should it really be the recipient of U.S. tax dollars?

LEWIN: Look, here's the way I think of this - every single energy source we have is subsidized. Nuclear is the most subsidized form of energy ever. No nuclear plant gets built without government support. Oil and gas - again, the oil and gas industry is a pretty mature industry, but we still have subsidies available for it. Why do we have subsidies for energy? Because people like low-cost energy. So if you want to take away subsidies, it's going to be a very unpopular thing to do. They're going to have a lot of very angry constituents, very angry business owners. So, yeah, if we want to get rid of the subsidies, let's get rid of all of them, and everybody's energy will go up 50% or 100%, and you'll have people out in the streets with pitchforks, and then they'll put the subsidies back in place.

RASCOE: Do you believe that there is a conservative argument for supporting clean energy? I mean, as you said, you're based in Texas. That's a pretty red state. What is the argument to Republican lawmakers that, you know, supporting clean energy is beneficial?

LEWIN: Oh, I think there's absolutely a conservative argument. I mean, you can just start with most of the economic - the direct economic benefits of wind and solar installations are happening in Republican districts. Something like 80% of the benefits of those tax credits is flowing to Republican areas of the country. So that's one of them, is just the benefits to rural economies all across this country.

RASCOE: Well, I mean, that's definitely a different pitch for renewables because in many ways, the tax credits were intended to speed up the transition away from fossil fuels and to help fight climate change. If the tax credits were to go away, what happens to that fight when it comes to climate change?

LEWIN: Well, you know, it's very interesting. I actually think, particularly at the moment we're at right now in 2025, climate is obviously a very important concern, but it's actually secondary or even tertiary to economic growth. There is no way we are going to win the AI race against China without developing massive amounts of power. Right now, economic growth and lower emissions are possible in a way that they weren't even certainly 10 years ago, and probably even three or four years ago. And that trend is actually accelerating. It's actually becoming more and more true that we can both increase economic growth and lower emissions at the same time.

RASCOE: That's Doug Lewin, CEO of Stoic Energy Consulting. Thank you so much for being with us.

LEWIN: Thanks, Ayesha.

Without significant intervention, the vicious cycle of wildfires, air pollution, and climate change will only intensify.","As Canada grapples with an intensifying wildfire season, the smoke from sprawling blazes in its prairie provinces is casting a hazardous pall over the United States, raising alarms about deteriorating air quality and the escalating impacts of climate change.

The record-breaking fires, fueled by unusually warm and dry conditions, have already burned vast swaths of land, prompting evacuations, emergency declarations, and renewed focus on the cross-border environmental and health consequences of a warming planet.

A Record-Breaking Fire Season

The 2025 wildfire season in Canada has continued the alarming trend of recent years, with massive blazes erupting across Manitoba, Saskatchewan, Alberta, and British Columbia. In Manitoba alone, wildfires have consumed approximately 200,000 hectares (494,000 acres) this year—three times the province’s recent full-year average. The Bird River and Border fires in northern Manitoba remain uncontained, while the Caribou Lake fire in Alberta has added to the crisis. The Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre reports that 40 of the 146 active fires are burning “out of control,” with forecasts predicting above-average fire activity through the spring and summer due to persistent drought and high temperatures.

These fires follow the devastating 2023 season, which saw 7.8 million hectares burned—six times the annual average since 2001—and produced carbon emissions nearly four times those of the global aviation sector in 2022. The 2023 fires, concentrated in western Canada and Quebec, sent smoke plumes as far as Europe and China, underscoring the global reach of Canada’s wildfire crisis. This year’s early-season intensity suggests 2025 could rival or exceed those records, driven by climate conditions that experts warn are becoming the new norm.

Climate Change as a Catalyst

While wildfires are a natural part of Canada’s boreal forest ecosystem, their frequency, size, and severity are increasing due to human-driven climate change. Warmer springs, longer dry seasons, and reduced snowpack have created tinderbox conditions across Canada’s forests. In 2023, temperatures in northwest Canada were 4.5°F (2.6°C) above average, with precipitation 3 inches below normal, setting the stage for extreme fire activity. Similar patterns in 2025, exacerbated by a weakening jet stream that allows smoke to linger, have intensified the crisis.

Natural Resources Canada reports that fire conditions are currently at their maximum severity across affected regions, with climate models projecting a doubling of burned areas by the end of the century if emissions remain high. Drought, invasive insects, and dead trees have further increased fuel loads, making fires more intense and harder to control. Manitoba Premier Wab Kinew, declaring a province-wide state of emergency, noted, “This is the largest evacuation Manitoba will have seen in most people’s living memory… a sign of a changing climate that we are going to have to adapt to.”

Cross-Border Air Quality Impacts

The smoke from Canada’s wildfires is drifting south, threatening air quality across the U.S. Midwest, Northeast, and mid-Atlantic regions. Cities like Chicago, Detroit, and Washington, D.C., are bracing for air quality index (AQI) levels reaching the “red” category (AQI > 150), indicating unhealthy conditions for all groups. In 2023, smoke from eastern Canada’s fires turned New York City’s skies orange, briefly making it the world’s most polluted city, with PM2.5 levels peaking at 258.9 μg/m³—17.3 times the World Health Organization’s guideline of 15 μg/m³. Similar impacts are expected this year as smoke continues to billow across the border.

Wildfire smoke contains fine particulate matter (PM2.5), ozone precursors, and toxic compounds like polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), which are linked to cardiovascular and respiratory diseases, strokes, and even fertility issues. A recent study found that exposure to wildfire smoke can affect heart and lung health for months after the smoke clears, posing a growing public health threat. In the U.S., climate-driven wildfires have already reversed decades of air quality improvements, contributing to an estimated 15,000 PM2.5-related deaths between 2006 and 2020, with a $160 billion economic burden.

Health and Societal Impacts

The health risks are particularly acute for vulnerable groups, including children, the elderly, and those with preexisting conditions. In 2023, over 100 million people in the U.S. were under air quality alerts, with cancellations of school outings, sporting events, and even White House activities. This year, the Canadian military is airlifting 17,000 people from fire zones, while First Nations communities in Saskatchewan face evacuations and road closures. In the U.S., officials are urging residents to limit outdoor activity, wear masks, and use air purifiers to mitigate smoke exposure.

The economic toll is also significant. Canada’s 2023 wildfires caused billions in property damage and disrupted timber supplies, while the U.S. has spent over $3.5 billion annually on firefighting efforts. As wildfires grow, they threaten critical infrastructure, water systems, and ecosystems, with long-term consequences for carbon sinks like Canada’s forests, which may lose their capacity to absorb CO2 if fire activity continues to rise.

Adapting to a Fiery Future

Experts emphasize that while wildfires are not directly caused by climate change, the conditions fueling their intensity—heat, drought, and dry vegetation—are strongly linked to human-induced warming. The Fourth National Climate Assessment warns that over 100 million Americans live in areas with unhealthy air pollution, a problem worsened by wildfires. Mitigation strategies, such as reducing greenhouse gas emissions, improving forest management, and discouraging development in fire-prone areas, are critical to curbing future risks.

In Canada, authorities are enhancing fire monitoring with satellites, drones, and AI-driven risk prediction to optimize firefighting resources. The U.S. is also investing in resilience, with California’s 2009 Climate Adaptation Strategy serving as a model for addressing wildfire-related air quality threats through better land management and public awareness.

Urgent Call to Action

As smoke from Canada’s wildfires continues to choke U.S. cities, the crisis serves as a stark reminder of the interconnected nature of climate change. President Joe Biden, reflecting on the 2023 fires, called them a “stark reminder of the impacts of climate change,” a sentiment echoed by experts who urge global action to curb emissions. Posts on social media capture public concern, with users describing hazy skies and health impacts, while calling for stronger climate policies.

Without significant intervention, the vicious cycle of wildfires, air pollution, and climate change will only intensify. For now, communities on both sides of the border are left to navigate the immediate challenges of smoke-filled skies, while the long-term fight for a cooler, cleaner future remains urgent.",https://www.bbntimes.com/images/Canadian_Wildfires_Worsen_Threatening_US_Air_Quality_Amid_Climate_Change-Driven_Conditions.jpg,N,,2025-06-01 19:03:22.744738

Cheaper batteries mean cheaper EVs, and electric cars and trucks remain the main driver of battery demand.

China’s price advantage is widening over the rest of the world.

The war for a zero-emission future of transportation is really a war for batteries. If battery prices—the biggest single cost of any electric vehicle—remain high, then EVs will stay expensive. But if batteries can be made or secured cheaply and locally, prices will decline.

Tesla figured this out early on with its Gigafactory in Nevada. It's also why automakers like General Motors, Toyota and Ford are planning battery plants of their own—to varying degrees of success thus far.

But as every automaker, battery supplier and energy provider races toward that future, here's some good news: global prices for lithium-ion battery packs fell 20% in 2024, according to a new study from the International Energy Agency (IEA). That's the biggest single price drop since 2017.

You can thank increased competition, more production and growing demand for this situation. ""Lithium prices, in particular, dropped nearly 20% in 2024, reaching similar prices to those at the end of 2015, despite lithium demand in 2024 being about six times bigger than in 2015,"" the report said.

The low prices of critical minerals are due to current surpluses, which is good news for EV costs in the near-term but could lead to under-investment in the future.

Battery Prices (IEA)

Battery pack prices fell in all markets, the report said. But the biggest drops were in—and probably not surprisingly—China. That country has a significant lead in the battery race, both in terms of securing the supply chain and overall technological development.

""China was responsible for 80% of global battery cell production in 2024, while the remainder was produced in the United States, the European Union, Korea and Japan,"" the study said. ""The faster pace of battery cost reduction and innovation in China has been enabled by fierce competition that has driven down profit margins for most producers (though not all), at the same time as driving up manufacturing efficiency and yields, as well as access to a large, skilled workforce.""

Interestingly, that study also notes that contrary to what you may think, hybrid batteries are more expensive than EV batteries, despite being significantly smaller. ""The price of such components is spread across fewer battery cells, increasing the price per kilowatt-hour,"" the study said. ""In 2024, the average price of a 20 kWh PHEV battery pack—roughly the global sales-weighted average for standard plug-in hybrids—was about the same as a 65 kWh BEV battery pack.""

China's near-total lead on lithium iron phosphate (LFP) batteries is having a big impact on the market as well. While LFP batteries have long been considered a lower-cost option for EVs, their performance has improved significantly through continued development, making them far more suited for mainstream mass-market car duty than ever.

LFP batteries made up nearly half of the global EV battery market, the study said, also attributable to China. Their use grew by about 90% in 2024 in the European Union, but remained at only 10% in the United States, due to anti-China tariffs. Meanwhile, LFP batteries are sort of taking over the rest of the world.

""Market penetration of LFP batteries is moving even faster in other markets,"" the study said. ""In Southeast Asia, Brazil and India, the share of electric car batteries using LFP reached more than 50% in 2024. In Southeast Asia and Brazil, LFP uptake is led by imports from China, mostly by BYD, whereas in India it is driven by cars produced domestically, led by Tata Motors."" Meanwhile, LFP battery development is moving more quickly in South Korea and Japan as well.

LFP vs NMC battery adoption

Onto more good news and bad news. On the first front, the U.S. is slowly beginning to catch up. ""Manufacturing capacity in the United States grew by almost 50%, led by Korean companies attracted by tax credits, which accounted for nearly 70% of the growth in 2024,"" the study said. ""This led installed capacity in the United States to surpass that in the European Union, which nonetheless increased by 10% in 2024 despite the Northvolt plant in Sweden being halted following its bankruptcy.""

However, those tax credits could very likely go away soon if President Donald Trump's budget bill is signed into law. The so-called Big, Beautiful Bill is poised to eliminate both EV tax credits and tax incentives for domestic battery manufacturing. A current version passed by the U.S. House of Representatives cuts both; it is now working its way through the Senate.

Ultimately, the global battery boom isn't going anywhere. But whether America wants to have a place in it remains to be seen.

President of the Uniting Church in Australia, Rev Charissa Suli told reporters in Perth on Sunday, she is “profoundly disappointed” about the approval of the North West Shelf gas processing facility.

“As a daughter of the Pacific, I have witnessed first-hand the devastating impacts of climate change on culturally rich but environmentally vulnerable nations in our region,” she said.

“These nations — many of which are home to Uniting Church partners within the Asia-Pacific — contribute the least to global emissions yet suffer the greatest consequences.

“Why then is approval granted to an old, polluting facility to continue emitting vast

volumes of climate damaging emissions of a magnitude many times greater than the

emissions of all the Pacific nations? This is not loving thy neighbour.”

Rev Mitchell Garlett from the Uniting Aboriginal & Islander Christian Congress added he is “very disappointed” that the decision was made without “close consultation with the relevant Traditional Owners”.

“The connection we feel to Country is not just a physical thing but a spiritual connection that is deeper than what we see with our eyes,” he said.

“It is heartbreaking that reconciliation is spoken of but our brothers and sisters voices are not being heard, and the land continues to suffer for so-called progress.”

Rev Dr Ian Tozer added they are “deeply concerned” by the threat to First Nations cultural heritage sites, including 60,000-year-old priceless petroglyphs at the World Heritage nominated Murujuga rock art site.

“It is vital that these ancient sites, so precious to Australia’s First Peoples and to our history, are not further damaged by industry,” he said.

Meanwhile, Woodside has said the approval would support thousands of jobs and supply affordable energy to Western Australia.

The project has supplied 6000 petajoules of domestic gas, powering homes and industry in Western Australia with enough energy to power homes in a city the size of Perth for approximately 175 years, the company said.

In response to the perceived soullessness of electric vehicles, Kafantaris founded Hyperion in 2011 in Columbus, Ohio.
Though the Energy Policy Act of 1992 classifies hydrogen as an alternative fuel, hydrogen fuel cells are currently too costly to appeal to most consumers.
The administration says the United States only has about 60 fueling stations for hydrogen vehicles, and all of those are in California.
And though California is leading the way in increasing accessibility, hydrogen fuel for a mass audience is still decades away.","Angelo Kafantaris is an old-school car guy. He’s the founder and CEO of Hyperion Motors, makers of the world’s first 1,000-mile alternative-fuel vehicle, the XP-1. Unlike most other alternative fuel vehicles on the market, the XP-1 taps into the growing interest in green hydrogen and uses hydrogen fuel cells to power its prototype.

Kafantaris — who grew up fixing cars with his father and who has a deep and abiding love for Detroit — is unapologetic about his fascination with legacy automobiles.

“In the U.S., we have an anthropomorphized relationship with cars,” he says. “There are masculine cars. There are feminine cars. We talk about cars making noises, having smells and giving off vibrations. To me, it’s the ultimate product.”

In the last few decades, Kafantaris said, the automotive industry has lost its way. Though electric vehicles are arguably better for the environment, they’ve sacrificed the elements that traditional car lovers enjoy — the noise, the vibration, the sense of power. Outside of quick acceleration and the ability to move people from place to place, electric vehicles have nothing to do with the power and verve of a gas-powered car. “EVs are almost soulless to true car people,” Kafantaris says.

In response to the perceived soullessness of electric vehicles, Kafantaris founded Hyperion in 2011 in Columbus, Ohio. The company relocated to California in 2015 to take advantage of California’s growing investment in hydrogen infrastructure for personal vehicles, and Hyperion unveiled the XP-1 in 2020. Several of Hyperion’s investors are based in Naples, said Edison Awards’ Executive Director Frank Bonafilia. This year, the company was a finalist at the Fort Myers-based Edison Awards, which honors excellence in innovation.

Kafantaris has a background in mechanical engineering and industrial design — including a stint at Mattel, where he worked on the Hot Wheels line — and he brings an appreciation for both form and function to his design process. “To create a truly remarkable product, the end result needs to not only work beautifully but be aesthetically pleasing, as well,” he says. “This means touch and feel, as well as viewer interface.”

The XP-1’s striking design features a carbon fiber titanium chassis, adjustable solar air blade, high-voltage fuel cells, axial flux motors and a two-ring exhaust that produces a blue-flame effect. Kafantaris calls it “the perfect compromise between zero emissions and automotive traditions.” It has all the components that make cars exciting to people, both aesthetically and mechanically. Plus, he said, it feels like a spaceship.

Kafantaris acknowledges that the United States has a ways to go before it reaches zero emissions, but Hyperion is doing its part to move the nation one step closer to a green hydrogen economy. He refers to the XP-1 as a lightning strike: a brilliant, captivating piece of machinery meant to tease the imagination and bring traditional car lovers to the world of alternative fuels. “We have everything that an electric car offers without — pardon my French — the boringness.”

The Growing Hydrogen Economy

According to a 2023 report released by Deloitte, the global value of the green hydrogen market is expected to reach $1.4 trillion by 2050. The same report predicts the hydrogen industry will support 2 million jobs around the world each year between 2030 and 2050. This will lead to a significant reduction in cumulative carbon emissions — 85 gigatons, according to the report, which is more than twice the amount of global CO2 emissions produced in 2021. But this forward-looking green hydrogen economy comes at a steep cost. Deloitte estimates that more than $9 trillion of investment is needed in the global hydrogen supply chain to achieve these results. Of that $9 trillion, $3.1 trillion would need to go to developing economies.

Too Good to be True?

Advocates tout the benefits of green hydrogen for both the economy and the environment, but is the United States ready for hydrogen as a fuel source for personal vehicles? Not yet, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Though the Energy Policy Act of 1992 classifies hydrogen as an alternative fuel, hydrogen fuel cells are currently too costly to appeal to most consumers. Plus, key infrastructure is lacking. The administration says the United States only has about 60 fueling stations for hydrogen vehicles, and all of those are in California. And though California is leading the way in increasing accessibility, hydrogen fuel for a mass audience is still decades away.",https://www.gulfshorebusiness.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/BATCAVE_1.webp,N,,2025-06-01 15:05:45.993320

The draft, which has been in development for five years, is now open for public comment for a 30-day period.

Ashley Rudzinski from the Groundwork Center for Resilient Communities expressed concerns about the project's potential environmental impact. ""One of the things that stands out is the 20,000 gallons of drilling fluid that would be released into the Great Lakes. On top of that, what they’re proposing would cause detrimental impacts to local air quality. There would be major construction noise and vibrations caused by the drilling and blasting,"" said Rudzinski.

Rudzinski also called for Governor Whitmer to take a public stance on the proposal. ""Governor Whitmer has never publicly weighed in on Enbridge’s oil tunnel proposal, and we really need her to break her silence and show leadership on behalf of the people of Michigan. That means making sure that EGLE is actually scrutinizing the project with an eye toward the Submerged Bottomlands Act, and what this drilling and blasting would mean for the Great Lakes,"" she said.

Enbridge, the company behind the project, issued a statement acknowledging the draft's release. ""We appreciate the extensive technical work that went into this document and the opportunity to contribute detailed responses to numerous data and information requests—demonstrating our commitment to transparency and environmental, social and cultural responsibility,"" the statement read.

Enbridge also emphasized its goal to minimize environmental impact, stating, ""The tunnel design already reflects that intent, and we will use the USACE’s findings from the DEIS to further refine the project.""

Below is a statement from the Governor’s office:

“Next to our people, the Great Lakes are Michigan’s best asset and support 350,000 jobs in the state. Our goal has always been to get the dual pipelines out of the water as quickly as possible while also working to secure our energy independence and lower the cost of energy for Michiganders. We are reviewing the Army Corps’ draft study as state agencies continue to carefully evaluate their portions of the permitting process. The Governor will remain focused on protecting the Great Lakes and Michigan jobs.”

The Army Corps of Engineers plans to issue its final ""record of decision"" this fall, a timeline accelerated to comply with a previous executive order from President Trump declaring an energy emergency.

This year’s scorecard did indicate some improvement, with the number of pro-IP Senators increasing past 20 in addition to 22 pro-IP Representatives identified.
In particular, C4IP’s Congressional scorecard lauds the efforts of Senators Thom Tillis (R-NC) and Chris Coons (D-DE) in advancing national IP policy in a positive direction through 2024.

Several bills that would negatively impact IP rights for Americans are also being debated by Congress, C4IP cautioned.","“[O]nly two states had average scores of ‘B+’ or above across their entire Congressional delegation: Delaware (‘A’); and Idaho (‘B+’).”

On May 28, intellectual property (IP) policy advocacy group the Council for Innovation Promotion (C4IP) published the second edition of its Congressional Innovation Scorecard, a detailed assessment of Congressional engagement with legislative efforts on IP protections and related policies. Although this year’s edition highlighted a larger number of pro-IP voices in Congress, a majority of U.S. Senators and Representatives are still earning poor grades indicating a lack of engagement with issues that are critical to the future of America’s innovation economy.

Sens. Tillis and Coons, Rep. Moran are Only Politicians Graded ‘A+’ for Innovation

C4IP makes clear near the top of its Congressional scorecard that a member of Congress must be pro-IP to rate highly as pro-innovation. Calling the innovation system “America’s 401(K) — the investment vehicle through which we secure future prosperity,” C4IP notes that the responsibility for nurturing the IP system “falls heavily on the shoulders of Congress.” While placing greater emphasis on legislative actions taken during the recently concluded 118th Congress, the Congressional scorecard also takes into account relevant past activity from the 117th Congress and 116th Congress.

Among the key findings of C4IP’s scorecard is that a clear majority of Congress has only limited interest in advancing pro-IP legislation and policy. More than half of members of Congress received a grade of ‘C’ or lower, with nearly 7% of Congress earning a grade of ‘D’ or lower. This year’s scorecard did indicate some improvement, with the number of pro-IP Senators increasing past 20 in addition to 22 pro-IP Representatives identified.

In particular, C4IP’s Congressional scorecard lauds the efforts of Senators Thom Tillis (R-NC) and Chris Coons (D-DE) in advancing national IP policy in a positive direction through 2024. Both Senators earned a grade of ‘A+’ and were closely followed by three Senators earning ‘A’ grades for their increasingly positive engagement with IP policy: Mazie Hirono (D-HI); Marsha Blackburn (R-TN); and Tom Cotton (R-AR). While noting that Tillis and Coons have demonstrated unmatched positive pro-IP activity, C4IP also gave an ‘A+’ grade to Representative Nathaniel Moran (R-TX) for consistent support of pro-IP activities. Six U.S. Representatives also earned ‘A’ grades including Ben Cline (R-VA), Hank Johnson (D-GA), Kevin Kiley (R-CA), Madeleine Dean (D-PA), Scott Peters (D-CA) and Deborah Ross (D-NC).

States With Higher Percentage of Private R&D Workforce Only Maintain ‘C’ Grades

IP-intensive industries are important to every state, with U.S. Patent and Trademark Office data cited by C4IP showing that such industries account for anywhere from 23% to 37% of the private sector workforce in those states. Despite this clear interest in pro-IP efforts that could bolster their private sectors even more, only two states had average scores of ‘B+’ or above across their entire Congressional delegation: Delaware (‘A’); and Idaho (‘B+’). As C4IP points out, poor scores across the board highlight a clear disconnect between the high economic importance of IP-intensive industries and the importance of pro-IP efforts. Indeed, each of the eight states in which IP-intensive industries employ more than 35% of the private sector workforce only scored a ‘C’ average: California (35.1%); Illinois (35.5%); Massachusetts (35.7%); Michigan (35.3%); New York (35.8%); Utah (37%); Washington (36.7%); and Wisconsin (35.2%).

C4IP’s Congressional scorecard identifies several pieces of pro-IP legislation currently before the Senate and House of Representatives. Among these particularly consequential bills are the Patent Eligibility Restoration Act (PERA), a bill sponsored by Tillis and Coons to address the untenable uncertainties posed by the current state of patent-eligibility law, and the Promoting and Respecting Economically Vital American Innovation Leadership (PREVAIL) Act, which addresses unpredictability stemming from inter partes review (IPR) proceedings conducted at the Patent Trial and Appeal Board (PTAB). C4IP also advocated for bringing back the presumption of injunctive relief for parties proving infringement through passage of the Realizing Engineering, Science, and Technology Opportunities by Restoring Exclusive (RESTORE) Patent Rights Act.

Several bills that would negatively impact IP rights for Americans are also being debated by Congress, C4IP cautioned. The Affordable Prescriptions for Patients Act and similar bills addressing so-called “patent thickets” are premised on anti-IP logic that presumes fewer IP protections will naturally lead to greater consumer access, especially for pharmaceuticals. Such logic is undercut by the realities of the COVID-19 pandemic, C4IP argues, given the unimaginably rapid pace of vaccine development thanks in large part to the collaborative environment created by mutual respect for IP rights covering the vaccine’s building blocks.",https://ipwatchdog.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Depositphotos_45526763_S.jpg,N,,2025-06-01 14:05:40.793085

Denmark's current vehicle tax system provides several incentives for zero-emission vehicles. The registration tax for private cars is calculated progressively: 25 percent of the first 72,900 Danish kroner (11,089 U.S. dollars) in 2025, 85 percent of the value between 72,900 and 226,500 Danish kroner, and 150 percent of the remaining value.

For zero-emission vehicles such as electric cars emitting zero CO2, only 40 percent of the calculated tax is payable if the car is registered before 2026, with this rate gradually increasing until full taxation applies in 2035. Additionally, zero-emission cars receive a basic deduction of 165,000 Danish kroner in 2025 from the vehicle registration tax.

“Our renewable portfolio at the moment is more than 2 gigawatts in operation but, in the coming five years, our target is to increase our portfolio to 5 gigawatts,” Kalyon Enerji's chief executive Murtaza Ata said in Istanbul.

“We are looking at opportunities in the Middle East, Eastern Europe and in the US to grow our portfolio.”

In Eastern Europe, Kalyon Enerji is considering Romania and Poland, while in the Middle East and North Africa, it is targeting markets including Algeria, Morocco and Libya, according to Mr Ata.

In the US, “there are many projects that have been offered to us and we are studying them”, he said, without disclosing details.

Globally, countries are boosting investments in renewable projects as they look to cut emissions to meet their clean energy goals. The US aims to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050, while other countries have set their own targets to cut emissions to reduce global warming.

Kalyon Enerji’s portfolio includes a 1.3-gigawatt solar power plant in Turkey, which is the “largest in Europe and has received the largest green financing from UKEF [UK Export Finance]”, Mr Ata said. Its other projects are also based in Turkey.

The Istanbul-based company has “all the capacity and capability to execute projects on its own”, Mustafa Kocar, chief executive of Kalyon Holding, said.

“Currently, we are the biggest renewable investor in Turkey. So basically, we have the technical expertise, we have the capacity to inject more equity in new projects and we can secure the financing through our own resources,” he added.

“We have very good relations with the international financing network.”

New power plants in Syria

Kalyon Enerji is building new power plants in Syria after economic sanctions were lifted on the country by the US and the EU last month.

On Thursday, it signed a $7 billion energy investment agreement with a consortium of companies including Qatar's UCC Holding as well as US company Power international and Cengiz Enerji of Turkey to build a solar power plant with a capacity of 1,000 megawatts and natural gas power plants with a combined capacity of 4,000 megawatts in the country.

“The target is to complete natural gas power plants in three years after financial closure, which maybe four years from today. For solar one and a half year after financial closure, which is two and a half years from today,” said Mr Ata.

After 14 years of war, Syria's electricity sector has been suffering from severe damage to its grid and power stations, ageing infrastructure, and persistent fuel shortages, generating only 1.6 gigawatts of electricity, down from 9.5 gigawatts before 2011, according to a Reuters report.

Reconstructing the country's power sector is expected to cost about $11 billion and the new administration is betting on the private sector shouldering the burden, underlining a shift from the state-led economic policies of the former regime led by Bashar Al Assad.

“We are really happy to contribute to the development of Syria after the new situation,” Mr Ata said.

Global expansion in construction

Meanwhi, Kalyon Holding is also eyeing opportunities in other verticals of its business including in construction, according to Mr Kocar.

“We were more [of] a local company, but in the last couple of years, with this strategy of internationalisation, on the construction side, we are undertaking some works in Azerbaijan in rail and highway,” he said.

“We are also doing a gas pipeline project for Romania’ state-owned Transgaz and are bidding for many tenders on the construction side in the Middle East, CIS [Commonwealth of Independent States], North Africa and Eastern Europe.”

Kalyon Holding is also eyeing opportunities in airport construction in Turkey and other parts of the Middle East after building Istanbul airport in 2019.

“We have a 55 per cent stake in Istanbul airport, and we have completed its construction, and we are now managing the airport together with our partner there,” Mr Kocar said.

“Airport construction investment is also an area that we are looking at, not only in Turkey but also in the region.”",https://www.thenationalnews.com/resizer/v2/IYGVK7563VD4XH4TWBG3FASGQQ.jpg?smart=true&auth=cd1252418245fd446d4544420f9d871947f0fb01df820688ef4d9bd7dd9c85b2&width=1200&height=630,N,,2025-06-01 13:07:16.067639

Much of the public discourse around AI centres around cybersecurity and such issues, but its environmental impact also needs to be considered.

While AI and the data centres it relies on use large amounts of energy and water, the technology can also be used to help tackle climate change.

By adopting practical strategies, there are actionable steps that organizations can take to align their AI strategies and sustainability goals.

Conversations around the use of artificial intelligence (AI) in business typically centre around data security, ethical uses and the risk of over-reliance on the emerging technology. But there is also growing discussion and concern around AI’s environmental footprint and rightly so.

With AI having a significant impact on energy and water consumption, as well as global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, it is vital that the subject of environmental sustainability is included in discussions around responsible AI.

Simultaneously, there’s an undeniable sense of renewed hope that AI can positively contribute to the global transition to a lower carbon economy. As AI’s impact rises alongside growing use of the technology, we must reflect on how it contributes to – and fights against – climate change.

AI’s growing appetite for energy and water

Over the past decade, demand for cloud computing and digital services has focused minds on energy optimization, with modern data centres increasingly adopting energy-efficient hardware and advance cooling systems leading to improved power usage effective averages across the industry. However, the reality is that the energy demands of AI, powered by data centres, significantly outpace current efficiency gains.

A single ChatGPT inquiry consumes about five times more electricity than that of a web search, while it is also estimated that training a single language model such as GPT-3 uses electricity equivalent to the power consumed annually by 130 US homes.

Then, there’s the energy consumption of AI image generation. While an AI model generating text in response to 1,000 prompts requires as much 16% of a full smartphone charge, generating an image requires the equivalent of 100%.

AI operations also come with high water demands as data centres require cooling systems to maintain optimal operating temperatures. GPT-3 is estimated to utilize about one 16-ounce bottle of water for every 10-50 responses it prepares and this quickly adds up when factoring in billions of queries – with AI’s projected annual water withdrawal to reach 6.6 billion cubic metres by 2027.

Lastly, operational logistics, including construction and maintenance, account for up to two-thirds of a data centre's lifetime emissions. Emissions from building infrastructure, manufacturing IT equipment and chip manufacturing requirements of data centres contribute significantly to AI’s environmental footprint.

As AI workloads expand, so do their power demands. The World Bank estimates that AI’s wider industry category of information and communications technology currently generates at least 1.7% of global emissions. While this percentage may seem modest, current figures only reflect today’s reported AI usage and not tomorrow’s actual consumption.

AI adoption continues to accelerate – and also considering increased global digital penetration, expansion of cloud storage, internet of things uptake and the growing prevalence of cryptocurrencies and blockchain technologies – the collective impact on climate change could become significantly larger, even as environmental efficiencies are factored in.

Under current growth trajectories, the International Energy Agency (IEA) predicts global data centres may consume up to 1,000 TWh of electricity in 2026 – an increase of 400% from 2022.

Meanwhile, reports from major tech giants support these projections with Google and Microsoft recently disclosing year-on-year increases in emissions, warning these trends challenge their climate commitments. That said, many businesses are still innovating new ways to respond to the impacts of their energy use.

Mitigating the impact of AI energy consumption

Many prominent organizations associated with cloud computing and AI development have taken strong stances on tackling emissions and climate. For example:

Amazon has matched 100% of its operation’s global energy consumption with electricity generated by renewable energy systems.

Microsoft established a supplier code of conduct, requiring suppliers to transition to 100% carbon free electricity by 2030, and has committed to doing the same.

Google remains committed to their goal to rely on carbon-free electricity by 2030 and have launched efforts to improve their AI model efficiency and data-centre energy consumption.

OpenAI founder Sam Altman invested $20 million in Exowatt, which uses solar power to help meet the needs of OpenAI data centres.

Salesforce announced that it is lobbying for new regulations to compel companies to report AI emissions data and efficiency standards as part of its Sustainable AI Policy Priorities initiative.

Amid continued investment in computing infrastructure and AI development, looking to industry leaders can provide inspiration for improving energy management and reducing emissions.

Reducing AI energy consumption

As we consider the need to address the environmental impact of AI use as part of global efforts to build a sustainable future, organizations of all sizes can pull their weight in the following ways:

1. Measure emissions and reduction efforts

Leverage tools to measure, analyse and report your emissions over time

Work with suppliers to know how your AI use translates to energy consumption

2. Use efficient AI models and optimize AI workflows

Leverage pre-trained models and APIs

Compress models or use batch processing wherever possible

3. Comply with ISO 42001 requirements

When determining which ISO 42001 standards affect your organization’s AI management system, include climate change as a relevant factor

Conduct an AI system impact assessment, which evaluates societal impacts of your AI system, including the effects on environmental sustainability

4. Partner with sustainable vendors

Utilize AI and cloud platforms committed to renewable or carbon-free energy and that publish sustainability metrics and goals

Seek vendors who are ISO 14001 and ISO 42001 certified, which demonstrates their commitment to improving sustainability performance and using ethical AI systems

5. Foster a company-wide sustainability culture

Educate and train employees on emissions, energy demands and water use related to business and AI operations

Source ideas for sustainability-related efforts from employees and create an environmental sustainability employee resource group to lead the implementation of such measures

Engage with customers and suppliers to collaborate on ways to mitigate energy use and emissions

AI’s positive environmental impact

Amid the public discourse around AI and its undeniable environmental impact, many argue that it can also be a powerful tool in the fight against climate change – and they’re right.

AI can quickly and effectively analyse significant volumes of data to provide insights into climate trends and the effectiveness of emissions reduction strategies that can lead to faster action. Additional capabilities for AI to positively contribute to fighting climate change include:

Providing greater understanding of extreme weather climate risks

Modelling climate scenarios

Improving resource utilization and management

Expediting the development of new sustainable, energy-efficient materials

Reducing carbon footprints by forecasting demands and optimizing operations

Developing product life-cycle assessments to improve the accuracy of supply chain emissions calculations

Tackling AI-driven emissions

Maintaining awareness of the sustainability expectations of investors, suppliers and consumers, and tracking and reporting energy use and emissions, is best practice for organizations wanting to tackle AI-driven emissions.

Publishing an annual emissions inventory that is subject to third-party assurance or by becoming ISO 14001 certified, gives stakeholders confidence that you are committed to sustainability, while ISO 42001 certification also demonstrates a commitment to using ethical, trustworthy and accountable AI systems. It’s also vital to ensure you keep up with and emerging sustainability and AI regulations as they evolve.

What's the World Economic Forum doing about the transition to clean energy?

Moving to clean energy is key to combating climate change, yet in the past five years, the energy transition has stagnated.

Energy consumption and production contribute to two-thirds of global emissions, and 81% of the global energy system is still based on fossil fuels, the same percentage as 30 years ago. Plus, improvements in the energy intensity of the global economy (the amount of energy used per unit of economic activity) are slowing. In 2018 energy intensity improved by 1.2%, the slowest rate since 2010.

Effective policies, private-sector action and public-private cooperation are needed to create a more inclusive, sustainable, affordable and secure global energy system.

Benchmarking progress is essential to a successful transition. The World Economic Forum’s Energy Transition Index, which ranks 115 economies on how well they balance energy security and access with environmental sustainability and affordability, shows that the biggest challenge facing energy transition is the lack of readiness among the world’s largest emitters, including US, China, India and Russia. The 10 countries that score the highest in terms of readiness account for only 2.6% of global annual emissions.

To future-proof the global energy system, the Forum’s Centre for Energy & Materials is working on initiatives including Clean Power and Electrification, Energy and Industry Transition Intelligence, Industrial Ecosystems Transformation, and Transition Enablers to encourage and enable innovative energy investments, technologies and solutions.

Additionally, the Mission Possible Partnership (MPP) is working to assemble public and private partners to further the industry transition to set heavy industry and mobility sectors on the pathway towards net-zero emissions. MPP is an initiative created by the World Economic Forum and the Energy Transitions Commission.

The project will rely on small modular reactors, which are nuclear reactors smaller than typical commercial ones in size and output.
Because of this, consumers pay less for nuclear energy than they do for energy sourced from polluting fossil fuels.

EnergySage, a solar energy consumer resource, simplifies the process of going solar.","Behind hydropower, nuclear energy is the second-largest source of low-carbon electricity in the world, according to the U.S. Department of Energy. The U.S. Energy Information Administration reported that as of August 2023, there were 93 operating nuclear reactors at 54 sites in 28 states.

Google is about to add three more to that list.

Through nuclear site developer Elementl Power, Google will fund the project and plans to add 600 megawatts of generating capacity at all three sites, as reported by TechCrunch.

While the development company has yet to develop any power plants, its experience and understanding of the nuclear power industry make Elementl well-suited for such an ambitious and beneficial project.

The project will rely on small modular reactors, which are nuclear reactors smaller than typical commercial ones in size and output. There are currently no SMRs outside of China, but developers in the United States are attracted to them for their cost-effectiveness, short construction times, and nonexistent carbon output.

This initiative by Google and Elementl will financially benefit consumers whose electricity is sourced from nuclear power. The World Nuclear Association said nuclear plants are expensive to build but cheap to run. Because of this, consumers pay less for nuclear energy than they do for energy sourced from polluting fossil fuels.

Free energy is a dream, but it is entirely possible. When consumers use nuclear power as well as solar panels, their energy bills can drop to near $0. EnergySage, a solar energy consumer resource, simplifies the process of going solar. The company compares quotes for consumers and can potentially save them up to $10,000.

Clean energy can be a money-saver, giving consumers more finances for other essentials. This collaboration between Google and Elementl will benefit the planet and the economy.

In a press release, Elementl Power Chairman and CEO Chris Colbert said: ""Innovative partnerships like this are necessary to mobilize the capital required to build new nuclear projects, which are critical to deliver safe, affordable and clean baseload power, and help companies advance their long-term net zero goals.""

Amanda Peterson Corio, the global head of data center energy at Google, said in the same release: ""Google is committed to catalyzing projects that strengthen the power grids where we operate, and advanced nuclear technology provides reliable, baseload, 24/7 energy.""

Trump's Republican administration is supporting the development of fossil fuels in contrast to his Democratic predecessor Joe Biden, who had massively supported the production of renewable aviation fuels through tax credits.
- 'Entirely achievable' - The air transportation industry has faced growing pressure to deal with its contribution to the climate crisis.
To achieve net-zero emissions, airlines rely on non-fossil sources known as Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF).
""This represents only 0.7 percent of total aviation needs,"" IATA Director General Willie Walsh said.","The airline industry's flagship goal of decarbonising by 2050 is now ""in peril"" due to climate-sceptic policies, including those of US President Donald Trump, the leading airline association IATA warned on Sunday.

The emergence of leaders favouring fossil fuels and recent regulatory rollbacks are ""obviously a setback... it does imperil success on the 2050 horizon"", Marie Owens Thomsen, the International Air Transport Association's senior vice president for sustainability, told reporters.

""But I don't think it's going to halt or reverse progress. I think it will just slow progress,"" she said at the IATA annual industry conference in India.

Trump's Republican administration is supporting the development of fossil fuels in contrast to his Democratic predecessor Joe Biden, who had massively supported the production of renewable aviation fuels through tax credits.

UN aviation agency members, from the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), have set the year 2050 as their goal for achieving net-zero carbon emissions for air travel -- an industry often criticised for its outsized role in climate change.

- 'Entirely achievable' -

The air transportation industry has faced growing pressure to deal with its contribution to the climate crisis.

Currently responsible for 2.5 percent to three percent of global CO2 emissions, the sector's switch to renewable fuels is proving difficult, even if the aeronautics industry and energy companies have been seeking progress.

To achieve net-zero emissions, airlines rely on non-fossil sources known as Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF).

However, SAF biofuels are still three to four times more expensive than petroleum-based jet fuel.

""Another problem, which is related, is the fact that oil is so cheap,"" Owens Thomsen said. ""I think that also diminishes the sense of urgency that people have.""

A barrel of Brent North Sea crude, the international benchmark, stands below $65 as a result of Trump's tariffs, his call to ""drill baby drill"" and especially a decision by OPEC+ to hike crude output quotas.

This represents an immediate boon for airlines, whose fuel costs represent between a quarter and a third of operating expenses.

SAF is seen as a crucial ingredient in hitting emissions targets. The biofuel produces lower carbon emissions than traditional jet fuel and is made from plant and animal materials such as cooking oil and fat.

European Union rules require carriers to include two percent of SAF in their fuel mix starting this year, rising to six percent in 2030 before soaring to 70 percent from 2050.

Owens Thomsen estimated on Sunday that $4.7 trillion in investment is needed to establish SAF sectors capable of meeting the needs of air transport by 2050.

""It is entirely achievable,"" she said, adding that the raw materials and technology already exist and simply need to be developed.

""The money involved is very comparable to the money that was involved in creating the previous new energy markets, notably obviously wind and solar,"" she said.

That money could be found just by stopping subsidies to oil producers, she said.

""The world is subsidising large oil companies to the height of $1 trillion per year,"" she said.

""With that money, if it were redirected in its totality, we could solve our energy transition in less than five years.""

IATA also indicated on Sunday that it expects global SAF production to double this year compared with 2024 to 2.5 billion litres -- slightly down from its previous projections of 2.7 billion litres.

""This represents only 0.7 percent of total aviation needs,"" IATA Director General Willie Walsh said.

In April, leadership in Spain indicated that they would be open to reconsidering the phase-out of nuclear plants in that nation.
Furthermore, the pivot toward renewable energy has caused some volatility in European energy markets, where prices have occasionally dropped below zero over the past year.
A lot of this renewed attention to nuclear power is focused on the rollout of small modular reactors, rather than traditional nuclear plants.","Europe is embracing nuclear energy with a new vigor. Even the most historically staunch nuclear opponents are softening their restrictions on the carbon-free form of energy production as the continent continues to pivot away from oil and gas imports and toward energy independence in the long shadow of Russia’s invasion in Ukraine and the European energy crisis that followed.

In March, the government of Italy made a significant step toward overturning the nation’s 40-year ban on nuclear power production. In April, leadership in Spain indicated that they would be open to reconsidering the phase-out of nuclear plants in that nation. And just this month, Denmark followed Italy’s lead in publicly announcing the legal revisitation of its nuclear ban, and Germany – Europe’s starkest nuclear energy adversary – agreed to drop its opposition to nuclear power in European Union legislation, in cooperation with France. A German official called the move “a sea-change policy shift” that will remove roadblocks and increase efficiency in energy policymaking within the European Union.

According to a report from CNBC, “The renewed European interest in nuclear shows how some countries are hedging their bets in pursuit of more energy independence.” However, it’s also related to the “hidden cost” of balancing and transporting electricity from renewables, the outlet reports.

While solar and wind remain much cheaper alternatives for power generation, their rapid expansion in European grids has not been without challenges. Last month, one of the worst blackouts in European history crippled power grids across Spain and Portugal, and many think that the rapid buildout of renewable resources in that region could be to blame. While official reports on the cause of the blackout are still in investigation stages, critics have been quick to point to the fact that around 70% of Spain's electricity production at the time of the blackout, and that Spain’s solar capacity growth has outpaced the rest of Europe by a factor of two.

Furthermore, the pivot toward renewable energy has caused some volatility in European energy markets, where prices have occasionally dropped below zero over the past year. While these price crashes are great news for European consumers, who have been battered by high utility bills in recent years, they’re bad news for the sector and the climate, as they can discourage further investment in renewable capacity expansion.

Despite these challenges, solar and wind remain critically important to Europe’s energy independence and for climate goals. But leadership is clearly looking for a stop-gap while renewable-charged grids get their sea legs. “Solar and wind are still the cheapest and fastest way to drive the green transition, and that remains our focus. But we also need to understand whether new nuclear technologies can play a supporting role,” Lars Aagaard, Denmark’s minister for climate, energy and utilities, was quoted by CNBC.

A lot of this renewed attention to nuclear power is focused on the rollout of small modular reactors, rather than traditional nuclear plants. This relatively nascent technology offers a lot of advantages for countries like Denmark and Italy who phased out their nuclear workforces, and thereby national nuclear expertise, years ago. Unlike full-scale nuclear power plants, which require years of design and planning, these small modules are built in a factory setting and assembled on-site with a relatively small crew, and require little oversight.

“We have no recent experience with nuclear power, and we lack the necessary knowledge regarding safety and waste management. That’s why we must begin a serious analysis — not to replace solar and wind, but to see whether new nuclear can complement our energy system in the future,” Aagaard said about Denmark’s aversion to traditional nuclear development.

The US agriculture industry is facing a tsunami of misfortune between trade wars, climate impacts, and a fresh round of colony collapse disorder that decimated the honeybee population last year. In one bright spot, new agrivoltaic projects demonstrate that solar energy, crops, and livestock can coexist on the same land, creating new opportunities for farmers to earn revenue while preserving the land from development into shopping malls, housing developments, fulfillment centers and the like.

Farming-Friendly Solar Power Plants

The science behind the agrivoltaic movement began to emerge in force during the first Trump administration, as researchers assembled evidence that some plants can thrive in between solar panels, despite the shade they cast — or, in some cases, because the shade provides a beneficial cooling environment (see more solar-plus-farming background here).

That’s a sharp contrast with earlier practices, in which solar arrays were typically mounted on beds of gravel or other l0w-maintenance ground cover to cut costs, damaging the soil below if not permanently destroying it. Under an agrivoltaic scenario, livestock grazing can keep excess vegetation in check while restoring nutrients to the soil.

Farmers are also beginning to introduce food crops into solar arrays, but pollinator habitats, marginal farmland restoration, and livestock grazing are more typical use cases here in the US.

A 10-Hive Apiary For A New Agrivoltaic Project

Agrivoltaic specialists have also emerged to provide solar developers with purpose-built designs, hardware, and ecological guidance aimed at optimizing solar generation and agricultureat the same site.

Urban Grid, an Independent Power Producer that specializes in agrivoltaic projects, demonstrates how solar developers can take advantage of the growing store of knowledge and resources supporting the solar-plus-farming movement. The Texas-based company already grazes lambs on its 65-megawatt Crystal Hill Solar project in Halifax County, Virginia, and it has just launched a 10-hive, 500,000-bee apiary at the edge of the site in partnership with the Virginia firm Siller Pollinator Company.

“Together, Urban Grid and Siller’s founding farmer Allison Wickham are launching a multi-year study of pollinator activity and plant diversity on solar land. The program includes vegetation monitoring, soil sampling and honey analysis to understand how pollinators interact with the solar environment—and what that means for the surrounding ecosystem,” Urban Grid explains.

The new apiary is no small potatoes. Urban Grid expects the hives to produce more than 400 pounds of honey per year. In addition to providing samples for research, the company plans to share the honey among community food banks, schools, and faith organizations.

Next Steps For Agrivoltaic Research In The USA

The Trump-Musk budget chopper took a hard swing at the research branch of the US Department of Agriculture earlier this year, including the division that monitors colony collapse disorder. CCD is a catch-all for various conditions, whether environmental or human-made, that prompt worker bees to abandon their hives.

In normal times, USDA labs would be humming with activity as researchers race to find the causes and help restore bee populations. No such luck this year, which makes private sector agrivoltaic research projects like Crystal Hill all the more valuable.

“We’re not just placing hives on a solar site—we’re farming this land,” Allison Wickham emphasized in a press statement. “We’ll be analyzing pollen to identify what species bees are foraging, measuring vegetation changes over time and comparing site conditions near and far from the hives.”

“This kind of research can help shape smarter, more sustainable solar land use across the country and provide greater opportunities to a wider range of farmers and land managers,” Wckham added.

Here Come The Food Crops

In tandem with the new apiary, Wickham has been tasked with establishing a rotating crop operation on three acres of the Crystal Hill array, located near the hives. Urban Grid expects the pilot project to inform the expansion of its agrivoltaic plans from grazing and beekeeping to raise food crops, too. The company also plans to assess how its bee colonies benefit other nearby properties.

“This pilot gives us the chance to research pollinator impacts on the local community,”explains Urban Grid VP of Asset Management Jeff Hudson. “By installing the hives on the edge of the project we can study the impacts across a significant portion of the land, which allows us to measure pollination benefits for local farmland.”

“In the end, improving vegetation while producing energy is the goal—this is a business, and these innovations help us operate smarter while creating shared value for the communities we’re in,” Hudson added.

Next Steps For The US Agrivoltaic Industry

The loss of USDA research staff is not the only problem besetting the relationship between farmers and the federal government. In February, USDA summarily clawed back reimbursable renewable energy grants that had already been approved under the agency’s longstanding REAP (Rural Energy for America Program) branch, leaving some farmers on the hook for equipment and installation costs already incurred.

USDA later indicated that farmers could get reimbursed but they would need to align their grant descriptions with the priorities of the Trump administration, effectively boxing out agrivoltaic systems along with other renewable energy projects.

Meanwhile, private sector stakeholders like Urban Grid are picking up part of the slack. Urban Grid currently lists a 1-gigawatt (DC) portfolio of contracted or under construction solar projects, with 12 more gigawatts of solar in the pipeline and 7 gigawatts in co-located or standalone energy storage projects.

If all goes according to plan, research on beekeeping, grazing, and food crops at the Crystal Hill site will inform similar projects in the future. “These insights will shape habitat design, vegetation planning and ecological performance across the company’s portfolio, as Urban Grid works to expand this model,” the company explains.

Of interest from a political perspective, the company’s current focus of operations covers 12 states including 10 that voted for the winning presidential candidate on Election Day 2024: Texas, Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Tennessee, Alabama, South Carolina, Virginia, Indiana, and Pennsylvania. Maryland and Delaware are the other two states.

Meanwhile, keep an eye on Virginia’s growing footprint in the US lamb industry. In addition to Urban Grid’s Crystal Hill operation, the firm AEP is hosting sheep on its 485-megawatt Spotsylvania Energy Center in Virginia. As a further benefit, the sheep reportedly enjoy the cool shade cast by the solar panels on hot summer days.",https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/agrivoltaic-sheep-beekeeping-urban-grid.jpg,N,,2025-06-01 14:05:37.008863

Since his return to the Oval Office, Trump has positioned hydrocarbons as the backbone of the U.S. energy portfolio and also as a lever for exerting America’s geopolitical influence on the global stage. The focus on Washington’s utilization of natural resources as a geopolitical tool has centered around Europe, where the U.S. helped wean its transatlantic allies off their dependence on Russian gas. Trump’s push for Asian investment in the Alaska LNG project as a way to balance the region's trade with the U.S. amid the tariff disputes is a new test of U.S. energy diplomacy. Washington is seeking to leverage Asia’s growing demand for energy to compel renegotiations.

Is Alaskan LNG Moving Forward?

Once seen as a pipe dream hindered by challenges related to its scale, cost, and complexity, there is now renewed optimism regarding the $44 billion Alaska LNG project. The project, if built out, will move natural gas along an 800-mile pipeline from fields north of the Arctic circle to Southern Alaska and then be shipped on tankers to Asia, providing access to Alaska’s more than 120 trillion cubic feet of natural gas and the logistical benefit of avoiding the Panama Canal, reducing bottlenecks and drastically decreasing shipment times.

Following President Trump’s suggestion that trade partners can avoid tariffs by increasing their purchases of U.S. energy, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent confirmed that investments from Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan in the flagship LNG project could form the basis of a deal with those countries. If Trump’s reciprocal tariffs are implemented, Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan would face 24%, 25%, and 32% tariffs, respectively.

Japan’s biggest electricity producer and gas buyer, Jera, is considering participating as part of its effort to negotiate a trade deal with the U.S., while officials from South Korea are expected to visit Alaska to discuss the project in the coming weeks. These developments follow announcements in March that Taiwanese state energy company CPC signed a nonbinding agreement with the state-run Alaska Gasline Development Group to buy U.S. LNG and invest in the project.

Asia’s Growing Energy Need

In addition to East Asia, U.S. tariff negotiations have brought several countries in Southeast and South Asia to the table, all of which are eager to purchase energy to reduce their trade surpluses with the U.S.

There’s a strong convergence of interests on all sides, especially from Asia. With electricity demand in Southeast Asia growing at an annual rate of 4% and a heavy reliance on maritime oil and gas imports through the Strait of Malacca, Indo-Pacific energy security stands to benefit greatly from increased trade with the U.S.

Since the onset of negotiations, several countries have started to explore the possibility of buying American energy. Bangladesh signed an agreement with Louisiana-based Argent LNG for up to five million tons per year, Indonesia has offered to buy $10 billion of additional U.S. energy goods, and Vietnam announced provisional deals for the import of U.S. energy projects to avoid tariffs. Some countries have taken measures aside from increasing their purchases of American energy products. For example, India is weighing the option to scrap its import tax on American LNG in addition to boosting U.S. oil imports, and Thailand pledged to buy more U.S. energy commodities and reduce import tariff rates on LNG and ethanol

With China’s suspension of U.S. LNG imports and Italian energy giant ENI’s CEO Cristian Signoretto’s cautionary comments on the competitiveness of American LNG as the U.S. imposes tariffs, Washington is angling to find new customers as it streamlines regulations, works to increase efficiency, and cut costs for natural gas export projects along the Gulf Coast.

How Energy Fits into the U.S Multilateral Approach to Asia

The Trump Administration’s attempt to corral Taiwan, Japan, and South Korea into making significant investments in the Alaska LNG project signals a continuation of its departure from the U.S.’s historical “hubs and spokes” alliance system in Asia.

In addition to bilateral contacts between the U.S. and its Asian partners, Washington is no longer limiting its collective engagement in Asia to defense and security. Asian countries recognize the increasing importance of regional energy security, and the U.S.’s energy-focused outreach is striking a chord.

The Toyota bZ goes on sale in second half of 2025.

The 2026 Toyota bZ makes a leap forward with improvements for everything from the subcompact EV's name to its charging system. The 2022 bZ4X was an uncharacteristic disappointment from the world’s largest automaker. Overpriced and under-equipped, it was hamstrung by everything from uncompetitive technology to a ludicrous name.

Toyota listened to its critics and turned one of the world’s most formidable continuous improvement machines loose.

Renamed the bZ ― still not poetry, but the badge no longer looks like a laser printer threw up ― the new model is competitive with small electric SUVs like the Kia Niro, Hyundai Kona and Fiat 500e.

The 2026 bZ goes on sale in the second half of 2025. Detailed figures for price, range and charging will be available later.

I recently drove a loaded bZ Limited through the exurbs surrounding Toyota’s North America headquarters in Plano. It felt like a completely different vehicle from the bZ4X Limited I tested a couple of months ago.

Key improvements to 2026 Toyota bZ

25% range increase to 314 miles

50% power increase to 338 horsepower

NSCS charging port

Plug & Charge compatibility

Radical makeover

Improvements to the ’26 bZ start at the EV’s heart: battery, charging and motors.

The bZ gets two sizes of lithium-ion battery: a 74.7 kWh unit delivers up to 314 miles range and a 57.7 kWh unit rated at 236 miles. The battery is now capable of pre-conditioning, which speeds up charging and reduces energy use in cold weather.

A built-in NACS charging port provides access to Tesla’s DC fast charging network. An adaptor will be necessary for CCS chargers common at other charging stations. An onboard charger upgraded from 7 to 11 kW will hasten charging at the 240v connections most EV owners use at home. Plug & Charge software makes charging fast and easy at participating chargers including Electrify America, EVgo, ChargePoint and Tesla.

Maximum power increases dramatically, from 214 to 338 hp for the AWD model and 201 to 221 hp for FWD.

The exterior styling benefits from updated front LED running lights and fascia that bring the nose into harmony with Toyota’s ""hammerhead"" nose. Body-color front fascia and cladding around the wheels is also new.

Driving impressions

The ’26 fairly leaps away from stops compared with its under-power predecessor. Toyota claims a 4.9-seconds 0-60 mph for the AWD bZ. It was mum on the previous model’s acceleration, and not out of modesty.

The steering was responsive in my time in neighborhoods, shopping districts and along wide, smooth roads that curved between corporate campuses and public parks.

The brakes are firm and easy to modulate. New steering column paddles adjust regenerative braking to recapture energy, but there’s no one-pedal setting to bring the bZ to a full stop.

The front seat is roomy, with a big center console that holds two new wireless charging pads. Wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto are standard.

The new dash has a 14-inch touch screen. The instrument cluster is new, too, bigger and easier to read.

A heat pump reduces energy use for heating and cooling the cabin.

Standard heated steering wheel and front seats further reduce cold-weather energy use. Climate control options include ventilated front seats, heated rear seats and a radiant front-seat foot and leg heater.

Why buy a 2026 Toyota bZ?

Price and charging time are huge unknowns, but there’s lots to like about the 2026 Toyota bZ.

Its improved power and battery size give it competitive performance and range. Revised lights and exterior color pattern make it look like a grown-up vehicle, as opposed to the bZ4X’s cobbled-together appearance.

The interior of my bZ Limited was comfortable, trimmed in appealing soft materials and roomy.

It’s a huge step forward to Toyota’s EV status, worth a look from anybody shopping for a small electric SUV.

Posters celebrating cooperative principles decorated the walls; one, proclaiming “Democratic Member Control,” showed ants working together to carry a bright green fern leaf. Some of the electricians filtered in late, having come straight from a job site.

“We want to take a moment to recognize some amazing people in our co-op,” said Melanie Duggan, a senior project manager at Cal Solar, which installs rooftop solar and battery systems. Duggan and other managers then praised their colleagues’ “commitment to craft” and “pure fucking magic” — core values of the company. Workers cheered and clapped after each shout-out.

This supportive culture is at the heart of Cal Solar. “I haven’t run into any other construction environments where you have construction workers saying, ‘Love you,’” Lars Ortegren, the company’s co-founder and director of construction services, told me.

Cal Solar has been installing panels on homes and businesses in Grass Valley and surrounding Nevada County for the past 25 years. In 2019, it became a worker-owned cooperative, and Ortegren went from being sole owner to an employee-owner.

Today, Cal Solar’s worker-owners spend their days constructing solar systems and managing sales. But they also run a company. They make decisions, share profits and have a financial stake: $5,000 invested up front, or $1,000 down and $4,000 financed through paycheck withdrawals. Any employee may buy in, though currently only 46% are owners. Not everyone wants the additional responsibilities, Ortegren said, but all workers benefit from the cooperative culture.

“I haven’t run into any other construction environments where you have construction workers saying, ‘Love you.’”

Ortegren has wanted to create well-paying solar jobs and a collective workplace since he first entered the industry over two decades ago. “I had this whole fantasy of creating an anarchist labor union for solar installers,” he told me. Previously, Ortegren and Angel Niblock, Cal Solar’s general manager, were members of the Industrial Workers of the World. They believe in “the dignity of labor, in democratic workplaces and in the idea that those who do the work should have the say and a stake in how it’s done,” as Niblock put it at the company meeting.

In recent years, the solar industry has ballooned: It employs nearly six times more workers than the coal industry, according to a 2024 report from the Department of Energy. Solar jobs vary, though. Employees at rooftop solar companies like Cal Solar install panels in their own communities, while installers on large utility-scale projects travel between remote sites and rarely see their families, though they may earn more money. In California, for example, contractors often partner with labor unions and must pay prevailing wages on large projects. In states with weaker labor laws, however, some utility-scale facilities contract with temporary hiring agencies that have notoriously bad labor practices.

Meanwhile, Cal Solar’s worker-owners shape company policies and generate wealth for themselves and their colleagues.

A FEW HOURS before the company meeting, Alejandro de Necochea and his crew installed racking and wires on a home in Grass Valley. Panels leaned against the ranch-style house and power drills buzzed, echoing above the gentle ripple of a nearby stream.

“Every two or three days, I have a new job site that’s beautiful, just like this,” de Necochea said, gesturing toward the cedar, ponderosa and oak trees surrounding the property.

Solar first caught his interest over a decade ago, when he moved to Grass Valley to live with his parents in an off-grid home. That’s not unusual in Nevada County, which has attracted people interested in hippie, back-to-the-land lifestyles since the 1960s. De Necochea’s family relied on solar panels for electricity, so he learned the basics. Then, 10 years ago, he started working at Cal Solar. He’s now a lead journeyman electrician, worker-owner and board member with additional governance responsibilities.

De Necochea enjoys being a worker-owner, but “it’s not all sunshine and rainbows,” he said. “You definitely feel the pressure of it being your company.” For 10 hours a day, four days a week, he climbs on roofs and installs solar systems. But if there’s a board meeting in the evening, he doesn’t get to clock out when his shift ends. He could probably make more money on utility-scale projects, but he’s committed to Cal Solar.

“I had this whole fantasy of creating an anarchist labor union for solar installers.”

That commitment creates a sense of accountability: During the COVID-19 pandemic, for example, worker-owners took pay cuts to keep the business afloat. “You really feel like people got your back going through ups and downs,” he said.

Industry insiders call those ups and downs the “solarcoaster.” Companies must contend with shifting state and federal incentives, changing building codes, new technologies and global economic trends. “We’re at a low point right now on that solarcoaster,” Niblock told me.

Current challenges include the Trump administration’s tariffs, inflation, a potential rollback of a 30% federal tax credit for residential solar and reductions in California’s rooftop solar incentives. Right before California’s policy changed in April 2023, sales spiked. “We booked like a year’s worth of work,” said Casey Tomasi, Cal Solar’s design manager, “and then it immediately fell off a cliff.”

But Grass Valley homeowners still want solar, partly for independence from Pacific Gas and Electric. In recent years, PG&E has shut off power during periods of high wildfire risk, and Ryan Harris, who owns the home where de Necochea worked this spring, wanted a more reliable system. “Going without power for 14 days in the middle of winter or in the middle of a 115-degree heat storm in the summertime — it’s absolutely miserable,” he said. Now, his family will have electricity even when the grid shuts down.

THE CO-OP MODEL has helped Cal Solar and other residential solar companies stay resilient. “You have multiple sources of people working on these problems and solving them together, versus like one single owner sitting in his or her office trying to solve all this on their own,” said Stephen Irvin, co-founder and CEO of Amicus Solar Cooperative, a purchasing co-op that shares best practices and pools the collective buying power of small companies like Cal Solar to reduce equipment costs.

Today, 22 of Amicus’ 85 member companies have some form of employee ownership. Irvin himself was a co-founder of Namaste Solar, an early worker-owned solar company in Boulder, Colorado. Other employee-owned solar companies include Technicians for Sustainability in Tucson, Arizona, and Positive Energy Solar in northern New Mexico.

The collective brainstorming Irvin speaks of was visible at Cal Solar’s company meeting this spring. “What do you envision for the future of our co-op?” Niblock asked her co-workers.

“My biggest thing is staying lean right now and not growing too fast,” de Necochea replied.

“I’m interested in working for low- to mid-class people,” Ortegren said later. “I would love to not work for rich people anymore.” Ortegren sees himself and his co-workers not just as electricians but as educators, explaining how to use solar efficiently and effectively.

“As a co-op, it’s our vision,” Niblock said. “We have to have imagination. We have to be the creators of our own destinies.”

The nuclear industry’s detractors have played down the potential for SMRs to prove a gamechanger for nuclear energy.","When millions of people across the Iberian peninsula were left without power last month the political fallout ignited debate over Europe’s renewable energy agenda, and fuelled the rising interest in nuclear power.

Europe’s largest power blackout in decades, still largely unexplained, has raised questions about whether renewable energy can be relied on to provide a stable source of clean energy. It has also fuelled a renewed interest in the global nuclear power renaissance already under way.

Despite long-held environmental concerns about nuclear power generation, political leaders across the globe are increasingly looking to lift restrictions on nuclear reactors or invest billions in new projects to keep pace with the fast-rising demand for low-carbon energy, which is expected to accelerate as AI datacentres grow.

In Spain, the blackout has intensified an ongoing debate over the government’s plans to phase out the country’s remaining seven nuclear reactors by 2035. Support for the low-carbon energy source has re-emerged hand-in-hand with criticism of renewable energy, and its potential role in the outage.

Spain’s power grid relied on renewable energy for about 70% of its power at the time of the blackout, which experts believe may have made it more difficult for the energy system operator to keep the grid’s frequency stable.

The suggestion was vehemently denied by Spain’s prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, in the country’s parliament. Just hours after the blackout he said: “There was no problem caused by an excess of renewable energy. Those who link this incident to the lack of nuclear energy are either lying or revealing their ignorance.”

But even before the Iberian peninsula was plunged into chaos, critics of the government’s anti-nuclear stance had raised their concerns. A few weeks before the blackout, the chair of the renewable energy company Iberdrola, which owns a small stake in the country’s nuclear fleet, warned Spain against plans to shut all seven of its nuclear power plants by 2035.

Ignacio Galán predicted that Spain could see its electricity prices jump by a quarter and get a less reliable system if Madrid followed the example of Germany, which began to close its nuclear reactors following the Fukushima nuclear disaster in 2011 and completed the phase-out in 2023.

Days later Sama Bilbao y León, director-general of the World Nuclear Association, told a conference in Madrid that she was “concerned about Spain’s economic future without nuclear energy” because its economic progress would rely on “abundant, clean, and affordable energy, available every day, all year round”.

In Germany the hardline stance against nuclear power is already softening. Chancellor Friedrich Merz, who came to power in February, has criticised the previous government for shutting Germany’s last three nuclear power stations in the midst of Europe’s energy cost crisis and promised to explore whether it is possible to resurrect the plants.

Merz is not expected to back a return to new conventional nuclear power projects in Germany but he has vowed to invest in new technologies: such as small modular reactors (SMRs) and nuclear fusion. The Swiss government has also said it will lift the country’s ban on the construction of new nuclear power projects, which has been in place since 1 January 2018, to pursue SMR projects.

The tide against nuclear power is turning in countries beyond Europe too. In Australia the new coalition government wasted little time in lifting the country’s ban on nuclear generators with a promise to commit $36.4bn in equity for two projects that it says could be operating by the mid 2030s – and $118.2bn for the seven projects it has promised by 2050.

Later this summer Taiwan is expected to vote on whether to restart a nuclear reactor which shut just last week amid concerns on the island about the rising electricity demand of some of the world’s biggest chipmakers which are based there, and about energy security in the event of a military blockade by China.

The concerns about a looming surge in power demand driven by tech giants and the desire for secure, homegrown low-carbon energy sources are common in countries across the globe. This trend is key to the renewed interest in nuclear power.

In the US, the notorious Three Mile Island site in Pennsylvania will restart for the first time in five years after its owners struck a 20-year deal to power Microsoft’s energy-hungry AI datacentres. Tech companies including Amazon, Meta and Apple are all expected to consume vast amounts of energy to power the boom in AI, and nuclear has emerged as an increasingly popular option given its steady stream of 24/7 power generation.

US President Donald Trump, who has taken aim at the Biden administration’s support for renewable energy, this month unveiled a series of executive orders aimed at delivering 10 large nuclear reactors by 2030, and quadrupling the country’s nuclear energy capacity by 2050. The move was welcomed by nuclear proponents as a step towards helping to lower emissions in the US while supporting Big Tech.

“Several big tech companies looking for low carbon, round-the-clock energy signed contracts for new nuclear capacity in the last year, and there could be more such deals ahead,” predicted the US investment bank Goldman Sachs earlier this year.

“The proliferation of AI data centers has boosted investor confidence in future growth in electricity demand at the same time as big tech companies are looking for low-carbon reliable energy. This is leading to the de-mothballing of recently retired nuclear generators, as well as consideration for new larger-scale reactors,” it added.

The growing demand for electricity may have piqued the interest of global government in nuclear power, but it is the breakthrough in new nuclear technologies which promises a new dawn for the industry. Whereas full-scale nuclear projects are notorious for spiralling budgets and delays, SMRs promise quicker, cheaper construction because the component parts can be built in a factory and assembled on site. But the technology has not been proven commercially.

Last year Google became the first company to ink an agreement to purchase nuclear energy from small modular reactors (SMRs), which are being developed by Kairos Power in the US. Small modular reactors are also being pursued by the US, South Korea, China, Russia, and Canada. The latter approved the construction of the first mini-nuclear reactor in the West earlier this month which is expected to begin operating by 2029.

In the UK, Keir Starmer unveiled plans for a historic expansion in nuclear power across England and Wales shortly after calling for tech companies to work alongside the government to build small modular reactors (SMRs) to power energy intensive AI datacentres across Britain. He said that he anticipated smaller reactors could begin operating in 2032 and become commonplace across Britain.

The nuclear industry’s detractors have played down the potential for SMRs to prove a gamechanger for nuclear energy. Dr Doug Parr, the chief scientist and a director at Greenpeace UK, said the Labour government had “swallowed nuclear industry spin whole, which is courageous – or stupid – given that not a single one has been built, and with the nuclear industry’s record of being over time and over budget unmatched by any other sector.”",https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/915e7e6a0aa77637bfde048486c43968640e9752/176_0_4520_3616/master/4520.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=2318dbeb1db340eae8fa3d811aa4a876,N,,2025-06-01 11:10:03.514118

In a press release, Phil Roos, director of the Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes, and Energy, announced the introduction of 18 electric school buses and 20 chargers for Dearborn Public Schools. This marks a monumental step for the state in the fight against climate change caused by the pollution from planet-warming gases as part of Gov. Gretchen Whitmer's MI Healthy Climate Plan.

Rather than relying on diesel-powered buses to transport children to school, these electric buses don't emit tailpipe pollution, saving them from breathing in harmful fumes that can lead to significant health risks like asthma and other respiratory issues. The vehicles also save the school district money on fuel, freeing up funds that can go toward other classroom resources.

""In less than three years, we've helped districts across Michigan deploy nearly 400 electric school buses — including these right here in Dearborn,"" Roos said in the release. ""We're moving from diesel-dominated fleets to cleaner, quieter, and more sustainable transportation — and we're doing it faster than ever.""

The introduction of electric school buses was made possible by support from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's Clean School Bus Program and Michigan's Clean Bus Energy Grant, which the release described as ""transformational."" It was also noted that partnerships across federal, state, and local levels facilitated this development, with support from the EPA and the Michigan Department of Education playing a key role.

""Electrifying school buses is more than a clean energy milestone,"" Roos said in the release. ""It's about protecting kids' health, investing in communities, and building a future where every child in Michigan can ride to school in a vehicle that's good for them and good for the planet.""

The move reflects the Trump administration’s shift in energy policy, which prioritizes maximizing oil and gas output while rolling back key aspects of Biden-era climate and clean energy policies.
Environmental groups and clean energy advocates have strongly criticized the cuts.
The canceled projects were part of the Office of Clean Energy Demonstrations’ efforts to test carbon capture and storage technologies at industrial sites.
Carbon capture projects aim to mitigate climate change by removing carbon dioxide from the air or from industrial emissions for long-term storage underground.","The U.S. Department of Energy announced Friday that it has canceled 24 green energy projects, totaling more than $3.7 billion in funding, that were issued during the Joe Biden administration.

The decision, which affects major carbon capture and clean technology initiatives, comes as the Donald Trump administration re-evaluates publicly funded awards and loans aimed at emerging technologies.

“While the previous administration failed to conduct a thorough financial review before signing away billions of taxpayer dollars, the Trump administration is doing our due diligence to ensure we are utilizing taxpayer dollars to strengthen our national security, bolster affordable, reliable energy sources and advance projects that generate the highest possible return on investment,” U.S. Secretary of Energy Chris Wright said.

Among the canceled projects is a $332 million carbon-cutting initiative at Exxon Mobil’s Baytown refinery complex in Texas, which aimed to reduce emissions by using hydrogen instead of natural gas to produce ethylene, a key component in plastics and textiles, Reuters news report said. Other major projects affected include a $500 million award to Heidelberg Materials in Louisiana and a $375 million award to Eastman Chemical Company in Longview, Texas.

Nearly 70 percent of the canceled awards had been signed between the November 5, 2024, election and January 20, 2025, Biden’s final day in office.

The move reflects the Trump administration’s shift in energy policy, which prioritizes maximizing oil and gas output while rolling back key aspects of Biden-era climate and clean energy policies. The administration has framed the decision as part of a broader effort to reassess government spending on emerging technologies.

Environmental groups and clean energy advocates have strongly criticized the cuts. Steven Nadel, executive director of the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy, called the decision “short-sighted” and warned it could stifle innovation.

“Locking domestic plants into outdated technology is not a recipe for future competitiveness or bringing manufacturing jobs back to American communities,” Nadel said.

The Center for Climate and Energy Solutions estimated that the termination of the projects could result in the loss of up to 25,000 jobs and a $4.6 billion hit to economic output.

The affected companies, including Exxon Mobil, Heidelberg Materials, and Eastman Chemical, have not yet responded to requests for comment.

The canceled projects were part of the Office of Clean Energy Demonstrations’ efforts to test carbon capture and storage technologies at industrial sites. Carbon capture projects aim to mitigate climate change by removing carbon dioxide from the air or from industrial emissions for long-term storage underground. In some cases, the captured CO₂ is injected into depleted oil fields to enhance crude production.

The cuts have fueled debate over the future of U.S. climate policy, as the country faces mounting pressure to reduce greenhouse gas emissions while maintaining energy security and industrial competitiveness.

That's why programs like net energy billing aim to help offset some of the financial burden, offering rewards for completing those projects.

However, the current formula for distributing these incentives has resulted in what some are calling overgenerous subsidiaries given to commercial solar companies.

Maine lawmakers are now looking to reform the program.

This week, a bipartisan bill to rein in the net energy billing formula received majority support by the state's Energy, Utilities, and Technology Committee. LD 1777 calls for a tier system of net energy billing, where smaller community-based projects get more financial support than bigger ones.

Backers of the legislation see it as a modest reform that helps smaller community solar projects while maintaining the integrity of the program.

Commercial solar advocates and lobbyists, on the other hand, argue the bill will harm renewable energy companies in the state.

The Coalition for Community Solar Access bills itself as a national trade association that represents dozens of community solar companies, businesses, and nonprofits ""working to expand customer choice and access to solar for all American households and businesses through community solar,"" according to its website.

CCSA penned a letter this week urging Maine lawmakers to oppose the bill, calling it a ""backwards-looking rollback of the state's clean energy leadership that threatens to dismantle a successful market and set a dangerous precedent for the region.""

Kate Daniel, Northeast Regional Director for the CCSA, spoke with NEWS CENTER Maine about concerns the organization has about the bill going forward.

""To have that rug pulled out from them at this stage is likely to cause some very concerning impacts, and that is ultimately at the heart of our concerns,"" Daniel said.

Rep. Sophia Warren, D-Scarborough, serves on the state's Environment, Utilities, and Technology Committee and described some of the considerations lawmakers have been exploring in the committee.

Georgia Power attorneys say the company’s forecast continues to grow based on the state’s economic projections for commercial and industrial customers.
The staff is recommending Georgia Power decrease its load growth projections for data centers by as much as 25%.
However, the three days of hearings began with public comments expressing split reactions to Georgia Power and its energy plans.
Craig told commissioners that he felt the company’s energy plan provides the necessary infrastructure to continue providing reliable electricity to businesses.","The state’s largest electric utility says it needs to significantly increase its energy capacity to accommodate a potential wave of data centers.

Georgia Power plans to turn to some renewable energy to generate that electricity, but for the most part, the utility intends to lean on fossil fuel sources like gas-fired power plants to boost capacity.

Those controversial plans, packed into what’s called an integrated resource plan, received a public airing during three days of public hearings. Several clean energy advocacy groups and state regulator staffers urged members of the Georgia Public Service Commission to reject the plan.

Commissioners are set to vote on the proposal in July.

Data centers fuel growth forecasts

Georgia Power projects that over the next several years the growth of data centers will significantly increase the state’s electricity consumption, and the company is requesting to add about 9,000 megawatts of capacity by 2031. According to the utility’s forecasts, data centers will consume about 80% of the new power generated.

But some have questioned the accuracy of those projections.

PSC staff expert witnesses said this week they are concerned Georgia Power is using incorrect model forecasts. They also say the utility has not provided evidence showing that data centers are likely to materialize at a higher rate than other industries.

Georgia Power attorneys say the company’s forecast continues to grow based on the state’s economic projections for commercial and industrial customers.

PSC staff questioned the models used by the company that led to forecasting as much as 13,000 megawatts of peak load growth through 2044. The staff is recommending Georgia Power decrease its load growth projections for data centers by as much as 25%.

“Our recommendation is to adjust down Georgia Power’s load forecast,” said Robert Trokey, director of the Public Service Commission’s electric unit. “I think it’s important that they continue to file the data that they have been filing in quarterly reports. If we see trends continue over the short term as the projects roll out, then certainly Georgia Power should adjust its forecast methodologies.”

Advocacy groups have argued that overbuilding the infrastructure could shift the cost burden to ratepayers.

Public Service Commissioner Tricia Pridemore pushed back on the criticism, pointing to a recent rule change that requires data centers and other large companies consuming more than 100 megawatts of energy to cover their full electricity costs.

The change included a provision allowing Georgia Power to require companies to put up front-end collateral for energy costs over the lifetime of the contract. State regulators would also review any contract for high-energy users.

Clean energy versus fossil fuels

Georgia Power has come under fire for reversing plans to shutter a pair of coal plants, Bowen and Scherer. The company instead is asking that state regulators sign off on extending the life of the two plants and allow the company to ramp up its fossil fuel energy capacity.

The utility had planned to retire Bowen and Scherer by 2028. Since then, Georgia Power has cited the projected industrial growth boom primarily driven by massive data centers as a reason it is now planning to retire Bowen by 2035 and Scherer Unit 3 by 2038.

Energy experts and clean energy advocates expressed concerns about the company’s potential overestimation of electricity demand and the underestimation of gas-fired unit costs, which could lead to higher rates.

They recommended increasing planning flexibility, updating load forecasts, and exploring earlier deployment of renewables and energy storage. Their analysis compared different scenarios, showing that renewables and energy storage are more economical under various future conditions.

Critics of the plan advised the commission to require Georgia Power to present additional research portfolios and improve forecast accuracy. The company was also urged to further increase its investments in renewable energies like solar.

Energy consultant Maria Roumpani, who testified on behalf of the Georgia Conservation Voters, said that renewable energy and storage are much more economically viable than the expansion of gas-fired power plants.

“The analysis should focus on enabling earlier years of deployment for wind and energy storage, especially medium and low duration, as well as higher limits for solar,” she said.

Public, protestors weigh in

Clean energy and consumer advocates held a rally outside the PSC’s downtown offices while the hearing was underway Tuesday, warning of the potential consequences if the commission rubber-stamps Georgia Power’s long-term energy plans.

The five-member utility regulator is set to vote July 15.

Hundreds of written comments poured into the PSC, many of them dominated by concerns about rising utility bills and health risks tied to fossil fuels.

However, the three days of hearings began with public comments expressing split reactions to Georgia Power and its energy plans.

The long-term energy generation plan is receiving support from the Georgia Chamber of Commerce and local chamber officials such as Timothy Craig, director of business development of Valdosta-Lowndes County Chamber of Commerce.

Craig told commissioners that he felt the company’s energy plan provides the necessary infrastructure to continue providing reliable electricity to businesses.

“One of the first questions small business owners want to ask is: can I count on the systems that support my business?” Craig said this week. “Energy is at the top of that list. Whether it’s a local bakery or high tech firm, reliable energy is essential. Georgia Power’s plan delivers that reliability.”

Retired educator Bette Holland, founder of North Georgia Conservation Coalition, said it’s important that state regulators accept the science that shows that burning coal, oil and natural gas detrimentally increases the earth’s temperature.

“Solar and wind are much cheaper than fossil fuels to create energy,” Holland said. “The only thing that stops us are the energy companies and regulators who bow to the pressure of the fossil fuel companies. Please begin to think about the survival of the people in Georgia, in this country, on this planet, and about the survival of our natural resources in our wildlife.”",https://georgiarecorder.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/IMG_2696-2048x1365.jpeg,N,,2025-06-01 11:10:19.081140

“Congrats to Representative Zeldin on his nomination to be the 17th EPA administrator,” said Andrew Wheeler, an EPA administrator under Trump in his first term as president.","Long Islander Lee Zeldin was thrust into the national spotlight with his nomination by President Donald Trump to be administrator of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).

Trump said: “I have known Lee Zeldin for a long time, and have watched him handle, brilliantly, some extremely difficult and complex situations. I am very proud to have him in the Trump Administration, where he will quickly prove to be a great contributor.”

However, Zeldin, a former member of Congress representing a district including eastern Long Island, has faced stiff criticism, beginning with his nomination, that has continued.

“Unqualified,” declared Ben Jealous, executive director of the Sierra Club, the nation’s largest environmental organization, upon the Zeldin nomination.

It “lays bare Donald Trump’s intentions to, once again, sell our health, our communities, our jobs and future out to corporate polluters,” he said. “Our lives, our livelihoods, and our collective future cannot afford Lee Zeldin — or anyone who seeks to carry out a mission antithetical to the EPA’s mission.”

The League of Conservation Voters, in a letter to members of the Senate signed by its president, Gene Karpinski, called on it to reject the nomination. Cited was the organization’s “National Environmental Scorecard which details the voting records of members of Congress on environmental legislation,” on which “Zeldin’s abysmal 14% lifetime score …. [renders] him unqualified for the role.”

“Trump Picks New EPA Head Guaranteed to Destroy the Environment,” was the headline in The New Republic. The subhead on its article: “This will be a disaster.”

“Meet the ‘great deregulator’ Trump chose to lead EPA,” was the headline of the E&E website of Politico.

The headline of the New York Metropolitan Area news website Hell Gate said: “Lee Zeldin Appointed to Oversee Climate Collapse.” The subhead: “Trump choosing a Long Island lackey as EPA administrator.”

There were some hoorays for the nomination. “Congrats to Representative Zeldin on his nomination to be the 17th EPA administrator,” said Andrew Wheeler, an EPA administrator under Trump in his first term as president. Prior to that, he was a lobbyist for major coal, chemical and uranium companies.

And Elon Musk said of Zeldin’s nomination: “I know he will do a great job tackling the regulatory overreach while protecting our air and water.”

Zeldin has been a close ally of Trump. In 2021, he was among Republican members of the House who voted against certifying the results of the 2020 election, which Trump said he won. Also, Zeldin was a leader in defending Trump during Trump’s first impeachment hearings.

With Zeldin in office as EPA administrator, Sierra, the magazine of the Sierra Club, ran an article speaking of “axing programs and funding intended to address pollution and advance clean energy.”

“At the EPA, there has been an exodus of employees, a freeze on funding disbursement — including funds already authorized by Congress — as well as a dismissal of scientific advisory boards and a removal of climate change references from the agency’s website,” it reads.

In April, Zeldin, a Shirley resident, faced 100 protesters when he came to the Crest Hollow Country Club in Westbury to speak at an event hosted by the Long Island Association.

The demonstration was organized by Food & Water Watch and the Long Island Progressive Coalition. At it, Eric Weltman, New York senior organizer at Food & Water Watch, said “New Yorkers deserve an EPA that protects our health and environment, not one that does the bidding of corporate polluters.”

In May, there was sharp criticism of Zeldin after he announced the EPA was dropping federal limits on four “forever chemicals” in drinking water. The weakening of the rules is “a betrayal of public trust,” charged Adriene Esposito, executive director of Citizens Campaign for the Environment based in Farmingdale. It “adds a significant threat to public health,” she said.

Still, Zeldin remains supported by nearly all Republican members of Congress. At a hearing in May of the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works at which he appeared, its chair, Senator Shelley Capito, a Republican from West Virginia, opened it by telling Zeldin, “I applaud your aggressive efforts to undo the previous administration’s regulatory overreach.”

But at the same hearing, Senator Adam Schiff, a California Democrat, told Zeldin: “I want to be very specific about the legacy you’re going to leave …. more cancer.”",https://www.longislandpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/2018-05-22T160115Z_1564032435_HP1EE5M18I32M_RTRMADP_3_USA-TRUMP-RUSSIA-1.webp?w=1200&p=q,N,,2025-06-01 10:06:48.073056

Tagged “Empowering Future Leaders in Renewable Energy,” the NextGen RESCO programme is the first of its kind in Nigeria.
Aliyu explained that the programme responds directly to a critical labour shortage in Nigeria’s renewable energy sector.
“Currently, Nigeria has around 70,000 jobs in renewable energy, but with our population and energy needs, we should be producing five times that number,” he said.
He further noted that Africa, in general, accounts for only 320,000 renewable energy jobs, underscoring the urgency of building a sustainable workforce pipeline on the continent.","The Rural Electrification Agency (REA) has secured 130 paid energy jobs for young Nigerian graduates under its newly launched NextGen Renewable Energy Service Company (RESCO) programme. The initiative, which officially kicked off this month, aims to create a clear pathway from training to employment for aspiring professionals in the country’s fast-growing clean energy sector.

Tagged “Empowering Future Leaders in Renewable Energy,” the NextGen RESCO programme is the first of its kind in Nigeria. It is a collaborative effort between REA, the National Power Training Institute of Nigeria (NAPTIN), and the Eco-Innovation Empowerment Initiative. According to REA, the programme is designed to train, mentor, and place talented youth in paid internships and jobs across the country within a 12-month cycle. “We are not just training people, we are launching careers,” said REA’s Managing Director and CEO, Engr. Abba Aliyu, during the programme’s unveiling in Abuja.

Aliyu explained that the programme responds directly to a critical labour shortage in Nigeria’s renewable energy sector. “Currently, Nigeria has around 70,000 jobs in renewable energy, but with our population and energy needs, we should be producing five times that number,” he said. He further noted that Africa, in general, accounts for only 320,000 renewable energy jobs, underscoring the urgency of building a sustainable workforce pipeline on the continent.

Speaking to journalists, Aliyu said, “This programme is not only about creating 130 jobs. It is about building a national talent pipeline that will produce 10,000 energy professionals in the coming years. The gap between theory and hands-on skills is costing us, and we are here to close that gap.” According to him, the pilot programme last year placed 120 graduates across the six geopolitical zones and laid the foundation for the current expansion.

The NextGen RESCO initiative places greater emphasis on technical capacity than academic pedigree. “A degree is important, yes, but what this sector needs are people who can wire a solar mini-grid, calibrate inverters, and maintain battery systems,” Aliyu said. He added that the programme includes three months of classroom training, one month of internship with Renewable Energy Service Companies (RESCOs), and nine months of paid work placements.

Ahmed Nagode, Director-General of NAPTIN, echoed Aliyu’s sentiments. “Only 50 percent of the skilled workforce needed to sustain Nigeria’s power sector is currently available,” Nagode revealed. “Our graduates have knowledge, but many lack industry-grade technical skills. This programme is our answer to that crisis.” He also warned of the consequences of inaction, pointing to deteriorating solar infrastructure in the capital. “Streetlights powered by solar energy in Abuja may fail in the next five years if not maintained by skilled professionals,” he said.

A press release from REA further emphasized that the programme’s curriculum includes training in solar PV installation, mini-grid design, energy efficiency audits, and PV system supervision. “We are developing not just workers, but professionals who can innovate, manage systems, and lead projects,” the statement read. REA also confirmed that application is now open to qualified Nigerians nationwide.

Participants will benefit from paid internships and guaranteed jobs secured through partnerships with private RESCOs. According to REA, top-performing trainees will transition into nine-month, fully paid roles in the renewable energy sector. “These are not vague promises—these are signed agreements with our partners,” Aliyu stated.

By investing in skills and job placements, REA hopes to anchor Nigeria’s clean energy transition in local expertise. “We want to ensure that the people powering Nigeria’s energy future are young, homegrown talents who understand the terrain and the technology,” said Aliyu. With this initiative, the government aims not only to tackle unemployment but also to lay the groundwork for a sustainable, resilient energy system.",https://i0.wp.com/thenigeriaeducationnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/1000157294-1.jpg?fit=2880%2C1620&ssl=1,N,,2025-06-01 12:14:40.788731

Starting with this race, Toyota will take on the challenge of utilizing technology that automatically switches between stoichiometric combustion, which delivers high output, and lean combustion, which enables fuel-efficient driving, in response to the driver’s output requirements (accelerator operation).

Until now, Toyota has continued to improve stoichiometric combustion to achieve high output equivalent to that of gasoline.

From this race onwards, Toyota will take on the challenge of utilizing technology that smoothly switches to lean combustion when high output is not required with a view to applying it to the development of future production vehicles.

Developing a new filling valve that improves hydrogen filling speed and safety while making the vehicle compact and lightweight. Toyota has adopted a new structure for the filling valve used during hydrogen supply.

To date, valve opening and closing have been operated by an external actuator. However, in addition to limitations in expanding the flow path area during hydrogen supply, there have been challenges with improving airtightness in a -253 °C environment.

For this race, adopting a new internal piston structure has enabled an increase in flow path area, improving filling speed by approximately 30%. The new structure also eliminates the need for an external actuator, reducing weight by 2 kg. Furthermore, eliminating external opening and closing processes has improved airtightness and reduced the risk of hydrogen leakage.

Reducing vehicle weight through partial use of aluminum wiring for wire harnesses. A portion of the wire harnesses―bundles of wires distributed throughout the vehicle for power supply and signal transmission―has been changed from copper to aluminum wiring. Until now, corrosion caused by water exposure at terminal connections and other areas has posed a challenge in using aluminum wiring for wire harnesses.

For this race, adopting a sealed-structure terminal (Alpha terminal) using fiber laser welding technology developed by Furukawa Electric Co., Ltd. has made it possible to prevent water infiltration without compromising mass-producibility and cost competitiveness, thereby preventing corrosion, which had been an issue.

This change has also resulted in an 18% weight reduction compared to conventional wire harnesses.",https://bioage.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4fbe53ef02e8610271e4200d-600wi,N,,2025-06-01 12:14:57.657548

“From satellite skies to solar campuses, and from mechanized farms to biotech labs—Nigeria is rising, and it is powered by innovation.”","By Ikechukwu Emmanuel

Chief Uche Geoffrey Nnaji, Minister of Innovation, Science and Technology, has applauded President Bola Ahmed Tinubu, for steering Nigeria into a new era of science-driven, innovation-led development within the past two years.

In a statement signed by his Senior Special Adviser (Administration), Dr. Robert Ngwu, the Minister described the Tinubu administration as a “powerhouse of progress,” citing milestone achievements across clean energy, digital innovation, healthcare, security, agriculture, and job creation.

One of the administration’s flagship initiatives is the Renewed Hope Solarisation Project—a first-of-its-kind energy gift to Nigeria’s tertiary institutions and federal teaching hospitals. Under this initiative, each of the 36 states and the FCT will receive a 2MW solar hybrid power system, targeting one federal university and one federal teaching hospital per state.

“This pilot phase offers eco-friendly, reliable electricity to institutions long burdened by erratic power and rising utility costs,” Nnaji stated. “It is a beacon of hope and a foundation for national rollout.”

The Ministry is also advancing the Sustainable Energy Access Project (SEAP)—a nationwide clean energy and clean cooking initiative covering all 774 local governments. Full-scale implementation is projected to create nearly one million jobs, with a strong focus on youth, women, and artisans—echoing the Renewed Hope Agenda’s commitment to inclusive development.

In the domain of space technology, President Tinubu approved the launch of four new satellites—NigeriaSat-3, Sat-4, Sat-5, and NigeriaSAR-1—under the National Space Research and Development Agency (NASRDA). These assets will bolster national security, disaster response, border surveillance, agriculture, and geospatial land administration.

Another milestone is the formulation and national validation of Nigeria’s first Cleantech Innovation Policy, developed through the National Cleantech Innovation Programme (NCIP) with support from international partners. The policy aims to fast-track Nigeria’s green industrial revolution, climate resilience, and economic diversification. Its full implementation is expected to generate over 500,000 direct and indirect jobs in sectors such as agritech, renewable energy, circular economy, green transportation, and smart manufacturing.

Special emphasis is placed on empowering women, youth, and persons with disabilities, through inclusive funding, training platforms, and national mentorship schemes.

To reduce Nigeria’s overreliance on raw material exports and curb the costly dependence on imported finished goods, the Federal Ministry of Innovation, Science and Technology, through RMRDC, has proposed the 30% Minimum Value-Addition Bill. This pioneering legislation mandates that at least 30% of local value must be added to raw materials before they are exported or utilized in industrial production.

In a predominantly import-driven economy, the bill is a strategic policy shift designed to stimulate domestic manufacturing, enhance export earnings through value-added goods, and create widespread employment across key sectors such as agro-processing, extractives, and light industry. It also seeks to strengthen supply chain resilience, foster SME growth, and reduce vulnerability to global market shocks. By anchoring industrial progress on local capacity and innovation, the bill aligns with President Tinubu’s Renewed Hope Agenda and reinforces Nigeria’s path to economic self-reliance and competitiveness.

As part of the Ministry’s industrialization strategy, the revival and optimization of the cassava value chain has become a strategic national priority. Leveraging Nigeria’s comparative advantage as one of the world’s largest producers of cassava, the Ministry is facilitating the deployment of mechanized and semi-automated processing systems to enhance value addition, reduce post-harvest losses, and create high-impact jobs across rural communities.

A central component of this initiative is the extraction and industrial utilization of high-grade starch from cassava (HGCS), which serves as a versatile industrial raw material with a wide array of downstream applications spanning multiple sectors like food and beverage (Glucose syrup, sweeteners, baking ingredients, modified starch), pharmaceuticals and nutraceuticals (Tablet binding, dietary supplements and excipients, medical-grade glucose and dextrose), industrial and chemical manufacturing (Adhesives and glues, Biodegradable plastics and packaging materials, Paper sizing and coating agents, Textile finishing agents, Ethanol and industrial alcohol production), cosmetics and personal care (Starch-based baby powders, Organic thickeners and skin-conditioning agents), and agriculture and animal feed (Livestock feed concentrates, Binders in fish and poultry feed, Biofertilizer components).

By fostering the development of these value chain products, the Ministry is unlocking significant opportunities for import substitution, export diversification, and rural industrialization. This intervention aligns strongly with President Tinubu’s Renewed Hope Agenda and is poised to transform cassava from a subsistence crop into a strategic industrial commodity driving national prosperity.

Similarly, a €7.9 billion Green and Blue Methanol Industrial Complex is in the works to deliver decarbonization in blue economy, and low-carbon fuels, reinforcing Nigeria’s leadership in Africa’s clean energy transition.

In line with the clarion call of President Tinubu, GCFRlllllll, the Ministry has made a significant push toward research commercialization, with industrial-scale fabrication of agro-processing equipment—crushers, mixers, dryers, stoves, ovens—aimed at improving food security and reducing post-harvest losses. These machines are now being deployed in semi-automated production lines for palm oil, cassava, plantain, soybean, vegetable oil, etc.

One of the country’s most notable health breakthroughs is the development and field-testing of Nigeria’s first Artemisinin Extraction Plant, which extracts the active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) from domesticated Artemisia annua—a game-changing innovation in the fight against malaria.

The National Research and Innovation Fund (NRIF), which is currently being finalized will empower scientists to commercialize their findings, with a pipeline of over 1000 patents expected annually. These outcomes position Nigeria as a knowledge economy anchored on innovation, not just consumption.

President Tinubu also established an Inter-Ministerial Innovation Committee, chaired by the Vice President, to align innovation and job creation targets across all MDAs. With support from the Nigeria Bureau of Statistics Nigeria now tracks metrics such as job creation, emissions reduction, and gender participation using real-time dashboards.

Under Tinubu’s strategic foreign policy, the Ministry has secured new partnerships with UNDP, UNESCO, the Commonwealth Secretariat, and the African Development Bank, boosting investment flows into Nigeria’s innovation ecosystem.

“Thank you, Mr. President,” Nnaji concluded. “From satellite skies to solar campuses, and from mechanized farms to biotech labs—Nigeria is rising, and it is powered by innovation.”",https://global.ariseplay.com/amg/www.thisdaylive.com/uploads/Uche-Geoffrey-Nnaji.jpg,N,,2025-06-01 11:10:27.891518

Most of Indiana's new battery storage comes from AES Indiana's new 200 megawatt facility at its Petersburg Generating Station in Pike County.

These stand-alone batteries allow utilities to buy energy off the grid when it's cheap and store it for their customers or sell it back to the grid. Because that could be any combination of wind, solar, gas and coal — it's hard to say if the energy stored is particularly green.

“The legislation would ensure that Massachusetts stays on track to reduce emissions from transportation – the sector that accounts for the greatest share of emissions in the Commonwealth,” according to a bill summary.
Last week, conspiracy theorist Alex Jones posted about the bill on X, which was subsequently removed from the social media platform.
“I do worry about an unintended and subtle bias against rural Massachusetts,” Barrett said at the hearing on the bill.
Massachusetts’ clean energy and climate plan lacks “clear, measurable guidelines or targets” to reduce miles driven, Gadbois said at the legislative hearing.","A bill pending on Beacon Hill that looks to set a statewide vehicle miles traveled reduction goal as part of the decarbonization push has ignited national backlash, with critics calling it governmental overreach.

Under the so-called Freedom to Move Act, an interagency coordinating council would be tasked with crafting a “whole-of-government plan” to reduce reliance on personal vehicles and increase access to public transportation in the Bay State.

“The legislation would ensure that Massachusetts stays on track to reduce emissions from transportation – the sector that accounts for the greatest share of emissions in the Commonwealth,” according to a bill summary.

Senate Majority Leader Cindy Creem, a Newton Democrat, is leading the push to shift the Bay State away from relying “too heavily” on electric vehicles as a “decarbonizing strategy.”

“With the Trump administration rolling back vehicle emission standards and withholding funds from EV charging programs,” Creem said during a legislative hearing in mid-May, “and with congressional Republicans looking to repeal EV tax credits and derail state-level EV rules, now is the time to pursue new strategies, additional strategies.”

“Setting specific goals for reducing vehicle miles traveled would help guide decisions made across state government,” she added, “and sharpen the focus of efforts to promote alternative modes of transportation like public transit, biking, walking.”

A clip of Creem’s tesimony has gone viral in the weeks following the Joint Committee on Telecommunications, Utilities and Energy’s hearing on May 14.

Last week, conspiracy theorist Alex Jones posted about the bill on X, which was subsequently removed from the social media platform. Fox News’ ‘The Faulkner Focus’ also featured it in a segment titled “Democrats divided over how to move forward,” last Tuesday.

In the segment, anchor Harris Faulkner interviewed conservative political commentator Michael Knowles, who noted a survey that MassInc conducted last year showing that 70% of respondents “felt unsafe on public transit in the Greater Boston area.”

“People want to be safe,” Knowles said. “You need to give people some kind of option to vote for you. As Democrats are struggling with being viewed as so out of touch, I don’t think this lady in Massachusetts is going to help.”

State Rep. Mike Connolly, a Cambridge Democrat, is one of the bill’s eight co-sponsors. He told the Herald on Saturday that he believes the way the bill is being portrayed is “completely overblown and ignorant.”

“This legislation doesn’t attempt to set some specific limit or establish any kind of prescriptive formula to punish individual drivers, as the right-wing reporting on this seemed to imply,” Connolly said. “All it really does is say that we should put the structures in place to consider and refine our policies around vehicle miles traveled.”

The bill’s summary states that MassDOT’s transportation plans must “provide a reasonable pathway to compliance with our emissions limits for the transportation sector.” If those reductions aren’t met, the agency would have to make a “greater investment in public transit, bike and pedestrian infrastructure, or other clean transportation options.”

Regional planning organizations and MassDOT would also be required to approve only projects with “a reasonable pathway to compliance with the greenhouse gas emissions sublimits … and the statewide vehicle miles traveled reduction goals.”

Massachusetts Fiscal Alliance, a watchdog group, thrust the bill into the national spotlight, with a May 23 post garnering nearly 350,000 views on X and being multiplied further by prominent conservative accounts.

Organization spokesman Paul Diego Craney says the legislation would be “incredibly damaging to the state economy and restrict transportation for countless residents.”

“Massachusetts lawmakers need to reverse course on the state’s mandate to hit net-zero by 2050,” Craney told the Herald on Saturday, “which is driving these lawmakers to propose some extreme pieces of legislation … Net-zero is nothing more than a fantasy.”

The interagency coordinating council would be created through the legislation, consisting of 15 state officials.

The group would assess and report on strategies “necessary to reduce statewide vehicles miles traveled through the establishment of an equitable, interconnected, accessible and reliable network of non-personal vehicle transportation options and through land use policies that reduce the need for personal vehicles,” according to the bill.

Sen. Michael Barrett, a Lexington Democrat who chairs the Joint Committee on Telecommunications, Utilities and Energy, has raised concerns that the bill may not be practical in all parts of the Commonwealth.

“I do worry about an unintended and subtle bias against rural Massachusetts,” Barrett said at the hearing on the bill. He added it raises the “question of what someone is to do in a place where one has to travel a long distance” to work.

A statewide coalition of environmental organizations reported last December that transportation represents “37% of total emissions statewide, and it is one of the sectors where we have made the least progress toward our statutory Clean Energy and Climate Plan goals.”

One of the targets in that plan is for there to be “200,000 zero-emission vehicles on the road by 2025,” but the Bay State was “below half that total” at end of last year, according to the coalition.

State data shows that “light-duty vehicles” traveled 57,191 million miles in 2023, a figure projected to grow to “about 59,100 million in 2030.”

Seth Gadbois, a clean transportation staff attorney at the Conservation Law Foundation, highlighted that the bill is based on laws in Minnesota and Colorado, which redirected funding away from highway projects towards bus corridors.

Massachusetts’ clean energy and climate plan lacks “clear, measurable guidelines or targets” to reduce miles driven, Gadbois said at the legislative hearing.

“This absence leads to disparate and uncoordinated efforts to give people more options for how to get around,” he said, “all while miles driven by car and emissions continue to increase year over year.”

New Bedford resident Elijah DeSousa, founder of the energy advocacy group Citizens Against Eversource, told the Herald on Saturday that he believes the bill is not “just another climate proposal,” but a “blueprint for behavioral control disguised as environmental policy.”

“I refuse to quietly surrender the most fundamental right we have as citizens: the right to move freely, without needing permission from unelected councils or state-issued metrics,” he said.",https://www.bostonherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/0624-NWS-BHR-L-traffic-cc01.jpg?w=1024&h=768,N,,2025-06-01 06:01:22.146389

India, a major carbon emitter, is aggressively expanding its clean energy sector, with solar power becoming increasingly cost-effective. While coal still dominates electricity generation, renewable energy capacity is rapidly growing, driven by government policies and private investments. Challenges remain in optimizing renewable energy use and building necessary infrastructure to meet the nation's soaring energy demands and climate goals.

One of the most carbon-polluting countries, India is also making huge efforts to harness the power of the sun, wind and other clean energy sources. Most of the electricity in India, the world's most populous nation, still comes from coal, one of the dirtiest forms of energy. But coal's dominance is dropping, going from 60% of installed power capacity 11 years ago to less than 50% today, according to India's power ministry.

At the same time, India had its largest ever addition of clean power in the fiscal year between April 2024 and April of this year, adding 30 gigawatts - enough to power nearly 18 million Indian homes.

With a growing middle class and skyrocketing energy needs, how fast India can move away from coal and other fossil fuels, such as gasoline and oil, could have a large impact on global efforts to confront climate change.

Here is a snapshot of India's clean energy transition and some of the challenges.

Renewable energy is now the most economical option Solar is now half the cost of power from new coal-powered plants. Availability of cheap components and many sunny days each year in India are some reasons experts say installed solar power increased 30 times in the last decade.

Live Events

""Solar power is the cheapest it's ever been,"" said Ruchita Shah, an energy analyst at climate think-tank Ember. Shah added that dropping costs for energy storage, in the form of batteries, means that renewable power will be the ""new normal,"" even when the sun doesn't shine or the wind doesn't blow.

India has nearly 170 gigawatts of renewable energy projects in the pipeline, which are expected to be completed in the next few years.

""I have no doubt that India will reach its target of 500 gigawatts by 2030,"" said Raghav Pachouri, an energy expert at Vasudha Foundation, a New Delhi-based think-tank.

Government policies and private investments push renewables Experts say the growth in renewables is being spurred by India's plans to add approximately 50 gigawatts of non-fossil fuel power capacity every year for the next five years and for clean power to provide 50% of the nation's energy by the decade. When burned, fossil fuels let off greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide, the main driver of climate change.

A 2022 law that made electricity cheaper for companies choosing to buy clean power, the federal government's recommendation that state utilities buy more renewable power and a 2023 government plan to invest $452 million have all catalyzed investments in renewables.

India has the fourth highest amount of clean power installed in the world and government officials said $81 billion has been invested in the renewable energy sector in the last decade. Multiple large-scale renewable power projects have begun operations or are under construction, including one of the world's largest wind and solar power farms.

""We've seen domestic manufacturing capacity, at least when it comes to modules for solar panels, increasing,"" said Madhura Joshi, a senior energy analyst at the European think-tank E3G.

Still, renewables are underutilized Despite the rapid growth, challenges persist. While non-fossil fuel sources now comprise 45% of India's total installed capacity, their share in actual electricity generation stood at 24% last year. Coal remains the dominant source, accounting for 75% of electricity generation.

The share of solar, wind, small hydro power and biomass in India's electricity generation mix stood at 12%, double what it was in 2014 but still lower than expectations by this time, according to a report by New Delhi-based think-tank, the Centre for Science and Environment.

Installed capacity is growing, but power generation from renewables needs to be optimized and integrated effectively into the grid, the report found.

At a clean energy crossroads A recent report by the nonprofit clean energy think-tank, RMI, found that electricity demand is expected to triple by 2050 - driven by more electric vehicles, air conditioners and industrial growth.

Acquiring land for clean energy projects remains a challenge. India also needs to rapidly build robust electricity transmission infrastructure and energy storage facilities to continue increasing clean power capacity.

""India is expected to become the world's third-largest economy in a few years, and I think we will need to adopt renewable energy to do this. There is no option for us because fossil fuels can't keep pace"" with energy needs, said Deepak Thakur, chief executive officer of Mumbai-based renewable energy company, Mahindra Susten.

“We are a top 10 state in the nation in the number of clean energy jobs, more than 100,000 workers in the clean energy sector.
Unfortunately, some in Congress want to slow our growth,” Stein said, referring to the gutting of clean energy tax credits in the huge U.S. House bill passed this month.
Talking to reporters after his speech, Stein said he’s told North Carolinian members of Congress about “the urgency that we keep those tax credits.” “Here’s the thing.
Many of them have made major business decisions about investing in North Carolina.","In May, Gov. Josh Stein announced several businesses coming to North Carolina.

In Charlotte, it was AVL Manufacturing, promising to build a new production facility resulting in 325 new jobs.

In Holly Springs, it was biotechnology company Genentech, announcing plans to build a new manufacturing plant with 420 jobs.

In Goldsboro, it was transformer manufacturer Prolec-GE Waukesha, also with a new manufacturing plant, and 330 jobs.

Those are just three of a slew of businesses coming to the state this year.

So it was no surprise that when Stein delivered a speech at the Emerging Issues Forum on energy at N.C. State University this week, the subject went beyond policy to talk about the economy and business.

Good morning and welcome to the Sunday Under the Dome newsletter, which focuses on the governor. I’m Capitol Bureau Chief Dawn Vaughan.

In his speech at N.C. State on Wednesday, Stein said that while the state has more work ahead to reduce pollution and have a clean tech economy, “in many ways, the market demands that we do.”

“Nearly half of the leading companies in the world have a net zero emissions target. Many of these companies want to call North Carolina home. In fact, many of them already do: Amazon, Google, Meta, Toyota, Honeywell. When these companies decided where to invest, they were looking for a strong workforce, a favorable business environment, an excellent quality of life and places where they could get inexpensive, clean and reliable electricity,” Stein said.

He talked about another one of his economic development announcements, held in April in Greenville, when Boviet Solar opened a new solar module factory.

“Boviet is a powerful addition to our supply chain that includes a roster of 220 solar companies that are helping to provide more low-carbon energy sources,” Commerce Secretary Lee Lilley said at the time.

“They have already hired 400 employees, nearly, and they’re going to keep hiring. If things progress as they fully expect, when they get to phase two, that number should increase to over 1,000 employees, making them one of the largest private sector employers in the county of Pitt,” Stein said in his energy speech this past week.

“We are a top 10 state in the nation in the number of clean energy jobs, more than 100,000 workers in the clean energy sector. Unfortunately, some in Congress want to slow our growth,” Stein said, referring to the gutting of clean energy tax credits in the huge U.S. House bill passed this month.

Talking to reporters after his speech, Stein said he’s told North Carolinian members of Congress about “the urgency that we keep those tax credits.”

“Here’s the thing. Companies make investments based on policy, and there has to be certainty, there has to be settled expectations, or else they do not know how to invest,” he said.

“They were told that these credits existed. Many of them have made major business decisions about investing in North Carolina. We’ve got to preserve those credits so that the companies get the bargain that they struck.”

But one important aspect of taxation has been largely ignored: tax credits.

Tax credits were included in the Inflation Reduction Act from the Biden administration and, along with discounts on the purchase and installation of energy-efficient electric appliances, vehicles, solar systems and more, have allowed great progress toward a more sustainable energy economy in addition to creating jobs and investment in new industries, as well as benefiting Americans who took advantage of them.

A national poll conducted by Yale University’s Communication Program on Climate Change found that 63% of Nevadans are worried about climate change, identical to the national average. That number was 1% higher in Clark County, and 6% higher in Washoe County. This is significant in a state that has the two fastest-warming cities in the country, Reno and Las Vegas.

Most people likely understand that the driving force behind the worsening climate is the burning of fossil fuels. Giving people concrete steps they can take really activates them. And tax credits have done just that. Many have embraced the opportunity to replace their fossil fuel cars and appliances with those that utilize sustainable electric energy; these purchases of replacements have been amplified by the discounts and tax credits available to them, usually up to 30% or more.

The additional benefit of tax credits is the energy savings; more money in people’s pockets because their energy bills are lower. This has a direct impact on the economy in two ways: Americans have more money to spend on other things, and there are more jobs created for industries that provide the new appliances, cars, solar systems and more. Indeed, Nevada has been identified as one of the top states for jobs in the solar industry.

Each year the potential energy savings can be hundreds of dollars. Think of the benefit to lower-income people when they don’t have to spend $300 or more a month just to feel comfortable in their home; there is evidence that some people simply avoid turning on their air conditioner when the temperature soars because they can’t afford it. In Clark County, extreme heat’s death toll in 2024 was 527. Tax credits, especially for solar, can help save lives.

Now that the reconciliation bill goes to the Senate for markup, we must contact our senators to insist that tax credits be included. This isn’t a partisan issue: Republicans from rural areas say sustainable energy infrastructure such as solar and wind in their areas is very popular, because the taxes from increased revenue have paved the way for desirable and necessary civic improvements. As the demand for sustainable energy grows, the desirability of tax credits increases. Our senators must encourage their Republican colleagues to join them in voting for maintaining tax credits.",https://assets.lasvegassun.com/media/assets/images/icons/favicon-app.png,N,,2025-06-01 06:01:26.115338

Some of a dam’s energy could come from solar panels floating on its reservoir to prevent water from being released solely to generate electricity.
Young grew up in the San Francisco Bay area, about 40 miles, he estimated, from the pioneering floating solar panels in Napa.","GILA RIVER INDIAN RESERVATION, Ariz.—About 33 miles south of Phoenix, Interstate 10 bisects a line of solar panels traversing the desert like an iridescent snake. The solar farm’s shape follows the path of a canal, with panels serving as awnings to shade the gently flowing water from the unforgiving heat and wind of the Sonoran Desert.

The panels began generating power last November for the Akimel O’otham and Pee Posh tribes—known together as the Gila River Indian Community, or GRIC—on their reservation in south-central Arizona, and they are the first of their kind in the U.S. The community is studying the effects of these panels on the water in the canal, hopeful that they will protect a precious resource from the desert’s unflinching sun and wind.

In September, GRIC is planning to break ground on another experimental effort to conserve water while generating electricity: floating solar. Between its canal canopies and the new project that would float photovoltaic panels on a reservoir it is building, GRIC hopes to one day power all of its canal and irrigation operations with solar electricity, transforming itself into one of the most innovative and closely-watched water users in the West in the process.

The community’s investments come at a critical time for the Colorado River, which supplies water to about 40 million people across seven Western states, Mexico and 30 tribes, including GRIC. Annual consumption from the river regularly exceeds its supply, and a decades-long drought, fueled in part by climate change, continues to leave water levels at Lake Powell and Lake Mead dangerously low.

Covering water with solar panels is not a new idea. But for some it represents an elegant mitigation of water shortages in the West. Doing so could reduce evaporation, generate more carbon-free electricity and require dams to run less frequently to produce power.

But, so far, the technology has not been included in the ongoing Colorado River negotiations between the Upper Basin states of Colorado, New Mexico, Utah and Wyoming, the Lower Basin states of Arizona, California and Nevada, tribes and Mexico. All are expected to eventually agree on cuts to the system’s water allocations to maintain the river’s ability to provide water and electricity for residents and farms, and keep its ecosystem alive.

“People in the U.S. don’t know about [floating solar] yet,” said Scott Young, a former policy analyst in the Nevada state legislature’s counsel bureau. “They’re not willing to look at it and try and factor it” into the negotiations.

Several Western water managers Inside Climate News contacted for this story said they were open to learning more about floating solar—Colorado has even studied the technology through pilot projects. But, outside of GRIC’s project, none knew of any plans to deploy floating solar anywhere in the basin. Some listed costly and unusual construction methods and potentially modest water savings as the primary obstacles to floating solar maturing in the U.S.

A Tantalizing Technology With Tradeoffs

A winery in Napa County, California, deployed the first floating solar panels in the U.S. on an irrigation pond in 2007. The country was still years away from passing federal legislation to combat the climate crisis, and the technology matured here haltingly. As recently as 2022, according to a Bloomberg analysis, most of the world’s 13 gigawatts of floating solar capacity had been built in Asia.

Unlike many Asian countries, the U.S. has an abundance of undeveloped land where solar could be constructed, said Prateek Joshi, a research engineer at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) who has studied floating solar, among other forms of energy. “Even though [floating solar] may play a smaller role, I think it’s a critical role in just diversifying our energy mix and also reducing the burden of land use,” he said.

This February, NREL published a study that found floating solar on the reservoirs behind federally owned dams could provide enough electricity to power 100 million U.S. homes annually, but only if all the developable space on each reservoir were used.

Lake Powell could host almost 15 gigawatts of floating solar using about 23 percent of its surface area, and Lake Mead could generate over 17 gigawatts of power on 28 percent of its surface. Such large-scale development is “probably not going to be the case,” Joshi said, but even if a project used only a fraction of the developable area, “there’s a lot of power you could get from a relatively small percentage of these Colorado Basin reservoirs.”

The study did not measure how much water evaporation floating solar would prevent, but previous NREL research has shown that photovoltaic panels—sometimes called “floatovoltaics” when they are deployed on reservoirs—could also save water by changing the way hydropower is deployed.

Some of a dam’s energy could come from solar panels floating on its reservoir to prevent water from being released solely to generate electricity. As late as December, when a typical Western dam would be running low, lakes with floating solar could still have enough water to produce hydropower, reducing reliance on more expensive backup energy from gas-fired power plants.

Joshi has spoken with developers and water managers about floating solar before, and said there is “an eagerness to get this [technology] going.” The technology, however, is not flawless.

Solar arrays can be around 20 percent more expensive to install on water than land, largely because of the added cost of buoys that keep the panels afloat, according to a 2021 NREL report. The water’s cooling effect can boost panel efficiency, but floating solar panels may produce slightly less energy than a similarly sized array on land because they can’t be tilted as directly toward the sun as land-based panels.

And while the panels likely reduce water loss from reservoirs, they may also increase a water body’s emissions of greenhouse gases, which in turn warm the climate and increase evaporation. This January, researchers at Cornell University found that floating solar covering more than 70 percent of a pond’s surface area increased the water’s CO2 and methane emissions. These kinds of impacts “should be considered not only for the waterbody in which [floating solar] is deployed but also in the broader context of trade-offs of shifting energy production from land to water,” the study’s authors wrote.

“Any energy technology has its tradeoffs,” Joshi said, and in the case of floating solar, some of its benefits—reduced evaporation and land use—may not be easy to express in dollars and cents.

Silver Buckshot

There is perhaps no bigger champion for floating solar in the West than Scott Young. Before he retired in 2016, he spent much of his 18 years working for the Nevada Legislature researching the effects of proposed legislation, especially in the energy sector.

On an overcast, blustery May day in southwest Wyoming near his home, Young said that in the past two years he has promoted the technology to Colorado River negotiators, members of Congress, environmental groups and other water managers from the seven basin states, all of whom he has implored to consider the virtues of floating solar arrays on Lake Powell and Lake Mead.

Young grew up in the San Francisco Bay area, about 40 miles, he estimated, from the pioneering floating solar panels in Napa. He stressed that he does not have any ties to industry; he is just a concerned Westerner who wants to diversify the region’s energy mix and save as much water as possible.

But so far, when he has been able to get someone’s attention, Young said his pitch has been met with tepid interest. “Usually the response is: ‘Eh, that’s kind of interesting,’” said Young, dressed in a black jacket, a maroon button-down shirt and a matching ball cap that framed his round, open face. “But there’s no follow-up.”

The Bureau of Reclamation “has not received any formal proposals for floating solar on its reservoirs,” said an agency spokesperson, who added that the bureau has been monitoring the technology.

In a 2021 paper published with NREL, Reclamation estimated that floating solar on its reservoirs could generate approximately 1.5 terawatts of electricity, enough to power about 100 million homes. But, in addition to potentially interfering with recreation, aquatic life and water safety, floating solar’s effect on evaporation proved difficult to model broadly.

So many environmental factors determine how water is lost or consumed in a reservoir—solar intensity, wind, humidity, lake circulation, water depth and temperature—that the study’s authors concluded Reclamation “should be wary of contractors’ claims of evaporation savings” without site-specific studies. Those same factors affect the panels’ efficiency, and in turn, how much hydropower would need to be generated from the reservoir they cover.

The report also showed the Colorado River was ripe with floating solar potential—more than any other basin in the West. That’s particularly true in the Upper Basin, where Young has been heartened by Colorado’s approach to the technology.

In 2023, the state passed a law requiring several agencies to study the use of floating solar. Last December, the Colorado Water Conservation Board published its findings, and estimated that the state could save up to 407,000 acre feet of water by deploying floating solar on certain reservoirs. An acre foot covers one acre with a foot of water, or 325,851 gallons, just about three year’s worth of water for a family of four.

When Young saw the Colorado study quantifying savings from floating solar, he felt hopeful. “407,000 acre feet from one state,” he said. “I was hoping that would catch people’s attention.”

Saving that much water would require using over 100,000 acres of surface water, said Cole Bedford, the Colorado Water Conservation Board’s chief operating officer, in an email. “On some of these reservoirs a [floating solar] system would diminish the recreational value such that it would not be appropriate,” he said. “On others, recreation, power generation, and water savings could be balanced.”

Colorado is not planning to develop another project in the wake of this study, and Bedford said that the technology is not a silver bullet solution for Colorado River negotiations.

“While floating solar is one tool in the toolkit for water conservation, the only true solution to the challenges facing the Colorado River Basin is a shift to supply-driven, sustainable uses and operations,” he said.

Some of the West’s largest and driest cities, like Phoenix and Denver, ferry Colorado River water to residents hundreds of miles away from the basin using a web of infrastructure that must reliably operate in unforgiving terrain. Like their counterparts at the state level, water managers in these cities have heard floatovoltaics floated before, but they say the technology is currently too immature and costly to be deployed in the U.S.

In Arizona, the Central Arizona Project (CAP) delivers much of the Colorado River water used by Phoenix, Tucson, tribes and other southern Arizona communities with a 336-mile canal running through the desert, and Lake Pleasant, the company’s 811,784-acre-foot reservoir.

Though CAP is following GRIC’s deployment of solar over canals, it has no immediate plans to build solar over its canal, or Lake Pleasant, according to Darrin Francom, CAP’s assistant general manager for operations, power, engineering and maintenance, in part because the city of Peoria technically owns the surface water.

Covering the whole canal with solar to save the 4,000 acre feet that evaporates from it could be prohibitively expensive for CAP. “The dollar cost per that acre foot [saved] is going to be in the tens of, you know, maybe even hundreds of thousands of dollars,” Francom said, mainly due to working with novel equipment and construction methods. “Ultimately,” he continued, “those costs are going to be borne by our ratepayers,” which gives CAP reason to pursue other lower-cost ways to save water, like conservation programs, or to seek new sources.

The increased costs associated with building solar panels on water instead of on land has made such projects unpalatable to Denver Water, Colorado’s largest water utility, which moves water out of the Colorado River Basin and through the Rocky Mountains to customers on the Front Range. “Floating solar doesn’t pencil out for us for many reasons,” said Todd Hartman, a company spokesperson. “Were we to add more solar resources—which we are considering—we have abundant land-based options.”

GRIC spent about $5.6 million, financed with Inflation Reduction Act grants, to construct 3,000 feet of solar over a canal, according to David DeJong, project director for the community’s irrigation district.

“If you can save water in two ways—why not?”

— Scott Young, former Nevada policy analyst

Young is aware there is no single solution to the problems plaguing the Colorado River Basin, and he knows floating solar is not a perfect technology. Instead, he thinks of it as a “silver buckshot,” he said, borrowing a term from John Entsminger, general manager for the Southern Nevada Water Authority—a technology that can be deployed alongside a constellation of behavioral changes to help keep the Colorado River alive.

Given the duration and intensity of the drought in the West and the growing demand for water and clean energy, Young believes the U.S. needs to act now to embed this technology into the fabric of Western water management going forward.

As drought in the West intensifies, “I think more lawmakers are going to look at this,” he said. “If you can save water in two ways—why not?”

“We’re Not Going to Know Until We Try”

If all goes according to plan, GRIC’s West Side Reservoir will be finished and ready to store Colorado River water by the end of July. The community wants to cover just under 60 percent of the lake’s surface area with floating solar.

“Do we know for a fact that this is going to be 100 percent effective and foolproof? No,” said DeJong, GRIC’s project director for its irrigation district. “But we’re not going to know until we try.”

GRIC’s panels will have a few things going for them that projects on lakes Mead or Powell probably wouldn’t. West Side Reservoir will not be open to recreation, limiting the panels’ impacts on people. And the community already has the funds—Inflation Reduction Act grants and some of its own money—to pay for the project.

But GRIC’s solar ambitions may be threatened by the hostile posture toward solar and wind energy from the White House and congressional Republicans, and the project is vulnerable to an increasingly volatile economy. Since retaking office, President Donald Trump, aided by billionaire Elon Musk, has made deep cuts in renewable energy grants at the Environmental Protection Agency. It is unclear whether or to what extent the Bureau of Reclamation has slashed its grant programs.

“Under President Donald J. Trump’s leadership, the Department is working to cut bureaucratic waste and ensure taxpayer dollars are spent efficiently,” said a spokesperson for the Department of the Interior, which oversees Reclamation. “This includes ensuring Bureau of Reclamation projects that use funds from the Infrastructure Investments and Jobs Act and the Inflation Reduction Act align with administration priorities. Projects are being individually assessed by period of performance, criticality, and other criteria. Projects have been approved for obligation under this process so that critical work can continue.”

And Trump’s tariffs could cause costs to balloon beyond the community’s budget, which could either reduce the size of the array or cause delays in soliciting proposals, DeJong said.

“I know for a fact this is inspiring a whole new generation of water protectors—those that want to come back and they want to go into this cutting-edge technology.”

— GRIC Governor Stephen Roe Lewis

While the community will study the panels over canals to understand the water’s effects on solar panel efficiency, it won’t do similar research on the panels on West Side Reservoir, though DeJong said they have been in touch with NREL about studying them. The enterprise will be part of the system that may one day offset all the electrical demand and carbon footprint of GRIC’s irrigation system.

“The community, they love these types of innovative projects. I love these innovative projects,” said GRIC Governor Stephen Roe Lewis, standing in front of the canals in April. Lewis had his dark hair pulled back in a long ponytail and wore a blue button down that matched the color of the sky.

“I know for a fact this is inspiring a whole new generation of water protectors—those that want to come back and they want to go into this cutting-edge technology,” he said. “I couldn’t be more proud of our team for getting this done.”

DeJong feels plenty of other water managers across the West could learn from what is happening at GRIC. In fact, the West Side Reservoir was intentionally constructed near Interstate 10 so that people driving by on the highway could one day see the floating solar the community intends to build there, DeJong said.

“It could be a paradigm shift in the Western United States,” he said. “We recognize all of the projects we’re doing are pilot projects. None of them are large scale. But it’s the beginning.”",https://insideclimatenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/041925_Bolster_AZ_019-1024x679.jpg,N,,2025-06-01 08:00:53.026605

With planned investments and timely implementation, the country can steer its power and energy sectors in the right direction and meet its renewable energy targets.","Bangladesh’s interim government is preparing to unveil its first budget on 2 June 2025 amid high expectations of a balanced allocation of funds to streamline the country’s energy transition. A prudent budgetary assessment by the government is much needed given that the power sector’s subsidy burden is reportedly expected to soar by 55% year-on-year in the fiscal year (FY) 2024-25. This is despite the electricity price hike by more than 20% between January 2023 and February 2024.

Bangladesh should follow a merit order dispatch – using the lowest-cost power sources first and then moving to the more expensive ones if demand increases – to bring down its subsidy burden. This opens up opportunities for government intervention – supporting renewable energy capacity addition to ease the transition from oil-fired power and investing in grid modernisation.

Furthermore, the system loss in Bangladesh’s gas sector, which hovers around 7%, calls for budgetary support to revamp gas distribution networks.

While Bangladesh will need a long-term strategy to stave off its energy and power sector challenges, the next budget can lay the foundation for an orderly transition.

Reducing the Power Sector’s Subsidies

Bangladesh needs to gradually reduce oil-fired power generation to limit subsidies. To do this, the government should incentivise renewable energy expansion through budgetary support.

i. Limiting the share of oil-fired power in total generation

In FY2023-24, the cost of oil-fired power was more than two times compared to the average power generation cost. If purchases from oil-fired plants are excluded, the average generation cost comes down to Tk9.54/kWh (US$0.078/kWh). In turn, this can lower the sector’s subsidies.

Earlier this year, the government initiated steps to reduce the share of oil-fired power in total power generation. After a temporary decline in January 2025, the share of oil-based power generation rebounded between February and April 2025, contributing to 10.27% of grid-based power and 29.27% of total fuel costs (Figure 1 highlights the days when the share of oil-fired power was considerably high). This pattern mirrors the trend seen in 2024.

The Ministry of Power, Energy and Mineral Resources (MPEMR) should strive to reduce oil-based power generation from FY2025-26, based on the estimates of the Bangladesh Power Development Board. As the Ministry of Finance allocates sectoral subsidies, this assessment will help the MPEMR and the Ministry of Finance to phase down power sector subsidies.

ii. Incentivising renewable energy uptake

With declining costs and improving technologies, Bangladesh can lower its overall power purchase cost by deploying cheaper renewable energy. However, since the utility-scale projects’ pipeline is empty and land acquisition poses a challenge, the upcoming budget can allocate part of the Public-Private-Partnership fund to support land acquisition and attract private investment.

Further, the government can provide a duty waiver on imported accessories to incentivise rooftop solar and solar irrigation expansion as quickfire solutions.

As solar irrigation systems are not viable without a grant of around 50% of the capital cost, the government can enlarge the renewable energy funding base of Tk1 billion (US$8.2 million) established in last year’s budget, and allocate a part of it as viability gap funding for the accelerated implementation of solar irrigation projects. The government can let the Infrastructure Development Company Limited, which has significant experience in financing solar irrigation, utilise this subsidy. With this support, microfinance institutions working in rural areas can also scale up solar irrigation projects.

These steps will help the country achieve its goals of attaining 6,145 megawatts (MW) and 17,470MW of renewable energy by 2030 and 2041, respectively, as set out in the Renewable Energy Policy 2025.

As Bangladesh’s variable renewable energy capacity is likely to surge in the next five years, the old electricity grid becomes a bottleneck. With a greater share of variable renewable energy, old grid may experience stability issues.

While the previous budget allocated Tk10,634 crore (US$0.87 billion) for grid expansion and modernisation, and the development of power evacuation systems, the new budget should continue to fund grid modernisation.

Bringing Down the Gas Sector’s System Loss

Bangladesh could not utilise 68.6 billion cubic feet (Bcf) of gas in 2024 due to a system loss of 7% (total consumption recorded in 2024 was 980Bcf) resulting from old pipelines in the gas distribution network and pilferage. By limiting the gas sector’s system loss to 2% from 7%, Bangladesh can save at least 49Bcf of gas per annum (5% of the 980Bcf consumed in 2024), reducing LNG imports worth US$497 million per annum (taking an LNG price of US$10.5/metric million British thermal units (MMBtu)). Prudent budgetary allocation can help the country’s gas distribution companies invest in replacing old gas pipelines. Besides, the country should deploy a team to monitor gas pilferage, which also contributes to system loss. As the country’s fossil fuel imports continue to swell, budgetary support to reduce this system loss is crucial.

The sustainability of Bangladesh’s energy and power sectors hinges on strategic budgetary allocation. With planned investments and timely implementation, the country can steer its power and energy sectors in the right direction and meet its renewable energy targets.",https://ieefa.org/sites/default/files/2025-05/shutterstock_524918623.jpg,N,,2025-06-01 05:02:45.269049

Musk’s exit raises questions about Tesla’s sales slump and competition

SpaceX faces setbacks with rocket program

Musk’s focus shifts to robotaxi launch

Tesla shares down 25% since December

By Aditya Soni, Kritika Lamba

May 29 (Reuters) – Elon Musk’s break with the Trump administration means investors will hope he refocuses on his sprawling empire as Tesla TSLA.O battles slumping sales and after SpaceX’s latest rocket launch fell short of expectations.

Musk called time on his White House stint on Wednesday, giving Tesla investors some succor after shares slumped this year in part due to the backlash to his support of U.S. President Donald Trump and right-wing parties in Europe. The billionaire also spearheaded Trump’s so-called Department of Government Efficiency, charged with cutting federal spending, which generated controversy.

He now returns to his empire facing several challenges, but also numerous advantages. Tesla’s sales slide is testing investor patience, yet SpaceX and Starlink dominate their respective markets, often serving as the default choice for commercial launches and satellite internet deployment. Foreign governments have also increasingly looked to Starlink, with regulatory approvals smoothed by Musk’s close ties to Trump.

That relationship, however, has drawn scrutiny. Shortly before he announced his exit from Washington, Musk criticized the tax bill that is making its way through Congress. In addition, he had recently pledged to spend less money on politics after he plunked down nearly $300 million on Trump’s presidential campaign and on other Republican candidates last year.

Tesla shares were little changed in afternoon trading on Thursday, but they have lost about 25% of their value since mid-December. The stock initially soared due to Musk’s relationship with Trump and expectations for swift regulatory approval for the company’s widely awaited robotaxis. They reversed course as sales dropped and protests erupted against Musk’s embrace of far-right politicians and his role in firing U.S. federal workers.

Analysts say deeper operational fixes are needed to reverse its sales slump, however, as EV buyers increasingly seek out competitors, particularly in the fast-growing Chinese market.

“Musk’s departure from DOGE will improve market sentiment, but I see no real change for Tesla,” said Morningstar analyst Seth Goldstein.

“Tesla’s deliveries decline shows its current product lineup is at market saturation and facing strong competition in all three key markets of the U.S., China and Europe.”

With a forward price-to-earnings ratio of roughly 165, according to LSEG data, Tesla remains far more expensive than other Big Tech giants like Nvidia NVDA.O or Microsoft MSFT.O, not to mention conventional auto companies. Bullish analysts, such as Wedbush’s Dan Ives, have long contended that Tesla’s future value is tied to autonomous driving, which Ives said on Thursday could be worth about “$1 trillion alone for Tesla.”

Tesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

RELATIONSHIP WITH TRUMP

Musk’s companies have benefited from his relationship with Trump. Reuters reported last week that Musk’s DOGE team was expanding use of his artificial intelligence chatbot Grok in the U.S. federal government to analyze data. Experts told Reuters that this could give Musk access to valuable nonpublic federal contracting data at agencies with which he privately does business, and give him an advantage over other AI service providers.

Trump’s cabinet will continue to work with DOGE employees across various federal agencies, the White House said on Thursday, even as at least one member of Musk’s team was set to depart. Steve Davis, a close associate of Musk and key in running the agency’s day-to-day operations, has stepped down from his DOGE leadership role, according to a source familiar with the matter.

SpaceX’s launch this week failed more quickly than expected, exploding over the Indian Ocean without achieving some of its most important testing goals. The result puts another pause in Musk’s speedy development goals for the rocket, which is bound to play a central role in the U.S. space program. Federal regulators had granted SpaceX a license for Starship’s latest flight attempt four days ago, capping an investigation of a mishap that had grounded Starship for nearly two months.

SpaceX has long had its own management team led by Gwynne Shotwell, though after the latest launch, Musk said he planned to spend more time on the company. The Starship rocket is still many steps away from being able to land humans on the moon or Mars.

“He’s not an official part of the government, but obviously maintains connections,” said Thomas Martin, senior portfolio manager at Tesla investor Globalt Investments. “So I think there’s a slight diminishment of influence at the margin, but I don’t think it’s going to move the needle on regulatory matters anyway.”

Musk has been quiet for months about legislation in Congress that takes aim at electric vehicles, but late on Wednesday, Tesla Energy criticized Republican plans to end energy tax credits. “Abruptly ending the energy tax credits would threaten America’s energy independence and the reliability of our grid,” Tesla Energy wrote on its X account. The Republican tax plan could cut tax breaks for electric vehicle purchases and leases, phase out battery production credits and cut clean-energy incentives for solar.

Tesla’s robotaxi launch next month is crucial to Musk’s plan to shift focus from an affordable electric vehicle to autonomous vehicles and the company’s Optimus humanoid robots.

Shortly after news of his Washington departure, Musk said Tesla has been testing driverless Model Y cars in Austin, Texas, with plans to deliver the first vehicles in June.",https://bilyonaryo.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/tesla-1.jpg,N,,2025-06-01 06:01:35.270669

This latest study finding needs to be a point of concern for Indonesia, which is currently beginning to shift to electric vehicles but has not yet been accompanied by an accelerated transition to renewable energy sources.

A study by researchers from the University of Auckland and Xiamen University in China, published in the February 2025 issue of the journal Energy, shows that carbon dioxide (CO₂) emissions in a country that switches to electric vehicles (EVs) actually increase if the country's electricity source still relies on fossil fuels. The report was written by Miaomiao Tao and Stephen Poletti from the Energy Centre, Department of Economics, Business School, The University of Auckland, New Zealand, and Boqiang Lin from the China Institute for Studies in Energy Policy, Xiamen University, China.

Tao, a doctoral candidate under the supervision of Poletti, stated in a release issued by his university on Wednesday (9/4/2025) that data indicates the increasing use of electricity worldwide has not led to a significant reduction in global CO₂ emissions. ""On the contrary, the adoption of electric vehicles is positively correlated with CO₂ emissions,"" said Tao.

He acknowledged that this finding appears to contradict previous intuition. This discovery, he stated, challenges the common belief that electric vehicles contribute to decarbonization.

In this study, researchers analyzed the environmental impact of human activities and used a statistical approach to investigate the drivers of CO₂ emission increases in a country. Using data from 26 countries over 15 years, they found a trend indicating that higher EV usage is associated with increased CO₂ emissions. The reason is that, in several countries, EVs are still powered by electricity generated through the combustion of fossil fuels such as coal or oil.

“Our analysis highlights that the environmental benefits of electric vehicles depend on the composition of a country’s power generation mix,” Tao said.

According to this study, New Zealand, where more than 80 percent of its electricity generation comes from renewable energy, is well-positioned to reap the benefits of EVs. ""This research serves as a reminder that transportation decarbonization cannot be done in isolation,"" said Poletti.

On the other hand, according to this study, countries like Indonesia, where in 2022 only about 19.6 percent of its total electricity production came from renewable energy sources, actually experienced an increase in CO₂ emissions due to the rising use of EVs. So far, the contribution of renewable energy in Indonesia primarily comes from hydroelectric power plants, geothermal energy, biomass, and, to a lesser extent, solar and wind energy.

Poleeti explained that if electric vehicles are charged using electricity generated from coal-fired power plants, the CO₂ emissions produced could actually be higher than those from gasoline or diesel-powered vehicles. ""In this case, electric vehicles can indirectly contribute to higher emissions compared to modern gasoline or diesel-powered vehicles, especially when considering the entire lifecycle from production to disposal,"" he said.

<strong>Renewable power generation</strong>

The study found that the adoption of electric vehicles would only contribute to reducing CO₂ emissions if the global share of renewable electricity generation reached around 48 percent. According to Poleti, renewables, mainly wind, solar and hydro, will only account for a little over 30 percent of the world’s electricity in 2023, so there is still a way to go if the world is serious about reducing CO2 emissions from electric vehicles.

""Electric vehicles are often seen as a magic bullet for climate change, but our results show that this is not the case if the electricity that powers them is not clean,"" Poleti said.

The study concluded that EVs are only environmentally friendly if they are connected to the electricity grid, and government policies should aim to increase the adoption and integration of renewable energy such as solar and hydro. ""This can be achieved by setting ambitious renewable energy targets and providing adequate subsidies such as tax credits to renewable energy producers and consumers,"" he said.

Poletti said investments in smart grids and transmission networks can improve the efficiency and reliability of renewable energy supplies. Therefore, policies should support community-based renewable energy projects, which can increase public acceptance of renewable energy installations.

The researchers further said that eliminating subsidies for fossil fuels and implementing carbon pricing mechanisms could also provide incentives for renewable energy development. “The adoption of electric vehicles could help countries meet climate targets, as long as the energy used to power them is clean,” Tao said.

In addition to electric vehicle use, the researchers examined the impact of economic growth, green technology innovation, renewable energy consumption, and population density on emissions.

They found that economic growth increases emissions, while innovation in green technologies and population density, in the form of denser cities, can help reduce emissions. The use of renewable energy has the most significant emission-reducing effect.",https://assetd.kompas.id/j__XGPr6Yo2sRO0g8lrwXNvc9Og=/fit-in/1024x875/filters:format(webp):quality(80)/https://cdn-dam.kompas.id/images/2025/03/24/9d18096124cdd40d9d94e0957baee3bd-20250324WEN9.jpg,N,,2025-06-01 10:06:30.509906

The visit by Department of Interior Secretary Doug Burgum, Energy Secretary Chris Wright and Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin comes after Trump signed an executive order earlier this year aimed at boosting oil and gas drilling, mining and logging in Alaska. It also comes amid tariff talks with Asian countries that are seen as possible leverage for the administration to secure investments in the proposed Alaska liquefied natural gas project.

Their itinerary includes a meeting Sunday with resource development groups and U.S. Sens. Dan Sullivan and Lisa Murkowski in Anchorage before heading to Utqiagvik, an Arctic town on the petroleum-rich North Slope where many Alaska Native leaders see oil development as economically vital to the region.

The federal officials also plan to visit the Prudhoe Bay oil field Monday — near the coast of the Arctic Ocean and more than 850 miles (1,368 kilometers) north of Anchorage — and speak at Republican Gov. Mike Dunleavy's annual energy conference Tuesday in Anchorage.

While it's not unusual for U.S. officials to visit Alaska during warmer weather months, Dunleavy's office said the officials' visit is significant. Dunleavy, a Trump ally, said he is thankful for an administration that “recognizes Alaska's unique value.”

Government and industry representatives from a number of Asian countries, including Japan, are expected to participate in a portion of the trip, reflecting pressure from the U.S. to invest in the pipeline — despite skepticism and opposition from environmental groups.

In Alaska, some environmentalists criticized the agenda for Dunleavy's conference. Highlighting fossil fuels alongside renewable or alternative energy make “energy sources of the past look more legitimate at a conference like this,"" said Andy Moderow, senior policy director with the Alaska Wilderness League.

“I think we should be looking at climate solutions that work for Alaskans, not trying to open up places that industry is taking a pass on, namely the Arctic refuge,” he said.

Trump has long taken credit for provisions of a 2017 tax law championed by Alaska's congressional delegation that called for two oil and gas lease sales in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge's coastal plain by late 2024. The first one remains the subject of ongoing litigation, with the main bidder a state corporation that saw its seven leases later canceled by then-President Joe Biden's administration. A judge in March ruled Biden's administration overstepped, and the Interior Department, in line with Trump's executive order, is working to reinstate the leases.

There weren't any bids in the second sale, held under Biden and blasted by the state as overly restrictive.

Debate over drilling in the refuge — home to polar bears, musk ox, birds and other wildlife — has long been a flashpoint. Indigenous Gwich’in leaders consider the coastal plain sacred land, noting its importance to a caribou herd they rely upon.

Many North Slope Iñupiat leaders who support drilling in the refuge felt their voices were not heard during the Biden era. During the Trump officials' visit, they also hope to make a case for additional development in the National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska, which Trump has advocated, and for being included in planning decisions.

Nagruk Harcharek, president of Voice of the Arctic Iñupiat, an advocacy group whose members include leaders from the region, called the officials' visit “a step in the right direction.”

For years, the state has sought to develop its stores of North Slope natural gas as a way to provide affordable energy to more residents and bolster revenues via exports. But cost concerns, shifts in direction, competition from other projects and questions about economic feasibility have stymied progress. Oil companies have long reinjected gas that occurs with oil deposits on the slope to produce more oil, which remains Alaska's economic lifeblood.

The latest gas proposal calls for a roughly 810-mile (1,300-kilometer) pipeline that would carry gas from the North Slope to port and a facility that would process and export liquefied natural gas to Asian countries. In a March speech to Congress, Trump touted his ongoing support of the “gigantic natural gas pipeline."" He said countries like Japan and South Korea “want to be our partner, with investments of trillions of dollars each.” No firm commitments from countries have been made.

The company advancing the project — in partnership with a state corporation — is in a stage of refining cost estimates, previously pegged at around $44 billion for the pipeline and related infrastructure, before final decisions are made on whether to move forward with the project.

While Dunleavy has likened Trump’s friendly approach to energy development as “Christmas every day,” Alaska's fortunes remain tightly linked to the volatility of oil prices, which are down sharply from a year ago, squeezing state revenues.

State lawmakers across party lines overwhelmingly passed a resolution urging Congress to provide Alaska with 90% of royalty revenues for oil and gas leases in the Arctic refuge, arguing the U.S. government reneged on past promises for such a share. The resolution also asked for that to be extended to the petroleum reserve.",https://i.abcnewsfe.com/a/9471fb5d-9baa-472e-9682-3b4226058dea/wirestory_d9b2b70f3ada4eab89da303b2a5c745d_16x9.jpg?w=1600,N,,2025-06-01 05:03:00.764119

The order requires BGE to shift recovery of some supply costs to lower-usage months over a six-month period. It means customers will pay less supply costs during the winter and summer, a time when bills are typically higher. However, they'll see an increase in the fall and spring when bills are lower.

The commission said the order will benefit customers by ""flattening costs and help[ing] mitigate excessively high electricity bills during peak months."" The commission originally considered this idea during an April meeting, after which the Commission requested and received proposals to spread costs over four-, six-, and twenty-four-month intervals.

Commission Chair Frederick Hoover said in a statement, ""The Commission took these actions to mitigate the impacts felt by customers as a result of higher-than-expected energy costs, coupled with potential high usage in the coming months.""

In response, BGE wrote in a statement: ""The Commission has decided to shift the recovery of some supply costs caused by last summer's PJM Capacity Auction results to lower-usage months over a six-month period. We will continue working with the Commission and parties to mitigate the impact of higher energy costs for our customers. In accordance with the PSC's order, adjusted residential electric supply rates will go into effect for usage starting June 1.""

The commission adds that they support the Maryland Office of People's Counsel and several other PJM state consumer advocates in a complaint against the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. The complaint challenges high wholesale capacity prices, arguing that PJM's most recent capacity auction will impose unjust and unreasonable charges on ratepayers.

Electricity prices increase on June 1

BGE said the increase in electricity prices is the result of an unexpected spike in capacity auction prices and the Talen Energy reliability-must-run (RMR) fee. A capacity market auction is a competitive bidding process where power companies promise to make their electricity generation available in the future.

""Generally, Maryland has an acute imbalance between electricity supply and demand from customers,"" said BGE Spokesperson Nick Alexopulos.

He said customers are paying to keep some power plants, set to retire, online.

""Customers have to pay the owner of those power plants, Talen Energy, a certain fee called the reliability-must-run,"" Alexopulos said. ""They're going to have to pay that every month until the power plants retire.""

What is the Talen Energy RMR fee?

The Talen Energy RMR fee refers to the fixed payments made to Talen Energy for continuing to operate its Brandon Shores and H.A. Wagner power plants in Maryland, beyond their planned retirement dates.

PJM Interconnection, the regional grid operator, pays a fee of $312 per megawatt per day for the Brandon Shores plant, amounting to approximately $145 million annually, along with a $5 million performance incentive.

According to data from E2, a US-based group of business leaders and investors, $14 billion in clean energy projects supporting 10,000 jobs have been cancelled or postponed so far this year.
And beyond supporting clean power generation, local governments had a variety of strategies to tackle climate change, she said.
Key offices that are responsible for climate change monitoring, maintaining the nation's databases related to climate change and for a large fraction of climate education in US schools, colleges and universities have been closed.
""When you cut that off, you're basically killing the future of innovation in all these domains, in terms of environmental and public health and in solutions for climate change,"" he said.","Donald Trump’s campaign pledge to ""drill, baby, drill,"" struck fear into the hearts of climate campaigners, but it was music to the ears of Washington’s fossil fuel lobbyists.

And the US President didn’t waste any time delivering on his promises to Big Oil.

In a dizzying slew of executive orders on his first day in office, Mr Trump pulled the United States out of the Paris Agreement to limit global warming, rolled back Biden-era clean energy incentives, stripped away environmental restrictions on oil and gas exploration and threw a lifeline to America’s dying coal industry.

Leaving no doubt as to the direction of travel, the administration went on to initiate legal action against states over their climate policies, shutter federal climate research offices, scrub information on extreme weather tracking from government websites and even ban the use of paper straws in federal buildings.

""We’re going back to plastic,"" Mr Trump said as he signed the order, ""these things don’t work"".

The president has made no secret of his disdain for renewable energy projects either, calling wind turbines ""stupid"" and ""unsightly"" and freezing approvals for wind and solar projects on federal lands and water.

The administration is now reportedly preparing to eliminate limits on greenhouse gas emissions from coal and gas-fired power plants in the United States, which is already the world’s second-largest polluter.

For some analysts, Mr Trump’s policies could sound the death knell for America’s competitiveness in green energy, a field where other countries, like China, are already surging ahead.

""They're really taking a meat axe to the federal government's work, both on the science of climate change and the technology addressing climate change,"" Harvard professor John Holdren, who was science advisor to former President Barack Obama during his two terms, told RTÉ News.

Others, though, welcomed what they saw as the administration shifting focus to America’s own energy security, which they believed would benefit the US in the long term.

Energy security

""I think what we are seeing from President Trump and Republicans in Congress is a strategy that looks to balance a future that has abundant, affordable, reliable and lower emissions energy,"" said Jeremy Harrell, CEO of ClearPath, a conservative-leaning clean energy organisation, based in Washington DC.

Federal programmes were being reevaluated under President Trump to ensure they were ""economically viable"" as well as targeted towards technologies in which the US was in pole position to lead, Mr Harrell said, citing geothermal, nuclear and carbon-capture as examples.

Was this an acknowledgment that the US couldn’t compete with China in sectors like wind and solar, given that China now makes 80% of the world’s solar panels and dominates global wind turbine manufacturing?

There was certainly bi-partisan support in the US Congress, Mr Harrell said, to onshore US energy in an effort ""to reduce reliance on China and Chinese supply chains, and position the US as a technology leader globally, in areas where we have some strategic advantage"".

But other observers felt the moment for asserting any strategic advantage had come and gone.

""It is a travesty that the United States has not taken a leadership position on the clean energy future,"" said Caroline Spears head of Climate Cabinet, which advocates for pro-climate policies at the state and local levels.

She was also sceptical that the United States would be able to boost domestic industry and technology under current conditions.

""The amount of uncertainty and volatility being created is wild,"" said Ms Spears.

And when it comes to massive projects - like nuclear - there was a danger the administration would overpromise and underdeliver, she said.

The push on climate was going to have to come from individual states, she said.

The power of red states

Last week the US House of Representatives passed a major tax bill - dubbed the ""Big Beautiful Bill,"" - which gutted the clean energy credits established in former President Biden’s signature piece of legislation, the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA).

The bill is now on its way to the Senate, where it may well be watered down, experts said.

That’s partly because much of the financial benefits from the Inflation Reduction Act flowed to Republican-voting areas of the country.

Senators of these so-called ""red states"" will be reluctant to legislate against large renewable energy plants that have brought jobs to their constituencies and have proven popular with voters, experts told RTÉ News.

A recent poll carried out by the Conservative Texans for Energy Innovation found that 84 percent of Texans were in favour of renewable energy projects.

Although best known for its Stetson-sporting oil barons, Texas is now the nation’s leading producer of wind and solar power, having outstripped California some years ago.

Nationally, a long-term study carried out by the Yale Program on Climate Change Communication showed that more that three quarters of Americans supported renewable energy infrastructure on public land while 66% of people polled wanted a full transition away from fossil fuels to clean energy by mid-century.

All this leads to a degree of unstoppable momentum, analysts said.

""A lot of the progress we have made in the United States on the ground is not going to be reversed through policy changes,"" said Anthony Moffa, law professor at the University of Maine.

The deployment of more renewable energy or electric vehicle adoption are trends that are going to continue, he said, even without federal government incentives.

""Automakers have already invested a significant amount of money and time in developing affordable electric vehicles,"" he said, ""and we're seeing them adopted more and more throughout the United States"".

Indeed, despite the Trump administration’s rollback of the tax credits and incentives in the Inflation Reduction Act, the US power system began producing more electricity from clean energy sources than fossil fuels in March, according to data released by Ember, a think tank.

That trend has continued for the past three months.

Stalling the energy transition

But while progress may not be halted, it’s likely to see a significant slowdown, analysts said.

According to data from E2, a US-based group of business leaders and investors, $14 billion in clean energy projects supporting 10,000 jobs have been cancelled or postponed so far this year.

But this is where individual states can make a difference, Caroline Spears told RTÉ News.

""They can set renewable portfolio standards, for example,"" she said, ""they can create permitting and leasing offices and make it easier to get projects off the ground"".

And beyond supporting clean power generation, local governments had a variety of strategies to tackle climate change, she said.

""The biggest source of pollution in the country is increasingly transportation,"" she said.

""There's a lot that states can do on electric vehicles and on public transport,"" she said, ""and we're seeing progress and movement there as well"".

Court battles

As with President Trump’s trade tariffs, the US courts have become a major climate battleground too.

In what law professor Anthony Moffa called an ""unprecedented move"", the administration has thrown its weight behind lawsuits brought by fossil fuel companies against state climate policies.

The department of justice, for example, sued New York and Vermont over their climate ""superfund"" laws that would force oil and gas companies to pay into a state fund for clean infrastructure projects.

But similarly, climate campaigners are also using the courts to challenge government policies.

A group of 22 young activists filed a lawsuit in Montana this week arguing that President Trump’s executive orders suppressed climate science and slowed the transition to renewable energy sources in favour of fossil fuels, ""thereby worsening the air pollution and climate conditions that immediately harm and endanger Plaintiffs’ lives and personal security"".

The spokesperson for the plaintiffs 19-year-old Eva Lighthiser said in a statement that the president’s fossil fuel directives were ""a death sentence for my generation"".

""I'm not suing because I want to, I'm suing because I have to,"" she said.

""My health, my future, and my right to speak the truth are all on the line. [President Trump] is waging war on us with fossil fuels as his weapon, and we're fighting back with the Constitution,"" she said.

Earlier this month, 17 states and Washington DC sued the government over its ban on wind power projects. The White House accused the attorneys general of the states of using ""lawfare"" to thwart President Trump’s agenda.

'Spherically senseless'

But whatever the final legal outcome of the various cases before the courts, cuts to climate research have already caused ""an enormous amount of damage,"" that will outlast this administration, according to John Holdren.

The National Science Foundation, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the Department of Energy's Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy have all seen their budgets slashed, he said.

Key offices that are responsible for climate change monitoring, maintaining the nation's databases related to climate change and for a large fraction of climate education in US schools, colleges and universities have been closed.

Research programs cannot be revived overnight, he said, noting that staff who have been fired may have moved on to other jobs of even other countries.

That early research was the ""seed corn"" from which future practical advances grew, he added.

""When you cut that off, you're basically killing the future of innovation in all these domains, in terms of environmental and public health and in solutions for climate change,"" he said.

This was ""absolutely a case of shooting the country in the foot,"" he told RTÉ News.

""It is what the energy analyst Amory Lovins once called 'spherically senseless,’"" he said.

""No matter how you look at it, it’s crazy"".",https://www.rte.ie/images/0022a325-1600.jpg,N,,2025-06-01 05:02:54.022413

It’s occurring as the Trump administration pursues the maximization of already record-high oil and gas output while dismantling swaths of Biden’s policies on climate and clean energy.

The Office of Clean Energy Demonstration awards for carbon capture and storage and other technologies the department axed include nearly $332 million to a project at Exxon Mobil’s XOM.N Baytown, Texas refinery complex, $500 million to Heidelberg Materials, US in Louisiana, and $375 million to Eastman Chemical Company EMN.N in Longview, Texas.

The Baytown award was meant to cut carbon emissions by enabling the use of hydrogen instead of natural gas for the production of ethylene, a feedstock used in producing textiles and plastic resins.

The department said nearly 70% of the awards had been signed between the November 5, 2024, election day and January 20, Biden’s last day in office.

The companies did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Carbon capture projects aim to help curb climate change by removing the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide directly from the air or from the pollution streams of facilities, including refineries and plants that burn coal and make ethanol, for storage underground. Sometimes the gas is injected into aging oil fields to push out remaining crude.

Environmental groups focused on energy decried the cuts. Steven Nadel, executive director of the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy, said the move was short-sighted and could stifle innovation.

“Locking domestic plants into outdated technology is not a recipe for future competitiveness or bringing manufacturing jobs back to American communities,” Nadel said.

The Center for Climate and Energy Solutions estimated that the cuts to the projects, meant to be test cases for huge industrial programs, could result in the loss of 25,000 jobs and $4.6 billion in economic output.",https://s1.stabroeknews.com/images/2019/06/sn-article-default.png,N,,2025-06-01 05:02:57.956650

Sublime Systems, which lost an $87 million grant, was “surprised and disappointed,” the company said in a statement.
Moreover, the announcement marks the latest of the administration's attacks on clean energy, broadly, and its effort to slash federal support for projects addressing climate change.

The grants, largely awarded during former President Joe Biden's final few months in the White House, were primarily for programs to capture carbon emissions and store them underground. Other targeted efforts span cleaner cement, natural gas and more.

Some of the 24 canceled awards include $500 million to Heidelberg Materials US, Inc.; $375 million to Eastman Chemical Company; $95 million to Nevada Gold Mines, LLC; and $270 million to Sutter CCUS, among others, according to a list provided by the Department of Energy. Sublime Systems, which lost an $87 million grant, was “surprised and disappointed,” the company said in a statement.

“Today’s action is bad for U.S. competitiveness in the global market and also directly contradictory to the administration’s stated goals of supporting energy production and environmental innovation,” said Conrad Schneider, a senior director at the Clean Air Task Force. It “undercuts U.S. competitiveness at a time when there is a growing global market for cleaner industrial products and technologies.”

The news was a swift follow-up to plans the Energy Department announced earlier this month to review 179 funded projects, totaling over $15 billion, that were awarded by the Office of Clean Energy Demonstrations created under the 2021 bipartisan infrastructure law.

It is part of Wright's pledge to ensure “responsible” spending — aligning with the government's broader efficiency and cost-cutting measures, such as those recommended by the Department of Government Efficiency, which has significantly impacted federal research, workers and agencies.

“While the previous administration failed to conduct a thorough financial review before signing away billions of taxpayer dollars, the Trump administration is doing our due diligence to ensure we are utilizing taxpayer dollars to strengthen our national security, bolster affordable, reliable energy sources and advance projects that generate the highest possible return on investment,"" Wright said in Friday's statement.

Moreover, the announcement marks the latest of the administration's attacks on clean energy, broadly, and its effort to slash federal support for projects addressing climate change.

The Trump administration has taken an ax to Biden-era environmental ambitions, rolled back landmark regulations, withdrawn climate project funding, and instead bolstered support for oil and gas production in the name of an “American energy dominance” agenda.

Steven Nadel, executive director of the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy, called the news “shortsighted.”

Carbon capture has been a controversial climate solution, as skeptics say it enables the continued burning of fossil fuels oil, coal and natural gas that emit planet-warming greenhouse gases — including carbon dioxide — and distracts from the need to cut ties with those energy sources altogether. Though investment in the technology has grown, it also remains challenging to scale.

Industry decries the news

Organizations quickly decried the secretary's actions, stressing that the cancelations don't align with the administration's goals to bolster domestic manufacturing or energy independence.

Jessie Stolark, the executive director of the nonpartisan Carbon Capture Coalition, said the news “is a major step backward"" for carbon management technologies, which are “crucial to meeting America’s growing demand for affordable, reliable, and sustainable energy.”

“These projects are not just reducing pollution, they are keeping the U.S. on the cutting edge of manufacturing technology,"" said Mike Williams, senior fellow on the energy and environment team at public policy and advocacy group the Center for American Progress. ""Canceling these important projects will raise energy prices for consumers and sacrifice thousands of high-quality union jobs, all because the president wants to curry favor with Big Oil.”

Evan Gillespie, partner at decarbonization organization, Industrious Labs, said the move dismantles the economy and the future of American manufacturing and its workforce.

Gretchen Whitmer are trying to win court rulings that would force Enbridge to remove the existing pipeline from the straits for good.
Concerns about the aging pipeline rupturing and causing a potentially disastrous spill in the straits have been building over the last decade.","Building an underground tunnel for an aging Enbridge oil pipeline that stretches across a Great Lakes channel could destroy wetlands and harm bat habitats but would eliminate the chances of a boat anchor rupturing the line and causing a catastrophic spill, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers said Friday in a long-awaited draft analysis of the proposed project's environmental impacts.

The analysis moves the corps a step closer to approving the tunnel for Line 5 in the Straits of Mackinac. The tunnel was proposed in 2018 at a cost of $500 million but has been bogged down by legal challenges. The corps fast-tracked the project in April after President Donald Trump ordered federal agencies in January to identify energy projects for expedited emergency permitting.

A final environmental assessment is expected by autumn, with a permitting decision to follow later this year. The agency initially planned to issue a permitting decision in early 2026.

With that permit in hand, Enbridge would only need permission from the Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes and Energy before it could begin constructing the tunnel. That's far from a given, though.

Environmentalists have been pressuring the state to deny the permit. Meanwhile, Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel and Gov. Gretchen Whitmer are trying to win court rulings that would force Enbridge to remove the existing pipeline from the straits for good.

Construction could have major short-term, long-term impacts

The analysis notes that the tunnel would eliminate the risk of a boat anchor rupturing the pipeline and causing a spill in the straits, a key concern for environmentalists. But the construction would have sweeping effects on everything from recreation to wildlife.

Many of the impacts, such as noise, vistas marred by 400-foot (121-meter) cranes, construction lights degrading stargazing opportunities at Headlands International Dark Sky Park and vibrations that would disturb aquatic wildlife would end when the work is completed, the report found.

Other impacts would last longer, including the loss of wetlands and vegetation on both sides of the strait that connects Lake Huron and Lake Michigan, and the loss of nearly 300 trees that the northern long-eared bat and tricolored bat use to roost. Grading and excavation also could disturb or destroy archaeological sites.

The tunnel-boring machine could cause vibrations that could shift the area's geology. Soil in the construction area could become contaminated and nearly 200 truck trips daily during the six-year construction period would degrade area roads, the analysis found. Gas mixing with water seeping into the tunnel could result in an explosion, but the analysis notes that Enbridge plans to install fans to properly ventilate the tunnel during excavation.

Enbridge has pledged to comply with all safety standards, replant vegetation where possible and contain erosion, the analysis noted. The company also has said it would try to limit the loudest work to daytime hours as much as possible, and offset harm to wetlands and protected species by buying credits through mitigation banks. That money can then be used to fund restoration in other areas.

“Our goal is to have the smallest possible environmental footprint,” Enbridge officials said in a statement.

The Sierra Club issued a statement Friday saying the tunnel remains “an existential threat.”

“Chances of an oil spill in the Great Lakes — our most valuable freshwater resource — skyrockets if this tunnel is built in the Straits,” the group said. “We can't drink oil. We can't fish or swim in oil.”

Julie Goodwin, a senior attorney with Earthjustice, an environmental law group that opposes the project, said the corps failed to consider the impacts of a spill that could still happen on either side of the straits or stopping the flow of oil through the Great Lakes.

“My key takeaways are the Army corps has put blinders are in service to Enbridge and President Trump's fossil fuel agenda,"" she said.

Tunnel would protect portion of Line 5 running through straits

Enbridge has been using the Line 5 pipeline to transport crude oil and natural gas liquids between Superior, Wisconsin, and Sarnia, Ontario, since 1953. Roughly 4 miles (6 kilometers) of the pipeline runs along the bottom of the Straits of Mackinac.

Concerns about the aging pipeline rupturing and causing a potentially disastrous spill in the straits have been building over the last decade. Those fears intensified in 2018 when an anchor damaged the line.

Enbridge contends that the line remains structurally sound, but it struck a deal with then-Michigan Gov. Rick Snyder's administration in 2018 that calls for the company to replace the straits portion of the line with a new section that would be encased in a protective underground tunnel.

Enbridge and environmentalists spar in court battles

Environmentalists, Native American tribes and Democrats have been fighting in court for years to stop the tunnel and force Enbridge to remove the existing pipeline from the straits. They've had little success so far.

A Michigan appellate court in February validated the state Public Service Commission's permits for the tunnel. Nessel sued in 2019 seeking to void the easement that allows Line 5 to run through the straits. That case is still pending. Whitmer revoked the easement in 2020, but Enbridge challenged that decision and a federal appellate court in April ruled that the case can proceed.

Another legal fight over Line 5 in Wisconsin

About 12 miles (19 kilometers) of Line 5 runs across the Bad River Band of Lake Superior Chippewa’s reservation in northern Wisconsin. That tribe sued in 2019 to force Enbridge to remove the line from the reservation, arguing it’s prone to spilling and that easements allowing it to operate on the reservation expired in 2013.

Enbridge has proposed a 41-mile (66-kilometer) reroute around the reservation. The tribe has filed a lawsuit seeking to void state construction permits for the project and has joined several other groups in challenging the permits through the state's contested case process.",https://wsbt.com/resources/media2/16x9/2592/986/204x0/90/32db3eb1-dbaa-4c9b-ae41-edc65ba460a4-AP25150555797830.jpg,N,,2025-06-01 10:06:58.253988

Also according to the KED report, GM primary battery supplier LG Energy Solution will make room for LFP battery manufacturing in sections of its two Ohio and Tennessee facilities.
It has already said that the back-from-the-dead Chevrolet Bolt EV will get LFP battery packs, as will at least one variant of the Silverado EV.","Once upon a time, the first automobiles, which were referred to at the time as horseless carriages, used internal-combustion engines, but electrically powered automobiles soon became popular in many urban areeas, especially in New York City, and by 1900, accounted for about one-third of all motorized vehicles on the road in the United Staters. These early EVs cost more than gasoline-powered automobiles and had far less range. In addition, they had limited range, with the Electrobat at the bottom of the rankings with 25 miles (40 km), while Standard Electric and Fritchle Electric boasted their vehicles could attain ranges between 80 and 110 miles (129 to 178 km). As a result, in the alternate history universe of „The Two Georges,“ in which the United States never seceded from the British Empire and America got a royal visit from Charles III as one of the other consequences of that, the electric auto became dominant chiefly in the east and northeast, where ample industrial electricity was available, while the steam car was preferred across the rest of the continent.

Plus ça change…

In the 1990s, the first mass-produced, purpose-designed electric vehicle from a major automaker, the General Motors EV-1, was able to travel 55 miles (89 km) on lead–acid battery packs while it could go 105 miles (169 km) on nickel-metal hydride batteries.

Today, the current range champion is the 2025 Lucent Air Grand Touring, which can run 516 miles (830 km) on a full charge. That vehicle has a manufacturer’s suggested list price, or MSRP, of $110,900. By comparison, the 2025 Toyota Corolla Hybrid can travel at least 516 miles on a tankful of petrol, while its MSRP is $23,585. A car buyer can purchase almost five of the Toyotas for what one Lucid Air Grand Touring would cost.

This notwithstanding, when General Motors announced that it had cracked the chemistry of lower-cost, energy-dense electric vehicle batteries just two weeks ago, many groups— from other automakers to clean-energy advocates in the United States to automobile buyers who wanted an EV but felt the “tax they would have to pay for the privilege wasn’t worth the price of tea leaes in Boston Harbor“—held their collective breath.

Please keep your eye on the bouncing battery and remember that current GM truck and SUV batteries use nickel-manganese-cobalt-aluminum, while entry-level variants of the Tesla Model 3 and Model Y as well as the Ford Mustang Mach E use LFP battery packs.

It was just two weeks ago that the General said that it will begin to use lithium manganese-rich, or LMR, battery cells to power its largest electric vehicles, the SUVs and full-size trucks sold by Chevrolet, GMC, and Cadillac. Ultium Cells, GM’s joint-venture battery company with LG Energy Solutions, would begin pilot production of the cells in 2027, with full production slated to be conducted at a site not yet disclosed.

LMR batteries use significantly less nickel and cobalt, substituting more manganese, which is far less expensive that copper or cobalt and far more abundant, than do other types of vehicle batteries.

Few expected the other shoe to drop so quickly, and y’all better get out of the way, as even more shoes may be dropping soon enough, more than in a grim Grimm’s Fairy Tale, if this week’s news is only the beginning.

In an entry that most certainly falls into the “But wait! There’s more!” category, the Korean Economic Daily reported on Tuesday that the General’s two main battery suppliers are indeed planning to bring LFP battery production to the home of baseball, hot dogs, apple pie, and Chevrolet.

But wait, what about the General’s plans to produce LMR battery cells in partnership with GM Ultium partner LG Energy Solutions? Let’s not complicate things with the facts, especially because the vehicles the LMR batteries are destined to go into are larger, heavier, and at the upper-end of what remains of the once elegant GM pecking order that ran Chevrolet, Pontiac, Oldsmobile, Buick, and Cadillac.

Now, back to the LFP announcement. If the timing remains in their favor, the GM partnership LFP plants will be among the first of their kind to open in the United States, as it seems unlikely at this point that Ford’s CATL-backed LFP battery production plant will in fact open next year as originally had been planned.

The Samsung SDI/GM joint venture plant in New Carlisle, Indiana is slated to start manufacturing prismatic cells by early 2027—but again under the “But Wait! There’s more!” subheading, Samsung SDI has already indicated it will refrofit part of the plant to turn out LFP cells, and the company is hot on the trail of the required raw materials and the necessary production equpment.

Also according to the KED report, GM primary battery supplier LG Energy Solution will make room for LFP battery manufacturing in sections of its two Ohio and Tennessee facilities.

For what it’s worth, the General has been mum on much about these plans. It has already said that the back-from-the-dead Chevrolet Bolt EV will get LFP battery packs, as will at least one variant of the Silverado EV. We’ll need to get Ron “Ronco” Popeil to fill us in on that in the near future.

Confused? So are we, but here’s the old lady who lives in a shoe to comment on the news…

This fee will be applied to costs for tourism-related activities including hotels and cruise ships that dock in Hawaii.

Hawaii Gov. Josh Green signed Act 96 into law Tuesday, effectively approving a tax — also known as the “Green Fee” — which is the first of its kind in the nation.

“I hope the world is watching because having something that is a balance between industry and environment is gonna be the way to go forward to protect our people […],” Green said. “And most importantly, to protect the lifestyles and the lives we want our children to have for generations to come.”

The law now increases the the state’s Transient Accommodation Tax (TAT) by .75%, to 11%. This fee will be applied to costs for tourism-related activities including hotels and cruise ships that dock in Hawaii.

To break that down, for every $400 spent, $3 will go towards natural resource protection.

The bill is projected to raise an estimated $100 million a year to address what the state says is about half a billion dollars in critical funding needed to protect Hawaii’s environment.

“The visitor industry will struggle if we do not take action now,” said State Rep. Adrian Tam, chair of the House Committee on Tourism.

Unlike other state programs, the money generated won’t go into a dedicated special fund. Instead, the legislature will reevaluate priorities each year to decide where the money should go based on the greatest environmental need.

The areas of priority are protecting land and aquatic resources, climate and hazard resiliency and sustainable tourism.

The Grassroots Institute of Hawaiʻi, a longtime opponent of the bill, argues that it could end up hurting more than it helps.

“There’s nothing like a Hawaiʻi vacation and that is 100% true. But that doesn’t mean that it won’t affect visitor spending and the attractiveness of the Hawaiʻi as a destination,” said Malia Hill, policy director at the Grassroots Institute of Hawaiʻi.

They argue the fee won’t just fall on tourists, it will also impact local residents and small businesses.

“We travel interisland, for work, to see family, to see friends. So it is a tax on locals, and you cannot get away from that,” Hill said.

India also needs to rapidly build robust electricity transmission infrastructure and energy storage facilities to continue increasing clean power capacity.","BENGALURU, India -- One of the most carbon-polluting countries, India is also making huge efforts to harness the power of the sun, wind and other clean energy sources.

Most of the electricity in India, the world's most populous nation, still comes from coal, one of the dirtiest forms of energy. But coal's dominance is dropping, going from 60% of installed power capacity 11 years ago to less than 50% today, according to India's power ministry.

At the same time, India had its largest ever addition of clean power in the fiscal year between April 2024 and April of this year, adding 30 gigawatts — enough to power nearly 18 million Indian homes.

With a growing middle class and skyrocketing energy needs, how fast India can move away from coal and other fossil fuels, such as gasoline and oil, could have a large impact on global efforts to confront climate change.

Here is a snapshot of India's clean energy transition and some of the challenges.

Solar is now half the cost of power from new coal-powered plants. Availability of cheap components and many sunny days each year in India are some reasons experts say installed solar power increased 30 times in the last decade.

“Solar power is the cheapest it's ever been,” said Ruchita Shah, an energy analyst at climate think-tank Ember. Shah added that dropping costs for energy storage, in the form of batteries, means that renewable power will be the “new normal,"" even when the sun doesn't shine or the wind doesn't blow.

India has nearly 170 gigawatts of renewable energy projects in the pipeline, which are expected to be completed in the next few years.

“I have no doubt that India will reach its target of 500 gigawatts by 2030,” said Raghav Pachouri, an energy expert at Vasudha Foundation, a New Delhi-based think-tank.

Experts say the growth in renewables is being spurred by India's plans to add approximately 50 gigawatts of non-fossil fuel power capacity every year for the next five years and for clean power to provide 50% of the nation’s energy by the decade. When burned, fossil fuels let off greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide, the main driver of climate change.

A 2022 law that made electricity cheaper for companies choosing to buy clean power, the federal government's recommendation that state utilities buy more renewable power and a 2023 government plan to invest $452 million have all catalyzed investments in renewables.

India has the fourth highest amount of clean power installed in the world and government officials said $81 billion has been invested in the renewable energy sector in the last decade. Multiple large-scale renewable power projects have begun operations or are under construction, including one of the world’s largest wind and solar power farms.

“We’ve seen domestic manufacturing capacity, at least when it comes to modules for solar panels, increasing,” said Madhura Joshi, a senior energy analyst at the European think-tank E3G.

Despite the rapid growth, challenges persist. While non-fossil fuel sources now comprise 45% of India’s total installed capacity, their share in actual electricity generation stood at 24% last year. Coal remains the dominant source, accounting for 75% of electricity generation.

The share of solar, wind, small hydro power and biomass in India's electricity generation mix stood at 12%, double what it was in 2014 but still lower than expectations by this time, according to a report by New Delhi-based think-tank, the Centre for Science and Environment.

Installed capacity is growing, but power generation from renewables needs to be optimized and integrated effectively into the grid, the report found.

A recent report by the nonprofit clean energy think-tank, RMI, found that electricity demand is expected to triple by 2050 — driven by more electric vehicles, air conditioners and industrial growth.

Acquiring land for clean energy projects remains a challenge. India also needs to rapidly build robust electricity transmission infrastructure and energy storage facilities to continue increasing clean power capacity.

“India is expected to become the world's third-largest economy in a few years, and I think we will need to adopt renewable energy to do this. There is no option for us because fossil fuels can’t keep pace"" with energy needs, said Deepak Thakur, chief executive officer of Mumbai-based renewable energy company, Mahindra Susten.

Through lowered bills and federal clean energy tax credits, Clairton School District could save $1.5 million over the next three decades, according to Sharon Pillar, executive director of the Pennsylvania Solar Center.

But that figure is at risk.

""Without the federal benefits — which Congress is now considering abruptly ending at the end of this year — it could reduce the savings in Clairton and other schools by almost a third,"" Pillar said.

Last week, the Republican-controlled U.S. House of Representatives passed a spending plan that would phase out clean energy tax credits ahead of the schedule set in the Inflation Reduction Act.

Though public schools are not eligible for tax credits in the same way as a business or individual, schools can still benefit from an ""elective pay option,"" which allows them to get a direct payment from the government for the value of the credit.

The budget bill is now before the U.S. Senate.

U.S. Rep. Summer Lee (D-Pa.), whose 12th congressional district covers Clairton, said programs like Solar for Schools and federal incentives allow schools to reinvest savings in academics, as well as safeguard students' health.

""Every day that they breathe dirty air, it chips away at their future,"" Lee said. ""So, we know that clean energy is about health justice and racial justice, and at the end of the day, it is helping us to protect every child's basic right to breathe clean air.""",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/e07ec92/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4080x2142+0+465/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F2f%2F65%2Fcba3aa2641f79ce5fd323e915fd8%2Fpxl-20250529-151748572.jpg,N,,2025-06-01 01:02:26.075930

Most of the electricity in India, the world’s most populous nation, still comes from coal, one of the dirtiest forms of energy. But coal’s dominance is dropping, going from 60% of installed power capacity 11 years ago to less than 50% today, according to India’s power ministry.

At the same time, India had its largest ever addition of clean power in the fiscal year between April 2024 and April of this year, adding 30 gigawatts — enough to power nearly 18 million Indian homes.

With a growing middle class and skyrocketing energy needs, how fast India can move away from coal and other fossil fuels, such as gasoline and oil, could have a large impact on global efforts to confront climate change.

Here is a snapshot of India’s clean energy transition and some of the challenges.

Renewable energy is now the most economical option

Solar is now half the cost of power from new coal-powered plants. Availability of cheap components and many sunny days each year in India are some reasons experts say installed solar power increased 30 times in the last decade.

“Solar power is the cheapest it’s ever been,” said Ruchita Shah, an energy analyst at climate think-tank Ember. Shah added that dropping costs for energy storage, in the form of batteries, means that renewable power will be the “new normal,” even when the sun doesn’t shine or the wind doesn’t blow.

India has nearly 170 gigawatts of renewable energy projects in the pipeline, which are expected to be completed in the next few years.

“I have no doubt that India will reach its target of 500 gigawatts by 2030,” said Raghav Pachouri, an energy expert at Vasudha Foundation, a New Delhi-based think-tank.

Government policies and private investments push renewables

Experts say the growth in renewables is being spurred by India’s plans to add approximately 50 gigawatts of non-fossil fuel power capacity every year for the next five years and for clean power to provide 50% of the nation’s energy by the decade. When burned, fossil fuels let off greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide, the main driver of climate change.

A 2022 law that made electricity cheaper for companies choosing to buy clean power, the federal government’s recommendation that state utilities buy more renewable power and a 2023 government plan to invest $452 million have all catalyzed investments in renewables.

India has the fourth highest amount of clean power installed in the world and government officials said $81 billion has been invested in the renewable energy sector in the last decade. Multiple large-scale renewable power projects have begun operations or are under construction, including one of the world’s largest wind and solar power farms.

“We’ve seen domestic manufacturing capacity, at least when it comes to modules for solar panels, increasing,” said Madhura Joshi, a senior energy analyst at the European think-tank E3G.

Still, renewables are underutilized

Despite the rapid growth, challenges persist. While non-fossil fuel sources now comprise 45% of India’s total installed capacity, their share in actual electricity generation stood at 24% last year. Coal remains the dominant source, accounting for 75% of electricity generation.

The share of solar, wind, small hydro power and biomass in India’s electricity generation mix stood at 12%, double what it was in 2014 but still lower than expectations by this time, according to a report by New Delhi-based think-tank, the Centre for Science and Environment.

Installed capacity is growing, but power generation from renewables needs to be optimized and integrated effectively into the grid, the report found.

At a clean energy crossroads

A recent report by the nonprofit clean energy think-tank, RMI, found that electricity demand is expected to triple by 2050 — driven by more electric vehicles, air conditioners and industrial growth.

Acquiring land for clean energy projects remains a challenge. India also needs to rapidly build robust electricity transmission infrastructure and energy storage facilities to continue increasing clean power capacity.

“India is expected to become the world’s third-largest economy in a few years, and I think we will need to adopt renewable energy to do this. There is no option for us because fossil fuels can’t keep pace” with energy needs, said Deepak Thakur, chief executive officer of Mumbai-based renewable energy company, Mahindra Susten.

Second, the D. C. Circuit ordered the Board to address the environmental effects of projects separate in time or place from the construction and operation of the railroad line.

The NEPA is an environmental impact review statute that was promulgated in the 1970s, along with a slew of other environmental protection statutes like the Clean Air Act of 1972 and the Endangered Species Act of 1973. Unlike these two statutes, the NEPA is procedural. The statute merely requires an agency to produce an environmental impact statement (EIS) that must address the significant environmental effects of a proposed project and propose alternative measures to mitigate these effects. There is no particular way the statute says that an agency must review the environmental impacts, that discretion in manner is left to the agencies to do as they see fit.

The Supreme Court in this case was asked to review a lower court decision from the US Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit, which found that the US Surface Transportation Board (Board) did not produce an EIS that sufficiently analyzed all of the potential environmental effects of a project proposed by seven Utah counties. The proposed project concerned the construction and operation of an approximately 88-mile railroad line in northeastern Utah that would connect Utah’s oil-rich Uinta Basin to the national rail network.

The lower court specifically stated that the Board did not analyze the potential upstream and downstream effects of the oil drilling in the Basin. The court reversed this notion in a majority decision. Justice Kavanaugh, in the majority opinion joined by the four other conservative members of the Court, stated that:

First, the D. C. Circuit did not afford the Board the substantial judicial deference required in NEPA cases. Second, the D. C. Circuit ordered the Board to address the environmental effects of projects separate in time or place from the construction and operation of the railroad line. But NEPA requires agencies to focus on the environmental effects of the project at issue. Under NEPA, the Board’s EIS did not need to address the environmental effects of upstream oil drilling or downstream oil refining. Rather, it needed to address only the effects of the 88-mile railroad line. And the Board’s EIS did so.

Justice Kavanaugh continued by rejecting the petitioners’ attempt to use the NEPA as a way to air their policy disagreements with the construction of the proposed railroad. He concluded the opinion by stating, “[c]itizens may not enlist the federal courts, ‘under the guise of judicial review’ of agency compliance with NEPA, to delay or block agency projects based on the environmental effects of other projects separate from the project at hand.” The three liberal justices stated in a concurring opinion written by Justice Sotomayor agreed with the approval of the project, but stated that they would have taken a narrower path grounded in case precedent.",https://www.jurist.org/news/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2025/05/Mining_gilsonite_Cowboy_Dike_north_of_Bonanza_Utah_USA_4.jpg,N,,2025-05-31 23:01:15.558979

Because ‘nuclear power, no thanks’ today means ‘climate change, no doubt’ tomorrow.” Similar conversions are taking place across the globe, with once-bitter opponents of nuclear power now advocating for it.
The technology’s backers point out that, despite a handful of high-profile disasters, fewer deaths are linked to nuclear power than wind power.
At Sellafield, the birthplace of British nuclear power, Tim Gregory believes such challenges can and must be overcome.","Yet only one of those stations was ever built: Sizewell B on the Suffolk coast. It was switched on in 1995. Britain hasn’t completed a station since.

This failure is not down to a lack of ambition. Thirty years after the hubris of Howell, Ed Miliband, during his first stint as energy secretary, again announced ten new power stations. When he re-entered the energy department last summer, another 15 years later, construction had started on only one: Hinkley Point C.

Overbudget and overschedule, the Somerset station is now expected to be completed in 2031. With an estimated final price tag of £46 billion, it will be the most expensive power project the world has seen.

On June 11, Milliband will confirm £2.7 billion of funding for Sizewell C, in Suffolk, where ground preparation has begun. He will also announce a new generation of small modular reactors (SMRs) — factory-built miniature nuclear power generators that are seen by many as the future of the sector.

SMRs will cost a fraction of the price and take a fraction of the time to build, and by the early 2030s will be sending vital power into our homes … in theory. Nobody in Britain, or indeed anywhere else, has even built a prototype SMR.

Why, one wonders, is it so fiendishly difficult to build nuclear power stations in this country? With the sector’s questionable safety record and such eye-watering costs, to be met through our energy bills, do we even need new nuclear power?

Out of energy

In the five decades between Howell and Miliband, nuclear has been widely viewed as a silver bullet to solve Britain’s energy conundrum. Backers say it will underpin intermittent wind and solar and diminish our dependency on petrostates such as Saudi Arabia or Russia.

At one point, Britain led the way when it came to nuclear power. The world’s first commercial nuclear power station, Calder Hall, opened at Sellafield in Cumbria in 1956. Throughout the 1960s and 1970s, new stations sprang up from Dungeness to Torness, Anglesey to Hartlepool. For decades, those stations provided the baseload that underpinned Britain’s power system.

In 1997, there were 17 stations in operation, providing 27 per cent of the UK’s electricity. But when cheap gas was discovered in the North Sea, triggering the 1990s “dash for gas”, the newly privatised energy sector all but gave up on nuclear. Today only five of our ageing nuclear power stations are still operating in Britain — and four of them are scheduled to close by 2030, having already had their lifespans extended.

The 2011 Fukushima nuclear disaster in Japan contributed to the slowdown — not only in the UK but worldwide — adding to lingering fears from the 1979 Three Mile Island meltdown in the US and 1986 Chernobyl catastrophe in Ukraine. Environmentalists in the past have viewed nuclear power as not only dangerous and expensive but also potentially polluting — the half-life of uranium-235, the fuel used in most reactors, is 700 million years, and nobody has yet figured out how to safely store it.

Undeterred by such niggles, Miliband is now preparing to relaunch our nuclear sector once again, saying: “We are shaking up the planning rules to make it easier to build nuclear power stations of all types across the country, ending the status quo and building a nuclear resurgence here in Britain.”

‘The penny is dropping’

We have heard such rhetoric before. This time, however, experts say politicians are acting with a new sense of urgency.

“It’s just dawning on us what it will take to seriously electrify society,” says Tim Gregory, a nuclear chemist at Sellafield and the author of Going Nuclear: How the Atom Will Save the World. “Electric cars, electric heating systems, artificial intelligence — these all use an enormous amount of electricity.”

For advocates of nuclear, the drive to net-zero carbon emissions makes acceleration all the more important. Last year, Britain’s last coal-fired power station closed in the name of lower emissions. By the end of the decade, Labour also wants to eliminate gas, which provides a third of the country’s electricity.

Wind and solar power are being rolled out at speed, but when the wind doesn’t blow and the sun doesn’t shine, without fossil fuels to fill the gap, blackouts will be a serious threat.

“How do you make those enormous quantities of electricity and achieve net zero at the same time?” Gregory asks. “The penny is dropping: nuclear is a really obvious answer to that.”

Critics in Westminster whisper that Miliband is so wedded to renewables that he does not take nuclear seriously. They point to a left-wing tradition, epitomised by his activist parents Ralph and Marion, that they say puts the energy secretary closer to the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament than to Great British Nuclear.

His allies, however, say Miliband’s green conviction is precisely why he is so determined to revive nuclear power.

Miliband explained his reasoning in a 2009 speech to the TUC, saying: “I have to confess to you that I did not grow up in a pro-nuclear family, but the truth is that climate change should change everyone’s view about nuclear power. Because ‘nuclear power, no thanks’ today means ‘climate change, no doubt’ tomorrow.”

Similar conversions are taking place across the globe, with once-bitter opponents of nuclear power now advocating for it. In most cases it is not climate change but trade wars and actual wars that are driving a flight to self-sufficiency.

China steaming ahead

“In the post-Ukraine, post-Covid era, where we’ve seen energy prices spike and a lot more political instability, there’s a new desire to create energy independence from the outside world,” says Andy Champ, who leads the UK nuclear programme of GE Hitachi, an American-Japanese conglomerate hoping to build Britain’s SMRs.

Many countries are attempting to restart stalled sectors. Since the 1990s, nuclear construction has ground virtually to a halt across the West. France — whose 57 reactors generate 65 per cent of its power, the legacy of a 1970s building spree — last year completed its first new station in 25 years.

In 2023 and 2024, the US built its first new units since 1996, with such steep overruns that the manufacturer, Westinghouse, filed for bankruptcy midway through construction.

But the fears of the past are giving way to a new pragmatism. The technology’s backers point out that, despite a handful of high-profile disasters, fewer deaths are linked to nuclear power than wind power.

Germany, which closed its nuclear programme in the wake of Fukushima, last month ended its long-standing opposition to new European nuclear projects. Denmark, which banned nuclear power in 1985, is also reconsidering its position. Even Japan, which closed most of its reactors after the 2011 disaster, is looking to reopen old stations in a bid to reduce its reliance on imported fossil fuels.

Public opposition is melting away worldwide. In America, net support for nuclear power rose from 3 per cent in 1983 to 54 per cent last year. This has coincided with a need for new power for data centres and electricity-hungry artificial intelligence.

US energy planners are keenly aware that America’s great geo-economic rival has steamed ahead. China has more nuclear power under construction than the rest of the world combined. Since 2020 it has started work on 22 new reactors. South Korea is not only building steadily but also exporting its technology, with four new plants completed in the United Arab Emirates since 2021, on time and on budget.

Thinking small may help

There is now an opportunity for Britain to recover momentum. Sizewell C is designed as a replica of Hinkley Point C. But industry insiders say ministers need to act quickly to take advantage of lessons from Somerset.

There are 12,000 people working at Hinkley and another 14,000 people employed across the UK providing services and expertise for the project. Recruiting and training them was expensive and time-consuming. If Sizewell can get going soon, a large bulk of the workforce could, in theory, transfer straight from Somerset to Suffolk. But if there are more delays, they are likely to seek employment in other sectors or overseas.

Finance is another challenge. When work started in 2017, Hinkley Point C was budgeted as a £17 billion project. It will end up costing nearly three times as much.

“The old school of thought was that economies of scale come through building big,” says Champ, who worked for the British government before moving to GE Hitachi. “But you’ve now got to find £40 billion-plus to build one of these things, and you’ve got to wait ten years-plus before you start getting any payback on your loan.”

SMRs could solve this headache. Each of these modules generates roughly 300 megawatts — about a fifth of the output of each of the two giant 1.63 gigawatt reactors at Hinkley Point C. They also take up much less space: one could easily fit on two football pitches, while the Hinkley site covers the equivalent of 245.

Next week Great British Nuclear will announce the winner of a competition to build the UK’s first SMRs, which will also be the world’s first if they get a move on. Four companies are in the running: GE Hitachi, Rolls-Royce, Holtec and a restructured Westinghouse.

Although some politicians talk whimsically of having one of these reactors on every street corner, Champ says this is unlikely to happen, at least in the short term.

Initially, the plan is to build SMRs on existing or decommissioned nuclear sites. Although no location has been confirmed, last year Great British Nuclear bought the former nuclear sites of Wylfa, on Anglesey, and Oldbury, Gloucestershire, both of which have been talked about as SMR sites. Engineers envisage as many as ten SMRs would be built on a single site, creating a station with a total output similar to Hinkley’s.

The key advantage is the financing. SMRs are expected to cost about £3 billion each, less than a tenth of the cost of a full nuclear station. But Champ says: “You’re not going to get the efficiencies [building] just two or three or four. You need to start building 10, 20, 30 of these to really see the advantages.”

If a fleet of miniature nuclear stations does spring up across Britain, a key challenge remains: what to do with the spent fuel and other radioactive waste. Nuclear Waste Services, which is owned by the government, is trying to find a site to dig a huge underground cavern — a “geological waste-disposal” facility — in which to bury radioactive material.

Three potential sites have been identified: two in Cumbria and one in Lincolnshire. But even if locals agree to the proposals, it will be the 2050s at the very earliest before such a facility opens. The budget for such a site is estimated at up to £53 billion.

At Sellafield, the birthplace of British nuclear power, Tim Gregory believes such challenges can and must be overcome. “We’ve done it before and we can do it again,” he says. “If you solve the energy problem, then you solve the economic problem, the environmental problem, the humanitarian problem. Nuclear power can do that.”",https://www.thetimes.com/imageserver/image/%2Fbbad4058-09df-451c-aaa3-3a18a053ab93.jpg?crop=4369%2C2458%2C0%2C0&resize=1200,N,,2025-05-31 22:04:49.610572

(WMBD) — A federal agency has awarded the city of Galesburg more than $1.2 million to address environmental impacts.

The city has been notified of the awards and is now working to submit all required documentation,” he said.
The Assessment Grant will be used to evaluate two different sites that have been labeled as a brownfield.
The site has housed industrial buildings in the past that Gugliotta says have led to environmental concerns.","GALESBURG, Ill. (WMBD) — A federal agency has awarded the city of Galesburg more than $1.2 million to address environmental impacts.

The money comes from the Environmental Protection Agency in the form of two grants, the Assessment Grant worth $500,000 and the Cleanup Grant worth more than $713,000, Steve Gugliotta, the city’s director of community development, said.

“These funds will help address the environmental impacts of historically contaminated properties, paving the way for community revitalization and economic development. The city has been notified of the awards and is now working to submit all required documentation,” he said.

The two grants will be used for a few different projects, with the bulk of the cleanup grant going to remediate the old Knox Laundry site, he said.

The facility, which used to sit at 57 North Kellogg Street and 332 East Ferris Street, opened in 1898 as a retail laundry store which was expanded into a multi-story dry-cleaning facility, he said.

Between 2006 and 2007, the court ordered the demolition of the building after it had been vacated and condemned because of its deteriorating condition.

“Terminating the business operations and removing former structures has stopped the potential for any continuing releases of contamination into our environment,” he said. “But until the site is fully remediated, the potential for redevelopment is very limited.”

The money will help the city address remaining contamination, more specifically areas where soil has been “impacted above saturation limits,” Gugliotta said.

The Assessment Grant will be used to evaluate two different sites that have been labeled as a brownfield.

“A brownfield is a property, the expansion, redevelopment, or reuse of which may be complicated by the presence or potential presence of a hazardous substance, pollutant, or contaminant,” the EPA’s website said.

The first of these two brownfields is the former Broadview Hotel located at 29 Public Square, which throughout its time was home to many businesses, including a filling station which dates back to 1927, he said.

The second was the former Tucker’s Printing Company, located on North Cherry Street, which was recently demolished after it had a second fire in 2024, he said.

The site has housed industrial buildings in the past that Gugliotta says have led to environmental concerns.

With any money from these grants, they may have left over sites that will be selected by a Brownfields Inventory, which was put together in 2023 by Kansas State University’s Technical Assistance to Brownfield program, as well as consultants at Terracon, he said.

He said they are anticipating the project to run from Oct. 1, 2025, until Sept. 30, 2029, although that is just an estimate, and the projects may not take that much time.",https://www.centralillinoisproud.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/57/2019/06/cropped-CIProud_2019-1.png?strip=1,N,,2025-05-31 20:06:55.208924

The grants, largely awarded during former President Joe Biden's final few months in the White House, were primarily for programs to capture carbon emissions and store them underground.
Sublime Systems, which lost an $87 million grant, was “surprised and disappointed,” the company said in a statement.
Moreover, the announcement marks the latest of the administration's attacks on clean energy, broadly, and its effort to slash federal support for projects addressing climate change.
“Killing these projects means more emissions, more pollution, and more people getting sick,” he said.","WASHINGTON — Energy Secretary Chris Wright said Friday he canceled nearly $4 billion in project grants, in another massive blow to clean energy and greenhouse gas emissions reduction efforts in the U.S. under President Donald Trump's administration.

The grants, largely awarded during former President Joe Biden's final few months in the White House, were primarily for programs to capture carbon emissions and store them underground. Other targeted efforts span cleaner cement, natural gas and more.

Some of the 24 canceled awards include $500 million to Heidelberg Materials US, Inc.; $375 million to Eastman Chemical Company; $95 million to Nevada Gold Mines, LLC; and $270 million to Sutter CCUS, among others, according to a list provided by the Department of Energy. Sublime Systems, which lost an $87 million grant, was “surprised and disappointed,” the company said in a statement.

“Today’s action is bad for U.S. competitiveness in the global market and also directly contradictory to the administration’s stated goals of supporting energy production and environmental innovation,” said Conrad Schneider, a senior director at the Clean Air Task Force. It “undercuts U.S. competitiveness at a time when there is a growing global market for cleaner industrial products and technologies.”

The news was a swift follow-up to plans the Energy Department announced earlier this month to review 179 funded projects, totaling over $15 billion, that were awarded by the Office of Clean Energy Demonstrations created under the 2021 bipartisan infrastructure law.

It is part of Wright's pledge to ensure “responsible” spending — aligning with the government's broader efficiency and cost-cutting measures, such as those recommended by the Department of Government Efficiency, which has significantly impacted federal research, workers and agencies.

“While the previous administration failed to conduct a thorough financial review before signing away billions of taxpayer dollars, the Trump administration is doing our due diligence to ensure we are utilizing taxpayer dollars to strengthen our national security, bolster affordable, reliable energy sources and advance projects that generate the highest possible return on investment,"" Wright said in Friday's statement.

Moreover, the announcement marks the latest of the administration's attacks on clean energy, broadly, and its effort to slash federal support for projects addressing climate change.

The Trump administration has taken an ax to Biden-era environmental ambitions, rolled back landmark regulations, withdrawn climate project funding, and instead bolstered support for oil and gas production in the name of an “American energy dominance” agenda.

Steven Nadel, executive director of the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy, called the news “shortsighted.”

Carbon capture has been a controversial climate solution, as skeptics say it enables the continued burning of fossil fuels oil, coal and natural gas that emit planet-warming greenhouse gases — including carbon dioxide — and distracts from the need to cut ties with those energy sources altogether. Though investment in the technology has grown, it also remains challenging to scale.

Industry decries the news

Organizations quickly decried the secretary's actions, stressing that the cancelations don't align with the administration's goals to bolster domestic manufacturing or energy independence.

Jessie Stolark, the executive director of the nonpartisan Carbon Capture Coalition, said the news “is a major step backward"" for carbon management technologies, which are “crucial to meeting America’s growing demand for affordable, reliable, and sustainable energy.”

“These projects are not just reducing pollution, they are keeping the U.S. on the cutting edge of manufacturing technology,"" said Mike Williams, senior fellow on the energy and environment team at public policy and advocacy group the Center for American Progress. ""Canceling these important projects will raise energy prices for consumers and sacrifice thousands of high-quality union jobs, all because the president wants to curry favor with Big Oil.”

Evan Gillespie, partner at decarbonization organization, Industrious Labs, said the move dismantles the economy and the future of American manufacturing and its workforce.

Ford Executive Chair Bill Ford emphasized the critical role of these tax credits, stating, “The production tax credit that we made the investment around, it seems to be up for grabs,” warning that their loss could “imperil” the project.

The BlueOval Battery Park, currently under construction and 60% complete, is a cornerstone of Ford’s electric vehicle (EV) strategy, with production of lithium iron phosphate batteries slated to begin in 2026. The plant is expected to create 1,700 jobs and has already prompted Ford to invest over $450,000 in local community initiatives in Calhoun County. However, the project has faced challenges, including a turbulent EV market that led Ford to scale back its initial $3.5 billion investment to $2.5–$3 billion and reduce job projections from 2,500 to 1,700. The state of Michigan also cut its incentive package from $210 million to $141 million in response to Ford’s downsizing, reflecting the project’s precarious footing amid shifting economic and policy landscapes

What clean energy projects have been canceled Some of the most recent cancellations include the Kore Power battery factory in Arizona and BorgWarner’s closure of two EV manufacturing sites in Michigan.
Of the projects canceled this year, most — more than $12 billion worth — came in Republican-led states and congressional districts, the analysis said.
Red districts have benefited more than blue ones from an influx of clean energy development and jobs, experts say.
Still, $4.5 billion in development was canceled or delayed last month, according to E2’s tally.","More than $14 billion in clean energy investments in the U.S. have been canceled or delayed this year, according to an analysis released Thursday, as President Donald Trump’s pending megabill has raised fears over the future of domestic battery, electric vehicle and solar and wind energy development.

Many companies are concerned that investments will be in jeopardy amid House Republicans’ passage of a tax bill that would gut clean energy credits, nonpartisan group E2 said in its analysis of projects that it and consultancy Atlas Public Policy tracked.

The groups estimate the losses since January have also cost 10,000 new clean energy jobs.

The tax credits, bolstered in the landmark climate bill passed under former President Joe Biden in 2022, are crucial for boosting renewable technologies key to the clean energy transition. E2 estimates that $132 billion in plans have been announced since the so-called Inflation Reduction Act passed, not counting the cancellations.

Last week’s House bill effectively renders moot many of the law’s incentives. Advocacy groups decried the potential impact that could have on the industry after the multitrillion-dollar tax breaks package passed.

“The House’s plan coupled with the administration’s focus on stomping out clean energy and returning us to a country powered by coal and gas guzzlers is causing businesses to cancel plans, delay their plans and take their money and jobs to other countries instead,” E2 executive director Bob Keefe said.

The Senate is now reviewing the bill with an informal July 4 deadline to get it to the president’s desk.

What clean energy projects have been canceled

Some of the most recent cancellations include the Kore Power battery factory in Arizona and BorgWarner’s closure of two EV manufacturing sites in Michigan. Bosch suspended a $200 million investment in a hydrogen fuel cell factory in South Carolina, citing changes within the market over the past year in a statement to The Associated Press.

Tariffs, inflationary pressures, nascent company struggles and low adoption rates for some technologies may also have been reasons for these companies’ plans changing. For instance, the battery storage and electric vehicle sectors have seen the most impact in 2025, with the latter especially having had had a difficult past few years. Several projects spurred by the IRA were also canceled prior to 2025.

Of the projects canceled this year, most — more than $12 billion worth — came in Republican-led states and congressional districts, the analysis said. Red districts have benefited more than blue ones from an influx of clean energy development and jobs, experts say.

Georgia and Tennessee are particularly at risk because they are highly invested in EV and battery production, said Marilyn Brown, an energy policy professor at the Georgia Institute of Technology who was not involved in the analysis.

“If all of a sudden these tax credits are removed, I’m not sure how these ongoing projects are going to continue,” said Fengqi You, an engineering professor at Cornell University who also was not involved.

A handful of Republican lawmakers have urged the continuation of energy tax credits, with some saying in an April letter to Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D. that a repeal could disrupt the American people and weaken the county’s position as a global energy leader.

The US and the global stage

The Trump administration has sought to dismantle much of Biden’s environmental and climate-related policy — what he calls the Democrats’ “green new scam” — withdrawing again from the Paris climate agreement, rolling back countless landmark pollution regulations and environmental initiatives, reconsidering scientific findings supporting climate action, blocking renewable energy sources and more in an effort to bolster a fossil fuel-led “American energy dominance” agenda.

Meanwhile other countries are proceeding with green investments. The European Parliament is committing to the European Union Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism, a policy meant to prevent “carbon leakage,” or companies moving production to countries where climate policies are less strict. And the International Maritime Organization is moving toward a global carbon tax on shipping.

In a sign that not all hope is lost for the future of renewables in the U.S., April alone saw nearly $500 million in new development, with Japanese manufacturing company Hitachi’s energy arm building out transmission and electrification operations in Virginia and materials and technology company Corning investing in solar manufacturing in Michigan.

Also, we hear from Debbie Kelley, the “pollinator lady.” Hear about local efforts to restore pollinator habitats in south central Indiana.

Migrating birds are the ultimate endurance athletes. Some migratory songbirds weigh no more than a few ounces but fly nonstop across oceans to find food in the winter and nesting sites in the summer. There are more than 300 bird species – including birds of prey, songbirds, waterfowl and shorebirds – that migrate through the Midwest.

They follow the Mississippi Flyway, a superhighway in the sky that broadly traces the Mississippi River, extending north to Canada and south to Central and South America. The flyway encompasses many important Midwest habitats, including the restored bottomland forests along the lower Wabash River in southwestern Indiana and the prairies of Kankakee Sands.

During migration, birds depend on suitable habitats to rest and refuel, just as we need to rest and fill up on long hikes or road trips. North America has lost nearly 3 billion birds since 1970, much of that due to habitat loss. By helping to protect and restore vital pit stops along the flyway – in the Midwest and throughout the Americas – we are providing birds and other wildlife with a needed lifeline.

The southwest corner of Indiana, where the Wabash and Ohio rivers flow together, contains perhaps the widest array of habitats in the entire state. Here you will find cypress swamps, oak barrens and oxbow lakes in the big river floodplains, creating a home for many rare plants and animals, as well as providing critical stopover sites for migratory birds.

From a few critically endangered whooping cranes to hundreds of thousands of ducks and geese, the increasing numbers of birds delight birdwatchers, hunters and those of us who just enjoy hearing a warbler’s song outside our window. These birds, and hundreds of other species, are responding to the many conservation efforts to protect and restore area habitat. They also represent the quality of habitat that remains to be protected in southwest Indiana.

Using cutting edge mapping tools to prioritize potential restoration sites, The Nature Conservancy is transforming altered landscapes back to functioning floodplain habitat. Ultimately, greater numbers of migratory birds will utilize the area during their long journeys.

As a part of the larger Mississippi River basin, the Wabash River and its tributaries are a top conservation priority. The Nature Conservancy is focusing on water quality and quantity concerns and are working to reduce the impacts of intensive land use and address habitat loss.

Chicago, the third-largest city in the United States, now powers its more than 400 city-owned buildings – including firehouses, libraries and two major airports – using renewable energy. The shift is expected to slash the Windy City’s carbon emissions by 290,000 metric tons annually, the equivalent of the pollution from 62,000 cars. “Chicago’s efforst are a model for other state and city officials,” says EDF energy policy specialist Curt Stokes. Most of Chicago’s power comes from a massive solar array in central Illinois. Built over the last two years, the solar project created hundreds of new jobs in the state.

Part of the city’s successful transition to clean energy is owed to the Climate and Equitable Jobs Act of 2021, an Illinois law. The act aims to reduce climate pollution while creatinf a clean-energy workforce. Chicago got serious about transitioning to 100% renewable energy during the first Trump administration, when advocates began calling for local climate action in the absence of federal leadership.

“We have a responsibility to lead through climate action that benefits the people and the planer,” says Angela Tovar, Chicago’s chief sustainability officer. “By moving to renewable energy for city operations, we’re moving closer to our goal of making all energy consumed in Chicago renewable by 2035, and ultimately to a more sustainable future for all.”

A group of young people are suing the Trump Administration for prioritizing the use of fossil fuels — and driving up planet-warming emissions. The suit was filed Thursday morning in a Montana federal court. The plaintiffs are twenty-two young people from across the country – including ten of the youth plaintiffs in Montana’s climate case. The state supreme court ruled in their favor last year.

They are now suing over a suite of President Trump’s policies. That includes directives to promote fossil fuel development, exempt coal plants from having to filter toxic air pollution, stop all wind energy development, and defund scientific research on climate change. Trump says the U.S. needs to boost domestic energy production and limit regulations on the industry.

Livingston student Eva Lighthiser is the lead plaintiff- and one of the sixteen young people that sued the state of Montana. “We as young people are inheriting this future that is very uncertain and it is quite scary for us, and we are doing the best that we can to protect and preserve a safe future for ourselves. And I don’t think that’s too much to ask,” Lighthiser said.

She says the Trump administration’s actions will worsen climate change and the harms her generation faces as a result. She says these changes violate her, and the other plaintiff’s rights to life and liberty under the US Constitution. Julia Olson is one of the lawyers on the case, and the head of the nonprofit law firm Our Children’s Trust that’s brought these youth-led climate cases.

“The pollution from fossil fuels, in and of itself, is a danger, but it is truly threatening the life support system that these plaintiffs need to live and grow healthy,” Olson said. They are asking the court to block the Trump policies, and reinstate climate change information and monitoring across government sites.

Unlike the residential clean energy property credit, you cannot carry forward any unused energy-efficient home improvement credits to future years.
For more on these credits and the documentation they require, read Tax Credits for Energy-Efficiency Home Improvement in 2025.","If you are mulling installing solar panels on your roof or making other energy-efficient improvements to your home, you may want to act quickly to take advantage of one of two federal income tax credits. First, is the residential clean energy property credit for homeowners who install a power system that uses solar or other renewable energy. Second, is the energy-efficient home improvement credit for homeowners who make smaller energy-saving purchases for their homes.

How long these two credits — which reduce the taxes you owe dollar for dollar — will remain on the books, and what, if any, changes will be made, are currently open questions. On May 22, the House passed its One Big Beautiful Bill that would extend the tax changes in the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act that automatically expire at the end of 2025. The bill also provides lots of other tax breaks.

The House's One Big Beautiful Bill would also scale back many of the green energy tax credits that were created, expanded or renewed in the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act., including the home energy savings tax credits. Specifically, the bill would repeal the residential clean energy property credit and the energy efficient home improvement credit, effective for property placed in service after 2025.

Now it's the Senate's turn. The odds are good that Congress will pass a tax package sometime this summer, despite a series of hurdles that lawmakers will have to overcome. However, the Senate will make some changes to the bill, including possible revisions to the green energy tax credits.

Since homeowners may claim a home energy credit only for the year the improvements are made, if you’re thinking of making any energy-saving upgrades, you’ll want to pay for them and get them completed before December 31 to ensure a tax credit. They should be claimed using IRS Form 5695.

The residential clean energy property credit

This tax break is for homeowners who install an alternative energy system that relies on a renewable energy source, such as solar, wind, geothermal, or fuel cell or battery storage technology. Think solar panels, solar-powered water heaters, geothermal heat pumps, wind turbines, fuel cells, etc. The credit equals 30% of the cost of materials and installation or systems that you install in your home. There is no maximum credit dollar limit for solar, geothermal, wind, or battery storage systems. But for fuel cells, the credit is capped at $500 for each half-kilowatt of power capacity.

Unused residential clean energy property credits can be carried forward to reduce tax owed in future years. Homeowners who install a renewable energy system sometimes qualify for a rebate. These rebates are nontaxable, but they reduce the system’s cost for figuring the credit.

Read more: Are Clean Energy Tax Credits a Thing of the Past?

The energy efficient home improvement credit

The basic credit is 30% of the cost and installation of certain types of insulation, boilers, central air-conditioning systems, water heaters, heat pumps, exterior doors and windows, etc., that you install in a home. These items must also meet certain energy-efficiency requirements, depending on the product. There is a $1,200 general aggregate yearly credit limit. But many specific upgrades have lower monetary credit limits and others have higher ones.

Here are the item-by-item yearly caps: $150 for a home-energy audit; $500 in aggregate for exterior doors (a maximum of $250 per door); $600 for exterior windows or skylights, and $600 for natural gas, propane or oil water heaters, electric panels, central air conditioners, or natural gas, propane or oil furnaces or hot water boilers. And $2,000 for biomass stoves or biomass boilers, electric or natural gas heat pump water heaters, or electric or natural gas heat pumps. Unlike the residential clean energy property credit, you cannot carry forward any unused energy-efficient home improvement credits to future years.

As an example, let’s say that in 2025, you purchase and install in your home two exterior doors at a cost of $1,000 each, windows and skylights at a total cost of $2,200, and a $6,000 central air conditioner. Your 2025 tax credit amount is $1,200. Now, change the facts. In 2025, you purchase and install in your home a natural gas heat pump that costs $7,000, a $4,000 natural gas tankless water heater, and a $6,000 central air conditioner. Your total maximum credit is $3,200: $2,000 for the heat pump. $600 for the water heater and $600 for the air conditioner.

The plant is expected to be commissioned by December 2027. The green hydrogen produced at this facility will replace the fossil-fuel-based hydrogen currently used in the refinery's operations.

This transition is expected to significantly cut down carbon emissions, helping IndianOil move towards a more sustainable and environment-friendly model.

The company also added that this initiative is in line with Prime Minister Narendra Modi's vision under the National Green Hydrogen Mission and forms a critical part of IndianOil's larger decarbonization strategy.

The project also supports the company's Net Zero target and demonstrates its commitment to leading India's shift towards a cleaner and greener energy future.

Earlier, Arvinder Singh Sahney, Chairman of IOC, during an exclusive conversation with at the World Economic Forum 2025 in Davos, Switzerland, stated that the plant, with a production capacity of 10,000 tons per annum, had made substantial progress.

""Green hydrogen plant is now alive. We have got very good bids for it. And now the tenders are under evaluation. And within a month or so, we will be able to award the job, and within two years, that green hydrogen, the 10,000 tons per annum plant at Panipat (Haryana) will be commissioned"" he said.

AI is eating the world—and the machines behind it are ravenous.

Each ChatGPT query, each model update, each robotic breakthrough consumes massive amounts of energy. In fact, AI is already pushing global power grids to the brink.

Wall Street is pouring hundreds of billions into artificial intelligence—training smarter chatbots, automating industries, and building the digital future. But there’s one urgent question few are asking:

Where will all of that energy come from?

AI is the most electricity-hungry technology ever invented. Each data center powering large language models like ChatGPT consumes as much energy as a small city. And it’s about to get worse.

Even Sam Altman, the founder of OpenAI, issued a stark warning:

“The future of AI depends on an energy breakthrough.”

Elon Musk was even more blunt:

“AI will run out of electricity by next year.”

As the world chases faster, smarter machines, a hidden crisis is emerging behind the scenes. Power grids are strained. Electricity prices are rising. Utilities are scrambling to expand capacity.

And that’s where the real opportunity lies…

One little-known company—almost entirely overlooked by most AI investors—could be the ultimate backdoor play. It’s not a chipmaker. It’s not a cloud platform. But it might be the most important AI stock in the US owns critical energy infrastructure assets positioned to feed the coming AI energy spike.

As demand from AI data centers explodes, this company is gearing up to profit from the most valuable commodity in the digital age: electricity.

The “Toll Booth” Operator of the AI Energy Boom

It owns critical nuclear energy infrastructure assets, positioning it at the heart of America’s next-generation power strategy.

It’s one of the only global companies capable of executing large-scale, complex EPC (engineering, procurement, and construction) projects across oil, gas, renewable fuels, and industrial infrastructure.

It plays a pivotal role in U.S. LNG exportation—a sector about to explode under President Trump’s renewed “America First” energy doctrine.

Trump has made it clear: Europe and U.S. allies must buy American LNG.

And our company sits in the toll booth—collecting fees on every drop exported.

But that’s not all…

As Trump’s proposed tariffs push American manufacturers to bring their operations back home, this company will be first in line to rebuild, retrofit, and reengineer those facilities.

AI. Energy. Tariffs. Onshoring. This One Company Ties It All Together.

While the world is distracted by flashy AI tickers, a few smart investors are quietly scooping up shares of the one company powering it all from behind the scenes.

AI needs energy. Energy needs infrastructure.

And infrastructure needs a builder with experience, scale, and execution.

This company has its finger in every pie—and Wall Street is just starting to notice.

Wall Street is noticing this company also because it is quietly riding all of these tailwinds—without the sky-high valuation.

While most energy and utility firms are buried under mountains of debt and coughing up hefty interest payments just to appease bondholders…

This company is completely debt-free.

In fact, it’s sitting on a war chest of cash—equal to nearly one-third of its entire market cap.

It also owns a huge equity stake in another red-hot AI play, giving investors indirect exposure to multiple AI growth engines without paying a premium.

And here’s what the smart money has started whispering…

The Hedge Fund Secret That’s Starting to Leak Out

This stock is so off-the-radar, so absurdly undervalued, that some of the most secretive hedge fund managers in the world have begun pitching it at closed-door investment summits.

They’re sharing it quietly, away from the cameras, to rooms full of ultra-wealthy clients.

Why? Because excluding cash and investments, this company is trading at less than 7 times earnings.

And that’s for a business tied to:

The AI infrastructure supercycle

The onshoring boom driven by Trump-era tariffs

A surge in U.S. LNG exports

And a unique footprint in nuclear energy—the future of clean, reliable power

You simply won’t find another AI and energy stock this cheap… with this much upside.

This isn’t a hype stock. It’s not riding on hope.

It’s delivering real cash flows, owns critical infrastructure, and holds stakes in other major growth stories.

With the right currency conversion and a bit of context, the prices seem almost too good to be true, especially when it comes to Zhengzhou Nissan’s Z9 lineup.

Zhengzhou Nissan, the truck-centric branch of the Dongfeng-Nissan joint venture, has just expanded the local Z9 lineup with the GE PHEV, a plug-in hybrid that serves as the electrified sibling to the locally-built Nissan Frontier Pro. The company had previously launched gas and diesel-powered versions of the Z9.

Wallet-Friendly Workhorses

The Zhengzhou Nissan Z9 starts at just ¥119,900 (equal to around $16,600 at current exchange rates) for the internal combustion version. If you’re looking for a greener option, the new Z9 GE PHEV kicks off at ¥156,900 ($21,800), still far below what most midsize pickups command elsewhere.

While the Z9 and Frontier Pro may be siblings under the surface, you can tell them apart by their grille and bumper designs. They also sport unique LED lighting signatures at both ends. Beyond that, the bodywork is identical, including the five-seat cabin.

Low Price, High Tech

Inside, the Z9 punches well above its weight for the price. A 12.8-inch infotainment display and a 10.25-inch digital instrument cluster come standard. Higher trims step it up with a 14.6-inch touchscreen, Nappa leather seats, and all the modern comforts, including heating, ventilation, massage functions, and a 12-speaker stereo. Tech features extend to four ultrasonic radars, a transparent engine hood camera mode, and four high-def cameras enabling Level 2 driver assistance.

Size and Powertrain Specs

Measuring 5,494 mm long (216.3 inches) with a 3,300 mm (129.9 inches) wheelbase, the Z9 GE PHEV fits squarely into the midsize pickup truck category. It comes exclusively in a dual-cab layout, with seating for five and a 1,520 mm (59.8 inches) long rear bed.

The plug-in hybrid system pairs a turbocharged 1.5-liter gas engine with a single electric motor. Depending on the trim, total output comes to either 322 hp (240 kW) or 429 hp (320 kW), with both versions delivering an impressive 800 Nm (590 lb-ft) of peak torque. Power goes to the rear or all four wheels via an automatic transmission designed specifically for hybrid use.

The PHEV offers two battery options. The least powerful version gets a 17 kWh battery pack, allowing an EV-only range of 60 km (37 miles). For those who want more, the larger 32.85 kWh battery extends the zero-emission range to 135 km (84 miles). As always, keep in mind these numbers are based on the more optimistic NEDC test cycle.

A Serious Bargain Compared to US Offerings

Which brings us to the surprisingly low sticker prices. The base Z9 GE PHEV starts at ¥156,900 ($21,800), while the more powerful variant with the extended EV range is priced at ¥168,900 ($23,400). Even the fully loaded flagship version, complete with all the premium features, tops out at just ¥219,900 ($30,500). For those prioritizing value above all, the entry-level diesel model with a six-speed manual can be had for only ¥119,900 ($16,600).

More: Nissan Confirms Plug-in Hybrid Frontier For America

To put things in perspective, the similarly sized US-market Nissan Frontier starts at $32,050 for the most basic 4×2 King Cab with a non-electrified 3.8-liter V6. That’s nearly double the price of the Z9, without any hint of electrification or standout tech features.

As for EV alternatives, the upcoming Slate is projected to start around $28,000. But the base model skips over even the most basic comforts, like power windows – and paint. It’ll be sold in a single molded-in-color gray, with buyers offered a $500 do-it-yourself wrap kit as the only customization option. Federal incentives could bring the price down to about $20,500, but don’t bank on it. With Trump’s so-called “Big Beautiful Bill” picking up steam, those generous tax credits may not be around much longer.

Zhengzhou Nissan hasn’t revealed pricing for the Nissan-branded Frontier Pro just yet, but it’s likely to sit slightly above the Z9 GE PHEV. What’s more interesting is that the Nissan-branded truck is also expected to become available in markets outside China, though obviously, not in America. If they manage to keep the pricing in check, it could be a compelling option.

The super-cheap Tesla Cybertruck is nowhere to be seen Tesla started delivering the Cybertruck on November 30, 2023.
Tesla was hoping to move 250,000 Cybertrucks last year, but the Ford F-150 Lightning won back its crown as the best-selling electric pickup truck.
Dozens of Cybertrucks stay parked in the parking lot of a shopping center near Detroit.
It is still light years away from the $39,900 Cybertruck that Elon Musk promised in November 2019.","A video uploaded on social media brought Tesla's sales hurdles into the spotlight once again. It shows dozens of Cybertrucks sitting in the parking lot of a mall outside Detroit, looking like they were simply deposited there. They are reportedly Cybertrucks that the firm hasn't managed to selll yet.

The Cybertruck has been the talk of the town whole world since Elon Musk took it to the stage in Los Angeles for the official unveiling in November 2019, and the carmaker's Head of Design, Franz von Holzhausen, shattered its windows by hitting them with a steel ball and a sledgehammer.

From that moment on, orders started pouring in, and Tesla soon bragged about having collected over one million reservations. It was easy to reserve a truck. All you had to do was place a $100 deposit, which was refundable at any time. Either the one-million-reservation information was fake, or people got their deposits back because the number is nowhere to be seen.

The super-cheap Tesla Cybertruck is nowhere to be seen

Tesla started delivering the Cybertruck on November 30, 2023. The hype skyrocketed as many agreed to spec a Foundation Series, which was a $100,000 deal, in order to skip the line. Elon Musk had announced a starting price of $39,900 in November 2019, but that was before the chip crisis and before the repetitive production delays. It was the time when owners who flipped their Cybertrucks, despite the clause in the purchase contract that restricted them from doing so during the first year of ownership, brought them big money.

A Porsche dealership in Orlando bought a Cybertruck for an incredible $244,000 and listed it for sale days later for $290,000. Little did they know there would come a time when owners wouldn't even be able to get $90,000 for their electric trucks.

Furthermore, since Elon Musk joined Donald Trump's team, an unofficial boycott started against the brand, as Tesla's potential customers decided to resort to other brands, and many owners started trading in or selling their EVs. It is a move from which Cadillac benefits. General Motors has recently revealed that 25% of the customers buying an electric Caddy are former Tesla owners. So much for the brand loyalty that Tesla was bragging about.

Elon Musk departed the White House after publicly criticizing his team and complaining about the bureaucracy he had been dealing with during his 128-day mandate. We have yet to see if the move will impact Tesla's sales.

In the meantime, it seems that the automaker can't sell the Cybertruck, which was, at some point, the world's most anticipated model. The hype built around it in the previous years is now long gone, sales have come crashing down, and depreciation has its way with the model. Tesla sold just 40,000 units in 2024, and it hasn't been doing well this year either.

Tesla was hoping to move 250,000 Cybertrucks last year, but the Ford F-150 Lightning won back its crown as the best-selling electric pickup truck. As Elon Musk overpromised and underdelivered again, the Cybertruck has less range and a higher price than originally announced.

The owner of the property is in trouble

Those are solid reasons that keep customers at bay. Dozens of Cybertrucks stay parked in the parking lot of a shopping center near Detroit. The property owner is obviously in trouble.

He is violating the city code by storing dozens of Teslas in the parking lot located in suburban Detroit, as vehicle storage is not a permitted use of the land. The Teslas have basically taken over the parking spaces of the center, which is on the verge of undergoing a major redevelopment.

While trying to figure out what to do with all the pickups that it builds and is unable to sell, Tesla is storing them wherever it finds room for them. One of the places that accepted to host the firm's trucks was a run-down mall, the Hunter's Square, located in Farmington Hills, outside Detroit, Michigan, which got officials fuming.

Many of the stores that once operated there are now closed, but several fast-food restaurants are still open, which means a relatively reduced number of customers still visit the center. However, the Teslas are currently occupying several rows normally reserved for customers.

Penalizing the owner takes time

Automotive News reports that Charmaine Kettler-Scmult, director of planning and community development for Farmington Hills, Michigan, stated that city officials had already informed the shopping center landlord of the violation and asked him to clear the area. However, enforcing the evacuation procedure is time-consuming.

Tesla recently opened a brand-new showroom near Hunter's Square shopping center in West Bloomfield. The Cybertrucks parked at the mall might have been sourced from the showroom.

The firm is also counting on the single-motor rear-wheel drive Cybertruck to boost sales. The latest version quietly appeared in the online configurator back in April, with a starting price of $69,990. It is still light years away from the $39,900 Cybertruck that Elon Musk promised in November 2019.",https://s1.cdn.autoevolution.com/images/news/tesla-cybertrucks-pile-up-in-detroit-parking-lot-what-are-they-doing-there-252286_1.jpg,N,,2025-05-31 18:07:27.491169

Trump has repeatedly touted the $44 billion Alaska LNG project, which is meant to transport natural gas across the state for export.

Foreign representatives visiting Alaska for the discussions in coming days are expected to include representatives from Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Philippines, India and the United Arab Emirates, said people familiar with the matter, who asked not to be identified because they weren’t authorized to speak publicly.

The US delegation will be led by Interior Secretary Doug Burgum, who’s also the chair of Trump’s National Energy Dominance Council; the panel’s vice-chair, Energy Secretary Chris Wright; and Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin, the people said.

The trip is set to include visits to an oil pipeline and gas processing facilities on Alaska’s North Slope as well as meetings with industry officials and indigenous people, they said.

It comes as Trump moves to expand energy development in the state, a priority he outlined in an executive order hours after his Jan. 20 inauguration. And it coincides with a broad push by other nations to curry favor with the president, including through investment commitments, to ward off threatened tariffs.

Trump has repeatedly touted the $44 billion Alaska LNG project, which is meant to transport natural gas across the state for export. Although it has been planned for decades, the project faces headwinds due to its large price tag, mammoth scale and the sheer challenge of constructing an 800-mile (1,290 kilometers) pipeline across Alaska.

Trump pressed Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba on the project during their meeting in February, winning his commitment to cooperate on strengthening energy security, “including increasing exports of United States liquefied natural gas to Japan in a mutually beneficial manner.”

Representatives of the Philippines, Taiwan and South Korea also have been in talks with administration officials on the venture.

Discussions are expected to unfold over several days, including during site visits at the prolific Prudhoe Bay oil field, which has pumped crude for roughly five decades, and where units of ConocoPhillips and Hilcorp Energy Co. have operations. Other conversations are expected in Utqiagvik and Anchorage, including as part of Governor Mike Dunleavy’s Alaska Sustainable Energy Conference.

Trump officials see the visit as a chance to highlight the administration’s focus on unleashing Alaska’s energy abundance and draw a contrast with policies under former President Joe Biden they say locked up the state’s oil, gas and mineral potential. While Alaska LNG will be a significant portion of the discussions, a person familiar with the matter said, there’s an opportunity to examine the state’s resource potential and further policy shifts that can help deliver it.

At the heart of this initiative is a Corporate Power Purchase Agreement (CPPA), the first of its kind for the UK rail network.
Under the 14-year agreement, Network Rail will purchase 64 gigawatt hours (GWh) of renewable electricity annually at a fixed cost.
Over the full 14-year span, the clean energy supplied will be sufficient to run all 20 Network Rail-managed stations for eight consecutive years.
James Schwerdt, Head of Solar at EDF Renewables UK, said: “We are very pleased to be working with Network Rail to help them transition to green, renewable, low-carbon energy.","Network Rail is set to tap into clean energy from a newly commissioned solar farm in Norfolk, thanks to a landmark deal with EDF Renewables UK. Construction at Bloy’s Grove, just outside Swainsthorpe and within sight of the Great Eastern Main Line, is poised to begin, with the energy generated playing a pivotal role in decarbonising Britain’s railway infrastructure.

At the heart of this initiative is a Corporate Power Purchase Agreement (CPPA), the first of its kind for the UK rail network. Under the 14-year agreement, Network Rail will purchase 64 gigawatt hours (GWh) of renewable electricity annually at a fixed cost. This will account for around 15% of the electricity needed to power its offices, depots, and managed stations, collectively referred to as non-traction energy.

To put this in perspective, a single year’s worth of energy under the CPPA would be enough to power London Liverpool Street station for nine years. Over the full 14-year span, the clean energy supplied will be sufficient to run all 20 Network Rail-managed stations for eight consecutive years.

Rail Minister Lord Hendy said: “We are working with partners across the rail industry to build a modern transport network with our environmental commitments at the heart. The Government’s Plan for Change is driving economic growth, transitioning the country to sustainable energy, and securing jobs. Under our new integrated approach, we are ensuring the British rail industry remains at the forefront of innovation and improvement.”

The move aligns with Network Rail’s broader Green Strategy, which charts a course toward a more sustainable future for rail travel. The company isn’t stopping here. Plans are underway to secure additional CPPAs to transition all of its non-traction electricity eventually to solar, a significant leap toward full sustainability.

“With the railway industry set to unite under Great British Railways, this contract, our Green Strategy, and a cohesive railway system provide us with even more opportunities to reduce emissions and make our railway even greener.”

Jo Lewington, chief environment and sustainability officer at Network Rail, said: “Travelling by train is already one of the most sustainable ways of getting around, and we know we can do more as a business. In future, we would like all of our office and station power to come from sustainable sources, and this contract is a huge step forward towards that.”

EDF Renewables UK will build, operate, and manage the Bloy’s Grove facility. Over its projected lifespan, the solar farm is expected to offset approximately 60,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide, the equivalent of planting more than 2.2 million trees.

And it’s not just the environment that stands to benefit. EDF Renewables has also committed to investing in the local community, pledging £20,000 per year to a community fund for the whole 35-year operational life of the solar project.

James Schwerdt, Head of Solar at EDF Renewables UK, said: “We are very pleased to be working with Network Rail to help them transition to green, renewable, low-carbon energy.

The facility announced May 29 will be just south of PIT's terminal and is expected to dramatically enhance access to low-carbon jet fuel for commercial and cargo carriers operating in the region.

While other SAF plants operate elsewhere, PIT's facility situated just south of the terminal will be the first integrated within a major airport's infrastructure.

The facility will use KBR's PureSAF alcohol-to-jet technology, developed by Swedish Biofuels and globally licensed by KBR, converting renewable alcohol into jet fuel that meets ASTM certification and global sustainability standards.

KBR's PureSAF technology is an alcohol-to-jet process that converts various feedstocks, including bioethanol, syngas and carbon dioxide, into sustainable aviation fuel.

In addition to processing ethanol, this technology can also convert mixed alcohols, carbon dioxide and synthesis gas to SAF, creating pathways for utilizing captured carbon usage.

""This unique partnership with Avina and KBR will result in on-site SAF production and fills a growing need for our airline partners and the industry overall,"" Pittsburgh International Airport CEO Christina Cassotis said. ""With abundant natural resources, robust energy infrastructure and available fuel storage, PIT is uniquely positioned to meet these goals and serve the growing demands for SAF.""

The process is a low-cost industrial-scale process that produces jet fuel with properties similar to conventional jet fuel, making it fully fungible. This technology is particularly attractive for its ability to utilize a wide range of feedstocks, including waste biomass and biogenic CO2.

Through multiple development phases, the facility is expected to produce over 100 million gallons of SAF annually, helping to significantly reduce the aviation sector's carbon footprint.

Much lower carbon intensity

The SAF produced at PIT will have a carbon intensity at least 65% lower than conventional jet fuel, according to project estimates, contributing meaningfully to the industry's decarbonization goals.

""KBR is proud to support the Pittsburgh International Airport team and enable it to be one of the first airports globally to provide SAF to its customers by producing it on-site at the airport,"" Hari Ravindran, KBR's Global SVP for Technology, said. ""PureSAF (alcohol-to-jet) technology is designed to allow the facility to deliver 100% drop-in fuel made from renewable feedstocks while meeting global specifications for sustainable jet fuel. This project is a real example of how innovation and strong business relationships are delivering tangible benefits to the aviation industry.""

The PIT-Avina initiative aligns with broader efforts across the aviation sector to cut emissions and build resilient fuel infrastructure. As airlines face increasing regulatory and market pressure to decarbonize, projects like this may define the next generation of airport operations and fuel logistics in the US.

Construction is set to begin soon, with phased rollout expected to support regional airline partners and national SAF supply chain expansion.

At a steel mill just outside of Pittsburgh last night, President Trump applauded a potential deal between U.S. Steel Corporation and Japan's Nippon Steel - one that he says would bring billions in investment from the Japanese company.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: And it includes vital protections to ensure that all steelworkers will keep their jobs and all facilities in the United States will remain open and thriving.

SIMON: Now, Trump had opposed the deal as a candidate but now says it will be good for America and that U.S. Steel will still have an American CEO and a corporate board with a U.S. majority. But he was light on specifics and even admitted later, there is no final deal.

NPR's Don Gonyea's in Pittsburgh. Don, thanks for being with us.

DON GONYEA, BYLINE: Good morning.

SIMON: What's the reaction in steel country?

GONYEA: I've been in and around Allegheny County these past couple of days, and in West Mifflin, where a key U.S. Steel facility is located. So let's start there with the local mayor. His name is Chris Kelly.

What was your immediate reaction?

CHRIS KELLY: I started to cry. I mean, I've lived this for a year and a half, and I thought, wow, this is - I wasn't expecting it.

GONYEA: And he made it clear that they were tears of joy, he's talking.

SIMON: Did the mayor talk about how his community had been hurt by the decline of U.S. Steel?

GONYEA: Yeah. He's lived it. He grew up in a nearby town, where, he says, it was decades of decline. He says one mill after another closed, and more than 200,000 jobs disappeared.

KELLY: And I saw the devastation that came along with individuals losing their homes and their jobs, their cars, their families - you know, turned to drug abuse, eventually, domestic violences. And I didn't want to see that.

GONYEA: And he sees the new investments from Nippon Steel as new life.

SIMON: And what did people in the community tell you?

GONYEA: Most are only just learning some of the details, but it's welcomed. I met 55-year-old Malik Swain (ph) outside a local restaurant. He said it's good news, including what updating these old mills will mean for the environment.

MALIK SWAIN: I think it's good for the Mon Valley, actually. I think it's going to keep jobs there, grow it. They're also going to upgrade the facility. So I think that's a good thing as far as air quality goes, hopefully.

GONYEA: And then, Scott, I do want to note here that the United Steelworkers - the national union - has long been opposed to Nippon coming in, citing national security and allegations of unfair trade practices.

SIMON: Of course, Don, it's interesting that the president has really increased trade pressure on other countries. What do his supporters say about Nippon Steel - which is, after all, a Japanese company potentially - taking over what was a company that was once such a cornerstone of U.S. manufacturing.

GONYEA: And that was a big reason, during the campaign last year, that both candidate Trump and President Biden opposed this proposed deal with Nippon Steel. Now, though, such concerns seem to be overridden by the prospect of more jobs. But listen to this - I heard this from a local resident. His name is Mike Medich (ph).

MIKE MEDICH: I'm glad it's Japan rather than China because China has a lot of investments in our country, which I don't think they should have.

GONYEA: And I'll add here that Medich doesn't necessarily see this as a big engine for new jobs, but, he says, had this mill closed, that would have been a real blow to the community.

SIMON: NPR's Don Gonyea. Don, thanks so much for being with us.

Conclusion The convergence of automation and Industry 4.0 is revolutionizing the landscape of EV manufacturing.","The transition to electric vehicles (EV) in India is not coming — it is existing. As of mid-2025, EV sales were growing at an exceptional rate of greater than 45% annually while government level initiatives that fuel demand and incentives at a program level, such as the PM e-Drive or the Production Linked Incentive (PLI) programs, are spurring greater investment in the EV manufacturing space. But manufacturing is not about policy or demand; it is about the merging of automation and Industry 4.0 — in other words, a revolution changing the structure of EV manufacturing at the core.

To create faster, smarter, globally competitive EV manufacturing, India must leverage Industry 4.0 technologies, defined as a network of smart machines, data systems and connected platforms that allows factories to self-monitor, plan, predict and change stipulations in real time.

In this article, we will discuss how Industry 4.0 and automation are reshaping EV manufacturing processes in India and around the world about more efficient production lines, better quality control and more scalable solutions.

Materializing Industry 4.0 in EV Manufacturing

Industry 4.0 sometimes known as the Fourth Industrial Revolution — relates to the digitization of manufacturing using different technologies, including artificial intelligence (AI), Internet of Things (IoT), robotics, big data analytics, cloud computing, and cyber-physical systems. When applied to EV manufacturing, it results in smart factories where machines communicate, make decisions, and optimize performance with minimal human intervention.

Leading Indian EV OEMs like Tata Motors, Mahindra Electric, Ola Electric, and Ather Energy are investing heavily in smart production facilities that are equipped with Industry 4.0 frameworks. Automated ecosystems are making possible real-time quality assurance, predictive maintenance, and flexible assembly lines essential to rapid, efficient EV production.

Why is Automation So Important in EV Manufacturing

Unlike traditional internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles, electric vehicles (EVs) have unique requirements – high-voltage batteries (with thermal management), power electronics, and lightweight frames. Because of this complexity and need for greater precision and repeatability, automation is essential to EV manufacturing.

Automation is providing repeatability, speed, and safety in battery module assembly, welding aluminum body frames, winding motors – including for software calibrations! By 2025, robots had become a dominant factor in India’s leading EV manufacturing factories.

For example:

Tata Motors has implemented collaborative robots (cobots) for automated spot welding and battery handling at its Pune facility.

MG Motor India is utilizing advanced AI and machine learning tools, in collaboration with SAIC, to reduce defects in production and human error.

BYD India has applied more than 60% robotic automation in the bus and battery manufacturing units.

These developments indicate a strong movement toward Industry 4.0 ecosystems that will form the future of EV manufacturing in the India.

Key Industry 4.0 Technologies Reshaping EV Manufacturing

1. Digital Twins

Also a digital twin is a virtual real-time copy of a physical asset, or physical business process. In electric vehicle manufacturing, it has allowed engineers to simulate the production process, battery performance, and thermal characteristics of a finished vehicle by modelling aspects such as material performance and operational parameters before actual deployment. Digital twins can allow for reduced time-to-market and real-time remote monitoring of the processes at operational plant locations.

2. IoT and Smart Sensors

IoT sensors situated in machines or along assembly lines, can collect meaningful operational data related to temperature, vibration, energy usage, and torque so that parts can be evaluated for predictive maintenance and can also optimize processes by minimizing downtime and improving operational efficiencies in existing EV manufacturing units.

3. AI and Predictive Analytics

AI systems compute massive amounts of data to predict equipment failures and optimize inventory management, alongside maximizing yield. AI-based vision systems have also been adopted for real-time quality inspection of EV batteries and wiring.

4. Additive Manufacturing (3D Printing)

3D printing facilitates iterative development of EV components for prototyping and small-batch requirements like battery enclosures, housings, and custom cooling plates. Many EV manufacturing start-ups are now integrating additive manufacturing as an opportunity to reduce development costs and waste.

5. Cloud and Edge Computing

Data generated on the factory floor is now processed on edge devices for immediate insights, or stored in cloud data platforms for more traditional macro-level analytics. This hybrid system, where data is processed at the edge such as the manufacturing plant and aggregated in the cloud as necessary, allows for faster decision making across geographically dispersed EV manufacturing ecosystems.

Industry 4.0 and Supply Chain Integration

Another significant benefit of Industry 4.0 in EV manufacturing is the creation of smart, connected supply chains. Manufacturers can now track components in real-time, reduce lead times, and synchronize procurement with demand forecasting.

With EV components like lithium-ion batteries, semiconductors, and controllers often coming from diverse vendors, a digital supply chain helps reduce delays and avoid overstocking. Companies like Bosch, Bharat Forge, and Sona BLW have integrated smart supply chain platforms to enable seamless component flow into EV manufacturing plants.

Challenges to Adoption in India

While the benefits are immense, India’s EV manufacturing sector still faces hurdles in fully adopting Industry 4.0:

High Capital Expenditure: Setting up smart factories with robotics, AI, and IoT infrastructure involves substantial initial investment.

Workforce Skill Gap: There’s a significant lack of trained technicians, engineers, and operators familiar with Industry 4.0 tools.

Legacy Systems: Many traditional auto manufacturers have outdated ERP systems that are not compatible with modern automation platforms.

Cybersecurity: The connected nature of Industry 4.0 systems makes them vulnerable to cyber-attacks, requiring robust data protection protocols.

To overcome these, the government and industry bodies must collaborate on workforce skilling programs, offer tax incentives for tech upgrades, and promote standardized frameworks for smart EV manufacturing.

Government Push and Industry Partnerships

Recognizing the critical role of Industry 4.0 in boosting global competitiveness, the Indian government has included digital transformation under the PLI Auto Scheme. The Ministry of Heavy Industries has announced funding for pilot EV manufacturing projects that demonstrate end-to-end automation and data analytics integration.

Collaborations between OEMs and tech giants like Siemens, ABB, Bosch, and Infosys are also enabling smooth adoption of Industry 4.0 systems in EV assembly lines. Startups like Entuple E-Mobility and Numocity are developing India-specific solutions for real-time energy monitoring and digital diagnostics in EV manufacturing.

The Road Ahead: A Smarter EV Manufacturing Ecosystem

The journey toward fully automated and digitized EV manufacturing in India is just beginning, but the pace is picking up. In 2025, every major EV player is either scaling up its smart factory operations or investing in next-gen digital infrastructure.

The long-term vision is clear — India must become not just an EV consumer market but also a global hub for advanced EV manufacturing. To get there, embracing Industry 4.0 isn’t optional — it’s essential.

From AI-guided robots assembling battery packs to cloud platforms managing plant operations from thousands of kilometers away, the future of EV manufacturing lies in intelligent, interconnected systems. And with the right partnerships, investments, and policy support, India is well-positioned to lead this transformation.

Conclusion

The convergence of automation and Industry 4.0 is revolutionizing the landscape of EV manufacturing. It offers not just increased productivity and reduced costs, but also ensures higher precision, lower emissions, and scalable growth. As India accelerates toward its clean mobility goals, EV manufacturing powered by Industry 4.0 will be the cornerstone of this new industrial age.",https://www.evmechanica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Automation-and-Industry-4.0-in-EV-Manufacturing-Powering-the-Future-of-Mobility-1.jpg,N,,2025-05-31 19:07:23.310028

""We are supposed to start putting together the funding bills for 2026 next week.","WASHINGTON — The Trump administration released significantly more detail about its budget request Friday evening, giving Congress the information it needs for lawmakers to draft the annual government funding bills.

The 1,224-page document sheds light on where exactly President Donald Trump and White House budget director Russ Vought want lawmakers to cut federal spending during the upcoming fiscal year.

The Office of Management and Budget released a “skinny” version of the annual proposal in early May, requesting lawmakers cut domestic spending by $163 billion and keep funding for defense programs flat in the dozen annual appropriations bills.

While the documents in that request provided some insight into how Trump wants to reshape the size and scope of about $1.7 trillion in discretionary funding, which is spending that Congress directs, they didn’t include the level of detail that the Appropriations committees need to begin their work.

The appendix document released Friday should aid in that, though it does not represent a full budget request. That type of proposal would include the White House’s goals for mandatory programs, like Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security, which make up about two-thirds of federal spending. Such spending is required by law and is not subject to annual appropriations.

A full budget request also typically includes tax policy proposals, though with Republicans in Congress already working to enact an extension of the 2017 GOP tax law in the “big, beautiful bill,” those sections would likely be of little use to lawmakers at this point.

Work on spending bills launching

The House Appropriations Committee is scheduled to release and debate its 12 government funding bills throughout June, before voting to send those measures to the floor.

Chairman Tom Cole, R-Okla., will likely include funding levels and policy closely aligned with the White House request, since legislation in that chamber can pass a floor vote with a simple majority

Senate Appropriations Committee Chairwoman Susan Collins, R-Maine, has a more challenging task, since regular bills in that chamber require bipartisanship to get past the 60-vote legislative filibuster. Republicans control the Senate with 53 members.

In general, that means the Senate panel’s bills tend to look much more like the final version that becomes law than the House bills, though not always.

Both chambers are supposed to reach a bipartisan, bicameral agreement on the dozen bills before the start of the next fiscal year on Oct. 1, but that rarely happens.

Congress is much more likely to use a stopgap spending bill until mid-December to give members more time to negotiate funding levels and policies on thousands of government programs.

The House and Senate were unable to reach agreement for this fiscal year, and instead leaned on a series of three continuing resolutions to keep the government up and running.

Partial shutdown could loom again

Tensions over the proposed funding cuts in Trump’s first budget request of his second term could reach a boiling point if Cole, Collins, House ranking member Rosa DeLauro of Connecticut and Senate ranking member Patty Murray cannot broker an agreement before their deadline.

Failure to enact some sort of government funding legislation — either the dozen full-year bills, or a stopgap spending measure — would lead to a partial government shutdown.

Murray, D-Wash., wrote in a statement released Friday evening that it was “telling that President Trump has chosen to release his budget on a Friday night with no fanfare whatsoever.”

“This is a draconian proposal to hurt working people and our economy, and it is dead on arrival in Congress as long as I have anything to say about it,” Murray wrote. “But this is just another reminder we need Republicans to join us to reject these reckless cuts, focus on the investments we actually need to make in our communities and security, and to finally force Trump to follow the law and end his devastating funding freeze.”

DeLauro wrote in a statement that the ""government envisioned by President Trump only serves billionaires and the biggest corporations and would do nothing to lower the cost of living.”

“This is not a complete budget,"" she wrote. ""We are supposed to start putting together the funding bills for 2026 next week. If, as expected, House Republicans follow what President Trump has proposed so far, it is not a serious effort to deliver for the American people.”",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/s3/files/styles/social_large/s3/2025-05/trumprfkmcmahon.jpg?h=0a8b6f8b&itok=uqNRcgly,N,,2025-05-31 18:07:13.515960

Throughout its operations, Geronimo Power has prioritized generating tangible economic benefits for the regions in which it operates. Collectively, its active and under-construction projects are expected to provide approximately $840 million in direct economic benefits to American communities over their lifespans. These benefits include job creation, lease payments to landowners, and increased tax revenues for local governments. As part of its broader commitment to social responsibility, Geronimo Power also establishes charitable funds for each of its large-scale operational projects.

Blake Nixon, President and CEO of Geronimo Power, said in a statement, “We’re honored to rebrand the company in a way that celebrates and recognizes the roots we established under the Geronimo brand back in 2007. We’re proud to have earned a reputation for putting landowners and communities first, and we’ll carry that legacy forward as Geronimo Power, continuing our commitment to deliver reliable, innovative power solutions to meet growing demand in the US.”

These funds are designed to support local nonprofit organizations and community initiatives. The company collaborates with residents and community leaders to identify funding priorities, ensuring that the financial support is aligned with local needs and values. With the transition to Geronimo Power, the company aims to strengthen its legacy of community engagement and sustainable growth, while continuing to play a key role in building a more resilient and future-ready American energy landscape.",https://solarquarter.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Geronimo_Power_Logo_Final_Horizontal_Color_Text_Logo.jpg,N,,2025-06-01 00:00:29.124030

I’m proud to have worked in tandem with my colleagues and President Trump to make good on a promise I made.

On May 22, Congress struck down a key aspect of the Biden Administration’s nationwide EV mandate under the Congressional Review Act (CRA). This is a win for American consumers and protects Congress’s constitutional and statutory oversight authority over federal agencies and unelected bureaucratic overreach.

How did we get here?

More than 50 years ago, Congress allowed California to request a “wavier” from applicable federal air regulations. Congress provided California this tool because the state had extraordinarily poor air quality and unique challenges to control it. Recently, California has abused that discreet authority to set climate policy across the country.

In December of 2024, the lame duck Biden Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) approved California’s request to implement its “Advanced Clean Cars II” regulation when Democrats wouldn’t have to face voters over this politically toxic policy.

California’s ACC II waiver requires all vehicles sold in the state, Washington D.C., and the 11 other states that have adopted California’s standard to be zero emissions vehicles by 2035. This means in one decade that these states, totaling 30 percent of the nation’s new car market, will have a full ban on the sale of gasoline powered vehicles and traditional hybrids. These unattainable standards, backed by a fine of over $26,000 per vehicle for non-compliance, would reshape auto manufacturing and take away consumer choice across the country.

Only 2.3 percent of new vehicle registrations in West Virginia last year were EVs. Nationwide, EVs accounted for only 10.2 percent of new vehicle registrations. West Virginians don’t want California’s climate policy, and West Virginians don’t want California’s EV mandate. I’m confident that most Americans don’t want these things either.

The Biden EPA tried to avoid accountability from Congress by claiming their decision was not a rule and refusing to submit it to Congress under the CRA. Fortunately, President Trump corrected this by identifying the waiver as a rule and submitting it to Congress.

To protect American consumers and workers, as well as the Senate’s oversight authority of bad agency rules, I introduced a resolution under the CRA to reverse EPA’s California waiver. Using this statutory process allows members of the Senate and the House – the constitutionally elected representatives of all Americans – to decide whether a nationally significant agency rule should move forward.

After the rule was submitted to Congress, Senate Democrats who wanted to protect this EV mandate requested the Government Accountability Office (GAO) find the waiver was not a rule under the CRA. GAO has consistently found that once a rule is submitted by an agency, GAO does not issue an opinion. Despite its own precedent, GAO “observed” in a letter that the Biden EPA action approving California’s waiver was not a rule under the CRA, despite the agency’s submittal to Congress.

Democrats got this GAO letter to obstruct the Senate from exercising its authority provided by the CRA. Nothing in the plain text of the CRA, Senate Rules, or Senate precedents gives unelected staff at the GAO the authority to prevent the Senate from considering a resolution of disapproval against a rule that has been submitted to Congress.

Once an agency submits a rule to Congress, as EPA did here, elected representatives are able to decide whether to approve or disapprove of the rule. That is how the CRA and GAO precedent has functioned since its enactment in 1996 as a statutory exception to the Senate’s normal practice of unlimited debate. This allows Congress to realize the fundamental purpose of the CRA – oversight by elected representatives over unelected agencies.

Democrat Senators claim that our action undermines the legislative filibuster. That is simply untrue. Unlike my Democrat colleagues, I have supported the legislative filibuster as a Senator in the majority and as a Senator in the minority. The procedural action we have taken is not about the filibuster. Instead, the procedural action the Senate has taken is simply about whether GAO staff can violate its own precedent and have veto authority over elected officials’ ability to use the CRA against rules submitted to Congress by an agency. The answer is no.

Despite the best efforts of unelected bureaucrats in California, the Biden Administration, and congressional Democrats to shield this EV mandate from the will of the American people, Congress has rejected California’s attempt to impose an electric vehicle mandate that would have eliminated consumer choice, increased prices, and killed jobs across the country.

The suit from the service that airs “Sesame Street,” Ken Burns documentaries and the “PBS NewsHour” for free to millions of American homes, said that Congress has repeatedly protected PBS from political interference by filtering its funds through the Corp. for Public Broadcasting, which is not a federal agency.

“The [executive order] makes no attempt to hide the fact that it is cutting off the flow of funds to PBS because of the content of PBS programming and out of a desire to alter the content of speech.”

NPR, which also receives CPB funding, filed a suit on similar grounds on Tuesday.

Kilton Webb is a member of the IBEW Local 567 and a member of the Maine House of Representatives.

As an IBEW member in Maine representing over 4,000 workers, I know firsthand how important clean energy is to making our economy work for all of us. Investments in clean energy have enabled our union locals to create good-paying jobs, and drive down energy costs — something at the top of every Mainer’s mind — all while helping America maintain our global competitiveness.

The U.S. House budget reconciliation bill, however, proposes what amounts to a total repeal of many clean energy investments, putting our jobs at risk. As SEIA, the primary trade organization for the solar industry, put it: “this proposed legislation will effectively dismantle the most successful industrial onshoring effort in U.S. history.”

Let’s be clear: This bill is a direct assault on American manufacturing and American-made energy right here in Maine.

I have seen the benefits of clean energy investments myself. I began my career as an electrician, and my first job was on a solar field in Kennebunk. I’ve built dozens of solar farms across the state, a job that has helped me pay off debt, purchase a home, and advance to a journeyman electrician. I am honored to now represent Durham in the Maine House of Representatives.

I strongly support clean energy investments at both the federal level and in the private sector because they are fueling a clean energy economic boom with companies like Nyle Water Heating Systems here in Maine.

Maine has been a national leader in clean energy generation, with over two-thirds of the state’s total energy generation coming from clean energy, including 27 percent from wind and 13 percent from solar. We will need even more to meet rising demand.

Unfortunately, we have already seen how extreme Republican attempts to repeal clean energy are impacting Maine’s energy supply and jobs. In April 2025, Maine’s first planned offshore wind array Pine Tree Offshore Wind paused the project because of President Donald Trump’s opposition to wind energy. This delay is pulling the plug on 144 megawatts of energy, shrinking the state’s energy supply and putting the burden on Maine families.

Repeal of clean energy tax credits will also hurt Maine disproportionately because our rural state has 145 utility-scale projects either operating or in development across the state that could be eligible for these tax credits. That means 9,100 jobs, $8.8 billion in investment, and nearly 5,000 megawatts of power generation or storage.

The Trump Administration has already arbitrarily attacked Mainers’ access to energy efficient heat pumps that can help bring the costs of heating and cooling our homes under control, even as Maine is embracing them more and more, but now U.S. House Republicans want to immediately repeal all federal tax credits that can help working people lower their energy bills. All of this to cover a small fraction of tax cuts that go primarily to the wealthy — how does that make any sense?

Sen. Susan Collins, who has represented us since 1997, has been a longtime supporter of Maine’s clean energy development. Her support for Form Energy’s battery energy storage in Lincoln, for example, helped establish the largest long-duration energy storage project in the world. On April 9, four of her Republican colleagues in the Senate wrote in a letter to Senate Majority Leader John Thune, in support of the clean energy tax credits that have brought direct benefits to so many parts of the country.

“As Republicans committed to strengthening America’s energy security and economic growth, we write to emphasize the importance of maintaining a stable and predictable tax framework to promote domestic energy development. While we support fiscal responsibility and prudent efforts to streamline the tax code, we caution against the full-scale repeal of current credits, which could lead to significant disruptions for the American people and weaken our position as a global energy leader,” they wrote in their letter.

This is exactly right. Unfortunately, the House bill will implement unreasonable phaseouts, impossible red tape and restrictions, or outright termination of tax credits for clean energy that together make the tax credits completely unworkable, by design. This bill is essentially a full-scale repeal. It also repeals home energy tax credits, which would lead directly to higher energy costs, in addition to good-paying jobs.

Repealing clean energy tax credits would gut America’s clean energy production, raising costs for Maine families and killing hundreds of thousands of good-paying manufacturing jobs nationwide. Trump and Republicans promised to lower energy costs. Instead, this legislation would undermine America’s fastest-growing, most affordable energy sources.

Thankfully, Collins has an opportunity to inject some common sense into this bill and protect clean energy and the jobs that come along with it. Now that the bill has passed the House, it will move to the Senate next. Repealing clean energy investments would be bad for American businesses and bad for American workers. I urge Collins to continue being the leader we need and fix this reckless legislation.",https://i0.wp.com/bdn-data.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/05/climate-change-ski-mountain-snow-maine-bennett-2.jpg?fit=1200%2C800&ssl=1,N,,2025-05-31 20:06:14.702211

Gavin Newsom.

Newsom recently announced the launch of CalHeatScore, a cutting-edge tool to forecast and rank heat severity risks and connect Californians with available resources to stay safe during extreme heat events. With CalHeatScore, California becomes the first state in the nation — and one of the only jurisdictions in the world — to launch a heat-ranking system. Newsom’s office says this announcement comes as the Trump administration makes life-threatening cuts to the federal government’s weather monitoring apparatus.

CalHeatScore, developed by the California Environmental Protection Agency’s Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment, brings together ZIP code level data to provide locally tailored guidance. The tool identifies groups most susceptible to extreme heat — such as older adults and children — and provides tips for staying safe, such as how to recognize signs of heat illness. The tool additionally integrates other important data sets, like locations for the nearest cooling centers.

Newsom additionally announced $32.4 million to support 47 California communities in lifesaving extreme heat mitigation efforts. The Extreme Heat and Community Resilience Program aims to support local, tribal and regional efforts to combat dangerous heat exposure by building long-lasting infrastructure solutions and strengthening community resilience needed to withstand extreme heat events.

“Extreme heat kills — and with the federal government cutting the very programs that help forecast it, California is taking aggressive action to protect residents from the impacts of extreme heat and build resilience in our most vulnerable communities,” said Newsom. “With the first major heat of the summer expected this weekend, we’re connecting more Californians — particularly those that are most vulnerable to dangerous heat — to life-saving information, resources and programs across the state.”

In a hotter, drier world, connecting Californians with extreme weather information and resources has never been more important — especially as the federal government cuts critical programs providing pertinent information on weather, added Newsom’s office.

First-in-the-nation heat-ranking tool

The new CalHeatScore tool will be leveraged across state government, providing early warning that allows resources to be mobilized with greater speed and precision to communities that need it, promise staffers. To ensure the new tool works for Californians, the state will continue gathering input from the public, which will be used to shape future updates.

“Every single preventable death is one too many,” said Yana Garcia, California’s secretary for environmental protection. “This groundbreaking tool will help Californians plan and respond so they can stay safe when a heat wave is about to strike. And it will shore up the state’s all-in fight against the very real dangers that climate change keeps bringing to our doorstep.”

In 2021, the California Department of Insurance’s Climate Insurance Workgroup recommended California build a system to rank heat waves to better communicate the deadly risks to Californians and help communities prepare, similar to how tropical storms and hurricanes are described by category level.

As part of a broader climate package in 2022, Newsom signed Assembly Bill 2238 by Assemblymember Luz Rivas to codify CDI’s recommendation by requiring the state to develop a statewide extreme heat ranking system.

“CalHeatScore is an important tool to prepare Californians for extreme heat,” said Nancy Ward, director of the California Governor’s Office of Emergency Services. “It helps increase our readiness for heat events and protect those at greatest risk.”

Building on investments to protect Californians

The funding recently announced builds on the governor’s extreme heat action plan, which guides the state’s response to extreme heat events. Developed in partnership with more than 20 state agencies and informed by more than 1,000 individuals through listening sessions and public engagement, these grants respond directly to community needs and build on existing state programs.

Extreme heat solutions announced recently combine physical infrastructure with nature-based solutions and in-home technology to create more resilient communities. In Northern California, for example, North Coast Opportunities and the Middletown Rancheria of Pomo Indians of California will partner to provide solar-powered air conditioning in the homes of vulnerable community members.

“California is taking aggressive action to protect residents from the impacts of extreme heat and build resilience in our most vulnerable communities,” said Samuel Assefa, director of Governor’s Office of Land Use and Climate Innovation, the agency overseeing the funding. “With lives on the line each summer, the Extreme Heat and Community Resilience Program will provide critical infrastructure investments in heat vulnerable communities.”

Extreme heat is the leading cause of weather-related deaths in the state, claiming more lives annually than any other climate threat, including fires and floods. Last year, California communities experienced the hottest summer on record in 130 years. According to a report from the Department of Insurance, from 2013 to 2022, seven extreme heat events resulted in nearly 460 deaths, over 5,000 hospitalizations and about 344 adverse birth outcomes.

State research shows a correlation between heat and a range of negative health effects including death, lower birth weight and increased emergency room visits and hospitalizations for conditions ranging from heart conditions to poor mental health. Extreme heat also takes an economic toll on the state, with an estimated $7.7 billion of lost wages, agricultural disruptions and power outages.

Everyone’s property rights need to be respected in terms of new energy generation and distribution.
Wind turbines, solar panels and high-power transmission towers will always have a certain amount of industrial look to them.","Much has been in local news about electric power generation and distribution centering around solar power, as well as the “Grain Belt Express” power distribution plans that affect Pike County in Illinois and Ralls County in Missouri.

Going back in history, Thomas Edison was a pioneer in technology development and one of the first to develop the new technology of electrification. However, he was human, and his quest to provide the distribution of electrical power was flawed in the fact that what he proposed as Direct Current (DC) power could not be up- or down-converted in voltage. So, the size of the wire to transmit electric power would have been massive like the cables of the Golden Gate Bridge.

A guy by the name of George Westinghouse, however, had the idea of using Alternating Current (AC) on what would become the preferred form to transmit electric energy over long distances and be used by all consumers. The use of electrical transformers could up-convert and down-convert the electrical energy from more than 100kV down to 120V in those early days, as it still does today.

Fast forward nearly 130 years later and the development of high-power regulators to convert AC power to DC and inverters to convert DC power to AC, along with storage batteries such as lithium iron phosphate, has been developed.

It is good to look at new developments that now allow more efficient long-distance transmission of electrical energy by DC current, replacing a four-wire WYE configuration AC lines with only a two-wire DC current run. This is what is planned with “The Grain Belt Express” plan that has strong opposition from people like Missouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey.

His concern about the issue of eminent domain is valid, but his assumption that the project is of a “radical ‘green agenda” is not. As an attorney, it would be good if he stuck to using his skills to mitigate property conflicts in adapting such new technologies, while realizing he may not be an expert on such technologies himself.

This project will allow four separate electric grid systems in North America to be connected efficiently to better distribute and manage the load requirements of wind turbines and solar, as well as other energy sources of the United States and Canada. Situations such as the power grid failure in Texas in February 2021, an isolated grid from the rest of the U.S. that saw the system drop to as low as 59.4 AC cycles per second and colipase, need to be avoided in the future with sound engineering and energy development programs like the HVDC power Grain Belt Express.

Newly developed technology with wind turbines now allows the replacement of mechanical gear drive mechanisms in their hubs that were needed to reach 60-cycle AC to be replaced with AC-to-DC solid state regulators and inverters, either in the hubs or at the location, to allow an entire wind turbine farm to be more efficient. They are similar in manner but in reverse to your outside central air conditioner, which takes 60-cycle AC power and converts it in a regulator to DC, then through an inverter to run back to an AC motor — not at 60 cycles but as low as 20 cycles to run as energy efficient while meeting the heat dissipation requirements and as quiet as possible.

Latest technologies have developed to provide effective high-speed circuit breaker disconnects of the high-voltage DC lines. Unlike AC power, which goes to 0 volts 60 times per second, the DC current level is constant. To the nearest thousand miles, electricity travels at 186,000 miles per second. If you see wind turbines not rotating at a given location, you can pretty much assume the wind is blowing through others in other locations most times in our country.

Yes, solar panels only convert energy during the day, and we need sources like natural gas-driven turbine power plants to generate electricity in the years to come. However, taking action like making our long line power grid transmit DC power can mitigate the interoperability problems of 60-cycle AC power grids with wind turbines and solar sources we face today.

Everyone’s property rights need to be respected in terms of new energy generation and distribution. Wind turbines, solar panels and high-power transmission towers will always have a certain amount of industrial look to them. We need to make sure we are good stewards of the land and nature.

What we can’t allow to happen is what occurred on the 120-acre farm that once was my grandfather’s. White silica sand was mined out of the ground and transported by truck to feed the fracking process being done in places like Pennsylvania to mine natural gas. The red arrow shows the area of my family farm in Illinois that was now mined-out farmland. The green area was saved only due to the fact of a 19th-century family cemetery being present.

Replay the presidential debate between Donald Trump and Kamala Harris to hear Trump state how wrong Harris was initially on the environmental effects of fracking, only to change her mind to be in favor. He even mentions it in his closing remarks. She did change her mind, but it must be noted that the technology also changed in about 2018 to allow brown sand, like you find in west Texas, to be used in place of the round ball barring type white silica sand in applications less than 800 feet deep. So much for the old Carpenter family farm mined out before August 2019 before mining in LaSalle County (Ill.) farmland essentially stopped.

Not much is being said about the new energy generation facility on Koch’s Lane just west of Ambiance. It looks like all the solar panels are in, as well as other equipment (maybe inverters). The lithium iron phosphate batteries likely need to come from China, so it will be interesting when the facility can take delivery. China is fourth in countries with the most lithium reserves behind Chile, Australia and Argentina.

We should be mindful of how Lithium is mined in places like China. This solar farm will be different in terms of most other solar farms, as it stores much of its energy in very large banks of these batteries and goes online only when high power usage requires help to reduce “brownouts” or voltage reduction, which causes more inefficient energy consumption.

I hope you find some of what I have written to be helpful. Try to balance your judgments to include considerations of making the best use of new technologies being developed by some of the smartest people in this world.

I think I understand what new electrical generation hardware placed in given areas means to people. A while back, I was not in favor of an ethanol plant being across the road from my front yard but may have considered at the time being bought out at 50% above market value of my home and the homes of my neighbors so people working at the plant could live in that housing close to work.

Now comes new efforts to build many new nuclear power plants in the U.S. They take great amounts of water to cool them, so planting them next to the Mississippi River and our community could very well happen.

The grants, largely awarded during former President Joe Biden’s final few months in the White House, were primarily for programs to capture carbon emissions and store them underground. Other targeted efforts span cleaner cement, natural gas and more.

Some of the 24 canceled awards include $500 million to Heidelberg Materials US, Inc.; $375 million to Eastman Chemical Company; $95 million to Nevada Gold Mines, LLC; and $270 million to Sutter CCUS, among others, according to a list provided by the Department of Energy. Sublime Systems, which lost an $87 million grant, was “surprised and disappointed,” the company said in a statement.

“Today’s action is bad for U.S. competitiveness in the global market and also directly contradictory to the administration’s stated goals of supporting energy production and environmental innovation,” said Conrad Schneider, a senior director at the Clean Air Task Force. It “undercuts U.S. competitiveness at a time when there is a growing global market for cleaner industrial products and technologies.”

The news was a swift follow-up to plans the Energy Department announced earlier this month to review 179 funded projects, totaling over $15 billion, that were awarded by the Office of Clean Energy Demonstrations created under the 2021 bipartisan infrastructure law.

It is part of Wright’s pledge to ensure “responsible” spending — aligning with the government’s broader efficiency and cost-cutting measures, such as those recommended by the Department of Government Efficiency, which has significantly impacted federal research, workers and agencies.

“While the previous administration failed to conduct a thorough financial review before signing away billions of taxpayer dollars, the Trump administration is doing our due diligence to ensure we are utilizing taxpayer dollars to strengthen our national security, bolster affordable, reliable energy sources and advance projects that generate the highest possible return on investment,” Wright said in Friday’s statement.

Moreover, the announcement marks the latest of the administration’s attacks on clean energy, broadly, and its effort to slash federal support for projects addressing climate change.

The Trump administration has taken an ax to Biden-era environmental ambitions, rolled back landmark regulations, withdrawn climate project funding, and instead bolstered support for oil and gas production in the name of an “American energy dominance” agenda.

Steven Nadel, executive director of the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy, called the news “shortsighted.”

Carbon capture has been a controversial climate solution, as skeptics say it enables the continued burning of fossil fuels oil, coal and natural gas that emit planet-warming greenhouse gases — including carbon dioxide — and distracts from the need to cut ties with those energy sources altogether. Though investment in the technology has grown, it also remains challenging to scale.

Organizations quickly decried the secretary’s actions, stressing that the cancelations don’t align with the administration’s goals to bolster domestic manufacturing or energy independence.

Jessie Stolark, the executive director of the nonpartisan Carbon Capture Coalition, said the news “is a major step backward” for carbon management technologies, which are “crucial to meeting America’s growing demand for affordable, reliable, and sustainable energy.”

“These projects are not just reducing pollution, they are keeping the U.S. on the cutting edge of manufacturing technology,” said Mike Williams, senior fellow on the energy and environment team at public policy and advocacy group the Center for American Progress. “Canceling these important projects will raise energy prices for consumers and sacrifice thousands of high-quality union jobs, all because the president wants to curry favor with Big Oil.”

Evan Gillespie, partner at decarbonization organization, Industrious Labs, said the move dismantles the economy and the future of American manufacturing and its workforce.

“Killing these projects means more emissions, more pollution, and more people getting sick,” he said.

A team of scientists just solved a fusion energy problem that's held researchers back for nearly 70 years — and the fix could fast-track cheaper, cleaner electricity.

Fusion works by fusing atoms together to produce heat, just like the sun does. That heat can be used to make electricity without burning gas or coal and without creating long-lived nuclear waste. It's clean, safe, and virtually limitless.

But fusion depends on super-hot plasma trapped inside magnetic fields. And for decades, one problem has stayed unsolved: high-energy particles kept slipping through gaps in those magnetic fields, draining energy and killing the reaction.

Now, researchers at the University of Texas at Austin, Los Alamos National Lab, and Type One Energy say they've cracked it. Their new method pinpoints and fixes those ""holes"" using a faster and more accurate approach, reducing design time for fusion reactors by up to 90%.

""What's most exciting is that we're solving something that's been an open problem for almost 70 years,"" said lead researcher Josh Burby. ""It's a paradigm shift in how we design these reactors.""

This discovery could jumpstart the development of stellarators — a fusion reactor design known for reliability and safety. Until now, they've been slow to build because of their complex magnetic systems. This fix removes that roadblock.

It could also improve tokamak designs, which face different risks. In tokamaks, poorly contained particles can damage the reactor walls. The new method helps engineers map and avoid those failure points before they become dangerous.

""There is currently no practical way to find a theoretical answer to the alpha-particle confinement question without our results,"" Burby said. ""Direct application of Newton's laws is too expensive. Perturbation methods commit gross errors. Ours is the first theory that circumvents these pitfalls.""

Faster, safer design could lead to working reactors sooner than expected — a win for cities, power companies, and families stuck with rising energy costs. Fusion doesn't rely on mining or drilling, and once it's running, it's far cheaper to maintain than dirty fuels.

Fewer dirty power plants mean less heat-trapping pollution and cleaner air, especially for neighborhoods near industrial sites. That also means fewer asthma attacks, fewer ER visits, and healthier communities.

Until fusion reaches your block, the easiest way to save money and support clean energy is at home. Installing solar panels can bring your energy costs close to $0. EnergySage makes it easy to compare quotes from vetted local installers and save up to $10,000.

Type One Energy is already building next-generation reactors using this new approach. Other companies, like TAE Technologies and Commonwealth Fusion Systems, are racing toward similar goals.",https://www.thecooldown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/fusion-energyimage-recUC0zlgLPj0TxU3.jpg,N,,2025-05-31 16:07:20.294055

The grants, largely awarded during former President Joe Biden's final few months in the White House, were primarily for programs to capture carbon emissions and store them underground.
Sublime Systems, which lost an $87 million grant, was “surprised and disappointed,” the company said in a statement.
Moreover, the announcement marks the latest of the administration's attacks on clean energy, broadly, and its effort to slash federal support for projects addressing climate change.

The grants, largely awarded during former President Joe Biden's final few months in the White House, were primarily for programs to capture carbon emissions and store them underground. Other targeted efforts span cleaner cement, natural gas and more.

Some of the 24 canceled awards include $500 million to Heidelberg Materials US, Inc.; $375 million to Eastman Chemical Company; $95 million to Nevada Gold Mines, LLC; and $270 million to Sutter CCUS, among others, according to a list provided by the Department of Energy. Sublime Systems, which lost an $87 million grant, was “surprised and disappointed,” the company said in a statement.

“Today’s action is bad for U.S. competitiveness in the global market and also directly contradictory to the administration’s stated goals of supporting energy production and environmental innovation,” said Conrad Schneider, a senior director at the Clean Air Task Force. It “undercuts U.S. competitiveness at a time when there is a growing global market for cleaner industrial products and technologies.”

The news was a swift follow-up to plans the Energy Department announced earlier this month to review 179 funded projects, totaling over $15 billion, that were awarded by the Office of Clean Energy Demonstrations created under the 2021 bipartisan infrastructure law.

It is part of Wright's pledge to ensure “responsible” spending — aligning with the government's broader efficiency and cost-cutting measures, such as those recommended by the Department of Government Efficiency, which has significantly impacted federal research, workers and agencies.

“While the previous administration failed to conduct a thorough financial review before signing away billions of taxpayer dollars, the Trump administration is doing our due diligence to ensure we are utilizing taxpayer dollars to strengthen our national security, bolster affordable, reliable energy sources and advance projects that generate the highest possible return on investment,"" Wright said in Friday's statement.

Moreover, the announcement marks the latest of the administration's attacks on clean energy, broadly, and its effort to slash federal support for projects addressing climate change.

The Trump administration has taken an ax to Biden-era environmental ambitions, rolled back landmark regulations, withdrawn climate project funding, and instead bolstered support for oil and gas production in the name of an “American energy dominance” agenda.

Steven Nadel, executive director of the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy, called the news “shortsighted.”

Carbon capture has been a controversial climate solution, as skeptics say it enables the continued burning of fossil fuels oil, coal and natural gas that emit planet-warming greenhouse gases — including carbon dioxide — and distracts from the need to cut ties with those energy sources altogether. Though investment in the technology has grown, it also remains challenging to scale.

Industry decries the news

Organizations quickly decried the secretary's actions, stressing that the cancelations don't align with the administration's goals to bolster domestic manufacturing or energy independence.

Jessie Stolark, the executive director of the nonpartisan Carbon Capture Coalition, said the news “is a major step backward"" for carbon management technologies, which are “crucial to meeting America’s growing demand for affordable, reliable, and sustainable energy.”

“These projects are not just reducing pollution, they are keeping the U.S. on the cutting edge of manufacturing technology,"" said Mike Williams, senior fellow on the energy and environment team at public policy and advocacy group the Center for American Progress. ""Canceling these important projects will raise energy prices for consumers and sacrifice thousands of high-quality union jobs, all because the president wants to curry favor with Big Oil.”

Evan Gillespie, partner at decarbonization organization, Industrious Labs, said the move dismantles the economy and the future of American manufacturing and its workforce.

When the IRA was passed in 2022, there was immediate backlash against the provisions for carbon capture.

The Carbon Capture Coalition is urging lawmakers to restore transferability now that the bill has moved from the House to the Senate.","Dig down about a mile or two in parts of the United States and you’ll start to see the remains of an ancient ocean. The shells of long dead sea creatures are compressed into white limestone, surrounding brine aquifers with a higher salt content than the Atlantic Ocean.

Last summer, Exxon Mobil sponsored week-long camps to teach grade school students from Texas, Louisiana, and Mississippi about the virtues of these aquifers, specifically their ability to serve as carbon capture and sequestration wells, where oil, gas, and heavy industry can bury harmful emissions deep underground. In one exercise, students were given 20 minutes to build a model reservoir out of vegetable oil, Play-Doh, pasta, and uncooked beans. Whoever could keep the most vegetable oil (meant to represent liquified carbon dioxide) in their aquifer, won.

This kind of down-home carbon capture boosterism is a relatively new development for the oil and gas giant. Over recent years, Exxon Mobil and other fossil fuel companies have spent millions lobbying for government support of what they see as industry-friendly green technology, most prominently carbon capture and storage, which many scientists and environmental activists have argued is ineffective and distracts from eliminating fossil fuel operations in the first place. According to Exxon’s website, it’s evidence that they are leading “the biggest energy transition in history.”

Now that Congress has turned its attention to rolling back government spending on renewable energy, it appears that most of the climate “solutions” being left off the chopping block are the ones favored by carbon-intensive companies like Exxon. Corporate tax breaks for carbon capture and storage, for instance, were one of the few things left untouched when House Republicans passed a budget bill on May 22 that effectively gutted the Inflation Reduction Act, or IRA, the Biden administration’s signature climate legislation. What remained of the IRA’s clean energy tax credits were incentives for nuclear, so-called clean fuels like ethanol, and carbon capture. When the IRA was passed in 2022, there was immediate backlash against the provisions for carbon capture.

“Essentially, we, the taxpayers, are subsidizing a private sewer system for oil and gas,” said Sandra Steingraber, a senior scientist at the nonprofit Science and Environmental Health Network.

The tax credits for nuclear power plants, which produce energy without emitting greenhouse gases, are meant to spur what President Donald Trump hopes will be an “energy renaissance,” bolstered by a flurry of pro-nuclear executive orders he issued a day after the budget bill cleared the House. Projects will be able to use the tax credits if they begin construction by 2031; wind and solar companies, however, will lose access to tax credits unless they begin construction within 60 days of Trump signing the bill, and are fully up and running by 2028.

That the carbon capture tax credit was never in danger of being revoked is a testament to its importance to the oil and gas industry, said Jim Walsh, the policy director at the nonprofit Food and Water Watch. “The major beneficiaries of these tax credits are oil and gas companies and big agricultural interests.”

The carbon capture tax credit was first established in 2008, but the subsidies were more than doubled when it was tacked on to the IRA in order to get former senator Joe Manchin of West Virginia’s vote. Companies now receive $60 for every ton of CO2 captured and used to drive oil out of the ground (a process known as “enhanced oil recovery”) and up to $85 for a ton of CO2 that is permanently stored. As roughly 60 percent of captured C02 in the United States is used for enhanced oil recovery, detractors see the tax credit as something of a devil’s bargain, a provision that props up an industry at taxpayer expense.

How much carbon is actually captured by these projects is also a matter of debate. The tax credit requires companies that claim it to self-report how much CO2 they inject to the Internal Revenue Service. The Environmental Protection Agency, meanwhile, is in charge of tracking leaks. There are tax penalties if captured carbon ends up leaking, but those penalties only apply if the leaks occur in the first three years after injection. Holding companies accountable is made more complicated by the fact that tax returns are confidential, and Walsh cautions that there is very little communication between the EPA and the IRS. Oversight is “very, very minimal,” added Anika Juhn, an energy data analyst at the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis, a research firm.

“You can keep some really played out oil fields going for a long time, and you can get the public to pay for it,” said Carolyn Raffensberger, the executive director of the Science and Environmental Health Network, explaining the potential impact of the budget bill. “So the argument is, ‘This is a win for the climate, it’s a win for energy dominance.’ [But] it’s really a budget buster with no guardrails at all.”

Existing carbon-capture facilities have been plagued by technical and financial issues. The country’s first commercial carbon capture plant in Decatur, Illinois, sprung two leaks last year directly under Lake Decatur, which is the town’s main source of drinking water. When concentrated CO2 hits water it turns into carbonic acid, which then leaches heavy metals from rocks within the aquifer and poisons the water. Although a certain level of public health concerns come with many emerging technologies, critics point out that all of this risk is being taken for a technology that has not been proven to work at scale, and may actually increase emissions by incentivizing more oil and gas production. It could also strain the existing electrical grid — outfitting a natural gas or coal plant with carbon capture equipment can suck up about 15 to 25 percent of the plant’s power.

The tax credits exist “to pollute and confuse people,” said Mark Jacobsen, a professor of civil and environmental engineering at Stanford University, who has argued that there is essentially no reasonable use for carbon capture. They “increase people’s [energy] costs and do nothing for the climate.”

But the technology does have its defenders among scientists. The 2022 report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change called an increase in carbon capture technology “unavoidable” if countries want to reach net-zero emissions. Jessie Stolark, the executive director of the Carbon Capture Coalition, an umbrella organization of fossil fuel companies, unions, and environmental groups, contends that arguments like Jacobsen’s unnecessarily set the technology against renewables. “We need all the solutions in the toolkit,” she said. “We’re not saying don’t deploy these other technologies. We see this very much as a complementary and supportive piece in the broader decarbonization toolkit.”

Stolark said that carbon capture didn’t make it out of the budget process entirely unscathed, as the bill specified that companies could no longer sell carbon capture tax credits. So-called “transferability” — the ability to sell these tax credits on the open market — has been invaluable to small energy startups that have struggled to secure financing in their early stages, according to Stolark. The Carbon Capture Coalition is urging lawmakers to restore transferability now that the bill has moved from the House to the Senate.

Still, the kinds of companies likely to claim carbon capture tax credits — often major players in oil and gas, ammonia, steel, and other heavy industries — are less likely to rely on transferability than more modest companies (often providers of renewable energy), whose smaller tax bills makes it harder for them to realize the value of their respective tax credits.

“A lot of the factories, the power plants, the industrial facilities deploying within the next ten years or so, are expected to be these really big [facilities] with the big tax burdens,” said Dan O’Brien, a senior modeling analyst at Energy Innovations, a clean energy think tank based in San Francisco. “They’re not the type of smaller producers — like small solar companies — that are reliant on transferability in order to monetize the tax credit.”",https://grist.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/CCS-Well.jpeg?quality=75&strip=all,N,,2025-05-31 15:06:25.482925

The move is part of a broader rollback of 24 clean energy projects nationwide that “failed to advance the energy needs of the American people,” according to U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright.
The decision comes more than a year after the federal government announced $6 billion in funding for dozens of industrial decarbonization projects across the country, including six in Texas.
With Friday’s announcement, funding for four of the six Texas projects has now been rescinded.
“Choosing to cancel these awards is shortsighted, and I think we’re going to look back at this moment with regret.”","The U.S. Department of Energy on Friday canceled more than $1 billion in clean energy funding for Texas as part of a continuing effort to reduce federal spending.

The move is part of a broader rollback of 24 clean energy projects nationwide that “failed to advance the energy needs of the American people,” according to U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright.

“The Trump administration is doing our due diligence to ensure we are utilizing taxpayer dollars to strengthen our national security, bolster affordable, reliable energy sources and advance projects that generate the highest possible return on investment,” he said.

Among the canceled awards is a $331.9 million grant to ExxonMobil to replace natural gas with hydrogen at its Baytown Olefins Plant — a move that was expected to cut the facility’s emissions by more than half. Also canceled were a $270 million grant to Calpine for a carbon-capture facility in Baytown, a $375 million award to Eastman Chemical for a molecular recycling project in Longview, and a $99 million grant to Orsted for a clean methanol initiative along the Gulf Coast.

A spokesperson for ExxonMobil declined to comment on Friday. Calpine, Eastman Chemical and Orsted didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment.

The decision comes more than a year after the federal government announced $6 billion in funding for dozens of industrial decarbonization projects across the country, including six in Texas. With Friday’s announcement, funding for four of the six Texas projects has now been rescinded.

According to Energy Secretary Wright, the decision is expected to generate “an immediate $3.6 billion in savings for the American people.” Critics, however, argue the cancellations threaten the country’s energy innovation and manufacturing future.

“This program could have been a centerpiece of achieving the administration’s goal to bring manufacturing back to the United States,” said Steven Nadel, executive director of the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy. “Choosing to cancel these awards is shortsighted, and I think we’re going to look back at this moment with regret.”",https://cdn.houstonpublicmedia.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/30162601/power-plant-weatherization-tour-51629999110-o-1500x1000.webp,N,,2025-05-31 12:19:06.403922

PennEnvironment Research & Policy Center and Evergreen Action have released a new interactive map that highlights federal clean energy investments in Pennsylvania.

The map tracks renewable energy projects across the state that utilize federal funds from the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), allowing users to see the businesses, houses of worship, and public buildings pursuing projects ranging from installing solar panels and increasing energy efficiency to monitoring air quality and planting trees.

“Federal investments are fueling growth in local industries, creating new jobs, and laying the groundwork for long-term prosperity,” said Julia Kortrey, Deputy State Policy Director of Evergreen Action. “Pennsylvanians deserve an affordable, clean energy future, and these funds are making that future a reality.”

The release also provides Pennsylvanians interested in switching to clean energy alternatives with a “clean energy home toolkit,” a resource guide on how to use rebates and tax incentives from the IRA. In the first year after the IRA’s implementation of tax credits for individuals, businesses, and nonprofits, 160,000 Pennsylvanians saved more than $260 million.

“With these tax credits and incentives there’s never been a better time to go solar or get a heat pump or [electric vehicle],” said Ellie Kearns, PennEnvironment’s Climate and Clean Energy Advocate. Although up-front costs can be high, the incentives and credits available in the clean energy home toolkit can greatly reduce the costs of switching to renewable energy. At the same time, energy efficient upgrades will “pay for themselves” in the long run, “especially as utility bills continue to rise,” added Kearns.

The tools provided by PennEnvironment and Evergreen indicate reasons for optimism regarding the future of clean energy in Pennsylvania. According to PennEnvironment Deputy Director Flora Cardoni, “Pennsylvania has an immense, largely untapped opportunity when it comes to clean energy. And we have the technology to build a clean energy future today.” Cardoni pointed to data from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory showing that, if Pennsylvania continues to pursue clean energy projects, the state has the technical potential to generate five times its electricity demand in 2020 from the sun and 15% of its annual electricity demand from the wind.

Currently, however, Pennsylvania lags behind other states in growing renewable energy generation. For example, while Pennsylvania increased clean energy production by 57 percent between 2015 and 2024, it ranked 49th out of the 50 states by percent increase in total solar, wind and geothermal generation during that period. By contrast, neighboring states including New York, New Jersey, Maryland, and Ohio greatly outperformed the Commonwealth in increasing their generation of solar power.

There is, however, a plan in the pipeline which would help bring Pennsylvania back on par with its neighbors. In April, Governor Shapiro unveiled his Lightning Plan, a six-part legislative package which would “put the Keystone State on the path towards a new, cleaner energy future.” The various pieces of legislation contained in this plan would require utility companies supplying electricity in Pennsylvania to get 35 percent of their power from renewable energy sources by 2035, streamline the process to approve new clean energy projects, create programs to help Pennsylvanians switch to solar power and lower pollution, and create more tax breaks and incentives for switching to renewable energy.

READ: Pennsylvanians Won Important Victories for Clean Energy and the Environment in 2024

Polling shows that there is widespread bipartisan support in Pennsylvania for increasing renewable energy production. According to a poll conducted by Global Strategy Group in 2024, 93 percent of Democrats, 84 percent of independents, and 59 percent of Republicans support increasing the use of wind and solar energy.

The use of federal tax credits and incentives to promote a transition to clean energy, including those deployed under the IRA, enjoys even broader support. Another 2024 poll showed that “87 percent of Americans support federal incentives to deploy solar and energy storage, including 78 percent of 2020 Trump voters.”

Despite this bipartisan support, federal tax credits and incentives are on the chopping block during the ongoing congressional budget negotiations. “If the tax credits are repealed,” said Kearns, “we expect that many individuals, businesses, and non-profits will slow or even stop their efforts to install solar, buy EVs, [or] switch to heat pumps because the price becomes out of reach for at least the near future.”

In addition, the Trump administration is attempting to claw back congressionally approved grants distributed under the IRA to state and local governments, businesses, and farmers. If these efforts are successful, many of the projects illuminated in this new interactive map will likely be cancelled.

“There is some grant money that has already been dispersed and even used already, but there are also grants that have been paused or even attempted to be rolled back,” said Kearns. “The Shapiro administration has been suing so that Pennsylvania gets the money that it was allocated, but the fate of a lot of this funding is still murky and unknown.”

Red states and congressional districts have benefitted the most from the IRA since its passage: More than 110 major clean energy and clean vehicle factories and other projects are in development or have already broken ground in the southeastern states. Twenty-one house Republicans, including Reps. Ryan Mackenzie and Rob Bresnahan from Pennsylvania, have signed onto a letter asking congressional leaders not to repeal tax credits, but the future of these clean energy incentives remains uncertain.

PennEnvironment advocates have urged a call to action for Pennsylvanians who want to protect clean energy investments. “Pennsylvanians … should call their Congressmember and Senators and ask them to maintain all clean energy and energy efficiency tax credits, rebates, and incentives so those who want to can choose clean energy,” said Kearns.

Cardoni added that residents should also urger theur state lawmakers to pass Gov. Shapiro’s Lightning Plan and “prioritize other policies that would increase the amount of clean, renewable energy like wind and solar in the state and that would improve energy efficiency and conservation.”",https://982e8d80.delivery.rocketcdn.me/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Clean-energy_Pennsylvania.jpg,N,,2025-05-31 11:03:25.440552

From a purely business perspective, the elimination of Energy Star isn’t merely about labels on appliances; it directly impacts operational costs, performance consistency and market competitiveness.

The Energy Star program stands as a remarkably successful example of a public-private partnership that delivers substantial, measurable benefits to American consumers and businesses and the environment.

Energy Star has long provided clear and reliable standards that have enabled small businesses to make informed investments in energy-efficient products. This clarity translates into direct financial savings, reducing energy expenses by up to 30 percent according to the Environmental Protection Agency’s own data.

Especially for small businesses operating on tight margins, these savings aren’t trivial — they represent critical capital that can be reinvested into core business activities such as product development, hiring additional employees or expanding market reach.

Beyond immediate cost reductions, Energy Star has established an essential standardization in measuring and reporting appliance and equipment performance. Small business owners have relied on these standards to make purchases confidently, knowing they are investing in products that perform efficiently and reliably over their lifespan.

Without the program, businesses face increased uncertainty, leading to potentially costly investments in substandard products that fail to deliver the promised efficiency and reliability.

Consumer trust, a crucial component of market competitiveness for all businesses, is also at risk. The label is widely recognized and trusted by a majority of American households, signaling verified quality and efficiency.

Its absence would likely result in an influx of misleading performance claims and unverified efficiency assertions, damaging consumer confidence and creating a competitive environment where cutting corners becomes commonplace. This race to the bottom ultimately harms businesses committed to genuine quality and performance standards.

Moreover, from an economic standpoint, the return on investment provided by the program speaks for itself — every federal dollar spent on the program results in approximately $350 in cost savings for businesses and consumers alike. Small businesses particularly benefit from these savings, which enhance profitability, improve cash flow and bolster overall economic resilience.

The decision to defund Energy Star appears driven less by fiscal prudence and more by an ideological stance against terms like “climate change” and “sustainability.” However, dismissing these concepts as mere political rhetoric overlooks the substantial and proven economic benefits they offer businesses and consumers.

Efficiency and sustainability are practical, financially responsible strategies that reduce operational costs, strengthen consumer confidence and enhance long-term business viability.

Ultimately, maintaining funding for Energy Star isn’t about ideological debates, it’s a smart business decision that helps American businesses and consumers. Preserving a program that has demonstrably reduced costs, standardized performance and protected consumer trust should be a straightforward choice for any administration committed to the economic health and competitiveness of American small businesses.",https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/05/energy-star_05072025_AP_AP25127640518935.jpg?w=1280,N,,2025-05-31 14:06:23.101246

Lawmakers still want to attract data centers, but a bill that would speed up direct hookups between data centers and power plants has provisions that are drawing protests from business groups.","HARRISBURG, Pa. (AP) — The explosive growth of the data centers needed to power America's fast-rising demand for artificial intelligence and cloud computing platforms has spurred states to dangle incentives in hopes of landing an economic bonanza, but it's also eliciting pushback from lawmakers and communities.

Activity in state legislatures — and competition for data centers — has been brisk in recent months, amid an intensifying buildout of the energy-hungry data centers and a search for new sites that was ignited by the late 2022 debut of OpenAI’s ChatGPT.

Many states are offering financial incentives worth tens of millions of dollars. In some cases, those incentives are winning approval, but only after a fight or efforts to require data centers to pay for their own electricity or meet energy efficiency standards.

Some state lawmakers have contested the incentives in places where a heavy influx of massive data centers has caused friction with neighboring communities. In large part, the fights revolve around the things that tech companies and data center developers seem to most want: large tracts of land, tax breaks and huge volumes of electricity and water.

And their needs are exploding in size: from dozens of megawatts to hundreds of megawatts and from dozens of acres up to hundreds of acres for large-scale data centers sometimes called a hyperscaler.

While critics say data centers employ relatively few people and pack little long-term job-creation punch, their advocates say they require a huge number of construction jobs to build, spend enormous sums on goods and local vendors and generate strong tax revenues for local governments.

In Pennsylvania, lawmakers are writing legislation to fast-track permitting for data centers. The state is viewed as an up-and-coming data center destination, but there is also a sense that Pennsylvania is missing out on billions of dollars in investment that's landing in other states.

“Pennsylvania has companies that are interested, we have a labor force that is capable and we have a lot of water and natural gas,” said state Rep. Eric Nelson. ""That’s the winning combination. We just have a bureaucratic process that won’t open its doors.”

It's been a big year for data centers

Kansas approved a new sales tax exemption on goods to build and equip data centers, while Kentucky and Arkansas expanded pre-existing exemptions so that more projects will qualify.

Michigan approved one that carries some protections, including requirements to use municipal utility water and clean energy, meet energy-efficiency measures and ensure that it pays for its own electricity.

Such tax exemptions are now so widespread — about three dozen states have some version of it — that it is viewed as a must-have for a state to compete.

“It’s often a nonstarter if you don’t have them, for at least the hyperscalers,” said Andy Cvengros, who helps lead the data center practice at commercial real estate giant JLL. “It’s just such a massive impact on the overall spend of the data center.”

Zoning, energy fights often frustrate developers

In West Virginia, lawmakers approved a bill to create “microgrid” districts free from local zoning and electric rate regulations where data centers can procure power from standalone power plants.

Gov. Patrick Morrisey, a Republican, called the bill his “landmark policy proposal” for 2025 to put West Virginia “in a class of its own to attract new data centers and information technology companies.”

Utah and Oklahoma passed laws to make it easier for data center developers to procure their own power supply without going through the grid while Mississippi rolled out tens of millions of dollars in incentives last year to land a pair of Amazon data centers.

In South Carolina, Gov. Henry McMaster signed legislation earlier this month that eased regulations to speed up power plant construction to meet demand from data centers, including a massive Facebook facility.

The final bill was fought by some lawmakers who say they worried about data centers using disproportionate amounts of water, taking up large tracts of land and forcing regular ratepayers to finance the cost of new power plants.

“I do not like that we’re making customers pay for two power plants when they only need one,” Senate Majority Leader Shane Massey told colleagues during floor debate.

Still, state Sen. Russell Ott suggested that data centers should be viewed like any other electricity customer because they reflect a society that is “addicted” to electricity and are “filling that need and that desire of what we all want. And we're all guilty of it. We’re all responsible for it.”

Some lawmakers are hesitant

In data center hotspots, some lawmakers are pushing back.

Lawmakers in Oregon are advancing legislation to order utility regulators to ensure data centers pay the cost of power plants and power lines necessary to serve them.

Georgia lawmakers are debating a similar bill.

In Virginia, the most heavily developed data center zone in the U.S., Gov. Glenn Youngkin vetoed a bill that would have forced more disclosures from data center developers about their site's noise pollution and water use.

In Texas, which endured a deadly winter blackout in 2021, lawmakers are wrestling with how to protect the state's electric grid from fast-growing data center demand.

Lawmakers still want to attract data centers, but a bill that would speed up direct hookups between data centers and power plants has provisions that are drawing protests from business groups.

Those provisions would give utility regulators new authority to approve those agreements and order big electric users such as data centers to switch to backup generators in a power emergency.

Walt Baum, the CEO of Powering Texans, which represents competitive power plant owners, warned lawmakers that those provisions might be making data center developers hesitant to do business in Texas.

“You’ve seen a lot of new announcements in other states and over the last several months and not as much here in Texas,"" Baum told House members during a May 7 committee hearing. ""I think everybody right now is in a waiting pattern and I worry that we could be losing to other states while that waiting pattern is happening.”

But the grid was missing 4,500 megawatts from “unplanned outages” last weekend, MISO wrote.

Entergy has said its internal projections didn’t show the need for forced outages, and that MISO didn’t give it any advance warning.
Andy Kowalczyk, transmission director for the Southern Renewable Energy Association, said the scale of the unplanned outages — 4,500 megawatts — is huge.","Louisiana’s electric grid was missing a huge amount of power last weekend because of unplanned outages at power plants, contributing to the grid operator’s decision to order forced blackouts to avoid a “catastrophic” blackout similar to a recent crisis in Spain and Portugal, according to an internal memo.

The Mid-Continent Independent System Operator, which operates the electric grid in a large swath of middle America, abruptly ordered Entergy and Cleco to “shed load” last Sunday or initiate forced blackouts for about 100,000 in the New Orleans region. The event has raised concerns from regulators and elected officials, who have scheduled multiple upcoming hearings about why the public wasn’t notified sooner and how the customers who had the lights turned off were chosen.

The operator, known as MISO, wrote in a memo shared with some government officials Friday that it was aware of power plants that were down for routine maintenance, which it said is normal in the spring. The Times-Picayune obtained a copy of the memo.

But the grid was missing 4,500 megawatts from “unplanned outages” last weekend, MISO wrote. That’s enough electricity to theoretically power several million homes.

It says a “major transmission line” was also out of service because of tornadoes in March. And temperatures were higher than normal over the weekend.

Asked about the memo on Friday, MISO spokesperson Brandon Morris said there were seven total unplanned outages leading up to the blackout, including a large power station that went offline last Wednesday, presumably the River Bend nuclear plant. MISO doesn’t share unit-specific information, but Entergy’s River Bend was shut down on that date because of a leak and didn’t come back on for five days. It’s not clear which other power plants were out, but Louisiana’s utilities rely heavily on natural gas to generate electricity.

The unplanned outages that MISO described shed more light on why residents faced forced blackouts. But they also raise more questions about who owns the generators that went down and why they were offline.

Entergy New Orleans spokesperson Beau Tidwell said in an email Friday that Entergy had three units on planned maintenance outages before the River Bend unit went down, and that those were accounted for by MISO.

He said ""other non-Entergy owned units were also experiencing outages during the event.""

""As we have noted, Entergy's models did not show the need for load shed, but we recognize that MISO's models have a broader view of the grid due to its status as the regional transmission operator,"" Tidwell said.

The transmission line that was out was an Entergy line that was destroyed by tornadoes in March and was still being rebuilt. Tidwell said Entergy had developed a ""reconfiguration protocol"" while the line was down.

Some officials have criticized MISO’s lack of advance notice, which could have allowed Entergy or regulators to curtail power usage before requiring blackouts. Instead, city council members said Entergy only received a three-minute warning before having to cut power.

Logan Burke, head of the Alliance for Affordable Energy, said Friday that the huge amount of power being offline helps explain the load shed.

“The next question is, who owns that generation?” Burke said in an email. “Investigations are needed to identify why that much power dropped offline unexpectedly.”

MISO was managing the problems until Sunday, when transmission lines became overloaded, risking “cascading outages,” according to the memo.

“Absent shedding load, a catastrophic blackout (as Spain and Portugal recently experienced) could have occurred, causing significant damage to the transmission system in Southern Louisiana,” the memo said.

Entergy has said its internal projections didn’t show the need for forced outages, and that MISO didn’t give it any advance warning. In an email to customers Thursday, Entergy said it “regrets that Entergy was not provided with enough prior notice of the outage to prepare our customers for the potential loss of power.”

Entergy has long faced accusations that it does not have adequate transmission lines — which carry bulk power long distances — in its service territory. Amid scrutiny from the Department of Justice for allegedly wielding its monopoly to crowd out competitors, Entergy joined MISO in 2013. MISO directs where power flows and operates a wholesale market for the sale of bulk power.

Andy Kowalczyk, transmission director for the Southern Renewable Energy Association, said the scale of the unplanned outages — 4,500 megawatts — is huge.

When the grid loses large amounts of power, it can create instability on transmission lines, which get overheated if there’s too much demand and not enough power, he said. If Entergy had more transmission capacity in the region, Kowalczyk said power may have been able to more easily flow, stabilizing the grid.

“We had power locked up in Mississippi. We had power locked up north of Louisiana. It had no way to get where it needed to go,” he said. “Events like this are a reminder of how far behind MISO South is on planning. They’re about 10 years late.”",https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/nola.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/0/80/08016498-37e6-11ee-a8fa-17264d73953b/64d58e69c6d05.image.jpg?crop=1920%2C1008%2C0%2C35&resize=1200%2C630&order=crop%2Cresize,N,,2025-05-31 13:09:51.185799

This ""trillion-dollar win,"" as energy research nonprofit RMI called it, created over 300,000 new jobs between 2018 and 2024, spanning both the first Trump administration and the following Biden administration.

Both consumers and companies have increasingly invested in eco-friendly initiatives, demonstrating how going green is good for business. Federal and state governments have encouraged this by creating incentives for clean energy projects.

The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), which was passed in 2022, included Congress's largest investment in climate action. RMI reported that the IRA led to a tripling in quarterly clean energy technology investments over the past few years.

High-profile energy projects have cropped up in various states since the IRA's passage. For example, the Qcells solar panel factory in Dalton, Georgia, created 2,500 new jobs, with another 4,000 pending. Another solar manufacturing facility, First Solar, opened in Trinity, Alabama, last September and is expected to add 800 employees.

However, the future of these projects is uncertain because the Trump administration has announced intentions to roll back policies supporting them. This has caused some companies to suspend or slow down their investments.

Investment in clean energy helps protect the planet while creating new jobs for American workers. These projects have benefited red and blue states alike, with Republican voting states receiving slightly more, with 64% of new investments, according to RMI. Thus, it makes economic sense to continue incentivizing clean energy projects.

It can be difficult to find the right businesses to invest in, especially if you want your financial decisions to align with your values.

Energy Secretary Chris Wright said Friday he canceled nearly $4 billion in project grants, in another massive blow to clean energy and greenhouse gas emissions reduction efforts in the U.S. under President Donald Trump’s administration.

The grants, largely awarded during former President Joe Biden’s final few months in the White House, were primarily for programs to capture carbon emissions and store them underground. Other targeted efforts span cleaner cement, natural gas and more.

Some of the 24 canceled awards include $500 million to Heidelberg Materials US, Inc.; $375 million to Eastman Chemical Company; $95 million to Nevada Gold Mines, LLC; and $270 million to Sutter CCUS, among others, according to a list provided by the Department of Energy. Sublime Systems, which lost an $87 million grant, was “surprised and disappointed,” the company said in a statement.

“Today’s action is bad for U.S. competitiveness in the global market and also directly contradictory to the administration’s stated goals of supporting energy production and environmental innovation,” said Conrad Schneider, a senior director at the Clean Air Task Force. It “undercuts U.S. competitiveness at a time when there is a growing global market for cleaner industrial products and technologies.”

The news was a swift follow-up to plans the Energy Department announced earlier this month to review 179 funded projects, totaling over $15 billion, that were awarded by the Office of Clean Energy Demonstrations created under the 2021 bipartisan infrastructure law.

It is part of Wright’s pledge to ensure “responsible” spending — aligning with the government’s broader efficiency and cost-cutting measures, such as those recommended by the Department of Government Efficiency, which has significantly impacted federal research, workers and agencies.

“While the previous administration failed to conduct a thorough financial review before signing away billions of taxpayer dollars, the Trump administration is doing our due diligence to ensure we are utilizing taxpayer dollars to strengthen our national security, bolster affordable, reliable energy sources and advance projects that generate the highest possible return on investment,” Wright said in Friday’s statement.

Moreover, the announcement marks the latest of the administration’s attacks on clean energy, broadly, and its effort to slash federal support for projects addressing climate change.

The Trump administration has taken an ax to Biden-era environmental ambitions, rolled back landmark regulations, withdrawn climate project funding, and instead bolstered support for oil and gas production in the name of an “American energy dominance” agenda.

Steven Nadel, executive director of the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy, called the news “shortsighted.”

Carbon capture has been a controversial climate solution, as skeptics say it enables the continued burning of fossil fuels oil, coal and natural gas that emit planet-warming greenhouse gases — including carbon dioxide — and distracts from the need to cut ties with those energy sources altogether. Though investment in the technology has grown, it also remains challenging to scale.

Industry decries the news

Organizations quickly decried the secretary’s actions, stressing that the cancelations don’t align with the administration’s goals to bolster domestic manufacturing or energy independence.

Jessie Stolark, the executive director of the nonpartisan Carbon Capture Coalition, said the news “is a major step backward” for carbon management technologies, which are “crucial to meeting America’s growing demand for affordable, reliable, and sustainable energy.”

“These projects are not just reducing pollution, they are keeping the U.S. on the cutting edge of manufacturing technology,” said Mike Williams, senior fellow on the energy and environment team at public policy and advocacy group the Center for American Progress. “Canceling these important projects will raise energy prices for consumers and sacrifice thousands of high-quality union jobs, all because the president wants to curry favor with Big Oil.”

Evan Gillespie, partner at decarbonization organization, Industrious Labs, said the move dismantles the economy and the future of American manufacturing and its workforce.

“Killing these projects means more emissions, more pollution, and more people getting sick,” he said.

Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh explained in the Court’s opinion, “NEPA imposes no substantive environmental obligations or restrictions” on the board or on any other federal agency.
NEPA often hinders land development, as environmental groups or citizens opposing projects have the ability to sue, claiming that the STB that must approve the project did not prepare an adequate environmental impact statement.
“This partnership will identify underutilized federal land suitable for residential development and streamline the land transfer process,” explained DOI Secretary Doug Burgum in a March announcement.","The U.S. Supreme Court has handed down an opinion that argues excessive regulation of land development has made it too difficult to build housing in the U.S.

As per the case of Seven County Infrastructure Coalition v. Eagle County, Colorado, a proposed railroad project would run nearly 90 miles through the state Utah, connecting a remote region rich in oil to a more central rail network to simplify the transport of crude oil.

The Supreme Court held that the Surface Transportation Board (STB) was not required to consider certain environmental effects of the operation and construction of a proposed railway route. The Supreme Court determined the D.C. Circuit failed to provide appropriate deference to the STB under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) and had “incorrectly interpreted NEPA to require the STB to consider the environmental effects of upstream and downstream projects that are separate in time or place” (specifically oil drilling in Utah and oil production in the Gulf region) that might result from construction of the railway. NEPA is an environmental law designed to promote the enhancement of the environment, signed by President Richard Nixon, and considered one of the foundational environmental laws formed at the beginning of the modern environmental movement.

The Supreme Court’s decision is a setback for environmentalists, and President Donald Trump has criticized the government’s environmental review process as too cumbersome.

Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh explained in the Court’s opinion, “NEPA imposes no substantive environmental obligations or restrictions” on the board or on any other federal agency.

NEPA often hinders land development, as environmental groups or citizens opposing projects have the ability to sue, claiming that the STB that must approve the project did not prepare an adequate environmental impact statement.

“Under NEPA, agencies must consider the environmental impacts for which their decisions would be responsible,” wrote Sonia Sotomayor, Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States, in the Court’s opinion. “Here, the board correctly determined it would not be responsible for the consequences of oil production upstream or downstream from the railway because it could not lawfully consider those consequences as part of the approval process.”

In terms of future rural land development, the decision handed down in Seven County Infrastructure Coalition v. Eagle County, Colorado could impact the future of the U.S. Department of Housing & Urban Development (HUD) and U.S. Department of the Interior’s (DOI) Joint Task Force on Federal Land for Housing. The Joint Task Force is an initiative that identifies underutilized federal lands for residential development, streamlines land transfer processes, and promotes policies that increase the availability of affordable housing.

“This partnership will identify underutilized federal land suitable for residential development and streamline the land transfer process,” explained DOI Secretary Doug Burgum in a March announcement. “It will also promote policies to increase the availability of affordable housing, while balancing important environmental and land use considerations.”

The Joint Task Force on Federal Land for Housing will streamline regulatory processes so building on federal lands is not held up by environmental reviews, transfer protocols and other priorities.

“This is about more than building houses,” wrote the Secretaries in the Wall Street Journal. “We want to build hope. Overlooked rural and tribal communities will be a focus of this joint agreement. We are going to invest in America’s many forgotten communities. As we enter the Golden Age promised by President Trump, this partnership will change how we use public resources. A brighter future, with more affordable housing, is on its way.”",https://themortgagepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/AdobeStock_1422830349.jpeg,N,,2025-05-31 15:06:30.182788

A month after a round of layoffs, Tualatin grid-scale energy storage company Powin on Friday revealed ""the potential cessation of business operations"" at its headquarters and a Portland office.

In a layoff notice, the company told state and local officials that 96 employees in Oregon and 149 remote workers — a total of 245 — could lose their jobs.

""If Powin LLC's present business circumstances do not improve, it is currently anticipated that a layoff will occur on or before July 28, 2025,"" the company said.

Energy Secretary Chris Wright said his department decided to cancel 24 grants issued by the Biden administration because those projects were not economically viable and did not meet the nation's energy needs.

“While the previous administration failed to conduct a thorough financial review before signing away billions of taxpayer dollars, the Trump administration is doing our due diligence to ensure we are utilizing taxpayer dollars to strengthen our national security, bolster affordable, reliable energy sources and advance projects that generate the highest possible return on investment,” Wright said. “Today, we are acting in the best interest of the American people by canceling these 24 awards.”

Timothy Winters, president and CEO of Western New York Energy, did not return a request for comment on the Energy Department's move. But Juliette Strasser, communications and policy director for Skyven Technologies, the Texas-based company that partnered with Western New York Energy on the project, said the firm was disappointed to hear of the grant terminations.

""Skyven’s technology is cutting-edge and positions America for global leadership in industrial steam generation,"" she said. ""The Skyven portfolio of projects advance the DOE's and current administration’s goals to unleash American energy dominance, reduce energy costs and improve competitiveness for American manufacturers, support grid reliability, create American jobs and reduce the cost of American household goods.""

Strasser also indicated that the grant termination might not spell the end of the effort in Medina.

""We are reviewing the appeal process and will continue our efforts to increase efficiency and reduce operating costs for American manufacturers,"" she said.

Skyven announced last March that it had won $145 million in federal funding for its industrial decarbonization efforts. And last September, Skyven announced that it will install the largest-ever steam-generating heat pump at Western New York Energy, which produces ethanol and employs about 60 people, according to its website.

The steam pump technology would reduce the carbon dioxide output of the Medina facility by 20,000 metric tons annually, which would be equivalent to removing 4,300 vehicles from the road, Skyven said.

“By integrating Skyven’s cutting-edge Arcturus technology, we are taking significant strides in improving our community’s air quality by reducing our carbon footprint and improving our operational efficiencies,"" Winters said in Skyven's announcement of the program.

Told that the grant had been rescinded, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, a New York Democrat, said: ""This over $15 million federal grant for Skyven was promised to the community to help create new good-paying jobs and help reduce energy costs by shifting to steam production to help produce cheaper electricity ... This investment would have reduced the Medina plant’s expensive natural gas costs by up to 20%, all while making the community cleaner by reducing reliance on fossil fuels.""

Rep. Claudia Tenney, a Republican whose sprawling district includes Medina, did not return a request for comment.

""I hope Congresswoman Tenney will join me in denouncing this harmful cut by the Trump administration that will hurt local jobs and raise energy costs here in Orleans County,"" Schumer said.

In its list of grants that it was rescinding, the Department of Energy did not mention Western New York Energy. But it listed Skyven, the amount of the grant and the fact that it was awarded to a facility in Medina.

In its news release announcing the cancellation of the grants, the Department of Energy said it was primarily targeting carbon capture and sequestration and decarbonization initiatives. Such initiatives are part of the fight against climate change, given that scientists regard carbon dioxide as the main greenhouse gas that's warming the planet.

The cuts include nearly $332 million pulled from a project at ExxonMobil's Baytown, Texas, refinery complex, $500 million to Heidelberg Materials in Louisiana and $375 million to Eastman Chemical Company in Longview, Texas.

Carbon capture, often referred to as carbon capture and storage (CCS), is a climate change mitigation technology designed to prevent carbon dioxide emissions from entering the atmosphere or from the pollution streams of facilities, including refineries and plants that burn coal and make ethanol, for storage underground.

Climate change activists claim human-produced carbon emissions cause the earth to warm. Trump has long dismissed the theory and has often referred to progressive climate and energy policies as the ""Green New Scam,"" a play on the ""Green New Deal,"" a sweeping climate and economic proposal championed by progressive Democrats like Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y.

Environmental groups focused on energy decried the cuts. Steven Nadel, executive director of the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy, said the move was short-sighted and could stifle innovation.

""Locking domestic plants into outdated technology is not a recipe for future competitiveness or bringing manufacturing jobs back to American communities,"" Nadel said.

The Center for Climate and Energy Solutions estimated that the cuts to the projects, meant to be test cases for huge industrial programs, could result in the loss of 25,000 jobs and $4.6 billion in economic output.

The review of the projects came after the Energy Department sought to identify waste, protect America’s national security and advance President Trump’s goal to unleash affordable, reliable and secure energy for the American people, the agency said.

These funds will help address the environmental impacts of historically contaminated properties, paving the way for community revitalization and economic development. The city has been notified of the awards and is now working to submit all required documentation. It is anticipated that the project period for both grants will be Oct. 1, 2025, through Sept. 30, 2029, although the entire time frame may not be required for project completion.

Cleanup Grant: Remediation of the Former Knox Laundry Site

The $713,600 Cleanup Grant will support environmental remediation efforts at the former Knox Laundry site, located at the property previously known as 57 N. Kellogg St./332 E. Ferris St. Operated as a retail laundry since 1898 and later expanded into a multi-story dry-cleaning facility, the property was vacated and condemned due to its deteriorated condition and ultimately demolished by court order in 2006–2007. Terminating the business operations and removing former structures has stopped the potential for any continuing releases of contamination into our environment, but until the site is fully remediated, the potential for redevelopment is very limited.

The city plans to use grant funds to address remaining contamination, specifically targeting soils impacted above saturation limits. The project will include treatment of affected areas and installation of an engineered barrier, such as pavement, to safely limit potential exposure and prepare the site for future redevelopment.

The Trump administration’s ever-changing policies on tariffs and trade have injected chaos into the global energy economy.

On Wednesday, a federal court blocked President Donald Trump from being able to adopt tariffs under an emergency-powers law. The administration is appealing the ruling. This sets up additional legal wrangling in addition to the conflicts over trade that were already happening.

Analysts at the research firm Wood Mackenzie gave themselves the task of predicting where US tariff policy may be heading. The result is a report issued this week, “Trading Cases: Tariff Scenarios for Taxing Times,” that shows the huge gap in outcomes between a trade war and a trade truce.

My main takeaway from it is that everyone loses in a prolonged conflict. Even the oil and gas industry, which has close ties to the Trump administration, would face falling prices for its products at the same time that the costs of much of its equipment are rising because of tariffs.

The US renewable energy and battery industries stand out for the potential severity of their downturns because development here relies heavily on components made in other countries. The Biden administration sought to encourage manufacturers to build in the United States, but those efforts are still in their early stages, and many of the government incentives are now on the chopping block.

Under a “trade truce” scenario, in which tariffs return to 2024 levels, the global economy would grow by an average of 2.7 percent between now and 2030, the report says. The “trade tensions” scenario would mean that tariff barriers increase compared to last year, but the economy would still grow, albeit at a lower rate. The most damaging is the “trade war” scenario, with the United States maintaining an effective tariff rate of 30 percent or more, leading to a global recession.

The report says the middle forecast, “trade tensions,” is the most likely to occur.

Why is this conflict happening? The short version is that Trump and his advisers believe that tariffs will help the US economy by encouraging construction of factories here, reducing trade deficits and punishing barriers to entry of US products in other countries.

“We will supercharge our domestic industrial base,” Trump said in an April 2 speech announcing tariffs on nearly every US trading partner. “We will pry open foreign markets and break down foreign trade barriers and ultimately, more production at home will mean stronger competition and lower prices for consumers.”

A tariff is a tax charged by a government on imports. As the US government has increased its tariffs, other countries have retaliated with their own increases.

Adding to the chaos is that the policies frequently change, with the president often announcing shifts on social media, as happened in recent days on tariffs on the European Union.

I spoke with Chris Seiple, Wood Mackenzie’s vice chairman for power and renewables, to drill down on the parts of the report that deal with renewables. Here is that conversation, edited for length and clarity:

Dan Gearino: For renewable energy industries, is the big problem that tariffs make everything more expensive, or is there more to it than that?

Chris Seiple: Sure, things getting more expensive is a big part of it. I think the second challenge, and this is kind of unique to the power business, is that there’s a heavy hand of regulation. And so there’s a lot of US utilities that have to go through pretty extensive regulatory processes to get approval for what they want to build. Being in a world where there’s so much tariff uncertainty, they don’t know what it’s going to cost to build what they want to build. It’s particularly challenging for this industry to be able to navigate that, and it impacts renewables more than it impacts, say, other sectors like gas or coal, because we rely upon imports of equipment to such a bigger degree, especially for battery storage, where we’re essentially entirely dependent at this point on imports from China.

With battery storage, there has been an attempt to increase manufacturing capacity in the US. How would you characterize where that stands?

Very early days. A lot of battery manufacturing that’s going on within the US is meant to supply batteries to EV vehicles, not stationary utility-scale storage projects. And so the amount of manufacturing capacity in comparison to what the demand is for that equipment results in us importing well more than 90 percent of what we need.

I also think the tariff on it is just as important as the uncertainty about not knowing where the end game is and what the tariffs are going to be. So, if you’re on the manufacturing side of the renewables business, you’re making investment decisions that have very long lives when you’re building a manufacturing facility. Having that uncertainty around the investment climate and what the level of tariffs is going to be over the long-term just makes it more challenging to make all of those decisions.

During the early part of this year, as this tariff war was starting, I had, like, biweekly calls from this manufacturer in Korea, just exasperated, saying, “Doesn’t the US government know that we’re making long lead time decisions, and we need to have some sort of clarity around what the policy environment is going to be, not just for the next four years, but for the next 10 years?” The US is making it very challenging right now to make these types of investment decisions.

Is there any US energy industry that benefits from trade tensions?

I don’t think anybody benefits, per se, from the trade tensions. Everybody, no matter what part of the energy sector you’re in, is having to navigate the uncertainty around what the tariff levels are going to be. That said, the overall policy environment has changed to one that is more favorable for natural gas. The fact that we are an exporter of natural gas and have all of the domestic resources that we need makes it less impacted by tariffs than what other sectors are, like renewables. But even for E&P [exploration and production of oil and gas], they utilize steel in that process. There are tariffs on steel. Steel prices have gone up. It has a negative impact on all energy sectors.

One part of this report that jumped out to me is you said that the US may be stuck with older technologies, especially when it comes to solar, while the rest of the world advances at a quicker pace. What’s the long-term effect of that?

Before I answer that question directly, let me just give you some context.

We estimate that the cost of building a utility-scale solar project is about $1.15 a watt in the US. The comparable number in China is about 42 cents a watt. It’s not surprising that the cost of building a solar facility in China is a lot less than the cost of building a solar facility in the US.

What is very surprising when we put this data together is how much less expensive it is to build a solar project in Europe than it is in the US. It’s about 70 cents a watt to build a solar facility in Europe compared to the US. So the US is almost 50 percent more expensive to build a solar facility than the cost of building it in Europe. And the biggest reason that it’s more expensive here is because of all the tariffs that we have on solar. It’s not the only reason, but it’s the biggest reason. So we’ve already kind of penalized solar with the tariffs that we have in place.

And then, on the technology evolution issue, it’s the Chinese manufacturers that have the most sophisticated capability in solar manufacturing, and who are putting a lot more R&D into it than any US company is doing. And so, we essentially have policies in place that prohibit and make it uneconomic for US companies to be able to purchase Chinese technology, then that is what leaves us in a position where we’re not using the most advanced technology that’s available to the rest of the world. The long-term implication of that is it deprives the US of a low-cost source of energy that’s available everywhere else, and creates kind of an unlevel playing field in our efforts to have to power our industries with the lowest-cost energy solutions that are available.

These tariff policies seem to change almost daily. Is there an expectation that eventually things will settle down?

I think that’s the central challenge for the industry, that they don’t know where the ultimate outcome is going to fall. Nobody can really fully answer that question, and what makes it particularly challenging is that there’ve been so many different rationales given as to why we’re pursuing one tariff or another that it makes it hard to divine what the ultimate endgame is going to be. Is it about reducing a trade balance? Is it about supporting domestic manufacturing? Are there other policy goals that are trying to be achieved as a result of the tariffs? Not knowing that is what makes it very difficult for people to operate day to day.","https://media.wired.com/photos/683994a4f001b3464f287c18/191:100/w_1280,c_limit/GettyImages-2197485258.jpg",N,,2025-05-31 10:00:55.137706

Lula has often stood by her in that fight, but does he still have the stomach and the inclination to continue?","Political bullying is rarely as brutal as it was in Brazil this week when the environment minister Marina Silva was ambushed in a senate meeting. Her thuggish tormentors – all white male politicians on the infrastructure committee – took turns to publicly belittle the 67-year-old black woman, who has done more than anyone to protect the natural wealth of the country – the Amazon rainforest, Pantanal wetlands, Cerrado savannah and other biomes – from rapacious abuse.

One by one, they lined up to attack her for these globally important efforts. Decorum gave way to name-calling and sneering: “Know your place,” roared the committee head, Marcos Rogério, a Bolsonarist who cut Silva’s microphone as she tried to respond. The leader of the centre-rightPSDB, Plínio Valério, told her she did not deserve respect as a minister. The Amazonas senator Omar Aziz – from the Centrão party and a supporter of president Lula – talked over her repeatedly.

Their motives appeared to be partly ideological, partly misogynistic and largely self-interested. All of them were trying to force through economic projects – roads, oilfields, dams or plantations – that are under scrutiny by Silva’s environment ministry. Never mind that this is her job, they seemed to say, how dare she not allow them to have their way?

But she did dare. Despite her frail physique, Silva is a fighter. Born in the Amazon rainforest, she helped to found the Workers’ party alongside Lula during the era of military dictatorship. She campaigned against deforestation alongside Chico Mendes, who was assassinated in 1988. In her first stint as environment minister, between 2003 and 2008, she established a monitoring-and-penalty system that she said reduced forest clearance by 80%. Later, she ran as president for the Green party, securing nearly 20m votes – more than any other Green candidate in world history. Twelve years ago, she founded her own party – the Sustainability Network.

Silva refused to tolerate being abused and silenced, and walked out of the senate meeting. Outside, when she finally had a chance to speak, she turned on her tormentors: “My place is the place to defend democracy, my place is the place to defend the environment, to combat inequality, sustainable development, to protect biodiversity, and infrastructure projects that are necessary for the country,” she said defiantly. “What is unacceptable is for someone to think that because you are a woman, black, and come from a humble background, that you are going to say who I am and still say that I should stay in my place. My place is where all women should be.”

This version of what happened has been reported widely in the Brazilian media, but it tells only part of the story. What is missing – and more important – is why the pack of senators felt Silva was vulnerable. That is because over the previous few days, Lula had taken the side of the oil industry rather than the Amazon rainforest, and then – not by coincidence – the Brazilian environmental movement suffered one of the biggest legislative defeats in its history.

At the centre of everything is a long-running row over oil exploration in the Foz do Amazonas. BP and the French oil company Total used to hold most of these rights, but they baulked at the political and environmental challenge of drilling so close to the world’s biggest centre of terrestrial biodiversity. Instead, Brazil’s state-run oil company, Petrobras, stepped up. For Lula – and the senators in nearby regions – that meant potential votes, jobs and export earnings. The only thing standing in their way was the environment ministry, which has delayed a licence for years due to the risks of a possible spill in such an ecologically sensitive area.

That handbrake was lifted earlier this week, when the head of the environmental regulator, Ibama, ignored the warnings of 29 expert advisers by moving on to the next stage of the approval process for operations in the Foz do Amazonas. This capitulation followed pressure from Congress and the president.

This was followed by the biggest legislative setback for the environment in more than 40 years. To the delight of the mining, construction and farming industries, the senate has passed a long-pending bill that strips a range of environmental licensing powers from Silva’s ministry. This piece of legislation – dubbed the devastation bill by opponents – allows companies to self-license or avoid environmental licensing for road construction, dam-building and other projects. It is a shift of control from the representatives of the people to the executives of big companies.

Lula could yet wield a veto on this bill. But so far the president’s response has been tepid. His party has a weak presence in congress, so he depends on a broad and fractious coalition, many of whose members are enmeshed in agribusiness or mining. Next year’s presidential election seems to be weighing on his mind more than November’s Cop30 climate summit in Belém.

In the wake of the attacks on Silva by the senate infrastructure committee, Lula publicly came to her defence. He said she was right to walk out in the face of so much provocation. But he has not faced up to his responsibility for leaving her exposed. Nor has he faced up to the contradictions of his own promise to achieve zero deforestation by 2030 and his support for evidently incompatible projects, such as oil drilling off the coast of the Amazon, an upgraded BR319 road that would open up the forest between Manaus and Porto Velho to greater clearance activities, and a new grain railway that would increase pressure for more soya bean plantations.

At the Amazon Summit in Belém two years ago, he declined to sign up to Colombian president Gustavo Petro’s calls for a fossil-free rainforest. Soon after, at Cop28 in Dubai, his government shocked many of its supporters by announcing it would join the Opec+ oil cartel. Lula can argue that this is pragmatism as Brazil depends on petroleum sales for a growing share of its GDP. Fossil fuel realpolitik is likely to be evident at a Brics summit in Rio de Janeiro in July, where the Brazilian president will rub shoulders with China’s Xi Jinping of China, Russia’s Vladimir Putin, India’s Narendra Modi and other world leaders.

Lula has thrown Marina Silva under a cement mixer once before – in 2008, when she was forced to leave his second-term government because too many ministers saw her as a drag on economic development. He may feel reluctant to do so again before Cop30, because he knows she is vital for Brazil’s environmental credibility in the eyes of much of the world, and he does not want his country to return to the pariah status it endured during the Bolsonaro years. But the sands are shifting and Lula seems unsure of his footing.

His base – the working class and poor – are already suffering the brunt of climate impacts. The south of Brazil has been deluged by devastating floods. The northern Amazon has been stricken by record droughts and fires.

Civil society and progressive thinkers – almost all of whom usually support Lula – have been far more active than the president in opposing the devastation bill and defending the environment minister on social media, where many public figures have posted “Marina is not alone” messages of support.

But like many other centre left leaders in the world, Lula is struggling in the age of Trump, of rightwing extremism, of warmongering, of geopolitical realignment and corporate backtracking on the environment. As Silva showed, it takes courage to face those forces. Lula has often stood by her in that fight, but does he still have the stomach and the inclination to continue?",https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7e983851f45c534eec8b7c4343b5e312e78f355c/437_0_4372_3498/master/4372.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=db4cfcf71840ae9b27e57993d90cf63f,N,,2025-05-31 10:01:12.075406

Many of those clean energy incentives enacted under the Biden administration funneled jobs and billions of dollars into Republican-controlled states, including Florida.

One provision in the bill’s current language would disqualify projects from using an existing commercial solar energy tax credit, unless project construction begins within 60 days of the bill’s enactment.

Such an abrupt shift would breed an unpredictable, “horribly harmful” environment for companies and people working on commercial solar projects, according to Ben Pauluhn, founder and president of Optimus Energy Solutions. The Mount Dora-based company specializes in electric vehicle infrastructure and commercial and residential solar energy projects.

“The employment disruption on that 60-day provision will be massive, and it will not be painless, and it will be nationwide,” Pauluhn said. “It would really put a dampener on a whole lot of momentum that America is currently on with energy independence.”

An earlier version of the bill that would’ve gradually phased out the commercial tax credit over a period of six years made much more financial and logistical sense, Pauluhn said. But as it currently stands, the bill would derail his growing company, throwing it into “survival mode, essentially overnight.”

“Any business can plan for a six-year phase-out,” Pauluhn said. “It's an off-ramp. Agree or disagree with it; from a policy and a business standpoint, one can plan for that.

“If it is halted overnight, the employment disruptions … will be so disruptive that it will cause meaningful pain to people, communities and businesses that is probably not necessary,” Pauluhn said.

In Florida, more than 100,000 jobs are at stake if the proposed repeal of federal tax credits goes through, according to one third-party analysis commissioned by ConservAmerica, a conservative-leaning nonprofit. That report also estimates the average Florida household would pay about $83 more annually for energy costs.

There are more than 52,000 electric vehicles in Orange County alone, many of which were purchased using consumer credits that would be discontinued under the bill, according to Dory Larsen, Senior Electric Transportation Program Manager for the Southern Alliance for Clean Energy.

“When we look at repealing these programs, it represents broken promises to American consumers,” Larsen said. “And the result would be higher energy costs that we would all be forced to pay.”

Regardless of the barriers, solar energy is here to stay, Pauluhn said — but the question is, at what cost? He’s hoping to see lawmakers engage in “more thoughtful discussion” on the bill’s clean energy provisions, especially the 60-day construction requirement for commercial solar projects.

“Building, maintaining the infrastructure to deliver electricity is going to continue to be more expensive, irrespective of where the electricity comes from,” Pauluhn said. “So we darn well better keep the cost of electricity down. One of the best ways to do that is deploying solar [energy].”",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/0308e99/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2000x1050+0+139/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F3b%2Fb3%2F00ae5ccf4118a69af5211b81a9c7%2Flightbulb-energy-via-pexels-daniel-reche.jpg,N,,2025-05-31 12:19:14.301108
