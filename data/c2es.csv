The retention of ministerial decision-making powers satisfies a key demand from the Coalition and industry and is not opposed by the Greens.

But it has been criticised by environmentalists, who argue the model could allow developers to exert pressure on the minister.

The environment minister, Murray Watt, set out on Sunday the powers of the environment protection agency, under a bill to rewrite the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation (EPBC) Act due in parliament this week.

Watt’s hopes of passing the laws before Christmas were dealt a blow last week after the Coalition and Greens criticised separate aspects of the draft laws, denying Labor a clear path through the Senate and setting up a political fight in the final three sitting weeks of the year.

The Coalition argue the laws are anti-business, while the Greens claim the opposite, accusing Watt of drafting laws that have “big business and the mining companies’ fingerprints all over it”.

Speaking on Sky News on Sunday morning, Watt said the government was open to considering amendments but was adamant the revamp would not collapse for the second time in 12 months.

“People should be under no illusions … we will be passing these laws through the parliament,” Watt said. “The only question is how quickly we do it and who we do it with.”

One of the most contentious parts of the reforms has been the scope of the promised federal environment watchdog, with industry and environmentalists at odds over whether an independent agency – rather than the minister – should be responsible for approving projects.

Previously, the environment minister has made decisions on projects either directly or via an official acting under delegated powers.

In practice, the minister personally considers only a small number of significant applications, such as Woodside’s North-West shelf extension and the Robbins Island windfarm. Departmental officials sign off on more than 90% of decisions.

The new regime will be largely the same, except that rather than delegating decisions to a departmental bureaucrat, that responsibility will fall to officials in the new EPA.

The decisions that are taken by the minister will be based on advice from the EPA rather than department officials.

The new agency, to be officially known as the National Environment Protection Agency (NEPA), will have other functions that are independent of the minister, including policing nature laws and monitoring compliance with a project’s conditions.

“An independent NEPA will have strong compliance and enforcement oversight to better protect our precious environment and ensure those who seek to illegally destroy it pay a high price,” Watt said.

The Australian Conservation Foundation acting chief executive, Paul Sinclair, was disappointed the proposed EPA was not fully independent.

The peak green group favoured a model in which the minister set nature protection rules and then EPA assessed projects against them.

“Arm’s length decision making is better for nature and better for business,” he said.

The Greens environment spokesperson, Sarah Hanson-Young, said the EPA would become “another branch of government bureaucracy” if it didn’t have strong laws to enforce.

With a “climate trigger” that could block or restrict fossil fuel projects officially off the table, Hanson-Young signalled the Greens were prepared to negotiate with Labor on other mechanisms to address climate impacts.

Under the new laws, proponents of heavy polluting projects would be required to disclose their greenhouse gas emissions and how they intend to mitigate them as part of the application process.

But the laws would not force decision-makers to consider those potential climate impacts, meaning projects such as Woodside’s North-West Shelf extension could still be approved under the new regime.

“They’ve taken the climate trigger off the table because they’re doing the bidding of the fossil fuel companies,” Hanson-Young said.

“Now if we negotiate, the government’s going to have to come up with what they are prepared to do to protect the climate and to protect our forests.”","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e570dc85bd9efe9af6854270cd251075ce28ebd1/564_0_5641_4515/master/5641.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=1c10b16ae5399607aab9384c5d9642e8",N,,2025-10-26 02:58:02.568425

The project combines Coolsheet’s heat-exchange solar technology with Capral Aluminium’s Australian-made components, creating a system designed to generate both electricity and usable heat from a single rooftop array.

Located above Sydney Harbour, the redeveloped complex will use the system to capture the sun’s light and heat simultaneously. While conventional photovoltaic panels typically convert only about 25 per cent of sunlight into electricity, Coolsheet’s panels reclaim the remaining thermal energy using a lightweight aluminium water jacket mounted behind each PV module. The captured heat can then be stored in hot-water tanks or used to pre-heat water for heat pumps. Cooling the solar cells also increases electrical efficiency and extends panel life — enabling a dual-output energy platform that maximises solar potential.

At North Sydney Olympic Pool, the installation links Coolsheet’s heat exchangers to the rear of 206 solar modules rated at 550 W each, creating around 114 kWe of electrical capacity and producing two to three times that amount in thermal energy. The output will help maintain water temperatures for over three million litres across five pools, forming part of the site’s all-electric heating network.

The system aligns with North Sydney Council’s goal of achieving carbon neutrality by 2035, and the extra power from cooled panels is expected to offset the system’s own pump energy use.

“Coolsheet is proud to partner with North Sydney Council on this landmark project,” said Tom Hoole, Founder and CTO of Coolsheet. “It’s been a complex construction program but now, as the site nears completion, it’s clear this will be a world-class facility showcasing how renewable heat can be built into public infrastructure.”

Coolsheet, founded in Sydney, is Australia’s first PVT manufacturer and among only about 50 globally. Its patented system has undergone validation testing at UNSW Sydney, supporting local manufacturing and deployment of renewable heat technologies. “The opportunity for Australian industry is significant,” said Doug Smith, Chairman of Coolsheet. “By capturing more of the sun’s energy through both electricity and heat, we can help manufacturers improve efficiency, reduce energy costs, and strengthen energy resilience all while supporting local jobs and clean technology manufacturing.”

The system’s backbone relies on precision-engineered aluminium extrusions supplied by Capral, built for durability and corrosion resistance in outdoor environments. “As an Australian manufacturer with a national extrusion and distribution footprint, Capral is focused on enabling the country’s rapidly developing renewables sector,” said Tony Dragicevich, CEO of Capral. “Our role is to bring local expertise, consistent quality and responsive supply to projects like this — supporting innovators with the engineered aluminium solutions they need to deliver clean-energy outcomes at scale.”",http://www.alcircle.com/api/media/1761399167.81509_Coolsheet_0_0.jpg,N,,2025-10-26 03:17:34.366029

Entry-level positions in the majority of occupations in clean energy pay 23 percent more than the same jobs in other sectors, the government says.

Jobs in wind, nuclear and electricity networks all advertise average salaries of over £50,000, compared to the UK average of £37,000 - and are spread across coastal and post-industrial communities.

Energy Secretary Ed Miliband said: “Communities have long been calling out for a new generation of good industrial jobs. The clean energy jobs boom can answer that call .

“Our plans will help create an economy in which there is no need to leave your hometown just to find a decent job.

Under the redesigned legislation — expected to be introduced to Parliament on Thursday — Murray Watt will announce the creation of Australia’s first National Environmental Protection Agency.

Senator Watt on Sunday said the NEPA would oversee compliance and enforcement but, unlike the failed Nature Positive reforms proposed by predecessor Tanya Plibersek, the minister of the day would still be ultimately responsible for project approvals.

“An independent (National Environmental Protection Agency) will have strong compliance and enforcement oversight to better protect our precious environment and ensure those who seek to illegally destroy it pay a high price,” Senator Watt told Sky.

“But importantly, the minister of the day would still be ultimately responsible for approval decisions, a move that is backed by all sides of politics.”

The NEPA would also have the powers to issue stop-work orders, to act proactively in the case of unacceptable environmental risks.

“The thing about stop work orders — we currently don’t have the power under our national environmental law if we know that someone is about to go and bulldoze all sorts of trees with koalas or other threatened species,” Senator Watt explained.

“We don’t have the power to get in there before that destruction occurs.

“All we can do at the moment is actually fine someone after the event.

“Now, I think most Australians would agree that it’s probably a good idea that if someone is about to do the wrong thing by the environment, we should have the power to stop that from happening first, rather than coming in after the event.”

Senator Watt said the redesign of the outdated 1999 Act aimed to deliver “a balanced package” for faster approvals, stronger environmental protection, and greater accountability and transparency.

He also criticised the Coalition’s lack of support leading up to the coming sitting week after Opposition Leader Sussan Ley warned his amendments would be a “handbrake” on investment.

In her commentary, Ms Ley also raised concerns over the definition of “unacceptable impact” in the laws, and that the legislation was being rushed.

Shadow Environment spokeswoman Angie Bell accused Senator Watt of being “short on detail” and said without further transparency the laws didn’t appear balanced.

She told Sky on Sunday there had already been “grave concerns” from across the spectrum — from environmental groups to resource sector representatives.

“The Minister’s saying that it’s balanced. Well, the way we’re looking at it is — it’s not balanced at the moment. It’s short on detail,” she said.

Her Coalition colleague Susan MacDonald also expressed concern the proposed changes would undermine national prosperity and push Australian jobs offshore.

“Just because the minister says that these (laws) are going to be better for the environment does not make that true,” the Shadow Resources spokeswoman said.

“What we’re trying to caution the Government on is not to rush through legislation.”

Senator Watt labelled the criticism as beyond belief from a party that claims to stand up for the interests of Australian business.

“What we’re trying to do through these reforms is deliver a balanced package that actually delivers real improvements for our natural environment and real improvements for business,” he said.

“They say they’re a party of business. We know the part that business wants these reforms to be put in place to streamline approvals.

When I say fossil fuels, it’s not just coal and oil but also fossil gas, which a number of governments – including ours – have allowed themselves to be convinced is needed for this global transition.
Indeed the promised deployment of CCS is being used as a justification for allowing new fossil gas development.","Sydney’s record October heat; high winds battering both Melbourne and New Zealand, causing death and destruction; the algal bloom caused by South Australia’s marine heatwave wreaking havoc on our marine environment; coral in both the Great Barrier and Ningaloo reefs suffering horrific bleaching.

There’s barely an Australian who hasn’t been affected by one extreme weather event or another, some badly. Some have lost their lives, their homes or both.

The seas around our country are suffering a marine heatwave. Just a few degrees above normal is causing these climate change-fuelled warmer oceans to put our weather on steroids, intensifying heat, rainfall and wind.

And that intense rainfall will lead to increased plant growth, so another record bushfire season is inevitable at some point.

But this is really only the beginning: global warming has reached an average of nearly 1.5C, and we’re set to see warming of at least 2.7C by the end of the century if we don’t take more action.

How this warming will affect Australia was set out very clearly in the National Climate Risk Assessment report released last month: everything and everyone will be affected. Many sectors assessed are already experiencing moderate to high risk and if global warming is allowed to reach 2C most sectors will face very high to severe risk. Health and social support and natural systems will be severely affected – coral reefs will be all but extinct at 2C of warming.

Australians have a clear and obvious interest in the world taking action to peak global warming as close as possible to the Paris agreement’s 1.5C limit.

Never has there been a stronger need for rapid global decarbonisation; never has there been a stronger need to rid ourselves of fossil fuels and undertake a global transition to clean, renewable energy.

It’s there, and it’s available. Renewables have now taken over coal in global electricity generation. China’s emissions (and therefore the globe’s) may have peaked this year. And the cost of renewables, battery storage and EVs, thanks to a massive uptake in China, is plummeting. It’s never been cheaper.

And all the economics point to the cost of a global energy transition costing exponentially less than the ongoing – and building – costs of dealing with devastating climate change impacts.

So what’s getting in the way of this energy revolution? The biggest barrier to the global energy transition is the fossil fuel industry and its relationship with governments.

When I say fossil fuels, it’s not just coal and oil but also fossil gas, which a number of governments – including ours – have allowed themselves to be convinced is needed for this global transition.

But it absolutely is not, and it’s getting in the way and risks locking the world into warming of 2.5C – or more. Gas is a fossil fuel and needs to be reduced rapidly now and effectively out of the energy system by 2050 and the power sector a decade earlier.

Yet Australia wants to continue selling more of this gas to Asian markets in the form of liquefied natural gas or LNG all the way through to 2070, having just approved Woodside’s North West Shelf project to carry out this work. And LNG is much more energy-intensive than conventional gas, because of the processing it undergoes to ready it for export.

So if Indonesia builds a new gas-fired power station that burns Australian LNG (on-sold to them by Japan), this will keep Indonesia hooked on fossil gas for the 40-year lifetime of that power plant, locking in carbon emissions – or closing it early, leaving furious investors out of pocket.

The alternative is renewable energy firmed by storage that’s cheaper and more effective and will be better for the Indonesian economy and better for the planet. But this now risks being locked out by LNG.

Across Asia, Australia and Japan are touting their fossil gas wares, trying to convince their potential customers that they can just adopt carbon capture and storage (CCS) to deal with the emissions. Indeed the promised deployment of CCS is being used as a justification for allowing new fossil gas development.

But we know – and they must know – that this technology is failing. It is costly, complex and unreliable. It doesn’t work to get emissions to real zero, where they need to be; the rate of emissions capture is usually much lower than industry claims; the cost is very high, compared with clean alternatives, and is unlikely to reduce in cost over time.

The costs of renewable energy and storage will continue to reduce substantially over time as this industry scales up. Why spend all this cash buying fossil fuels and trying to bury emissions when renewables are now so much cheaper, and the fuel is both infinite and free? Let’s not forget the fossil fuel industry needs governments to carry the liability for this storage for many centuries into the future.

Australia has the know-how and the opportunity to help lead the global energy transition to a clean energy future, we have abundant critical minerals, we could export green hydrogen, and we have an endless supply of sun and wind that could power this future.

But first we need to take our foot off the gas.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9aeeea3628bd738ffca81aa8259ca9d79fba5bcf/250_0_2500_2000/master/2500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=3763250e18db0caf696523b82fde585e",N,,2025-10-26 00:18:07.929586

CONTACTS The Threat of Climate Change for Renters, https://nationalhousingtrust.org/news/threat-climate-change-renters.","Dear EarthTalk:

Why are renters more exposed to climate risks than homeowners?

TG, via email

Climate change poses a growing threat to human civilization by rapidly altering our environment and increasing the frequency, intensity, and destructiveness of natural disasters. Our homes are at the forefront of these challenges, facing rising energy costs to regulate extreme temperatures and increased risks of property damage from storms and floods. Among the most vulnerable are the third of Americans who rent rather than own their homes. When disaster strikes, renters are often left unprotected, with limited options for relocation or recovery. Notably, the areas with the highest concentration of renters also tend to face the most severe climate-related risks. This trend is particularly evident in Florida and California, where 88 and 79 percent of rental units, respectively, are in high-risk areas. After a disaster, renters frequently endure further hardship through sudden rent increases or evictions, exacerbating their vulnerability.

Government agencies like FEMA, the Small Business Administration (SBA) and the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) offer various forms of disaster relief for homeowners, including low-interest loans, nutrition assistance, short-term Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits, and rebuilding grants. However, renters receive little to no comparable aid. Beyond lacking direct assistance, renters have minimal control over post-disaster repairs, as landlords often opt for the fastest, cheapest fixes rather than investing in long-term, sustainable renovations.

To improve the safety and security of renters, disaster relief programs must incorporate targeted support and protections. In high-risk areas, expanding hazard-resistant building initiatives can ensure new construction and renovations prioritize climate resilience. Strengthening tenant protection laws can prevent post-disaster rent spikes and evictions, offering stability to those most affected. Also, lawmakers should require landlords to make climate-resilient upgrades, like using flood-resistant materials, improving insulation and modernizing energy systems. Expanding government relief programs to include rental assistance and temporary housing solutions can also help renters recover more effectively.

There are many ways individuals can contribute to renter protection: advocating for policy reforms; pushing for legislation that prioritizes renter protections; supporting tenant organizations; participating in community preparedness efforts. Also, raising awareness about available assistance programs, insurance options and renters' legal rights empowers individuals to make informed decisions and protect themselves. By taking these steps, individuals can help foster a more equitable and resilient housing system that ensures renters are not left behind in the face of climate change.

The Ohio Environmental Protection Agency approved a five-year permit allowing AquaBounty to install two mile-long pipelines near Pioneer. One would draw groundwater from a local aquifer, while the other would discharge wastewater into the east branch of the St. Joseph River.

According to the permit, it was officially granted on Sept. 12, with an effective date of Oct. 1. The permit remains valid through Sept. 30, 2030.

Residents who have followed the project closely say they were blindsided by the news. Members of the Williams County Alliance, an environmental advocacy group, said they were told they’d be notified when any new permits were issued. However, the approval was never announced publicly on the Ohio EPA’s website, AquaBounty’s website or the village of Pioneer’s page.

In a statement to WTOL 11, the Ohio EPA acknowledged that no public notice was issued and attributed the lapse to “an internal oversight.”

The EPA's statement:

""Ohio EPA, due to an internal oversight, did not issue a public notice regarding the issuance of AquaBounty’s permit.

It is our practice to release such notices, though not required by law, and we regret that this practice was not followed. We are continuing to look into this matter.

The permit holds the protection of human health and the environment as top priorities.""

Sherry Fleming, a leader with the Williams County Alliance, criticized the lack of transparency.

“This lack of a required simple notification to the public by the Ohio EPA illustrates how disconnected the state government is to the communities that will live with the impacts from this project every day,” said Fleming. “We deserve better.”

AquaBounty halted construction of its Pioneer facility in June 2023, citing financial challenges and rising construction costs. The company has not said if or when work on the site will resume.

On top of that, $25,000 is simply being moved from the General Fund to the Sustainability Fund, so there’s no actual net budget increase for that.
Board member Olin Wilson-Thomas suggested that the group recommend raising the wheel tax, at least on “large, polluting cars,” to add money to the Sustainability Fund.
Board members also debated if a wheel tax increase should be income-based to avoid penalizing low-income residents more likely to drive older cars.
Other board members didn’t raise any objections to that.","Evanston’s Environment Board agreed at its meeting Thursday night to ask the City Council to keep $100,000 in annual wheel tax revenue in the city’s Sustainability Fund instead of moving it to the General Fund, which officials have proposed to help balance the 2026 budget.

The city created the Sustainability Fund in 2022 to set aside money specifically for staff positions, programs and projects that advance the Climate Action and Resilience Plan (CARP) and other environmentally friendly initiatives. During its Oct. 23 meeting held at Morton City Hall, the Environment Board reviewed how the city’s proposed 2026 budget would impact that fund specifically. City Council is expected to discuss the budget on Monday evening as well.

In their 2026 proposal, the city is asking all departments to cut expenses by 3% in the face of budget uncertainty.

The Environment Board objected to this idea at Thursday’s meeting, with members saying they felt the move would set a bad precedent and hurt sustainability efforts, especially since the budget proposal shuffles some programs from the General Fund to the Sustainability Fund without providing additional revenue to pay for them.

Councilmember Jonathan Nieuwsma (4th Ward), who previously sat on the board and attended the meeting as a de facto liaison, suggested that members pass a resolution to send a message to the council.

While members agreed on what they objected to, they struggled over how specific they should get in their feedback and whether to suggest revenue solutions. The board ultimately voted for members James Cahan and Gennifer Geer, who drafted potential resolutions as the meeting went on, to send what they came up with to board co-chairs Katarina Topalov and Paula Scholl. The co-chairs would then “synthesize” these drafts into something to send to council in time for Monday’s meeting.

Sustainability Fund plans

Overall, the Sustainability Fund includes a projected $262,000 in revenue, not counting $730,450 transferred from other funds, and about $1.5 million in expenses. Cara Pratt, the city’s sustainability and resilience manager, said some changes in revenues and expenses reflect one-time grants being spread out over multiple years and errors that will be corrected in later drafts. On top of that, $25,000 is simply being moved from the General Fund to the Sustainability Fund, so there’s no actual net budget increase for that.

But other changes do reflect real funding gains and losses.

For example, the proposed budget assumes that a $250,000 U.S. Department of Energy grant to help implement the Healthy Buildings Ordinance isn’t coming — simply because, given the second Trump Administration’s priorities, it’s not something Evanston can count on.

“I don’t know if or when we’ll get it,” Pratt said Thursday.

Additionally, the budget also calls for shifting money around in a way that would result in a net reduction in Sustain Evanston grants.

The Sustainability Fund is also getting a $30,450 increase in transfers from Northwestern’s Good Neighbor Fund to keep up with inflation, and it would get a $15,000 increase in funding for seasonal employees to hire interns in the Transportation and Mobility Division.

But it was the proposal to keep $100,000 in the General Fund that dominated Thursday’s discussion. Topalov said she worried that this move could become an annual occurrence, which would hurt sustainability initiatives in the long term.

“There was a reason why we decided, you [City Council] decided, that there would be an earmarked pot of money that goes toward sustainability,” she said.

Nieuwsma replied that, if the board is against the move, it should let the council know.

“That feedback would be worth something,” he said.

Board member Olin Wilson-Thomas suggested that the group recommend raising the wheel tax, at least on “large, polluting cars,” to add money to the Sustainability Fund. Scholl said that might be worth discussing at a future meeting, and suggested that the board stick to the wheel tax funding issue for now.

This led to a long discussion over the statement to send to City Council, and if it would be more powerful to keep the comments simple or to offer a funding solution as well. Board members also debated if a wheel tax increase should be income-based to avoid penalizing low-income residents more likely to drive older cars.

Nieuwsma urged simplicity.

“The simple message the council will hear is don’t defund sustainability,” he said.

Deconstruction Ordinance

Earlier in the meeting, the board revisited an ongoing discussion on the city’s progress in meeting CARP goals, especially those items that were supposed to be completed this year.

One of those time-sensitive goals was for the city to propose, but not necessarily pass, a Preservation/Deconstruction Ordinance — in other words, an ordinance that would require buildings to be taken apart rather than demolished so that materials can be saved for reuse or recycled.

Nieuwsma wondered if that kind of ordinance is something the city should realistically pursue at the moment, given that the Rebuilding Exchange recently shut down after a $4 million U.S. Environmental Protection Agency grant it was counting on ended up in limbo.

He said that working with the Rebuilding Exchange would’ve “offered some carrots for contractors,” but now, the city would be left with nothing but sticks.

Board member Gul Agha asked if the Rebuilding Exchange could come back.

“When the administration changes,” Topalov answered. “They lost $4 million in grants.”

Nieuwsma said that, with “such a local asset” out of commission, he wanted to get the board’s sense of “where we might get more bang for our buck.”

“Making sure the enforcement is there” for the Healthy Buildings Ordinance, Geer replied.

Other board members didn’t raise any objections to that.

“I’m inclined to put it on the shelf, for now,” Nieuwsma said.”[Implementing] HBO is going to take everybody’s time and energy.”",https://evanstonroundtable.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/IMG_9437-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-10-26 00:58:16.381987

I just finished the Kamala Harris memoir about the 2024 election, 107 Days. I come away from reading it even more unsettled than ever about the dystopian state of our democracy under President Donald J. Trump and his Project 2025 backers.

Private companies and US citizens are hesitant to practice free speech. Partisan politics are restricting the lives and livelihoods of federal workers — the three-week federal shutdown risks critical systems on which millions of people in the US depend. It could weaken government technology infrastructure for years to come.

MAHA’s fake science is in, researchers and scientists are out.

The Energy Department has published a report that pooh-poohed the severity of climate change. Energy Secretary Chris Wright has committed to rewriting past policy reports on climate science.

The Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy within Trump’s Department of Energy has a whole slew of words that are no longer allowed to be uttered during his reign. They include “climate change,” “green,” “decarbonization,”“energy transition,” “‘clean’ or ‘dirty’ energy,” “emissions,”“sustainability/ sustainable,” “carbon/CO2 ‘footprint’” and “tax breaks/tax credits/subsidies.”

Shoot. We here at CleanTechnica wouldn’t have much to write about if our editors implemented such word restrictions.

Meghan Pazik, senior policy advocate with Public Citizen’s Climate Program, disputes the Trump word bans. Pazik describes how they’re part of a larger agenda of the “administration’s suppression of science, weaponizing deliberate uncertainty, and reiterating once more its authoritarian agenda.” Word bans, she continues, “are conscious decisions that change public discourse and are “a direct, intentional attack on evidence-based science and independent thought which are essential tools for holding governments accountable.”

Democrats Must Speak Out Loudly about the Real Costs to US Citizens

The Supremacy Clause of the US Constitution (Article VI, clause 2) states that the Constitution, treaties, and federal law “shall be the supreme Law of the land.” Underpinning respect for the Constitution is the belief that democracy is worth defending. “But there’s a foundational requirement for it to function that we rarely talk about explicitly, perhaps because it seemed too obvious to require articulation,” deconstructs Chris Armitage, the founder of The Existentialist Republic. “We have to agree about what has actually happened in the world.”

In our post-truth era, agreement is quite hard to come by.

The Climate Action against Disinformation coalition, which comprises 90 climate and anti-disinformation organizations, argues that the digital information landscape is “dangerously polluted, obscuring the truth and delaying the urgent action we need to protect our future.” Rather than found on the fringes of public discourse, evidence suggests that dystopian narratives are becoming “even more mainstream, more violent, and more impactful through repetition.”

I call the originators of climate disinformation “climate entrepreneurs.” They’re online influencers who promote conflict around fossil fuel-driven pollution, and they do so for profit. They make a living from stirring up controversy about renewables and a net zero future. They bombard social media networks with culturally appealing narratives and incite confusion and anger in an effort to undermine common-sense climate governance.

One area that must be made transparent in the face of such subterfuge is how each current government agency closure has detrimental and domino effects on climate action. “This will not only affect research and policy directly, it will also affect what we see and don’t see, and what we say and don’t say,” Rakesh Bhandari, associate director of interdisciplinary studies at the University of California, Berkeley, reminds Politico.

Where does federal power end and state authority begin?

“The state has this power in virtue of its legitimate and cognitive authority,” Bhandari explains. The 10th Amendment to the Constitution was added by the founders in response to anti-Federalist anxieties about an overbearing central government. They added this language to emphasize that the government possessed only limited powers and everything else — including the broad “police power” to regulate health, safety, morals and general welfare — remained with the states. States are currently wallowing in the dirty waters flowing out of the federal government, though.

Some may argue that Democrats have alienated potential conservative voters by refusing to focus on centrist issues. Erica Payne, founder and president of Patriotic Millionaires, disagrees passionately.

“Democrats have absolutely, positively NOT moved too far left in terms of what people want for the economy. The complete opposite is true. People want a higher minimum wage. They want higher taxes on the wealthy and corporations. Their support for labor unions is at a 60-year high. They want something to be done about out-of-control CEO pay. Want a wildly popular agenda that cuts across party lines? Start there.”

Don’t Let ‘Em Forget about the Damage of Fossil Fuels

Trump has installed more than 100 fossil fuel insiders, renewable energy opponents, corporate lobbyists, and far-right think tank alumni across nine agencies during his second term. Dependence on fossil fuels both as feedstock and a source of energy and is at the heart of the intertwined global crises relating to plastics, climate, and toxic emissions.

Yet supporting Big Oil flies in the face of all evidence about how essential clean energy is to ensuring energy security, safeguarding communities, and protecting our planet’s health. Right-wing politicians, lobbyists, and fossil fuel influence groups behind anti-ESG bills are continuing to block companies from responding to climate risk, even as climate impacts accelerate and the costs become unavoidable for investors, pension holders, municipalities, and taxpayers.

“Democrats are pretty silent about what matters most to the GOP: the protection of fossil fuels,” UC Berkeley’s Bhandari adds. Oil, coal, and gas dump carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gasses into the atmosphere. Fossil fuels come with a damaging and costly downside: they are warming our planet faster than anything we have seen in the geological record. They also cause other forms of pollution that severely harm human health.

It’s also noteworthy that today’s fossil energy system is incredibly inefficient: almost two-thirds of all primary energy is wasted in energy production, transportation, and use — that’s before fossil fuel has done any work or produced any benefit. Over $4.6 trillion per year, almost 5% of global GDP and 40% of what the world spends on energy, is wasted due to fossil fuel inefficiency.

Celebrate Solar & Battery Storage, Over & Over

Trump 2.0 is in the midst of a war on climate change research, which parallels goals of fossil fuel companies. Yet more US homes and businesses are getting their power from renewable sources than ever before — and in greater amounts.

At a time in which electrification of transport, industry reshoring, and surging data center growth are driving up both energy use and peak demand across North America and Europe, clean energy is now the least costly form of new generation to build. Technology like battery storage is helping to make solar and wind more practical. These are facts.

“Solar and storage are the cheapest, fastest ways to bring much-needed affordable power to communities, as electricity demand and costs surge,” says Ted Kelly, director and lead counsel for clean energy at Environmental Defense Fund. Pulling the plug on projects without explanation won’t lower electricity bills for families and businesses, and restricting the supply of cheap electricity only makes the problem worse, Kelly explains. “Instead, the Trump administration is doubling down on costly fossil fuels like coal, opening up new federal lands for coal mining and handing out over $600 million in subsidies to keep polluting, aging coal plants on life support.”

With the Trump administration two-tiered approach to energy permitting, “Polluting, expensive fossil fuels get ‘concierge, white glove service,’” Kelly continues, “while cheap renewables and storage get freezes, delays, and cancellations.” The result? More asthma-causing pollution. Fewer clean energy investments that create jobs right now.

Renewable energy came to the rescue in the summer during New England heat waves. Solar panels on homes, schools, businesses, and larger arrays provided up to 22% of the region’s power. That amounted to nearly double the daily average. This reliable output stabilized the grid and saved customers tens of millions of dollars on some of the hottest days in memory. These are the types of climate facts that we need to be stating and restating, over and over again.",https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/dystopian.jpg,N,,2025-10-25 21:57:55.435241

A key lesson from the 2021 heat dome was that temporary, or pop-up, cooling centers don’t work well.","In June 2021, a deadly heat wave pushed temperatures to 109 degrees Fahrenheit (43 Celsius) in Spokane, Washington, a northern city near the Idaho border where many homes weren’t built with central air conditioning.

As the heat lingered for over a week, 19 people died in Spokane County and about 300 visited hospitals with signs of heat-related illnesses.

Scientists say it’s not a matter of if, but when, another deadly heat wave descends on the region. To help save lives, the city teamed up with my university, Gonzaga, to start preparing for a hotter future.

We were excited and relieved when the community was awarded a US$19.9 million grant from the Environmental Protection Agency to help it take concrete steps to adapt to climate change and boost the local economy in the process. The grant would help establish resilience hubs with microgrids and help residents without air conditioning install energy-efficient cooling systems. The city doesn’t have the means to make these improvements on its own, even if they would save lives and money in the long run.

Less than a year later, the Trump administration abruptly terminated the funding.

Spokane’s grant wasn’t the only one eliminated – about 350 similar grants that had been awarded to help communities across the country manage climate changes, from extreme heat and wildfire smoke to rising seas and flooding, were also terminated on the grounds that they don’t meet the White House’s priorities. Many other grants to help communities have also been terminated.

Many of the communities that lost funding are like Spokane: They can’t afford to do this kind of work on their own.

Why cities like Spokane need the help

Like many communities in the American West, Spokane was founded in the late 19th century on wealth from railroads and resource extraction, especially gold, silver and timber.

Today, it is a city of 230,000 in a metro area of a half-million people, the largest on the I-90 corridor between Minneapolis and Seattle. In many ways, Spokane could be on the cusp of a renaissance.

In January 2025, the U.S. Department of Commerce announced a $48 million grant to develop a tech hub that could put the Inland Northwest on a path to become a global leader in advanced aerospace materials. But then, in May, the Trump administration rescinded that grant as well.

The lost grants left the economy – and Spokane’s ability to adapt fast enough to keep up with climate changes – uncertain.

This is not a wealthy area. The median household income is nearly $30,000 less than the state average. More than 13 out of every 100 people in Spokane live in poverty, above the national average, and over 67% of the children are eligible for free or reduced lunch.

The city is a light blue island in a dark red sea, politically speaking, with a moderate mayor. Its congressional district has voted Republican by wide margins since 1995, the year that then-House Speaker Tom Foley lost his reelection bid.

Lessons from the 2021 heat dome

The 2021 heat wave was a catalyzing event for the community. The newly formed Gonzaga Institute for Climate, Water and the Environment brought together a coalition of government and community partners to apply for the EPA’s Environmental and Climate Justice Community Change Grant Program. The grants, funded by Congress under the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, were intended to help communities most affected by pollution and climate change build adaptive capacity and boost the safety of their residents.

A key lesson from the 2021 heat dome was that temporary, or pop-up, cooling centers don’t work well. People just weren’t showing up. Our research found that the best approach is to strengthen existing community facilities that people already turn to in moments of difficulty.

Half the $19.9 million award was for outfitting five resilience hubs in existing libraries and community centers with solar arrays and battery backup microgrids, allowing them to continue providing a safe, cool space during a heat wave if the power shuts down.

Another $8 million in grant funding was meant to provide 300 low- to moderate-income homeowners with new high-efficiency electric heat pump heating, ventilation and air conditioning systems, providing more affordable utility bills while improving their ability to cool their homes and reducing fossil fuel emissions.

Communities are left with few options

Now, this and other work is at risk in Spokane and cities and towns like it around the country that also lost funding.

According to the Trump administration, the program – designed to help hundreds of communities around the country become safer – was “no longer consistent with EPA funding priorities.”

A class action lawsuit was recently filed over the termination of the grants by a coalition that includes Earth Justice and the Southern Environmental Law Center. If the case is successful, Spokane could see its funding restored.

Meanwhile, the city and my team know we have to move fast, with whatever money and other resources we can find, to help Spokane prepare for worsening heat. We formed the Spokane Community Resilience Collaborative – a partnership between community organizations, health officials and the city – as one way to advance planning for and responding to climate hazards such as extreme heat and wildfire smoke.

As concentrations of heat-trapping gasses accumulate in the atmosphere, both the frequency and severity of heat waves increase. It is only a matter of time before another deadly heat dome arrives.

The EPA’s decision effectively halted plans to deploy 21 megawatts of solar generation and 55 megawatt-hours of battery storage across the Virgin Islands. The termination letter issued to VIEO included an immediate “Stop Work” order, forcing all related activities to cease.

Despite the setback, Energy Office Director Kyle Fleming said his agency remains committed to strengthening the territory’s energy resilience. “VIEO will yet be able to materially enhance electrical resilience in the territory,” Fleming said, pointing to other federally funded efforts such as the Community Electrical Innovations (CEI) program.

Even as large-scale funding was withdrawn, VIEO celebrated a milestone in residential renewable energy this year. The agency completed 12 home solar and battery installations through its Solar Plus Financing (SPF) Pilot Program, funded by the U.S. Department of Energy.

The SPF initiative offers 1 percent interest, zero-down loans in partnership with the Virgin Islands Economic Development Authority (VIEDA), allowing residents to finance rooftop solar systems and battery storage. On average, homeowners received about $28,000 to install 5.5 kW of solar panels with 14 kWh of storage.

Participants have already reported significant benefits. St. Thomas resident David Miles said the transition has not only lowered his WAPA bills but made outages virtually invisible. “My experience is that I am so grateful that I have these solar panels,” he said. “Because you don’t even know that the power is out. You can just feel a light flicker, and then I hear a generator start across the street and then I know the power is out.”

VIEO originally designed the SPF program as the first of several efforts to expand access to renewable energy and narrow the territory’s socioeconomic energy gap.

One of the agency’s remaining major initiatives is the Community Electrical Innovations (CEI) grant, a $10 million program administered through the Virgin Islands Housing Finance Authority (VIHFA). The program aims to strengthen the energy resilience of facilities that serve children, the elderly, and other vulnerable groups.

Following the July application deadline, 29 facilities were provisionally approved to receive solar and battery systems. The first phase will focus on Head Start centers and daycare facilities serving over 500 children territory-wide. Nine institutions on St. Thomas and St. Croix have already begun soliciting bids for design-build solar systems, with public tenders expected to open in November.

VIEO is also advancing efforts to improve territorial solar design and access. In early October, the agency selected DNV Energy as a consultant under RFP BD-25-270-2701-581, to assist with the development of community microgrids and rooftop solar financing models. The partnership will help design programs that ensure affordable access to renewable energy while positioning the Virgin Islands for future federal funding.

Additionally, the office finalized evaluations for RFP BD-25-270-2701-599, selecting Carib Sun Energy to build a microgrid system at WTJX’s Mountaintop broadcast tower on St. Thomas.

The project, funded by the Department of the Interior’s Energizing Insular Communities Grant, will feature a 70 kW solar array, 500 kWh battery system, and a microgrid controller integrated with the site’s existing diesel generator. Once completed—within roughly nine months of its official start—the system is expected to save the broadcaster $6,000 a month in electricity costs while ensuring uninterrupted transmission from one of the territory’s most critical communication points.

Despite the EPA grant withdrawal, Fleming said the Energy Office’s mission remains unchanged: to pursue affordable, resilient, and sustainable power for residents and essential community services.

“The VIEO continues to advance a diversified portfolio of solar and battery initiatives, leveraging alternative funding, strengthening public-private partnerships, and moving priority projects from planning to deployment,” Fleming stated.

With several projects underway and new federal partnerships emerging, VIEO says its focus will remain on “near-term, high-impact installations that deliver reliability, affordability, and resilience” to the Virgin Islands’ energy landscape.",https://viconsortium.nyc3.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/uploads/Maria-Perez-solar-roof.jpg,N,,2025-10-25 21:18:08.612825

That stockpiling now looks prescient—Gotion’s Michigan plant was supposed to supply the U.S. market, but it’ll never produce a single battery cell.","A Chinese battery giant’s plans to build a massive Michigan manufacturing plant have officially collapsed, with the state now demanding millions back after years of grassroots opposition, Chinese ownership controversies, and Trump administration policy shifts killed what was once touted as Northern Michigan’s largest economic project ever. Gotion Inc. abandoned its $2.4 billion electric vehicle battery materials plant near Big Rapids after Michigan officials declared the company in default and terminated all state incentives worth $175 million.

The failure marks the latest casualty in America’s troubled push for domestic battery manufacturing, coming just weeks after the September 30 expiration of federal EV tax credits that had promised to fuel the industry’s growth. For EV owners and enthusiasts watching the battery supply chain struggle to establish itself on American soil, Gotion’s collapse raises serious questions about whether Chinese technology and capital remain welcome in the U.S. market—or even necessary.

From $175 Million Promise To Complete Collapse

Michigan’s economic development agency announced Thursday it’s pursuing repayment of $23.6 million already spent on land purchases while suspending a separate $125 million grant that was never disbursed. The Michigan Economic Development Corporation sent Gotion a default notice in September after determining no construction or development activities had occurred on the 270-acre site for more than 120 consecutive days.

When Governor Gretchen Whitmer celebrated the October 2022 announcement, the project promised 2,350 factory jobs paying $62,000 annually—more than 50% above the local median income. The plant would have produced 150,000 tons of cathode materials and 100,000 tons of anode materials annually for EV batteries. But local opposition erupted almost immediately, focused on both environmental concerns and the company’s Chinese ownership structure.

The Michigan Strategic Fund’s September 17 letter to Gotion cited both the project abandonment and ongoing lawsuits as constituting “material adverse effect” violations of the grant agreement. The state gave Gotion 30 days to cure the defaults. That deadline passed October 17 with no resolution.

Local Rebellion Defeats State And Corporate Alliance

The Gotion saga became a case study in grassroots political power defeating entrenched interests. In November 2023, Green Charter Township voters recalled all five township board members who had supported the project, replacing them with officials openly opposed to the development. The new board subsequently rescinded support and, critically, voted to cut off access to water infrastructure essential for factory operations.

Marjorie Steele, founder of the Economic Development Responsibility Alliance that led the opposition, told reporters “What the MEDC tried to pull here in Big Rapids was just so egregious.” Residents organized protests, packed public meetings, and plastered the area with anti-Gotion yard signs, creating a political climate that made construction impossible.

Gotion fought back with a March 2024 breach of contract lawsuit against Green Charter Township. A federal judge granted Gotion an injunction in May 2024 requiring the township to honor the original agreement, but the township appealed. The legal battles stalled the project completely, with Gotion pausing environmental studies and state permitting applications.

In its October response to the state’s default notice, Gotion’s attorney Mark Heusel called the accusations “utterly false” and blamed “racist and ethnically charged stereotypes” for the township’s breach. He argued that ongoing legal expenses, property taxes, and site maintenance constituted “eligible activities” under the grant agreement, and requested a six-month suspension to negotiate an “open and candid discussion about the viability of the project.”

Political Opposition Centered On Chinese Communist Party Ties

The project became a flashpoint for growing U.S.-China tensions and skepticism about Chinese investment in critical industries. Congressman John Moolenaar, a Michigan Republican who chairs the House Select Committee on China, emerged as the project’s most prominent opponent. Moolenaar introduced legislation blocking companies like Gotion from receiving EV tax credits under the Inflation Reduction Act—a bill that President Trump signed into law earlier this year as part of the “Big Beautiful Bill”.

Critics pointed to Gotion’s corporate structure and Chinese government connections. While Germany’s Volkswagen owns approximately 30% of Gotion High-Tech’s parent company, U.S. lawmakers maintain that China retains “effective control” through multiple individual shareholders. The company’s ties to Chinese Communist Party activities, including employee visits to party memorials and executives attending political study sessions, fueled suspicions among opponents.

Moolenaar praised Thursday’s announcement, stating the people of Green Charter Township “can finally move on from Gotion’s lies and broken promises.” For supporters of domestic battery production, the congressman’s rhetoric highlighted the impossible political environment Chinese companies now face in the United States.

Illinois Plant Proceeds While Michigan Dreams Die

The stark contrast between Gotion’s Michigan failure and its Illinois success reveals how location and local politics determine project viability. Gotion’s $2 billion Manteno, Illinois plant began production in late 2024 and has hired approximately 150 employees toward a target of 2,600 workers. The facility converted a former Kmart distribution center into a battery assembly plant producing both EV battery packs and energy storage systems.

Benjamin Howes, Gotion’s head of corporate and public affairs, said the company “remains firmly committed to its mission of driving America’s clean energy future” including at the Illinois facility. The Illinois project received $536 million in state incentives, though it too faced local opposition, including anti-Gotion candidates winning April 2025 municipal elections in Manteno.

The key difference: Illinois officials maintained support through the political turbulence, and manufacturing started before opposition could build sufficient momentum. Michigan’s project never broke ground, allowing resistance to calcify and spread.

Part Of Broader Chinese Battery Retreat From America

Gotion’s Michigan collapse fits a troubling pattern for U.S. battery manufacturing ambitions. EVXL has documented multiple Chinese-backed battery projects failing or stalling in recent months. In June, another Chinese-owned manufacturer AESC halted work on a $2 billion Kentucky plant and paused construction on a separate $1.6 billion South Carolina facility originally designed to supply BMW.

The timing couldn’t be worse for the U.S. EV industry. Federal EV tax credits worth up to $7,500 expired September 30, 2025, eliminated under Trump’s tax reform legislation. The loss of both consumer incentives and manufacturing tax credits has triggered exactly the industry contraction many analysts predicted.

Ford’s Michigan battery plant using CATL technology survived only after months of political battles over Chinese licensing deals. Rivian recently laid off 600 workers—its third workforce reduction in four months—directly citing the expired tax credits and weakening EV demand.

For automakers like Ford and GM racing to build domestic battery capacity, the collapse of Chinese investments leaves a critical gap. Chinese companies including CATL, BYD, and Gotion possess the world’s most advanced battery manufacturing technology and lowest production costs. Without Chinese capital and expertise, American battery production faces both technical challenges and cost disadvantages that could take years to overcome.

EVXL’s Take

We’ve been tracking the slow-motion collapse of Chinese battery investments in America for months, and Gotion’s Michigan failure was entirely predictable. When we covered Ford’s battles over its CATL-licensed Michigan plant back in May, the political writing was already on the wall: Chinese battery technology might be essential to the EV revolution, but Chinese ownership has become politically radioactive.

Here’s what nobody wants to say out loud: America needs Chinese battery technology and manufacturing expertise to build a competitive EV industry, but American politics now make Chinese investment essentially impossible. That’s not a bug, it’s a feature—at least according to lawmakers like Moolenaar who view any Chinese involvement as a national security threat.

The Gotion collapse reveals a deeper problem than just one failed project. Michigan taxpayers are out $23.6 million. Big Rapids lost 2,350 promised jobs that won’t materialize. And the U.S. battery supply chain just lost a major planned supplier at exactly the moment when Trump’s elimination of EV tax credits has automakers scrambling to cut costs and scale back EV production.

This is the same pattern we documented with AESC’s failed Kentucky and South Carolina plants back in June, and with another South Carolina battery plant that halted construction amid policy uncertainty. Foreign battery manufacturers arrive promising jobs and investment, politicians lavish them with subsidies, local opposition erupts over Chinese ownership, federal policy shifts, and projects die. Rinse, repeat. Michigan just added another corpse to the pile.

The timing makes this worse. Trump’s “Big Beautiful Bill” eliminated the $7,500 EV tax credit effective September 30—just weeks before Michigan pulled the plug on Gotion. That’s not a coincidence. When we covered Rivian’s 600 layoffs earlier this week, we noted how the expired tax credits are forcing EV makers into crisis mode. Now we’re seeing the same policy shift kill battery supply before it even gets built.

Interestingly, back in May we reported on Rivian’s clever move to stockpile Gotion batteries before tariffs hit. That stockpiling now looks prescient—Gotion’s Michigan plant was supposed to supply the U.S. market, but it’ll never produce a single battery cell. Rivian saw this coming.

The Illinois plant’s survival offers a hint: projects that start production before opposition organizes can weather the political storm. But that’s cold comfort for the dozens of announced battery projects that haven’t broken ground yet. If Chinese companies are essentially banned and domestic companies lack the technology and cost structure to compete, who exactly is going to build America’s battery industry?

In this way, geothermal energy is helping to shape a future that is both prosperous and culturally grounded.","Kia ora koutou, and warm greetings from New Zealand.

It’s an honour to be here in Reno, Nevada, speaking as New Zealand’s Minister for Resources and Minister for Regional Development – two closely intersecting portfolios in New Zealand.

I want to thank the organisers of the 2025 Indigenous Geothermal Symposium for the invitation to deliver this keynote address. I would also like to acknowledge the people of Reno-Sparks Indian Colony for undertaking the opening ceremony.

This is a special gathering. Unlike many audiences where geothermal energy must be explained from first principles, here I’m speaking to experts – engineers, researchers, technology providers, and advocates. That allows me to take a broader view: to reflect on geothermal’s past, its cultural significance, and its future potential.

New Zealand is proud to be the world’s fifth-largest producer of geothermal electricity. Our location on the boundary of the Indo-Australian and Pacific tectonic plates gives us access to a world-class geothermal resource.

But our connection to geothermal energy goes far deeper than geology. For Māori, the indigenous people of New Zealand, waiwhatu – geothermal water—is a taonga, a treasure. It is a place where the physical and spiritual worlds meet. Our tīpuna, or ancestors, used geothermal waters for cooking, healing, and warmth. These practices were not just practical – they were deeply spiritual, rooted in a worldview that sees the land, water, and energy as living entities.

The Pink and White Terraces, once a major attraction in the central North Island before the 1886 volcanic eruption of Mount Tarawera destroyed them, drew visitors from around the world to bathe in their restorative waters. These terraces were more than a tourist destination – they were a symbol of the natural harmony between geothermal energy and human wellbeing.

Rotorua’s spa culture, established in the 1870s, played a vital role in healing injured soldiers returning from war. The geothermal waters were seen as therapeutic, and the region became a centre for rehabilitation and recovery.

This legacy of geothermal use is woven into our national identity. It’s a story of innovation, resilience, and respect for the land.

Globally, geothermal electricity generation began over a century ago in Larderello, Italy. New Zealand engineers visited the site in 1944 and again in 1948, witnessing its rebirth after wartime destruction. Inspired, we began exploratory drilling at Wairākei in 1949, leading to the world’s second geothermal power station – and the first to harness wet steam.

That pioneering spirit continues today. We are a small country but in geothermal science, we have consistently led the way.

Today, geothermal energy is a cornerstone of the Māori economy, and Māori have a long-term vision to enhance their role in New Zealand’s energy sector. Māori have a rich cultural heritage and a deep connection to their land and natural resources. Their identity is rooted in a unique worldview that emphasises the importance of kaitiakitanga, guardianship, over the environment, demonstrated in their commitment to sustainability and community wellbeing.

Many Māori iwi (tribes) own land with significant geothermal potential, particularly in regions like the central North Island. As a result, they’ve become key players in geothermal energy projects, both as resource owners and partners in large-scale ventures.

Investment in geothermal energy supports iwi, hapū, and ahu whenua (land management) trusts, enabling innovation and investment in areas like geothermal aquaculture, horticulture, and tourism.

These ventures are not just economically significant – they are culturally affirming. They allow Māori communities to exercise rangatiratanga, or self-determination, over their resources. They create opportunities for intergenerational wealth, education, and environmental stewardship.

In this way, geothermal energy is helping to shape a future that is both prosperous and culturally grounded.

I’ve been following the statements of US Energy Secretary Chris Wright with great interest. His emphasis on ‘affordable, reliable, and secure energy’ as the foundation of national prosperity resonates deeply.

Globally, energy demand is projected to rise faster than we experienced during the Industrial Revolution in the 1800s. According to the International Energy Agency, electricity use has grown at twice the pace of overall energy demand over the last decade and is projected to rise even faster.

As AI and other technologies drive unprecedented electricity demand, the link between energy and economic strength becomes even more critical.

Secretary Wright’s concept of ‘energy dominance’ highlights the strategic importance of energy policy. I believe we are witnessing a global reset in how geothermal is positioned – especially in countries like the United States, Japan, and New Zealand.

While geothermal accounts for around 20 per cent of New Zealand’s electricity, it contributes less than 1 per cent in the US, despite the US being the largest producer by volume.

Just as the US is advancing its energy transition, New Zealand is developing a national geothermal strategy that aims to unlock the full potential of our geothermal resources to drive energy resilience and support regional and Māori economic development.

The draft strategy, released for public consultation in July, sets the goal of doubling geothermal energy use by 2040, positioning New Zealand as a global leader in sustainable geothermal innovation and supporting our transition to a low-emissions economy.

Let me now turn to supercritical geothermal – sometimes referred to as superdeep or superhot geothermal. In New Zealand, we are investing in proving its viability.

Our Central North Island, home to the Taupō Volcanic Zone, offers extraordinary advantages. Scientific research confirms that supercritical fluids lie just 5–6km, or around three miles, beneath the surface—shallower than in most other regions globally.

Supercritical geothermal has the potential to revolutionise energy generation. These fluids carry vastly more energy than conventional geothermal sources. If harnessed effectively, they could provide baseload renewable energy at a scale comparable to fossil fuels.

We know the risks. We expect challenges. But just as our engineers pioneered wet steam technology in the 1950s, we are backing ourselves to innovate again.

We’ve established a robust governance structure for this programme. Our Kiwi-based team includes top engineers, scientists, and strategic advisors.

Representatives from these groups are here in Reno and eager to connect with you.

We’ve also convened an International Review Panel.

Today I am delighted to announce that Professor Roland Horne of Stanford University has agreed to chair the panel.

As you will know, Professor Horne is one of the world’s foremost geothermal experts and is attending the Geothermal Rising Conference here in Reno. We are delighted he has agreed to lend his expertise and leadership to our project.

I’d also like to welcome the three other highly regarded members of the International Review Panel – Dr Omar Friðleifsson and Mr Kristinn Ingason both from the Iceland Deep Drilling Project. We also warmly welcome to the panel United States geochemist Dr Darrell Gallup of Thermochem Inc.

We are very pleased to have such outstanding engineering and scientific experts join us.

On that note, I would like to say we are inviting other international collaboration – particularly from US companies and researchers. We believe the Taupō Volcanic Zone can serve as a global laboratory for supercritical geothermal.

But this is not just about New Zealand. The information we gather will have global implications. They will inform policy, guide investment, and shape the future of clean energy. Globally, we’re in an energy crisis. We need more clean, renewable energy to support the electrification of transport, industry, and data infrastructure.

Supercritical geothermal offers untapped potential that would be a great step forward for clean, green, sustainable energy. New Zealand is ready to lead – offering decades of geothermal expertise, political stability, a robust regulatory framework, and strong partnerships which our indigenous Māori landowners and communities, for whom geothermal resources are deeply embedded in whakapapa (histories), wairuatanga (identity and spirituality), and tikanga (customs).

We are already seeing interest from Japan, Iceland, and other geothermal-rich nations. The opportunity to share technology, capital, and expertise is immense.

Let me be clear, we are not just drilling wells. We are building a global partnership for energy transformation.

The future of geothermal is bright. With advancing science and deeper collaboration, the opportunities before us are limitless.

We stand at a crossroads. One path leads to incremental change. The other leads to bold innovation, cultural empowerment, and global leadership.

New Zealand has chosen the latter. We invite you to walk it with us.

Aliso Canyon is one of the largest natural gas storage facilities in the U.S.
Researchers now have a better understanding of what's in the gas that blew from Aliso Canyon and that continues to be stored in natural gas facilities around the country.","On an evening 10 years ago, Porter Ranch resident Matt Pakucko stepped out of his music studio and was walloped by the smell of gas—like sticking your head in an oven, he recalled.

Pakucko called the fire department. It turned out crews had already been up to the Aliso Canyon gas storage facility in the Santa Susana Mountains behind the neighborhood, responding to a report of a leak. Many of his neighbors were beginning to feel ill, reporting issues such as heart palpitations, vomiting, burning eyes and bloody noses.

""I swear I thought I was standing behind a 747 with its engines blowing—it was not just gas, it was an oil smell, it was a chemical smell that permeated,"" recalled Pakucko, who went on to co-found the advocacy group Save Porter Ranch. ""I couldn't stay out there for 30 seconds. It tasted like f— gasoline.""

Soon it was clear that this wasn't just a leak—it was a blowout. Over the course of 112 days, the Aliso Canyon facility would spew an estimated 120,000 tons of methane and toxic chemicals into the atmosphere. It was the worst natural-gas well blowout in U.S. history, and an environmental disaster whose effects will be unpacked for generations.

The event was widely seen as a wake-up call to the dangers of methane and underground natural gas storage. Methane, a planet-warming greenhouse gas, is about 80 times more potent than carbon dioxide and is responsible for about a quarter of all the human-caused climate change we are experiencing.

A study published by UCLA researchers in September found that women in their final trimester of pregnancy who were living within 6.2 miles downwind of the blowout in 2015 had a nearly 50% higher-than-expected chance of having a low birth-weight baby.

The blowout ushered in a wave of new regulations to strengthen the governance of natural gas storage facilities in California and the United States, as well as new tools and technology to monitor methane emissions.

But 10 years later, some Porter Ranch residents say the wounds still feel fresh, and too many promises have been broken. After the disaster, then-Gov. Jerry Brown called for the permanent closure of Aliso Canyon by 2027—a goal his successor, Gavin Newsom, called a top priority and vowed to meet even sooner.

Instead, Aliso Canyon remains open, with regulators voting in December to continue using the facility for years— probably into the 2030s—citing the need for natural gas to help maintain affordable energy rates and grid reliability in California.

The facility is a key asset for Southern California Gas. In an emailed statement, the company said the state would struggle to meet electricity demand without Aliso Canyon's storage. The site fuels 17 power plants and helps keep the lights on during the hours that can't yet be met by solar, wind and other renewable resources, the company said. Natural gas still represents about 40% of the state's electricity supply.

""There's a lot of work to do to get off natural gas and oil in California,"" said Adam Peltz, senior attorney with the nonprofit Environmental Defense Fund. ""That work is underway, but it's not complete. If you've built an economy on fossil fuels, it takes awhile to get off of it.""

Aliso Canyon was originally drilled as an oil field in the late 1930s before SoCalGas converted it to natural gas storage in the early 1970s. Utilities often use played out crude oil fields as places to pump gas downward under pressure and hold it until it is needed.

Aliso Canyon is one of the largest natural gas storage facilities in the U.S.

In the lead-up to the blowout, SoCalGas was filling the site in preparation for the winter heating season. Crews were using tremendous force to pump gas down a well that was more than 60 years old. But a metal casing on well SS-25 had corroded, and gas began blowing out at very high volumes.

Methane is not visible to the naked eye, but aerial images captured with infrared cameras and released by the Environmental Defense Fund showed a geyser-like eruption of the flammable, climate-changing gas—making it clear to the whole world the magnitude of the disaster.

It took nearly four months for crews to stop the leak. By that time, damage was done. More than 8,000 households were temporarily displaced, businesses were shut down, and two schools were relocated for several months.

Researchers are still working to unpack the health outcomes of the event. SoCalGas, meanwhile, has paid about $2 billion in settlements and agreed to operate the facility at a lower maximum pressure.

Officials with the gas company said they have shored up the facility, including replacing the inner steel tubing on all operating wells and conducting continuous ambient methane monitoring. All wells at the site are subject to real-time pressure readings and visual inspections four times a day, among other protocols, SoCalGas said.

""Over the past 10 years, SoCalGas has conducted comprehensive safety reviews and implemented multiple safety layers that protect one of California's most important assets for energy reliability and affordability,"" the company said.

While the maximum allowable operating pressure at the site remains reduced—about 3,183 pounds per square inch compared with 3,600 pounds per square inch in 2015—state officials recently voted to let SoCalGas increase storage at the facility to 68.6 billion cubic feet of natural gas from 41 billion cubic feet, outraging many in the community.

But experts say there are silver linings to the disaster. California overhauled its underground natural gas storage regulations to make them the strongest in the nation and among the strongest in the world, according to Peltz, of the Environmental Defense Fund. The changes include more thoughtful rules for well construction, better monitoring and risk management, and improved planning and emergency response.

Congress reacted to the disaster by requiring its regulatory agency, the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration, to issue safety standards for natural gas storage nationwide. In 2016, it adopted best practices recommended by the American Petroleum Institute, which were strengthened at the beginning of this month.

Many states with natural gas storage previously had no regulations at all, Peltz said.

""On a national basis, the systems will be safer as a result of that change,"" he said.

There have been technological advancements too. The infrared aerial recording of the leak captured in 2015 was a relatively new technique at the time, but has now become commonplace. The California Air Resources Board conducted its first large-scale statewide aerial methane survey in 2016, identifying many of the largest methane sources in the state.

There have also been considerable advancements in the ability to observe methane super-emitters through satellites and remote sensors, according to Seth Shonkoff, executive director at the science research institute PSE Healthy Energy and an associate researcher at the UC Berkeley School of Public Health.

""The rub is that we know more than we ever have, and we're perhaps controlling more than we would have if we didn't have the technology to see them, but we're still seeing more and more of these large-scale emission events all across the United States and all across the world,"" he said.

Methane concentrations in the atmosphere are still rising. It is streaming, often constantly, from facilities associated with the oil and gas industry, landfills and dairy farms, among other sources.

Methane isn't the only concern either. Researchers now have a better understanding of what's in the gas that blew from Aliso Canyon and that continues to be stored in natural gas facilities around the country. Although it is primarily composed of methane, roughly 99% of samples analyzed by Shonkoff and his team have contained hazardous air pollutants such as benzene, hexane and toluene, largely as a result of commingling with depleted oil and other subsurface materials.

Moving forward, he said, it will be critically important for gas companies to disclose to regulators and risk managers what their gas is composed of, so that if it leaks, responders can quickly determine the appropriate response.

""If we had had that with Aliso Canyon, we could have, within a matter of hours, understood whether people should get out of the way or stay inside, and we wouldn't have had as many people suffering from health symptoms,"" Shonkoff said.

In 2024, the Biden administration passed the first comprehensive rules to limit methane pollution by fining oil and gas developers for excessive emissions. But this year, the Trump administration revoked the rule, which it described as a tax.

At the same time, many natural gas storage facilities across the country are old and require retrofitting to meet current regulations, but such upgrades can be slow and expensive—often leaving ratepayers on the hook.

Residents near Aliso Canyon have also long feared an earthquake or wildfire in the area. The gas field sits along the Santa Susana fault and is in a high fire hazard severity zone. SoCalGas says it has numerous safety plans and procedures in place.

Perhaps the greatest tension remains between those who wish to see Aliso Canyon shuttered and the officials who say the facility is critically important to California's energy supply, which is increasingly trying to serve power-hungry artificial intelligence data centers.

California has committed to reaching 100% carbon neutrality by 2045. But SoCalGas says it still needs Aliso Canyon.

""SoCalGas is aligned with the state of California in pursuing the technologies and infrastructure that supports California's climate plan, including clean renewable hydrogen and renewable natural gas, that could, over time with other renewable energy projects, deliver the reliability and affordability Aliso Canyon supports today,"" the utility said in a statement.

However, any decision to reduce or eliminate operations at Aliso Canyon must be based on genuine reduced demand that is permanent, the company said.

Pakucko, of Save Porter Ranch, noted that the facility was offline for two years after the blowout without an interruption in service.

""Two years!"" he said. ""And guess what? We managed without the facility.""

For others in the area, it feels like the latest in a string of broken promises.

Among SoCalGas's settlement agreements was a $120 million consent decree with the state of California requiring the utility to fund methane mitigation projects, air monitoring and other initiatives to address alleged harms caused by the blowout. About $25 million of that went toward a long-term health study on the effects of natural gas exposure, which is being conducted by researchers at UCLA. The results are eagerly awaited.

About $26 million went to a program for dairy digesters in the Central Valley, which capture methane from cow manure before it enters the atmosphere. Many had hoped those funds would be spent closer to home, including former L.A. Mayor Eric Garcetti, who at one point envisioned the mitigation money being used to transform Porter Ranch into a net-zero community.

""That would have been so great,"" said Patty Gleuck, a Porter Ranch resident who served on the community advisory group for the health study. Instead, ""that money went to this dairy digester program that does not benefit this area.""

Dana Investment Narrative Recap

Shareholders in Dana must believe in the company’s ability to convert operational efficiency and electric vehicle content growth into sustained profitability, despite its increased concentration in the North American light vehicle market. The recent decision to close the Detroit and Auburn Hills factories signals near-term turbulence for Dana’s electrification narrative, but the closures do not appear to materially change the most important short-term catalyst: executing on existing backlogs and maintaining cost discipline. The biggest risk remains revenue sensitivity to order reductions among Dana’s largest OEM customers, as recently highlighted by these plant closures.

With these operational headwinds in mind, Dana’s continued declaration of a regular US$0.10 per share quarterly dividend stands out. This consistency could signal management’s commitment to capital returns even as challenges in both the EV segment and OEM demand affect visibility into future earnings streams.

By contrast, investors should be especially aware that the concentration of sales among a smaller group of automaker customers leaves Dana exposed if...

Dana's outlook forecasts $8.1 billion in revenue and $249.2 million in earnings by 2028. This is based on analysts' assumptions of a 6.4% annual revenue decline and an earnings increase of $221.2 million from current earnings of $28.0 million.

, a 24% upside to its current price.

Exploring Other Perspectives

Simply Wall St Community members have published two fair value estimates on Dana, ranging from US$15.03 to US$24.57 per share. This variety of views comes as Dana faces elevated risks linked to heavy reliance on a handful of OEM relationships, highlighting how performance assumptions can differ widely among market participants.

- why the stock might be worth as much as 24% more than the current price!

The oil and gas corporation based in Texas filed its complaint Friday in the U.S. Eastern District Court for California. It asks the court to prevent the laws from going into effect next year.

In its complaint, ExxonMobil says it has for years publicly disclosed its greenhouse gas emissions and climate-related business risks, but it fundamentally disagrees with the state’s new reporting requirements.

The company would have to use “frameworks that place disproportionate blame on large companies like ExxonMobil” for the purpose of shaming such companies, the complaint states.

Under Senate Bill 253, large businesses will have to disclose a wide range of planet-warming emissions, including both direct and indirect emissions such as the costs of employee business travel and product transport.

ExxonMobil takes issue with the methodology required by the state, which would focus on a company’s emissions worldwide and therefore fault businesses just for being large as opposed to being efficient, the complaint states.

The second law, Senate Bill 261, requires companies making more than $500 million annually to disclose the financial risks that climate change poses to their businesses and how they plan to address them.

The company said in its complaint that the law would require it to speculate “about unknowable future developments” and post such speculations on its website.

A spokesperson for the office of California Gov. Gavin Newsom said in an email that it was “truly shocking that one of the biggest polluters on the planet would be opposed to transparency.”",https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/10/68fd45f85749f8.83462006.jpeg?w=1280,N,,2025-10-25 19:03:02.351185

Headquartered in Riyadh, Nextracker Arabia will combine Abunayyan’s 75 years of leadership in water and energy infrastructure in Saudi Arabia and the MENA region with U.S.-based Nextracker’s global market share leadership in solar power plant technologies, advanced solar trackers, and yield management and control systems.

Nextracker Arabia will build on the unique experience and expertise in clean energy and solar innovation these two organizations bring to the new joint venture. This combination will best enable the new entity to advance Saudi Arabia’s clean energy transition while helping achieve the goals of Saudi Vision 2030 to diversify the economy and strengthen local industrial capacity.

The joint venture includes sales, engineering, and operations, and will assume ownership of Nextracker’s existing manufacturing facility in the Kingdom. This initial plant will play a key role in the production and distribution of Nextracker’s integrated solar power plant technologies for major utility-scale and distributed generation projects in Saudi Arabia and across the MENA region. These technologies will include Nextracker’s advanced solar trackers, mechanical infrastructure, and yield management and control systems.

Turki Al-Amri, Abunayyan Holding CEO, said, “Nextracker has a proven track record of the highest performing solar power systems. Nextracker Arabia will represent a powerful new platform built on shared values of sustainability and responsibility as well as a commitment to maximizing the potential of solar energy to lead MENA’s clean energy future. Together, we can deliver highly efficient, cost-effective clean energy at scale to help drive long-term social and economic growth in Saudi Arabia and across the region.”

Dan Shugar, Nextracker founder and CEO, said, “With Abunayyan Holding, we have a partner that is uniquely experienced in and deeply aligned with the region’s energy transition needs. With this new joint venture and initial manufacturing facility, we will build a strong local supply chain that brings production closer to our customers, enhances self-reliance, and delivers the high performance and reliability that our customers value. We are proud to invest in the Kingdom’s clean energy future and Saudi Arabia’s leadership in the energy transition across the MENA region.”

By localizing the sales, engineering, manufacturing and distribution of its products in Saudi Arabia, Nextracker Arabia can most effectively contribute to increasing the important role solar energy will play in helping to achieve national and regional energy transition objectives. Saudi Arabia has a goal of deploying 130 gigawatts of clean energy by 2030, with solar playing a critical role in achieving this objective.

The MENA region is emerging as a global solar energy leader. With increasing cost competitiveness and government-backed clean energy strategies, the region is accelerating its renewable energy transition. According to the Middle East Solar Industry Association (MESIA) 2025 Solar Outlook Report, MENA’s solar capacity could exceed 180 GW by 2030. In 2024 alone, installed capacity reached 24 GWac, up 25% from the previous year, and is expected to surpass 30 GW by year-end.

Nextracker has a strong legacy of reliable performance in Saudi Arabia, starting with KSA’s first utility-scale installation, the 405 MW Sakaka Solar Park where the company’s system has demonstrated exemplary reliability. Partnering with developers in the Middle East and Africa, Nextracker has delivered more than 6 GW of solar projects across the region, including more than 3 GW in Saudi Arabia. Landmark projects with Nextracker systems include 1.17 GW of the Al Kahfah project, the 449 MW Tabarjal project, and 904 MW of the Sudair project.

Turki Al-Amri, Abunayyan Holding’s chief executive officer, is expected to serve as both chairman of the board and chief executive officer for the new joint venture. Rajeev Kashyap, senior vice president and general manager for Nextracker Middle East, India, and Africa (MEIA), is expected to serve as chief operating officer for Nextracker Arabia.

Hyundai also intends to enter one of the industry's largest segments with the launch of its first mid-size pickup truck within the next five years.

A key part of its electric vehicle expansion includes the introduction of Extended Range EV (EREV) models, scheduled for launch in 2027. Unlike conventional approaches, Hyundai’s EREVs will utilise in-house high-performance batteries.

This design could achieve full EV power performance with less than half the battery capacity of some competitors, providing full electrification over a range of more than 600 miles.

Commitment to sustainable manufacturing

These ambitions are aligned with Hyundai’s ‘Progress to Humanity’ vision.

Hyundai says this ""reflects our belief that advancing emissions-free mobility is not only sound business, but a shared responsibility to ensure cleaner air, stronger economies, and a better quality of life for future generations"".

In Hyundai's 2025 Sustainability Report, José discussed this commitment further: “Our commitment to achieving 100% renewable energy (RE100) across our businesses is taking shape through large-scale renewable energy purchase agreements in Korea, the US, and India. We’re also maximising water recycling and working towards our ultimate goal of carbon neutrality by 2045.”

This dedication extends to its manufacturing footprint. José outlined how the Hyundai Motor Group Metaplant America (HMGMA) is projected to reach a total production capacity of 500,000 units by 2028.

This expansion in Georgia, US, will involve a US$2.7bn investment over three years. Hyundai aims to produce more than 80% of vehicles sold in the US domestically by 2030, a move that will increase supply chain content from 60% to 80%.

Manufacturing improvements also include the implementation of software-defined factories, where software is central to controlling and optimising production processes for greater efficiency.

Luxury brand and financial strategy

Hyundai's luxury brand Genesis is celebrating its 10th anniversary and 1,000,000 cumulative sales. According to José, Genesis aims to reach 350,000 annual sales by 2030, expanding its presence in up to 20 European markets while strengthening US-based production and EREV launches.

Seung Jo (Scott) Lee, Hyundai’s Chief Financial Officer, detailed Hyundai’s financial strategy, which includes an increase in target revenue by 5-6%. Hyundai also adjusted its OPM target to 6-7%. A KRW 77.3tn investment is planned for research and development capital expenditure and strategic investment.

Looking ahead, José reiterated Hyundai's direction: “We’re not just adapting to change - we’re leading it. Through our commitment to electrification, our investment in software-defined vehicles, our focus on manufacturing excellence, and our dedication to treating every customer like an honoured guest, we’re building the mobility company of the future.”",https://assets.bizclikmedia.net/1200/2c87f83d2b1a2ea81dc18dd674d94479:fbc9afb53781f4807757d33c6620d155/mk01.jpg.jpg,N,,2025-10-25 19:18:06.445019

The older I get, the more I believe that in most instances, what we’ve often thought to be coincidences — or the referenced “blind porcine” variety — turned out to have been divinely appointed.

A few days ago, tools in hand, I was restoring a screw in the mortar at our front door. From it hangs a small sign for doorbell ringers who’d like to sell us something. The words “No Solicitors” cause some “peddlers” to pass on by. (Would that we could hang such a sign on the telephone to warn us that roofers “happen to be in the area” and inquiries if our home is for sale.) …

As I prepared to re-attach the sign, I noticed a jovial guy ringing doorbells in our cul-de-sac; there was obviously friendly banter during brief doorway conversations. As he approached our abode, I aimlessly asked a four-worded question: “What are you selling?”

He saw the sign, asking, “Do you really want to know? If you’re serious, I’m selling solar power.”

Over the past decade, I’ve had telephone solicitations from companies wanting to “set us up” with solar power, save us money, protect the environment and provide electricity when traditional delivery fails during overloads or damaged power lines. Usually, there was mention that systems would pay for themselves over two or three decades. At my age of 88, I always felt like the guy who was sentenced to 300 years in prison. Hearing the plaintiff confess that he didn’t know if he could live that long, the judge answered, “Just do the best you can.” …

“Our program conversion is provided without charge, saves you money and both delivers and stores electricity,” C. J. Pilling assured as I invited him inside. Despite my haunting too-good-to-be-true fears, he had the right answer to every question.

I called a knowledgeable friend who offered “go-for-it” advice. Sure enough, everything promised has been done on time or sooner, and our new “flat rate” monthly bill is down by 20%. We have all new electrical stuff, with solar panels on the sunny side of the roof. And, there’s more! The first three months of solar power are free.

Turns out that our panels are harnessing more power than we need; it goes back on the grid. With batteries now fully charged, we can withstand black-outs for days at a time. How smug we felt — one week after our new electrical delivery system was operative — when there was a four-hour power failure affecting a thousand homes in our part of the city. We remained “electrified.” …

And, there’s more!

The company maintains warranties and pays insurance on the system. Customers need not own any equipment to get solar and battery benefits.

I’m not used to so many upsides, and my hard-to-convince brother — far better able to detect downsides without sliding into them — is going solar himself.

He lives in Dallas, also near electrical grids vital to the solar program. Sadly, grids are not available in all states, or in all parts of Texas. …

There’s space to mention only a few advantages of solar energy, and I’m discovering more each week.

Further, I know that it’s awkward contacting someone whose job it is to reach you. Contact me if you want more information. This is kinda like bragging about gasoline mileage on an e-car, which, by the way, could be charged nightly at zero cost in my garage. But, I’m not currently fixated on buying a car that plugs in.

Near-Term Growth from Data Centers: Surging power demand from AI and data center customers is driving infrastructure spending and boosting AEP’s regulated rate base.","Overview

American Electric Power (AEP) is one of the biggest publicly traded electric utilities in the US, based out of Columbus, Ohio. Its bread and butter is regulated utility operations—think power generation, transmission, and making sure lights stay on across 11 states. That happens through subsidiaries including AEP Ohio, Indiana Michigan Power, Appalachian Power, and Southwestern Electric Power Company. AEP also runs a transmission division (AEP Transmission), which happens to control the country’s largest high-voltage grid, plus a retail energy branch (AEP Energy) for residential and business customers. Its AEP Renewables wing builds out wind, solar, and hydro projects in line with its aims to cut carbon. The US electric utility sector is known for steady cash flows, a lot of regulation, and big infrastructure spending. AEP competes with other industry heavyweights like NextEra Energy, Duke Energy, and Dominion Energy by leaning on its massive 40,000-mile transmission system and strong state-level ties. Its business model—centered on regulated rates and cost recovery—gives it a sturdy market position. surging energy demand from data centers and the broader electrification trend is creating more opportunities, but AEP still has to navigate regulatory hearings, approval processes, and shifting renewable energy rules.

Recent Performance

From October 2024 to October 2025, AEP shares delivered a 20.25% return, beating the S&P 500’s 16.53% gain. What fueled the outperformance? Strong fundamental results—commercial demand jumped 12.3%, and they exceeded first-quarter EPS targets. Toss in news of a ramped-up capital investment plan and a $1.6 billion Department of Energy loan guarantee for transmission upgrades, and investors clearly liked what they saw. The common thread: AEP’s consistent plan to benefit from soaring power usage, especially thanks to the data center and AI boom.

Fundamental Analysis

Growth Prospects

AEP’s reported sales grew 6.38% in the past year, a solid showing, though still trailing the market average of 8.73%. Its five-year capital spending plan is being kicked up a notch—from $54 billion to $64 billion, with the possibility of going all the way to $70 billion under new proposals. That’s aimed at modernizing the grid, integrating renewables, and keeping up with the electricity appetite of data centers. Rate hikes tied to these projects—if regulators give the green light—should keep revenue and earnings trending up. On top of that, AEP’s geographic spread over 11 states and its growing fleet of wind and solar assets mean it has more levers for future growth.

Quality & Moat

AEP’s regulated model means reliable cash flows, reflected in its 25.67% operating margin—a notch above the market’s 18.32%. Its 6.84% return on invested capital isn’t high compared to the market average of 11.03%, but that’s typical for heavily regulated, infrastructure-heavy utilities. The management team’s got a reputation for disciplined cash spending, as seen in timely rate filings and cost recovery. Its net debt/EBITDA ratio is high at 5.25 (market average is just 1.41), thanks to big spending on new projects, but it can still comfortably cover its interest under current regulatory rules. Free cash flow has dipped negative (–3.52% yield) as spending accelerates, but AEP should be able to generate healthy cash again once all these upgrades finish and new rates kick in.

Valuation

At a forward P/E of 16.66x, AEP’s stock is priced below the market average (25.95x), offering a potential buffer for risk-averse investors. Its EV/Sales of 5.20x is a bit higher than the market’s 4.55x. That’s a nod to its high-quality regulated assets and predictable future cash flows. The lower-than-market earnings multiple makes sense given AEP’s current period of heavy spending and slow growth. Once these big investments move onto the regulated rate base, there’s a chance valuation could climb closer to industry peers.

Market Sentiment

Market mood is a bit of a mixed bag. AEP’s beta is just 0.17, which makes it one of the most defensive stocks out there with little correlation to the broader market. In the past couple of months, AEP shares have sat about 3.48% above their 50-day moving average, hinting at some gentle upward momentum. Annualized volatility at 15.48% is well below the market’s average of 25.65%, underlining AEP’s steady-as-she-goes profile. Short interest is around 4.1% of the float, with a 6.6-day cover ratio, but it’s actually falling (down 6.3% in the past month), suggesting bears are starting to back off. Institutional holders make up over 85% of the shares, showing broad support from professionals. Insiders own under 0.1%, so management’s interests are lined up with shareholders for the long run.

Key Risks

Regulatory Risk: AEP has to play by the rules in rate-regulated markets. Any unfavorable rulings from state Public Utility Commissions or federal regulators on allowed returns or how costs get passed to customers could hit revenues and profit margins.

Leverage and Interest Rates: AEP’s net debt/EBITDA of 5.25x is a lot higher than your typical company. If interest rates go up or AEP faces tough refinancing conditions, its cost of borrowing could rise and its free cash flow could tighten.

Execution of Capex Plan: Pumping $64–70 billion into new projects is no small feat. There’s always the chance of delays, higher costs than expected, or slow-moving approvals from regulators, all of which could weigh down returns.

Commodity and Operational Risks: Most of the business is shielded by regulation, but AEP still has exposure to swings in fuel costs for gas-powered plants, extreme weather disruptions, and risks linked to keeping the grid reliable.

Bull Case

Stable Regulated Cash Flows: With predictable revenue and earnings from its cost-plus rate structure, AEP protects margins and limits how much downturns can hurt.

Near-Term Growth from Data Centers: Surging power demand from AI and data center customers is driving infrastructure spending and boosting AEP’s regulated rate base.

Undemanding Valuation: A forward P/E of 16.7x gives AEP a valuation cushion compared to both its peers and the wider market.

Strong Transmission Network: Owning the nation’s largest high-voltage transmission system lets AEP benefit from FERC-approved returns—a durable competitive strength.

Defensive Profile: Low beta (0.17) and below-average volatility (15.5%) make this stock attractive for investors who want income and peace of mind.

Bear Case

Heavy Capital Expenditure: Spending heavily on new infrastructure in the near-term could keep free cash flow negative and leverage high, delaying any major credit improvements.

Regulatory Uncertainty: AEP’s ability to turn investment into profit depends on favorable rate cases. Rulings that cut allowed returns or refuse cost recovery could put a lid on earnings growth.

Modest Growth Prospects: Sales growth around 6.4% is solid for a utility, but it trails the broader market. That limits AEP’s prospects for getting awarded higher valuation multiples.

Low ROIC: Return on invested capital is below the market average, typical for utilities, but it does raise questions about how efficiently management is using shareholders’ money.

On Our Radar

Q3 2025 Earnings Release: Expected around November 6, 2025. The big things to watch: updated EPS, new guidance on capex, and any updates on ongoing rate cases.

FERC Transmission Rate Case: A key decision on AEP Transmission’s cost-of-service filing is due in late 2025, which will set allowed returns on new and existing grid investments.

State Rate Cases: Pending decisions in Ohio and Texas about rate adjustments tied to grid upgrades. Expect outcomes in the fourth quarter of 2025.

Capital Plan Announcement: AEP will formally unveil its $64–$70 billion five-year capex plan in November 2025, with detailed timelines on what gets built when.

Investment Conclusion

For patient, income-focused investors, AEP offers a way to tap into steady, regulated cash flows, bolstered by its low volatility, defensive profile, and robust transmission network. Its shares look attractively priced relative to the broader market. That said, the utility is in a period of heavy investment, with leverage running high and a fair bit hanging on getting regulatory approvals right. Anyone thinking about adding AEP to their portfolio should weigh the reliability of its dividend income and growth against the risk that regulatory or execution hiccups could make free cash flow tight or slow down earnings progress.",https://finimize-img.imgix.net/https%3A%2F%2Fchivas-assets.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com%2Fstatic%2Fimages%2Fasset_snapshot_placeholder.original.png?ixlib=python-3.1.2&s=733c218a6175c5f3b8215b90512f96d8,N,,2025-10-25 18:18:31.938291

The project, which started in July 2025, is a strategic initiative aimed at uniting 140-plus automotive companies, universities, and economic development entities across South Texas and Northern Tamaulipas, Mexico. By mapping this cluster, COSTEP hopes to bring more manufactures and suppliers to the Rio South Texas Region.

Rick Carrera, economic development director, said COSTEP has had 90 responses so far.

“We have found that some of the suppliers were not aware that their neighbors or their suppliers are based in the region. Some within a few miles, some several miles away. They did not know,” Carrera explained. “It is a win-win because some of these companies were getting their raw materials from suppliers outside the state. So it's been a very positive outcome, one that we thought might happen.”

Carrera added: “We weren't doing this (the Binational Autocluster project) to get into the matchmaking business, but we're more than happy to help that process out.”

The RGG Business Journal secured an interview with Carrera at the end of a South Texas Manufacturers Association meeting that was held at the Harlingen Convention Center.

The executive director of STMA, Mike Willis, had asked Carrera if he had any updates to share with the audience. He did. He spoke about the early success of the Binational Autocluster project.

Willis then explained to the audience what COSTEP is and what the Binational Autocluster project is all about.

""For those of you who are not familiar, COSTEP is a regional economic development group. They go to trade shows all over the world. They try to attract companies to our region,"" Willis said.

""They are trying to map out information about all the companies on both sides of the river that are in the automotive business to help show that to foreign prospects to try to see what kind of supply chain they could have if they located to northern Tamaulipas or especially the Rio Grande Valley. So, that is what that is for.”

In his in-depth interview with the Business Journal, Carrera also spoke about his attendance of the 50th National INDEX Convention, held in Mexico City. He said it was an excellent convention. INDEX is the trade association of the maquiladora industry in Mexico.

Carrera also spoke about a site selector conference he will be attending soon in Orlando, Florida.

Here, below, is an audio recording of the interview. It includes an introduction by STMA’s Willis.

Memorandum of Understanding

Meanwhile, at the INDEX convention in Mexico City that Carrera was talking about, COSTEP signed a Memorandum of Understanding.

The agreement, with INDEX Nacional, seeks to enhance competitiveness, attract investment, and foster industrial development along the Rio South Texas–Tamaulipas corridor, or Rio South Texas, as COSTEP calls it.

Adam Gonzalez, COSTEP’s CEO, said the signing formalizes decades of cross-border collaboration between the maquiladora industry in northern Mexico and economic development organizations of South Texas. He said both institutions share a common vision: to promote sustainable industrial growth, technological innovation, and binational workforce development as drivers of regional prosperity.

“Our region has grown shoulder to shoulder with INDEX — not just through trade, but through projects, shared families, and a shared commitment to progress,” Gonzalez said. “This MOU represents our pledge to continue working together to attract investment, accelerate binational development, and strengthen the manufacturing ecosystem that sustains thousands of families on both sides of the border.”

Humberto Martínez is president of INDEX Nacional. He said the MOU highlighted reinforces a long-term strategy for competitiveness.

“The future of our region will not be built in isolation, but through collaboration,” Martínez. “This partnership with COSTEP ensures that our industry continues to expand, innovate, and generate opportunities in a global environment increasingly shaped by nearshoring.”",https://gamma.creativecirclecdn.com/riogrande/original/20251025-164559-d0a-Rick_Carrera.JPG,N,,2025-10-25 20:03:57.742619

Hydropower contributed 27 percent of total U.S. utility-scale renewable electricity generation and 5.86 percent of total utility-scale electricity production in 2024. The U.S. first started developing its hydropower fleet in the late 1800s, long before other renewable energy sources, such as wind and solar power.

Hydropower plants produce electricity using the elevation difference created by a dam or diversion structure. Water flows in one side and exits at a lower point, spinning a turbine, which runs a generator to produce electricity. However, of the more than 90,000 dams in the United States, fewer than 3 percent produce power, with the others being used for recreation, farm ponds, flood control, water supply, and irrigation.

While there is huge potential for hydropower in the United States, many of the existing facilities are getting older and more expensive to maintain. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law that was launched under the Biden administration provides $753.6 million to the U.S. Department of Energy (DoE) for hydropower, but significantly more funding would be required to expand rather than solely maintain the country’s hydropower capacity.

The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) expects hydropower generation to rise by 7.5 percent in 2025, after falling by 241 billion kilowatt-hours (BkWh) in 2024, to its lowest generation since 2010. Generation is expected to reach 259.1 BkWh this year, to contribute around 6 percent of U.S. electricity production. Approximately half of the hydropower generating capacity in the U.S. is in the western states of Washington, Oregon, and California.

Energy experts suggest that now may be a make-or-break moment for hydropower, as several existing facilities require high quantities of funding to extend their lifespans. Almost 450 hydroelectric plants, which contribute over 16 GW of electricity in total, are due to be relicensed across the U.S. over the next 10 years. This accounts for around 40 percent of non-federal hydropower.

However, the introduction of stricter requirements will require millions of dollars to be spent on upgrades to qualify for a new operating permit for existing facilities, which is forcing many companies to close operations. Many of these plants have been providing vast quantities of stable, clean electricity for decades. However, the falling costs associated with natural gas, wind, and solar power have made it increasingly difficult for hydropower to compete.

Most dams in the U.S. have an average age of 65 years, meaning they were built without the same consideration for the environment that is now expected for hydropower development. Upgrading old facilities to enable the unobstructed passage for fish and other wildlife, as well as meeting other environmental standards, would be extremely expensive for operators. In addition, many of these facilities require significant investment to fix or replace turbines and other hardware that have atrophied over time.

Another barrier to relicensing is the lack of clear oversight for the sector. No single agency has full authority over hydropower. This can make the bureaucratic process for a new license extremely complex, as various agencies may have different standards and expectations for operators. At present, it takes an average of eight years to relicense an existing hydropower facility, which is far longer than for other energy sources.

In January, the Biden administration’s Treasury Department expanded a renewable energy rule to include hydropower, which treats facilities as new if operators reinvest a minimum of 80 percent of the facility’s market value into infrastructure upgrades, making them eligible for larger federal write-offs. Only one hydropower facility has used the federal investment tax credit to date, as, until recently, there was a lack of clear guidance on how to apply the tax credit.

While President Trump has been highly critical of many renewable energy sources, hydropower is one of the few clean energies that Trump appears to support. Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act preserves the sector’s access to key federal tax credits for the next eight years, which could help reassure investors.

There have been some positive signs for the hydropower sector in recent months, with the signing of a $3 billion hydropower deal between Google and Brookfield Asset Management in July. Google hopes the project will provide up to 3 GW of hydropower for its data centres. The move includes 20-year power purchase agreements for two hydropower facilities in Pennsylvania. The two sites are expected to be upgraded and relicensed as part of the arrangement, and Google aims to eventually expand the deal beyond the two initial sites to other parts of the Mid-Atlantic and Midwest, the company said.

“This collaboration with Brookfield is a significant step forward, ensuring clean energy supply in the PJM region where we operate,” Google’s head of data centre energy, Amanda Peterson Corio, said in a statement.

To enable hydropower plants to continue providing a significant proportion of the United States’ clean electricity, significant funding must be contributed to the sector to make facilities eligible for relicensing. Many plants require millions of dollars in upgrades, which most operators simply cannot afford. Meanwhile, the falling cost of gas, solar, and wind power has made hydropower less competitive in recent years, despite its long history in the U.S. and significant contribution to the country’s clean energy mix.

The memo outlined two primary organizational changes, both affecting customer-facing functions that generate no revenue during Rivian’s current production constraints.
Yet Scaringe’s memo reads like a routine organizational efficiency exercise, complete with org-chart minutiae about which VP reports to which interim executive.

The carefully worded message emphasized “structural adjustments” for the upcoming R2 launch while conspicuously avoiding the financial crisis threatening the company’s survival.

The layoffs—affecting approximately 4.5% of Rivian’s 15,000-person workforce—come just one day after Scaringe promoted the company’s ALSO e-bike spinoff to media, highlighting the jarring contrast between Rivian’s public optimism and private cost-cutting. The timing speaks volumes about the EV startup’s precarious position as it races to launch the $45,000 R2 SUV in early 2026 while burning through what remains of its once-massive cash reserves.

The Memo: Corporate Speak Meets Crisis Management

In the memo viewed by Business Insider, Scaringe framed the cuts as strategic positioning rather than desperate measures. “With the launch of R2 in front of us and the need to profitably scale our business, we have made the very difficult decision to make a number of structural adjustments to our teams,” he wrote. “These changes result in a reduction in the size of our team by roughly 4.5%.”

The CEO acknowledged the human cost with measured corporate language: “These are not changes that were made lightly. With the changing operating backdrop, we had to rethink how we are scaling our go-to-market functions. This news is challenging to hear, and the hard work and contributions of the team members who are leaving are greatly appreciated.”

But what’s most revealing isn’t what Scaringe said—it’s what he carefully avoided mentioning. The memo makes zero reference to the September 30 expiration of federal EV tax credits, which eliminated up to $7,500 in savings for new EV buyers under President Trump’s “One Big Beautiful Bill.” It doesn’t acknowledge this is the third layoff round since June. And it certainly doesn’t mention that Rivian has burned through more than $12 billion since its 2021 IPO, with less than $6 billion remaining and quarterly losses exceeding $1 billion.

Reorganization Details: Streamlining or Scrambling?

The memo outlined two primary organizational changes, both affecting customer-facing functions that generate no revenue during Rivian’s current production constraints.

Customer Operations Consolidation: Scaringe announced integrating Vehicle Operations into the Service organization “to create fewer customer handoffs and clearer ownership.” Delivery and Mobile Operations will fold into Sales “to ensure the purchase experience is as seamless as possible with a single touchpoint throughout the entire sales process and to delivery.”

Marketing Restructure: Perhaps most telling, Rivian is consolidating multiple marketing functions into a single organization while searching for its first Chief Marketing Officer. Until that hire, Scaringe will serve as interim CMO—adding another executive role to his plate while the company fights for survival. “While we recruit our first Chief Marketing Officer, I will be acting as Interim CMO,” he wrote.

The CEO specifically named two teams reporting directly to him during the transition: the Marketing Experiences team led by Denise Cherry and the Creative Studio team under Matt Soldan. This level of detail about org-chart reshuffling while cutting hundreds of jobs reads more like damage control than strategic vision.

What The Memo Conveniently Omits

The Wall Street Journal first reported the layoffs Thursday, noting they primarily target sales, marketing, and customer service departments—leaving manufacturing operations untouched as Rivian prepares for R2 production ramp-up at its Normal, Illinois facility.

What Scaringe’s memo doesn’t mention is the broader context EVXL readers already know well. We’ve been documenting Rivian’s mounting struggles for months:

These cuts follow a 10% workforce reduction in February 2024 and additional layoffs in June

Rivian reported a $1.115 billion net loss in Q2 2025 on just 10,661 deliveries

The company announced a $250 million IPO fraud settlement the same day as these layoffs

Third-quarter 2025 EV sales hit records as buyers rushed to claim tax credits before the September 30 deadline, but that temporary spike masked the coming demand cliff

The memo’s reference to a “changing operating backdrop” is corporate euphemism for “federal tax credits that propped up our industry just vanished, and we’re about to find out if anyone will pay $45,000 for an R2 without government subsidies.”

The R2 Gambit: All-In On Affordable EVs

Scaringe called the R2 “an inflection point for us to become a company of the scale we aspire to be, which is producing many millions of cars a year” during Wednesday’s ALSO unveiling event. That ambitious vision contrasts sharply with Thursday’s workforce cuts targeting the very departments needed to sell those millions of vehicles.

The R2 launches in the first half of 2026 with a targeted starting price of $45,000, positioning it against the Tesla Model Y and Ford Mustang Mach-E in the competitive compact electric SUV segment. Rivian delivered 13,200 vehicles in the third quarter—a 32% year-over-year increase—but narrowed its full-year guidance to 41,500-43,500 units amid post-tax-credit uncertainty.

The company maintains it has sufficient capital to reach R2 production, bolstered by Volkswagen’s $5 billion joint venture investment. But with quarterly losses exceeding $1 billion and production volumes still in the low tens of thousands, Rivian is betting everything on the R2 resonating with mainstream buyers who no longer receive thousands in federal incentives.

EVXL’s Take

Let’s decode what’s really happening here. Rivian just announced its third workforce reduction in four months—a 4.5% cut following previous rounds that already slashed more than 10% of staff. The company settled a $250 million fraud lawsuit the same morning it sent this memo. And it’s burning through its remaining $6 billion in cash at more than $1 billion per quarter while producing vehicles in the low five figures.

Yet Scaringe’s memo reads like a routine organizational efficiency exercise, complete with org-chart minutiae about which VP reports to which interim executive. The corporate euphemisms—“structural adjustments,” “changing operating backdrop,” “scaling our go-to-market functions”—carefully avoid the uncomfortable truth that Rivian is in crisis mode.

This isn’t restructuring. This is a company desperately trying to reach the R2 launch with enough cash and credibility intact to convince consumers they’ll be around to honor warranties. The fact that Scaringe is taking on the interim CMO role himself while searching for a permanent hire suggests either leadership churn or an inability to attract top talent to a sinking ship—or both.

We’ve seen this movie before with EV startups. Lordstown Motors collapsed. Fisker filed for bankruptcy. Lucid keeps cutting staff while surviving on Saudi money. The difference is Rivian actually builds compelling vehicles and has a legitimate manufacturing operation. But compelling vehicles don’t matter if you run out of money before reaching profitable scale.

The R2 at $45,000 without tax credits needs to be good enough to steal significant market share from Tesla, Ford, and Hyundai. That’s a massive ask for a company that’s never turned a profit, just cut hundreds of customer-facing employees, and is asking its CEO to moonlight as CMO while running product development and operations.

Read Scaringe’s memo carefully. Notice what he emphasizes—organizational efficiency, R2 preparation, streamlined customer journeys. Then notice what he doesn’t mention—the third layoff round in four months, the collapsed tax credit support, the $250 million fraud settlement announced the same day, or the very real possibility that Rivian might not survive to see the R2’s second model year.

The corporate messaging is masterful. The underlying reality is terrifying.

Hydropower contributed 27 percent of total U.S. utility-scale renewable electricity generation and 5.86 percent of total utility-scale electricity production in 2024. The U.S. first started developing its hydropower fleet in the late 1800s, long before other renewable energy sources, such as wind and solar power.

Hydropower plants produce electricity using the elevation difference created by a dam or diversion structure. Water flows in one side and exits at a lower point, spinning a turbine, which runs a generator to produce electricity. However, of the more than 90,000 dams in the United States, fewer than 3 percent produce power, with the others being used for recreation, farm ponds, flood control, water supply, and irrigation.

While there is huge potential for hydropower in the United States, many of the existing facilities are getting older and more expensive to maintain. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law that was launched under the Biden administration provides $753.6 million to the U.S. Department of Energy (DoE) for hydropower, but significantly more funding would be required to expand rather than solely maintain the country's hydropower capacity.

The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) expects hydropower generation to rise by 7.5 percent in 2025, after falling by 241 billion kilowatt-hours (BkWh) in 2024, to its lowest generation since 2010. Generation is expected to reach 259.1 BkWh this year, to contribute around 6 percent of U.S. electricity production. Approximately half of the hydropower generating capacity in the U.S. is in the western states of Washington, Oregon, and California.

Energy experts suggest that now may be a make-or-break moment for hydropower, as several existing facilities require high quantities of funding to extend their lifespans. Almost 450 hydroelectric plants, which contribute over 16 GW of electricity in total, are due to be relicensed across the U.S. over the next 10 years. This accounts for around 40 percent of non-federal hydropower.

However, the introduction of stricter requirements will require millions of dollars to be spent on upgrades to qualify for a new operating permit for existing facilities, which is forcing many companies to close operations. Many of these plants have been providing vast quantities of stable, clean electricity for decades. However, the falling costs associated with natural gas, wind, and solar power have made it increasingly difficult for hydropower to compete.

Most dams in the U.S. have an average age of 65 years, meaning they were built without the same consideration for the environment that is now expected for hydropower development. Upgrading old facilities to enable the unobstructed passage for fish and other wildlife, as well as meeting other environmental standards, would be extremely expensive for operators. In addition, many of these facilities require significant investment to fix or replace turbines and other hardware that have atrophied over time.

Another barrier to relicensing is the lack of clear oversight for the sector. No single agency has full authority over hydropower. This can make the bureaucratic process for a new license extremely complex, as various agencies may have different standards and expectations for operators. At present, it takes an average of eight years to relicense an existing hydropower facility, which is far longer than for other energy sources.

In January, the Biden administration's Treasury Department expanded a renewable energy rule to include hydropower, which treats facilities as new if operators reinvest a minimum of 80 percent of the facility's market value into infrastructure upgrades, making them eligible for larger federal write-offs. Only one hydropower facility has used the federal investment tax credit to date, as, until recently, there was a lack of clear guidance on how to apply the tax credit.

While President Trump has been highly critical of many renewable energy sources, hydropower is one of the few clean energies that Trump appears to support. Trump's One Big Beautiful Bill Act preserves the sector's access to key federal tax credits for the next eight years, which could help reassure investors.

There have been some positive signs for the hydropower sector in recent months, with the signing of a $3 billion hydropower deal between Google and Brookfield Asset Management in July. Google hopes the project will provide up to 3 GW of hydropower for its data centres. The move includes 20-year power purchase agreements for two hydropower facilities in Pennsylvania. The two sites are expected to be upgraded and relicensed as part of the arrangement, and Google aims to eventually expand the deal beyond the two initial sites to other parts of the Mid-Atlantic and Midwest, the company said.

""This collaboration with Brookfield is a significant step forward, ensuring clean energy supply in the PJM region where we operate,"" Google's head of data centre energy, Amanda Peterson Corio, said in a statement.

To enable hydropower plants to continue providing a significant proportion of the United States' clean electricity, significant funding must be contributed to the sector to make facilities eligible for relicensing. Many plants require millions of dollars in upgrades, which most operators simply cannot afford. Meanwhile, the falling cost of gas, solar, and wind power has made hydropower less competitive in recent years, despite its long history in the U.S. and significant contribution to the country's clean energy mix.

Sheikh Theyab bin Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, Deputy Chairman of the Presidential Court for Development and Fallen Heroes’ Affairs, oversaw the groundbreaking of the facility, which combines 5.2 gigawatts (GW) of solar photovoltaic panels with a 19-gigawatt-hour (GWh) battery storage system, capable of generating a full 1 GW of continuous baseload power.

What makes this project a world first

The sheer size is only part of the story. Traditional renewable energy faces a simple but stubborn problem: intermittency. Solar panels only produce electricity when the sun shines, and wind turbines when the wind blows. Until now, that has limited renewables’ ability to provide stable baseload power, forcing grids to rely on fossil fuels. This Abu Dhabi project overcomes that limitation through a combination of technological innovations at scale:

Gigascale battery storage: The 19 GWh system stores solar energy produced during peak sunlight in the day and releases it consistently through night-time and cloudy periods.

Grid-forming and black start capability: The system can stabilise the grid independently and even restart it if the network fails, ensuring unparalleled reliability.

Virtual power plant operation: It functions as a coordinated network of distributed resources, optimising energy dispatch across the site in real time.

AI-driven forecasting and intelligent dispatch: Advanced algorithms predict solar output and energy demand, managing the battery automatically to maintain uninterrupted supply.

Together, these features allow renewable energy to function as a true replacement for conventional baseload power plants, rather than just a supplementary source.

Scale and impact

The project spans roughly 1.5 times the size of Manhattan, covering 90 square kilometres (34.75 square miles) in the desert of Abu Dhabi, with a capital investment exceeding AED 22 billion (USD 5.94 billion). Once operational in 2027, it is expected to:

Create over 10,000 jobs and establish new manufacturing facilities.

Avoid approximately 5.7 million tonnes of CO₂ emissions annually, equivalent to removing more than a million cars from circulation.

Deliver electricity at a globally competitive tariff, demonstrating that renewables can be both sustainable and economically viable.

This facility is not only a national milestone but also a blueprint for countries worldwide aiming to decarbonise while meeting the rising demand for digital and AI-driven technologies, which require a steady, uninterrupted power supply.

A blueprint for the future

Developed by Masdar in partnership with Emirates Water and Electricity Company (EWEC), the project builds on Masdar’s two decades of experience in renewable energy across more than 40 countries. By 2030, the company aims to achieve a 100 GW global clean energy portfolio. This Abu Dhabi project represents Masdar’s largest and most technologically ambitious initiative to date, proving that renewable energy can be scaled intelligently, reliably, and sustainably. In the words of the developers, the facility is more than a solar farm or a giant battery — it is a new standard for global energy innovation, capable of delivering consistent power for the information age and supporting the next generation of technological growth.

Every time the wind stops blowing, turbines stand still. For decades, this simple reality that renewable energy only works when nature cooperates has been the industry's most logically stubborn obstacle.

Abu Dhabi broke ground on what could be the solution. The emirate just launched construction on the world's first gigascale project capable of delivering round-the-clock baseload power from renewable sources alone. When operational in 2027, the Dh22-billion facility will produce one gigawatt of continuous clean electricity—enough to power hundreds of thousands of homes by pairing what will become the world's largest battery storage system.

The scale is staggering: The project spans an area comparable to Manhattan and features a 19-gigawatt-hour battery—large enough to store energy generated during peak sunlight and dispatch it seamlessly through the night and cloudy days. It's the energy equivalent of never letting the lights flicker, regardless of the weather.

""This project aligns with the UAE's leadership vision to decarbonise and innovate,"" Ibraheem Al Mansouri, Director of Engineering at Masdar, told Khaleej Times. ""This marks the start of a new era for renewable energy globally.""

Sheikh Theyab bin Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, Deputy Chairman of the Presidential Court for Development and Fallen Heroes' Affairs, witnessed the groundbreaking of the facility developed by Masdar and Emirates Water and Electricity Company.

The timing addresses a critical global challenge. Renewable energy intermittency has limited solar and wind adoption because the bulk power system requires continuous current to literally ""keep the lights on."" Traditional power plants burn coal or gas around the clock, providing stable baseload power. Solar and wind couldn’t do that until this project.

""Being part of Masdar's journey from the early days and continuing to deliver first-of-its-kind projects globally is inspiring,"" Al Mansouri told Khaleej Times. ""This project changes the mindset about renewable energy and proves what's possible.""

Development will create more than 10,000 jobs and establish new manufacturing facilities across the UAE. The project represents one of the largest capital investments in renewable infrastructure globally.

The breakthrough builds on Masdar's two-decade track record developing renewable projects across 40 countries. Founded in 2006, the company is targeting 100 gigawatts of clean energy capacity by 2030. This Abu Dhabi facility represents its largest and most ambitious project to date.

When operational in 2027, the project will avoid approximately 5.7 million tonnes of carbon emissions annually equivalent to removing over one million cars from roads while delivering electricity at globally competitive tariffs.

This summer, President Donald Trump signed the One Big Beautiful Bill Act into law, ending various tax credits a decade ahead of schedule. The credits could be used to buy electric vehicles and to install solar panels on homes.

The EV tax credit expired last month. Residential solar tax credits are still available until the end of the year. But Kathy Kuntz, director of Dane County’s Office of Energy and Climate Change, told WPR’s “Wisconsin Today” that it’s unlikely people will be able to qualify for the credits in time unless they’ve already started the process.

“There’s a difference between buying a car and getting solar on your roof,” she said. “You can go to a dealership and buy a car in a couple of hours. It takes more planning to have all of the pieces in place, the permits and everything, to install solar on your house.”

“If people haven’t started yet, it’s probably not realistic for them to take advantage of the solar tax credits at this point,” she added. “If an installer is telling you ‘no problem’ and that they can get this done by the end of the year, you need to be a smart consumer and ask a lot of questions.”

Kuntz said most solar companies her office talks with are saying they’re booked through the year.

Burke O’Neal is a managing partner for Full Spectrum Solar, a solar installation company based in Madison. He told “Wisconsin Today” that the cancellation of the solar energy tax credits is hurting his business.

“It’s certainly been a bit challenging to change course,” O’Neal said. “We were expecting the residential and commercial tax credits through 2032. We were planning additional vehicle and tool purchases and adding electrical and roof installation crews, and we’re still planning to grow but it’s going to be at a slower pace than we expected.”

O’Neal said his company is offering a 5 percent discount to people if they schedule solar installations next year instead of this year to “keep the momentum going.”

Even without solar tax credits, Kuntz said there’s still an economic incentive for installing solar panels. She said the cost of installing solar panels has dropped by 90 percent since the early 2000s. She also said it’s a similar case with EVs becoming more cost-competitive with gas-powered cars.

O’Neal is trying to stay optimistic. He said energy costs for residential homes are up 35 percent in the last four years but solar installation costs remain stable. And as massive data centers around the country continue to drive up the demand and cost for electricity, O’Neal expects solar installations will remain popular.

“Maybe we’re a lot more resilient than we first felt when we learned about these (tax credit) changes,” he said.

Deal boosts solar adoption in Nigeria’s private sector

Empower New Energy, a Norwegian company specializing in developing solar power projects for commercial and industrial businesses, announced a partnership with United Bank for Africa (UBA) on Friday to install solar units at 25 of the bank's Nigerian branches.

The project, which signals continued growth in the commercial and industrial solar sector in the West African nation, is being funded by Empower for an undisclosed sum. Renewvia Energy and Incremental Energy Solutions are partners in the implementation.

Speakers in Friday's symposium offered a similar prescription for addressing strain on water infrastructure: working with data center operators and developers to reduce water use, flatten out swings in demand, and reduce strain on infrastructure.","LOWER SAUCON TWP., Pa. — As a surge of data center construction strains power and water infrastructure, experts met at Lehigh University’s Mountaintop Campus on Friday to prepare for a once-in-a-generation strain on — and potentially transformation of — these critical systems.

Before Friday’s guest speakers began their lectures and panel discussions, university Provost Nathan Urban took a moment to set the stage.

Urban referenced the Mountaintop Campus building where the symposium took place. Now Iacocca Hall, it was once the Homer Research Laboratories Complex, home to Bethlehem Steel’s most cutting-edge research and development projects.

The campus and the innovation it incubated were a powerful engine of last century’s economy, Urban said, while the buildings housing the beating heart of the next era of U.S. economic might well be data centers.

Supplying these new powerhouses will take difficult-to-comprehend amounts of water and electricity, plus careful management and thoughtful development.

Making it work could shape Pennsylvania’s economic outlook for decades to come.

“It's a complex puzzle, but one that I believe we can solve,"" Urban said. ""The conversations we have today are about more than servers and algorithms and electricity generation.

""They are about shaping a sustainable and prosperous future for the commonwealth.”

And those data centers are hungry. Depending on how it is configured, a midsize data center can use as much power and water as a small city.

As developers and technology companies stand up new data centers to supply the computing power undergirding the explosion of artificial intelligence, power and water infrastructure are already under pressure, showing no signs of easing.

Power demands

One of the greatest challenges for the grid, panelists said, will be bringing on enough power generation to meet surging demand.

PJM Interconnection, the organization responsible for balancing energy supply and demand across 13 states including Pennsylvania, expects 32 gigawatts of new electricity demand across the network over the next five years.

About 30 gigawatts of that demand, PJM Senior Director of Applied Innovation and Analytics Emanuel Bernabeu said, comes from new data centers.

PPL Electric Utilities expects to more than triple its peak load over the next 10 years, from about 7.5 gigawatts to nearly 22 gigawatts.

By comparison, from 2007 to 2023, average electricity demand stayed flat as efficiency improvements roughly matched growth.

The U.S. electric grid is already struggling with enough generation capacity, leading to higher costs and more frequent emergency alerts declaring that all of the grid’s power plants are running at full capacity.

Companies that build and operate power plants selling electricity to the grid have not stepped in to fill the gap, several panelists said.

Building a new power plant is a slow and expensive process.

While it may only take a year and a half to two years to build a data center, a new power plant can take two to three times as long to bring online.

The queue for new power plants to join the PJM grid is full through 2030. Currently, the grid controller has signed off on projects adding about 50 gigawatts of generation capacity.

With no silver bullet to quickly add more power to the grid, officials responsible for managing electric infrastructure must look for ways to reduce or shift power consumption.

For example, different cooling technology may help reduce power consumption at the cost of greater water consumption.

Giant batteries can give data center operators a way to draw less power from the grid during periods of peak demand. If data centers plan ahead, they can shift non-essential work to parts of the day when they aren’t competing with, say, residential air conditioning for limited electricity.

To combat limited supply and get projects up and running faster, some data center operators opt to build their own generators, either to supplement a typical power connection or to replace it entirely.

Utility companies may not have the legal authority to force their customers to take power cuts or shift operations to times when electricity is less scarce. Instead, grid managers rely on market forces to influence behavior and keep the supply of electricity in line with demand.

When there is not enough energy to meet demand, power prices rise. As a result, electricity users try to shift or minimize use; power plants may adjust how many generators they have online.

Because the venture-capital-backed companies standing up these new data centers are so flush with cash, price-based incentives do not accomplish much, Bernabeu said, whether that's higher peak power prices or multi-million-dollar payments to secure a grid connection.

Instead, he said, these operators are more motivated by getting up and running as quickly as possible.

Utilities and grid operators will see more success building reliable energy infrastructure by working to connect customers faster if they take steps like coordinating onsite battery storage, contributing their own power generation or allowing power to be cut off in a supply crunch, Bernabeu said.

The same AI technology threatening to overwhelm the electric grid could also help protect it, as machine learning helps operators better predict demand, model the electric grid’s behavior and deal with heavy loads.

Water needs

Data centers can also strain water resources, as the facilities can use as much as three million gallons of water per day to cool its chips, said Tony Nokovich, vice president of engineering for Pennsylvania American Water.

Much of this water evaporates in the process, so large data centers must continuously replace water as it is lost.

However, a data center’s water use can vary widely depending on the temperature outside, dropping to as little as 800 gallons per day during the winter, Nokovich said.

Huge swings in water use can harm water quality, as customers draw too little water to keep pipes from stagnating, or draw too much and lower pressure in the system.

Speakers in Friday's symposium offered a similar prescription for addressing strain on water infrastructure: working with data center operators and developers to reduce water use, flatten out swings in demand, and reduce strain on infrastructure.

Pennsylvania’s water infrastructure faced a similar explosion of demand with the beginning of the shale fracking boom about a decade and a half ago.

The fracking process requires large amounts of water, typically in more remote areas with limited amounts available. Meeting that demand required the same sort of thinking water infrastructure managers will need to address data centers, like installing on-site storage tanks to spread out a driller’s water needs over time.",https://static.lehigh-v.lehigh-valley.production.k1.m1.brightspot.cloud/dims4/default/45a71ac/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3273x1718+0+61/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Flehigh-valley-brightspot.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com%2Ff6%2Fd2%2Fa504cf14444ba085b3e44d21fe85%2Fpxl-20251024-145959284-mp.jpg,N,,2025-10-25 14:58:17.509863

By that math, an owner who paid roughly $100,000 would see a trade-in estimate of about $60,000 after under 20,000 miles.
Via email, Xie said: “Right now, (Kelley Blue Book) prices for the Cybertruck are still inflated, and the demand just isn’t there.
Because demand has cooled and values are falling, the question arises: Is now the perfect time to jump in and get a deal?","The Cybertruck was supposed to be the future. Now, one California dealership says it’s a future nobody wants to buy.

In a viral TikTok, Jason Xie, general manager of Alfa Romeo of San Jose (@alfa.romeo.of.san.jose) laments that even Founders Editions of the eye-catching Tesla are “piling up” and losing value fast, leaving some to wonder if the hype bubble has finally burst.

“It's nice quality, but it's too odd-looking. I'm not crazy about the look of these,” Xie said in the clip that’s been viewed more than 589,000 times. “It's definitely unique, but I think for the price point, I would take a Rivian over this.”

Xie’s comments underscore a palpable shift in the market for Tesla’s first electric pickup. The truck that once sparked year-long waitlists is now drawing dealer sighs and auction floors more than showroom excitement. Xie’s take: “They just keep piling up… about 150 days in stock at least.” That anecdote offers a peek behind the hood of what some observers are calling the Cybertruck’s rapid descent from “must-have” to “must-dump.”

Cybertruck’s Hard Resale Future

Behind the humor lies hard data. Multiple sources show the Cybertruck is depreciating at a rate that would be alarming for almost any vehicle, especially for a truck that cost six figures when new. According to an analysis by CarEdge, a Cybertruck that sold for roughly $96,985 could drop to a resale value of about $50,888 after five years, a decline of nearly 48%. More starkly, a study by iSeeCars found the five-year depreciation for a new Cybertruck at about 60%, versus around 38.8% for light-duty pickups in general.

In some trade-in examples shared by Electrek, Cybertrucks lost as much as 34-45% of their value in just the first year. By that math, an owner who paid roughly $100,000 would see a trade-in estimate of about $60,000 after under 20,000 miles.

OWNERSHIP STORIES

Viral stories from across the web

Our team of experts tracks what owners are saying about car-shopping, repairs, the daily driving experience and more on social media.

That kind of depreciation is almost unheard of for a new truck, especially one positioned as Tesla’s flagship. Xie’s observation that “no one buys ’em” echoes the broader trend: Dealers, knowing the market risk, are avoiding piling inventory of Cybertrucks. The result: supply builds, discount expectations rise, and buyers begin to suspect something’s off.

So what’s behind the slide? For starters, the design is polarizing. The angular stainless-steel body and futuristic profile that once generated viral acclaim now attract mockery: social-media commenters liken the truck to a “dumpster truck” or deride its aesthetics altogether.

Meanwhile, insurance and repair sources signal elevated costs for the model. With parts still scarce, repair times long and some insurers reluctant to cover the vehicle, ownership risk grows. Combined with a heavy curb weight and a premium price tag—the base Founders Edition launched near $100,000—the package is less suited to mainstream truck buyers than Tesla may have hoped.

Then there’s the macro-market context. Tesla’s used-EV values broadly are under pressure, and the Cybertruck appears especially vulnerable. With dramatic price cuts, fewer buyers willing to pay top dollar for EV trucks, and competition heating up from the likes of Rivian R1T and Ford F‑150 Lightning, resale sentiment is shifting. In effect, what was once a status symbol is becoming a cautionary tale.

Via email, Xie said: “Right now, (Kelley Blue Book) prices for the Cybertruck are still inflated, and the demand just isn’t there. There’s probably more price correction ahead before things level out.

“In contrast, we’re already seeing parity for EVs from other brands like Porsche, Lucid, and Rivian. A two- to three-year-old model that’s still under factory warranty can often be had for 40-50% off its original MSRP, which makes it much more accessible to the general market. Interestingly, a lot of those buyers are former Tesla owners.”

Built For Bold Buyers

But here’s where the narrative takes a twist. Because demand has cooled and values are falling, the question arises: Is now the perfect time to jump in and get a deal? For a buyer who is aware of the risks and intends to hold long-term, Xie’s admission that Cybertrucks are “piling up” may signal opportunity. A previously scarce vehicle, now discounted, might appeal to a niche buyer who values uniqueness over resale proof.

Still, the caveats are meaningful. The steep initial depreciation means the next buyer must expect a downward value curve, unlike traditional trucks, which hold value more robustly. The lingering social perception issues and ownership cost risks around insurer wariness, and repair complexity remain. For most buyers, that means the question isn’t simply if they can score a bargain but whether the bargain is worth the trade-offs.

Anyone intrigued by the Cybertruck’s boldness who is prepared for a longer-term hold and doesn’t mind the attention it brings may indeed find a deal emerging. But if resale value, mainstream appeal and predictable ownership dynamics matter most, you may want to hold off or consider alternatives with stronger resale tracks and broader market support.

In the end, the image of a cracked slab of asphalt Xie points to in the video may be the most accurate metaphor: a once-shiny future vehicle weighing too much to land softly. The question now is whether it’s that crack in the pavement or the value-gap beneath the truck that you’re really looking at.

When legislatures toss aside fair maps, they’re not just shifting lines on paper.
Until every state plays fair, California has a duty to recognize reality and respond.
50 isn’t about rewriting the rules forever.
We fight back, and we fight fair.","I served in the Navy, and when I raised my hand, I swore an oath to defend the Constitution. That oath wasn’t partisan, and it didn’t expire when I took off the uniform. It still guides me today. The values I lived by in uniform — honor, courage, commitment — aren’t just for battlefields. They’re for moments like this, when democracy is under attack and sitting on the sidelines is not an option.

This November, Proposition 50 is on the ballot. It doesn’t rewrite the rules forever. It doesn’t dismantle our independent redistricting commission. What it does is ensure that when others rig the system, Californians won’t sit quietly and accept it.

Prop. 50 allows a mid-cycle redraw of California’s congressional maps, but only because others already crossed that line. Texas, Missouri, and others have taken the extraordinary step of tearing up fair maps in the middle of a cycle, at the behest of the White House, with one goal: to cheat their way to power. That’s not democracy; that’s manipulation. California didn’t pick this fight. But we will not sit back and let ourselves be silenced by rigged maps drawn in Austin or Jefferson City.

And let’s be clear: this isn’t an isolated scheme. What we’re seeing isn’t limited to redistricting. This administration has made a habit of bending or breaking the rules to hold onto power. Whether it’s undermining the Justice Department, stacking the courts, or rewriting the rules of our immigration system, the through-line is the same: cheat where you can, and dare anyone to stop you. Some of those fights are out of California’s hands. But when it comes to elections, when it comes to our maps and our representation in Congress, we can do something about it, and Prop. 50 is how we do it.

Here’s the key: this isn’t permanent. It’s a mid-cycle correction, nothing more. Once the next regular redistricting process begins, the independent commission takes back the reins. Prop. 50 is a shield, not a weapon. It says California will meet fire with fire, just long enough to stop one-sided manipulation from deciding the balance of power in Washington.

We’ve already seen attempts to overturn the will of the people. In 2020, the effort to undermine our democracy didn’t happen in whispers behind closed doors, it happened in full public view and people died. And those same tactics are being repeated today. Pretending otherwise is an invitation for history to repeat itself.

When legislatures toss aside fair maps, they’re not just shifting lines on paper. They’re silencing entire communities. They’re deciding in advance who wins and who loses. That’s not politics-as-usual, it’s cheating. And it breaks faith with the very idea of elections.

These aren’t just lines on a map. They decide whether a farmworker in the Central Valley has a representative who listens to her, or whether a military family in San Diego gets a voice in Washington. Gerrymandering doesn’t just redraw boundaries, it redraws lives. Californians understand that when our voices are erased, our futures are too.

Every person who has ever raised their right hand and taken the oath to serve in the military, to uphold the law, or to take public office, swore allegiance not to a party, not to a politician, but to the Constitution. That oath is a reminder that loyalty belongs to the people and to the rule of law.

When state legislatures contort themselves to please a single leader, they violate that sacred trust. They reduce themselves to servitude, ignoring the people they swore to represent. Californians should not, and will not, tolerate that kind of cowardice.

Prop. 50 reflects the Navy values I lived by. Honor demands we call out injustice when we see it. Courage demands we take action even when it’s uncomfortable. Commitment demands we hold the line until fairness is restored.

Critics will sneer that this is gerrymandering by another name. They’re wrong. Gerrymandering is about permanently locking in unfair advantage. Prop. 50 is temporary, reluctant, and necessary. It is a corrective measure until the referees, the independent commissioners, are allowed to do their jobs again.

It’s breathtaking hypocrisy when Republican-led legislatures rip up maps mid-cycle to entrench minority rule and call it “strategy.” Yet when California acts to defend itself, suddenly they call it “unfair.” That double standard isn’t just insulting, it’s un-American. Until every state plays fair, California has a duty to recognize reality and respond.

Fairness isn’t partisan, it’s patriotic. Veterans like me fought for democracy abroad because we believed it was worth defending. Now the fight is here at home.

California has always set the pace for America. On civil rights. On clean air. On consumer protections. Now it’s time to lead again by making clear that election-rigging has no home here. This isn’t about punishing politicians. It’s about protecting people. It’s about living up to our values of honor, courage, and commitment. And it’s about showing the country that democracy still belongs to the people.

The choice before us is clear: either California accepts a tilted playing field written in someone else’s statehouse, or we stand up and fight for a democracy that works for everyone. We’ve never been a state that backs down from a fight, not on civil rights, not on clean air, not on consumer protections. And we shouldn’t start now.

On Nov. 4, Californians can send a message far beyond our borders: we will defend fair play, accountability, and democracy. Because without fair play, democracy fails. Without accountability, power corrupts. Prop. 50 isn’t about rewriting the rules forever. It’s about refusing to let un-American power grabs in Texas, Missouri, or anywhere else dictate our future.

This is a one-time, mid-cycle stand forced upon us by cheaters.

Californians don’t bow to cheaters.

We fight back, and we fight fair.

“Coal is complex — there’s no single right way to deal with it,” said Sidney Gathrid ’22, the study’s lead author.
“Instead of asking only why coal plants retire, we asked how we can make retirements happen faster — and in ways that are efficient and grounded in data,” Gathrid said.
“That’s a powerful approach to a geographically diverse and politically fragmented challenge.” Their analysis found that about 28% of coal plants without retirement plans are already highly vulnerable to closure — potential “quick wins” for policymakers and advocates.
“It’s flexible, transparent and reproducible — exactly what we need to make smarter, more strategic decisions about the energy transition.” Gathrid, now a co-founder of an AI and data start-up, Krv Analytics, based in Los Angeles, said the framework’s open-source design makes it especially valuable.","Even as coal power continues its steady decline in the United States, more than a hundred plants still have no retirement plans — a gap large enough to derail national climate goals. A new study led by UC Santa Barbara researchers offers a way forward, showing how targeted, data-driven approaches could help accelerate the transition.

Published in Nature Energy, the study tackles a critical question: if market forces have already driven many coal plants to close, why are so many still running? Despite years of decline, roughly 105 gigawatts of coal capacity — representing 114 plants — are still slated to operate through 2035, even though a complete phaseout by that date is widely considered essential for meeting U.S. net-zero emissions goals.

“Coal is complex — there’s no single right way to deal with it,” said Sidney Gathrid ’22, the study’s lead author. “Our goal was to build tools that reflect that complexity, so different actors can take on different facets of the problem. There’s no one straightforward path, and we wanted to do research that represented that reality.”

Working with Grace C. Wu, an assistant professor in the Environmental Studies Program and senior author on the paper, Gathrid and his team show that reaching those goals will require policymakers to move beyond age-based or one-size-fits-all approaches — and instead focus on the specific contexts that accelerate the retirement of certain coal plants.

To do that, the researchers — including Jeremy Wayland, Stuart Wayland ‘22, and Ranjit Deshmukh, an associate professor in the Environmental Studies Program and the Bren School of Environmental Science & Management — developed a new framework combining graph theory and topological data analysis to classify the entire U.S. coal fleet into eight distinct groups based on 68 technical, economic, environmental and socio-political factors. They also introduced a “contextual retirement vulnerability” score that measures how susceptible each plant is to early retirement by comparing it to facilities that have already announced closures.

The framework goes a step further by identifying “retirement archetypes” — patterns that explain why plants in each group are retiring. These range from regulatory and health-based drivers to unfavorable economics or political pressure, offering a clear set of levers that can be applied to similar facilities elsewhere.

“Instead of asking only why coal plants retire, we asked how we can make retirements happen faster — and in ways that are efficient and grounded in data,” Gathrid said. “Our framework helps policymakers and advocates identify where they can have the biggest impact.”

The study began as Gathrid’s senior thesis in UCSB’s Environmental Studies Program, supported by the campus’s Manalis Leadership Fellowship, sponsored by Howard and Lisa Wenger, and evolved into a years-long collaboration. Wu said the project’s scope and impact are rare for undergraduate research.

“This is Ph.D.-level work,” Wu said. “It’s extremely unusual for a project that started as a senior thesis to reach this level of sophistication and impact. What’s exciting is that this framework doesn’t just describe which plants might retire — it shows how to accelerate those retirements using drivers that worked with other retired or soon-to-be retired coal plants.”

Using their model, the team grouped 198 active U.S. coal plants into clusters such as High Health Impacts Plants, Expensive Plants, and Plants in Anti-Coal Regions, each linked to specific vulnerabilities that can be targeted with policy or advocacy. For example, plants associated with high asthma rates and poor air quality could be prioritized through public-health campaigns and environmental enforcement, while those struggling financially might respond more effectively to economic incentives or market-based mechanisms.

One striking example is Belews Creek in North Carolina — a nearly 50-year-old, 2.49-gigawatt coal plant that the study categorizes as both highly vulnerable to retirement and part of Group 0: Fuel Blend Plants. The facility can burn up to 50% natural gas, yet remains one of the nation’s top particulate polluters, ranking 26th out of 198 for fine particle emissions. Financially, it’s among the most unprofitable plants in the country, carrying roughly $46 million in debt as of 2020.

Belews Creek is also located in a state seeing rapid growth in solar development and the implementation of coal debt securitization policies designed to help utilities transition away from uneconomic fossil assets. “Given the drivers for retirements in this group,” the authors noted, “advocates can leverage state and utility clean energy targets.” There were even preliminary discussions about replacing Belews Creek with a small modular nuclear reactor, but the plant’s owner, Duke Energy, has since postponed its retirement — underscoring the financial and operational complexities that the UCSB framework aims to untangle.

“We can simplify nearly 200 plants into clear groups and pair each with evidence-based strategies,” Wu said. “That’s a powerful approach to a geographically diverse and politically fragmented challenge.”

Their analysis found that about 28% of coal plants without retirement plans are already highly vulnerable to closure — potential “quick wins” for policymakers and advocates. But it also revealed that the least vulnerable plants are spread across several groups, underscoring the need for a diverse set of strategies to address the most persistent facilities.

The implications extend beyond coal. Because the model captures the multi-dimensional forces that shape real-world decisions — economics, politics, health and grid reliability — it could be adapted to other complex decarbonization challenges.

Wu, whose research focuses on sustainable energy transition planning, said the framework bridges mathematical and applied environmental science in a way that could transform how analysts and decision-makers approach energy policy.

“This work takes state-of-the-art mathematical tools and puts them into the practitioner’s toolbox,” she said. “It’s flexible, transparent and reproducible — exactly what we need to make smarter, more strategic decisions about the energy transition.”

Gathrid, now a co-founder of an AI and data start-up, Krv Analytics, based in Los Angeles, said the framework’s open-source design makes it especially valuable.

“The methods we developed are meant to be used,” he said. “Whether you’re working on coal, renewables or industrial emissions, the idea is the same — use the data you have to see where progress can happen first, and why.”",https://mediasvc.eurekalert.org/Api/v1/Multimedia/ddc7f658-3d48-4f48-81e9-3d9e48c35eb4/Rendition/thumbnail/Content/Public,N,,2025-10-25 14:03:29.367867

Many automakers and tech companies are developing ways to slash the cost of EVs, including developing fast chargers, working to avoid tariffs, and improving battery recycling possibilities. As a result, more people will access the myriad of benefits of EVs.

According to the Natural Resources Defense Council, electric cars can help you save money on routine maintenance and fuel, allowing you to maximize your savings even more.

Plus, you can charge electric cars using solar energy, which reduces charging costs. At-home chargers are also cheaper than public options.

For homeowners interested in Level 2 EV chargers, Qmerit is providing free installation estimates. Additionally, EnergySage makes it easy to find home solar panel quotes from reputable installers.

Aside from saving money, the Union of Concerned Scientists has explained that EVs release no tailpipe pollution. That's a positive, because pollution contributes to rising temperatures and poorer air quality. Not to mention, EV manufacturing has a smaller environmental impact compared to traditional vehicles, as it requires fewer resources.

Several people had interesting things to say about the company's decision.

Some people expressed confusion about the credit in the Electrek article's comments.

The 30% clean energy tax credit will end on December 31, 2025. Are you going to make your upgrades? By acting now, you could reduce your taxes, lower energy bills, and position your home for a cleaner, smarter future.

Decoding the 30% clean energy tax credit and what it means for homeowners

The clean energy credit is a federal tax credit through the Inflation Reduction Act to promote energy efficiency and sustainability in U.S. homes. Homeowners can claim 30% of the total cost (both materials and labor) of qualifying energy-saving home improvements, up to certain annual limits.

To qualify, the improvements must be made to a primary residence in the United States. Improvements made in service from January 1, 2023, through to December 31, 2025, will be eligible

According to the IRS official statement on Energy Efficient Home Improvement Credit, homeowners are eligible to be reimbursed up to $1,200 each year for the types of improvements listed above; additionally, homeowners can be reimbursed $2,000 per year for larger types of improvements, including heat pumps, biomass stoves, and water heaters.

Understanding what home upgrades can maximize your 30% clean energy tax credit

The IRS lists many home improvements that qualify for the clean energy credit, instead of decreasing your overall energy use, and enjoy better comfort:

Insulating and air sealing: Keeps homes warmer in the winter and cooler in the summer by stopping the loss of energy.

Energy-efficient doors, windows, and skylights: These features minimize drafts and keep the indoor temperature stable, reducing the workload on heating and cooling equipment.

Heating and cooling systems: High-efficiency heat pumps, furnaces, and air conditioning systems use less energy while lowering your monthly expenses.

Efficient water heaters: High-efficiency models heat water faster while using less energy, so that you can shower, do laundry, and wash dishes without interruption.

Home energy audits: Discover where you are wasting energy while receiving recommendations specific to you to optimize energy use, while benefiting from the clean energy tax credit.

If you are thinking of making the switch to renewable energy with solar panels, wind systems, like this vertical turbine redefining home energy, or battery storage, you may also be eligible for related tax credits, such as the Residential Clean Energy Credit, which would stack on top of your 30% tax credits.

What Homeowners need to know to secure the clean energy tax credit

To receive your clean energy credit, you need to have all the records in order and be aware of the timing. Always hold onto your receipts, documentation of manufacturer certifications, and Energy Star labels for the eligible items you purchased.

When filing IRS Form 5695 to compute your total credit, this is when you will have the final figures available. All items must be upgraded and “placed in service” by December 31, 2025, as projects must be completed by this date to be considered.

Common mistakes homeowners make when claiming the clean energy credit and how to avoid them

Finding innovative ways to recycle renewable energy equipment could help significantly cut costs and reduce waste, further supporting the sector’s green ambitions. There is great potential for a range of components to be reused and recycled, from solar panels to wind turbines and electric vehicle (EV) batteries. However, greater research and investment must be contributed to the sector to improve practices and make recycling options more accessible.

As interest and investment in renewable energy increase, we are seeing more technological advancements across the sector. Wind turbines have become bigger and more powerful, while solar panels have been getting cheaper and more efficient. This means that old technologies are becoming outdated more quickly, leading to their replacement. Once a renewable energy component reaches the end of its lifecycle, it is normally removed and replaced by something bigger, stronger, and better. What is done with these old components varies massively from country to country.

Often, old turbine blades or photovoltaic (PV) panels are stockpiled for long periods of time as companies decide what to do with them. Waste from the renewable energy sector is significant, with Europe expected to dismantle around 14,000 wind turbines by the end of the decade. This would result in between 40,000 and 60,000 tonnes of blade waste, according to WindEurope. Meanwhile, in the United States, wind turbine blade waste could reach anywhere between 200,000 to 370,000 tonnes a year by 2050.

Greater innovation in recycling could help reduce waste and cut costs by putting old components to good use. However, recycling old renewable energy parts is not always so simple. Steel and other materials that can be easily recycled account for around 85 to 90 percent of the makeup of a wind turbine, but the glass fibre or carbon fibre blades are much more complicated to recycle. The difficulties in recycling have not put operators off, with more innovative solutions being seen year on year. In a bid to become more sustainable, after years of discarding old blades and other components, several wind firms have pledged to invest in recycling operations to prevent old components from going to landfill.

In Scotland, old blades from the Hagshaw Hill windfarm are being recycled to provide a hybrid polymer to be used to produce precast concrete alternatives or replace virgin plastics. Meanwhile, Spanish energy firm Iberdrola aims to transform 10,000 tonnes of blade waste annually at its blade recycling facility on the Iberian Peninsula. It will use glass fibres and resins from the turbines to produce new blades to be used across a range of sectors, from aerospace to construction.

In the solar energy sector, various innovations are being seen. For example, in Brisbane, Australia, solar panels are being transformed into silver and copper. Operators are removing aluminium and wires from PVs that can no longer produce energy to grind them up into plastic, glass, silicon, silver, and copper. Pan Pacific Recycling is now processing around 30,000 panels a year and hopes to eventually increase its annual capacity to 240,000 panels.

Global solar panel waste is currently far higher than the recycling capacity for this waste, meaning that greater investment is needed in the sector to expand capacity and improve sustainability by preventing old solar panels from going to landfill. In addition, experts suggest that many of the solar panels being replaced with more efficient models are still capable of producing energy and could be reused in a different context rather than discarded. Several startups, such as Australian Second Life Solar, are working to encourage the reuse of old solar panels in alternative settings to provide clean energy and prevent unnecessary waste.

Some of the greatest advancements have been seen in EV battery recycling, as companies worldwide strive to improve their critical mineral supply chains. The lithium supply used for EV battery production is finite, meaning that once supplies are depleted, we will no longer be able to produce this type of battery. However, extracting the lithium from old EV batteries could allow EV makers to reuse the critical mineral, rather than relying wholly on mining projects for their lithium supply. Other minerals that can be extracted from these batteries include nickel, cobalt, and graphite.

Various companies from different regions of the world are now investing in expanding and improving recycling practices, although the industry’s recycling capacity still falls far behind the production of new wind turbine blades and solar panels, suggesting that greater funding is needed to accelerate the global component recycling capacity. In addition, governments could encourage companies to invest in recycling activities by introducing stricter rules and regulations on renewable energy waste, thereby helping the industry to become more sustainable.

What is energy security, and how does it relate to AI?

""It is making sure there is enough energy in the world to help enable and support our allies,"" said Pullin. ""But then an even broader, bigger context is making sure there's secure energy for humanity.""

She said energy security also applies to making sure companies like Google and Meta have the power they need to take advantage of artificial intelligence.

""Some of it's life and death, literal. And the other side of it is prosper, growth, and innovate, and keep the United States leading in this area,"" she said.

Is the HAMM Institute working on solutions to help fix the disparity of energy poverty globally?

Pullin said that ending energy poverty is at the heart of what they do.

""When you still have people that don't have access to electricity ... then that's a real problem, and so you have to solve that first, ""she said. ""We're not going to get there and be able to solve that unless we keep putting affordable and reliable energy at the front. of the argument in regard to energy policy. That has to happen, because when we can do that here locally and federally within our own country, that allows us to do more.""

How much are are local regulations affecting energy reform?

She said permitting reform is a key part of the solution.

""It is such a significant issue when you have an inconsistent policy, which is what we have seen over the past three decades in the United States, honestly. You see oil and gas come in favor, then out of favor. You see nuclear in favor, then out of favor. You see renewables in favor and then out of favor. And when you have that kind of inconsistency, the capital investment gets scared, and they're not willing to take that risk,"" said Pullin. ""Unless there is permitting reform, ? It means that there are laws in place that can help industry be able to do this in a way that's efficient and affordable and reliable to the consumer. What we will see, the risk of not getting the permitting correct, will be an increase in energy costs for the consumer.

“Nuclear energy is actually the backbone of Ontario's energy generation sector,” said Albis.
“It shows just how multigenerational nuclear power plants are,” he said.
Earlier this year, the Ford government greenlit Ontario Power Generation to start construction on the first SMR.
The Darlington New Nuclear Project was on Prime Minister Carney’s list of projects deemed to be in the national interest and therefore worthy of fast-tracking.","For as long as he can remember, Carter Albis has been fascinated by nuclear energy.

""I grew up right next to Pickering Nuclear. I used to play on the beach, like right next to the plant a lot,” he said. “When you're that age, it's this cool, mysterious building. That's where it started for me.”

That fascination led him to apply to Ontario Tech University’s nuclear engineering program, not far from which sits the Darlington Nuclear Station in Bowmanville.

Now it’s there, where the first-year student sees a radiant future for his career.

“Nuclear energy is actually the backbone of Ontario's energy generation sector,” said Albis. “There's no shortage of opportunity.""

On Thursday, Ontario and the federal governments announced a combined spending commitment of $3 billion to build Canada’s first small modular reactors (SMRs), a new nuclear energy technology to be built next door to the Darlington power plant.

The project is projected to bring 18,000 construction jobs to the region and sustain 3,700 energy jobs annually over 65 years.

“It shows just how multigenerational nuclear power plants are,” he said. “Many of the nuclear plants that are in projects that are being built right now, they'll continue to produce energy past 2100. That's a long time.”

Trickle-down effect expected to boost other sectors

The SMRs will inject $500 million annually into the Canadian supply chain, according to the prime minister, while construction, operation and maintenance of the four units will add more than $38 billion to Canada’s GDP over the next 65 years.

Earlier this year, the Ford government greenlit Ontario Power Generation to start construction on the first SMR. The total project cost was announced at the time as costing $20.9 billion, with the estimated construction cost of the initial reactor being $7.7 billion.

While construction is still in its infancy, local businesses are already reaping the rewards, according to Bonnie Wrightman, Clarington's board of trade executive director.

“We have connected quite a few businesses to vendors who are serving the project and working with our local businesses already,” Wrightman said. “ The economic impact is actually being felt right now.”

Wrightman described the scale of the project as one of the largest Clarington has ever seen. She said the trickle-down effect will boost numerous sectors throughout the region.

In a briefing earlier this year, officials with Ontario's Ministry of Energy and Mines told reporters roughly 80 per cent of the SMR project spending will go to Ontario companies.

“It puts us in a great position to keep supporting the nuclear file,” Wrightman added.

Clarington on a global stage

The technology is expected to be the first of its kind built within the G7.

The Darlington New Nuclear Project was on Prime Minister Carney’s list of projects deemed to be in the national interest and therefore worthy of fast-tracking.

Clarington Mayor Adrian Foster touted the project as a way to put the municipality on the map.

“The world is at our doorstep. They are coming through, they're paying attention,” said Foster. “There's a huge amount of international interest in this.”

Foster said the project holds the potential to provide relief among U.S. tariffs and economic uncertainty.

He pointed to struggling sectors, like Canada’s automotive industry, suggesting that workers could retrain to help steer the SMR project to completion.

“Those skill sets are more closely aligned than you would expect,” he added. “I think we can build a really, really interesting workforce, maybe more quickly than we thought.”

Foster said post-secondary institutions will have a vital role to play in filling out the positions created by the Darlington project.

Steven Murphy, the president of Ontario Tech University, knows that all too well.

Right now, he said post-secondaries across the country are working together to create pathways for future generations to enter into the nuclear field.

“That involves a lot of skilled trades like millwrights, welders, many others that are in short supply,” Murphy told CBC News. “If we are going to have this great build out as a nation, we're going to need all of us (post-secondaries) to be very coordinated.”

The first of four SMRs is expected to come online in 2030, according to the province.

When completed, the four SMRs is expected to produce 1,200 megawatts of electricity, or enough to power 1.2 million homes, according to officials.","https://i.cbc.ca/ais/1.7234294,1718308387000/full/max/0/default.jpg?im=Crop%2Crect%3D%280%2C0%2C5280%2C2970%29%3BResize%3D620",N,,2025-10-25 13:19:03.367234

“Competition chili is a little bit stronger, a little saltier, a little spicier,” says Maricle, a member of GVEC.
She dabbled in chili cooking on a lark, and now—with the help of her “chili family”—she’s a state champion.","Texans know: Chili is so much more than just a bowl of red.

That wasn’t always the case for Teena Friedel—not many years ago, when she worked for the city of Irving and was tasked with spicing up a city festival.

“I started trying to think of ways to make a festival more fun,” she says, “and one of the things I found was something called a chili cook-off, not knowing what that entails.”

Friedel joined her local pod of the Chili Appreciation Society International to learn the rules and process of a sanctioned competition. After her 2006 event, she remained part of the chapter but was reluctant to get more involved. “They asked me if I wanted to cook, and I did not want to do it,” she says.

After much cajoling and a crash course in cooking chili, she was finally persuaded to compete.

“I made the final table that first day and placed second in showmanship,” Friedel says. She was hooked. “I said, ‘Oh, honey, if I’m cooking chili, I’m going all in.’ ”

The community embraced her.

“If I needed anything, somebody gave it to me, and seeing how much fun everybody had, and part of your entry fee went to charity, and that feels really good.”

In the birthplace of chili, the official state dish comes with a storied history that represents Texas’ bold, rich culture. CASI, one of three standard-bearers for chili cook-offs in the state, hosts hundreds of competitions annually across the continent, raising $729,000 for charity during the last full fiscal year. But none of those events have the vibrance, camaraderie and history of the Texas Ladies’ State Chili Championship Cook-Off.

It’s as much about Texas hospitality as it is secret spice mixtures, and it’s a testament to the power of women in a traditionally male-dominated domain and the close-knit bonds that good food fosters.

The TLSCCO holds a unique place in chili history. The event was created in direct response to the 1970 formation of the Chilympiad, a famous San Marcos cook-off that barred women. In response, legendary rancher and humorist Hondo Crouch offered up Luckenbach, the town he owned near Fredericksburg, for a separate cook-off in 1971 called Hell Hath No Fury Like a Woman Scorned. It was for women only. And it was an instant hit.

The event evolved over the years to support more entrants and found its footing in Seguin, about 35 miles east of San Antonio, in 1991 as the second-largest chili cook-off in Texas, just behind the distinguished Terlingua International Chili Championship. While it’s no longer the second-largest, the women’s competition is still a qualifier for Terlingua, meaning winners gain immediate entry to the most prestigious cook-off of the year.

Heating Up

On a warm April day at Max Starcke Park in Seguin, there’s a huge spread of cars, campers and tents, all in residence for the TLSCCO weekend. A flag with the CASI logo flies above the proceedings, centered around a covered pavilion in a grove of pecan and sycamore trees along the Guadalupe River.

With 135 cooks, the competition is fierce but also clearly fun. Tents, tablecloths, T-shirts and décor are in bright pinks, purples and yellows. Previous champions stroll around wearing tiaras and bright sashes. Men, working behind the scenes, wear pink polos. Everywhere is the sound of women laughing.

Under the pavilion, the junior competition is already underway, with four girls ages 7–15 tending their pots in front of the main stage. Last year’s junior champion, Reese Satsky of Friendswood, is back, wearing her crown.

At the appointed hour, they parade their chili through a glitter-speckled purple arch to the turn-in table, reminiscent of a beauty pageant victory lap.

Outside the pavilion, the adult competition is just getting started. Cooks can begin their chili anytime but most plan a three-hour cook for the 1 p.m. turn-in time, when all competitors must present their chili to judges in 32-ounce plastic foam cups, marked only with ID numbers for anonymity. The visiting and socializing quiet down as the burners are lit.

“A lot of people think if you go to a cook-off, it’s just, you know, a free-for-all,” says Beverly Maricle, the cook-off’s board president. “We do party. We do have a good time but take what we do very seriously. After chili is turned in, or during the resting period, then you walk around and you visit with everybody, but when you’re cooking, you’re cooking. It is a competition.”

René Chapa of Grand Prairie, the 2023 chili world champion and 2014 ladies state champion, is among this year’s top competitors, browning her meat on a custom-painted camping stove under a purple awning with six other cooks, including her mom, Beth Baxter. All are dressed in pink shirts that read, “Spread Kindness.”

“Everybody does their own things a little bit differently,” Chapa says. “And so, you know, I’ll tweak it here and there. She tweaks hers here and there.”

While traditional Texas chili consists of beef (usually cuts of stew meat) cooked low and slow with a blend of peppers, garlic and onions, competition chili is more concentrated.

“This chili is not like a Wolf Brand Chili. You’re not going to sit there and eat a whole bowl; it’s very spicy,” Chapa says. “We’ve got five, six chili powders in here.”

Stew meat is left behind in favor of chili ground beef, and any vegetables are blended to create a gravy. Judges taste a single spoonful of each chili before recording a score, so each bite needs to pack a consistent punch.

“Competition chili is a little bit stronger, a little saltier, a little spicier,” says Maricle, a member of GVEC. “You want a little back bite, but if the tears are running down your face, your pot’s too hot.”

Each entry is judged based on five factors: aroma, color, consistency, taste and aftertaste. At the end of each round of judging, half the entries advance and the tasting begins anew.

Pat Krenek, 2001 and 2003 ladies state champion, has been coming to the competition since the Luckenbach days.

“You have to start out with a decent recipe,” she says. “You crank it up, put it in that cup, turn it in and wish for the best. Once you cook your pot, it’s out of your hands.”

Krenek loves the atmosphere of the event. “This is just a relaxing time. It’s not a beauty contest, so you don’t have to dress up or do your hair and makeup,” she says. “And the men are the ones working.”

Cooking Down

Stoves get turned off during the chili’s resting period as the spices work their magic. And then there’s a last-minute crush of activity before the mad rush to the turn-in table.

At Chapa’s tent, a band of visiting competitors brings out a tray of Jell-O shots, and everyone toasts to each other’s good luck. Some go back for seconds.

About 10 minutes before turn-in time, Chapa primes her entry cup by pouring in a spoonful of chili and swishing it around the edges, coating the cup in a familiar red color. Precoating the cup takes some of the plastic foam smell away, giving the aroma the best chance of scoring high.

At its core, this is a competition, but it’s also about the experience. For the participants, it’s a chance to show off their skills and gain recognition but also to nurture the bonds of a supportive statewide community.

Jeff Bauer, a CASI board member from Pinehurst, is sitting in the shade as his daughter Madalynn Bauer, 18, is cooking in the adult division for the first time. “At barbecue cook-offs, nobody will help you. It’s all about me, me, me, me, me,” Jeff says. “But chili cooks, they’ll help you.”

He competed for years on the barbecue trail before finding the chili circuit.

“It got to the point to where I was spending almost $800, $900, $1,000 a weekend at barbecue competitions,” he says, “and without sponsorship, there’s no way an average Joe can do that.”

Crowning Moment

For judging, hundreds of people—including members of the public—are divided among tasting tables.

“We like to have a minimum of 200,” Maricle says. On this day, some parks employees and litter cleanup crews have been recruited. The mayor of Seguin, Donna Dodgen; city employees; and longtime chili judges line the final table to determine the winners.

The main stage features custom purple camp chairs, part of the award booty for the top 20 cooks.

After the final tastings, the pavilion overflows with competitors, their supporters and curious onlookers. The winners are announced from 20th place to first by the entry numbers on their cups. Sharp cries and shouts of excitement rise up as winners emerge from the crowd, accept hugs from friends and then are escorted on stage.

Beth Baxter’s number is called as 20th place, and she takes a seat in her camp chair. As she’s handed a chilled glass of champagne, the number of her daughter, René Chapa, is called as 19th place, and the two women reunite on stage with laughter and hugs.

The camp chairs are almost full as the reserve champion’s number is called. A proud Jeff Bauer lets out a whoop of joy and spins his daughter Madalynn around. As the runner-up, she will head to Terlingua after her first year of competition.

When the championship announcement comes, Friedel looks radiant as she rises from the crowd. It takes her a few minutes to make her way to the stage, slowed down by all the hugs she receives along the way.

She’s crowned by last year’s winner and handed a bouquet of yellow roses and a large trophy, which she will carry around to competitions until next year’s winner is declared. She dabbled in chili cooking on a lark, and now—with the help of her “chili family”—she’s a state champion.

“I already knew it was going to be me,” she says later. “It was really weird, I just knew I was going to go get that crown.”",https://texascooppower.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/chili-cookoff-11783-og.jpg,N,,2025-10-25 14:19:35.679793

Dear Charlie,

I read with interest your discussion of the grid as the bottleneck for AI development in the United States. But aren't you assuming that AI will not be the bust that many people now think it may be? What if AI turns out to be an overhyped loser? Then won't China have won a race that was never run?

Appreciate you reading the piece. And fair question. You're asking if I'm betting the farm on AI turning out to be the next internet instead of the next Pets.com.

Short answer: I don't care if AI is overhyped. Here's why: electricity infrastructure isn't an AI bet. It's a civilization bet.

Whether AI cures cancer or just gets really good at writing bad poetry, we still need to power data centers, charge electric vehicles, run manufacturing plants, and keep the lights on while everyone streams Netflix. The grid is failing now. Texas nearly froze to death because their power grid has the reliability of a 1987 Yugo. California had to schedule blackouts like they're yoga classes.

AI might be the excuse we're using to finally fix infrastructure we should've upgraded 30 years ago. If that makes me a sucker, fine. At least I'm a sucker who can turn on the air conditioning in August.

As for China ""winning a race that was never run,"" that's the wrong metaphor. China is building power infrastructure because they're smart enough to know that electricity is what separates civilization from camping. If AI turns out to be garbage, they'll still have functional power plants and we'll still be arguing about whether windmills cause cancer.

The Romans built aqueducts because they thought the gods demanded clean water. Turns out the gods didn't exist, but the aqueducts still worked. Sometimes the right infrastructure for the wrong reasons beats no infrastructure at all.

Besides, even if AI is 90% hype, that remaining 10% still needs a ton of electricity.

Betting on voltage over vaporware,

Charlie

P.S. - If you're right and AI is a complete bust, at least I'll be able to say I invested in companies that make actual things instead of tokens that represent someone's dream of making money by selling tokens to other people.

Dear Charlie,

Here's two interesting points that one may consider: First, one should look at how much coal China is actually using versus how many mines/plants it may have. Second, the U.S. has many more nuclear reactors than does China.

W.L.

Dear W.L.,

You're right on both counts. China's 3,100 coal plants run at 50% utilization, so they're only burning coal at seven times our rate. And we have 94 nuclear reactors versus their 58.

Here's what those numbers actually mean:

Our 94 reactors are an average of 42 years old. The oldest went online in 1969 - the year the U.S. landed on the moon. It's still running. America built its first new reactors in 30 years at Vogtle, in Georgia. Two of them. Took a more than decade; cost more than double.

China's reactors are mostly under 20 years old. They're building Generation III, Generation IV - China opened the world's first commercial Gen IV reactor in 2023. They have 28 under construction and last April approved 10 more.

The U.S.? America approved reopening Three Mile Island - the one that melted down in 1979.

The U.S. has more nuclear reactors than China. It's like having the world's largest collection of rotary phones while the other guy's building cell towers.

So yes, the U.S. has more nuclear reactors than China. It's like having the world's largest collection of rotary phones while the other guy's building cell towers.

On coal - China built so much infrastructure they can run it at half-speed and still burn seven times more than America does. That's not inefficiency. That's having options. The U.S. is running its 240 plants into the ground because that's all there is.

You're right. America is ahead on 50-year-old technology. China is ahead on everything built in this century.

May the best infrastructure win.

Charlie

P.S. - Nothing says ""global superpower"" quite like bragging that your energy infrastructure predates the invention of the VCR. The U.S. is not falling behind China; it's been behind since China figured out that concrete doesn't need congressional approval.

Dear Charlie,

Radicalization within the political arena is not really good for infrastructures. The energy shortage and infrastructures' extreme decay were both obvious for some time. And now the U.S. government is shut down.

Reality will hit the earth soon. Most will call this a crash.

Pierre

Dear Pierre,

Political radicalization is terrible for infrastructure. So is government dysfunction, regulatory paralysis, and the fact that Congress couldn't organize a two-car parade.

The energy shortage and grid decay in the U.S. have been obvious for 15 years. Nobody fixed it because cutting ribbons on transformer stations doesn't win elections.

Here's what happens next: Reality doesn't care about your political dysfunction. Data centers still need power. AI doesn't run on bipartisan cooperation.

Which means someone builds the infrastructure anyway.

That someone is private capital. Blackstone (BX) deployed $25 billion in 90 days. Microsoft (MSFT) is building power plants. Utilities being upgraded before the grid collapses during an earnings call.

You're right - most people will call this a crash when reality hits. I'm calling it the biggest infrastructure spending cycle in American history, happening whether Washington functions or not. The 10 companies that deliver transformers, cables, and grid systems get paid regardless of which party controls Congress.

Chaos is expensive. Someone profits from fixing it.

Yours in profitable dysfunction,

Charlie

P.S. - The beautiful thing about infrastructure investment is that it doesn't require optimism about government - only pessimism about its alternatives. When the choice is between Congress fixing the grid and Blackstone doing it for 12% returns, bet on greed every time. At least greed shows up for work.

Dear Charlie,

I'm a mother of three and a CPA. I manage our family's investments conservatively - index funds, some bonds; nothing crazy.

You're telling me to bet on American infrastructure when I can't even get the pothole on my street fixed after two years of complaints? When the school needs a new HVAC system but the city says there's no budget?

I get your thesis about China building while America argues. But you're asking me to invest in the same incompetence that can't maintain what we already have. Why would companies suddenly build transmission lines when municipalities can't even patch roads?

My husband says I'm too pessimistic. But I'm the one who balances our checkbook.

Jennifer

Dear Jennifer,

You balance the family checkbook. That makes you more qualified than 90% of Congress.

You're asking why companies would suddenly build transmission lines when your city can't fix a pothole. Great question. Here's the answer: because Microsoft needs power and your city council doesn't.

The pothole stays because fixing it requires a municipal bond issue, three committee hearings and a contractor whose brother-in-law knows a guy. Nobody profits enough to care.

The transmission line gets built because Blackstone deployed $25 billion and they'd like $28 billion back. When private capital wants something, it generally gets it. When public works want something, they schedule another hearing.

You're not betting on American competence. You're betting on American desperation. Your skepticism is healthy. Index funds are smart. But sometimes the boring infrastructure stocks ARE the index, just concentrated enough to actually benefit when the thing finally happens.

May your portfolio outperform your municipality,

Charlie

P.S. - Your city can't fix the pothole because there's no profit in asphalt and nobody gets fired for ignoring it. Blackstone will build the transmission line because there's 30% IRR in electrons and someone absolutely gets fired if they don't.

Dear Charlie:

The squirrel fires remark had me rolling on the floor. Made my day!!

Violet

Dear Violet,

Glad the squirrel barbecue gave you a laugh. Though honestly, with the way our grid's running, we might want to start collecting recipes now while we still have internet access to look them up.

Thanks for reading.

Charlie

P.S. - If you're near a squirrel when reading this, maintain eye contact. Show no fear. They can smell weakness.

“A truly just transition must put people and safety first — not profits or politics.” Author: Bryan Groenendaal","Calls grow for government to abandon oil, gas and nuclear projects seen as threats to a just energy transition.

With just weeks to go before the COP30 climate summit in Brazil, South African faith and community leaders are calling on government to abandon what they describe as “high-risk and outdated” energy projects that could derail the country’s Just Energy Transition (JET).

The Southern African Faith Communities’ Environment Institute (SAFCEI) has warned that expanding oil, gas, and nuclear investments risks locking the country into decades of inequality and fossil fuel dependence. The appeal comes amid mounting controversy over offshore exploration projects, Eskom’s proposal to extend the operating life of the Koeberg Nuclear Power Station’s Unit 2, and indications that the government’s draft Integrated Resource Plan (IRP) could include additional nuclear capacity.

“South Africa stands at a crossroads,” said SAFCEI energy justice coordinator Ntombizodidi Mapapu. “Offshore oil and gas expansion and new nuclear investments are costly distractions from real solutions. Communities across the country are saying clearly: we cannot keep betting on energy options that harm our people, pollute our environment and delay a just transition.”

Communities Mobilise Through “No Faith in False Solutions” Campaign

Through its No Faith in False Solutions campaign, SAFCEI is training 45 faith and community leaders nationwide to strengthen grassroots advocacy, engage in public consultations, and push for cleaner, community-centred energy alternatives.

Among them is Hilary Swartz, a business and faith representative from Atlantis, who attended a recent National Nuclear Regulator (NNR) hearing on the proposed extension of Koeberg’s licence.

“As someone representing both business and faith-based groups in Atlantis, I’m deeply concerned about the safety and evacuation risks,” said Swartz. “Our community lives next to the plant — we’d be the first affected if anything went wrong. There’s no clear evacuation plan, and many people lack the resources to relocate in an emergency. That’s unacceptable.”

Swartz added that extending Koeberg’s lifespan could undermine local economic stability. “If an accident occurred, the consequences for our economy, environment and families would be catastrophic. Government should be investing in renewable energy that creates jobs and protects communities, not clinging to outdated technologies. Nuclear is a false solution — it doesn’t belong in South Africa’s just transition.”

Safety and Transparency Concerns Around Koeberg and Vaalputs

Nearby, faith leader Wiedaad Davids, chairperson of West Coast Faith Solutions in Saldanha Bay, echoed safety concerns.

“At almost 40 years old, is Koeberg really in a safe enough condition? The public deserves evidence that this plant meets all safety requirements before any extension is approved,” Davids said. “Decisions that could have far-reaching impacts for our communities are being made without considering the real dangers to ordinary South Africans.”

In the Northern Cape, Justin Montzinger from Port Nolloth raised alarm over the long-term management of nuclear waste at the Vaalputs storage site.

“Our communities have lived near Vaalputs for years, yet most of us have never been properly informed about the safety measures or long-term plans,” Montzinger said. “People deserve clear information about what makes radioactive waste dangerous and how it’s handled — especially if Koeberg’s operation is to be extended for another two decades.”

Offshore Oil and Gas Projects Also Under Fire

Along South Africa’s coastline, fisher and faith communities are raising similar concerns about offshore oil and gas exploration, which they say threatens marine life, fisheries, and livelihoods.

Deborah De Wee, a small-scale fisher and faith leader from Doringbaai, said the government’s push for fossil fuel expansion ignores the lived realities of coastal people.

“Offshore drilling and nuclear expansion harm our environment and our health. For coastal communities, climate change and pollution are already real,” she said. “Government must support clean energy that protects our oceans and sustains our way of life.”

Davids added that many coastal communities have been sidelined in consultation processes.

“No oil company can guarantee there won’t be spills or accidents, yet we’re expected to risk the ocean that feeds and sustains us,” she said. “Future generations have the right to inherit clean seas and safe livelihoods — not more pollution and inequality.”

Montzinger said the wave of proposed offshore projects along the coastline has left many feeling unheard — but that’s starting to change.

“It feels as though risky projects are being imposed on our communities with little consultation. But through SAFCEI’s campaign, people are learning their rights and refusing to be spectators in decisions that affect their lives,” he said. “A truly just transition must put people and safety first — not profits or politics.”

Santee Cooper’s governing board voted unanimously Friday to allow the power company’s management team to officially begin negotiating with Brookfield Asset Management on an agreement to restart construction of the failed expansion project at the V.C. Summer nuclear plant in Fairfield County.

Brookfield, which boasts a $1 trillion global investment portfolio, was among more than 70 companies to express interest after Santee Cooper put a call out nine months ago. It was a partner on one of 15 proposals Santee Cooper ultimately reviewed.

Negotiations will continue over the next six weeks, CEO Jimmy Staton said. Santee Cooper will name the other partners on the project at a later date.

Santee Cooper did not make public the potential terms of the deal, expected to be valued in the billions.

But Staton said Santee Cooper would use any cash proceeds it may earn from the agreement to pay down debts still owed on the abandoned nuclear facility. Customers could also benefit from the power the reactors would produce if finished.

“I feel pretty confident that our customers will realize some fairly significant value, both rates wise and otherwise, in this process,” Staton said.

Santee Cooper and the now defunct South Carolina Electric & Gas started construction on the two first-of-their-kind nuclear reactors alongside an existing unit near rural Jenkinsville in early 2013. But the project was riddled with delays, cost overruns and fraud that led to multiple federal convictions of former executives.

Final executive punished for VC Summer failure to spend at least 10 months in prison

The utilities abandoned the plant’s expansion in 2017, but not before jointly spending $9 billion on the reactors that never produced a single megawatt.

Santee Cooper’s share of the debt was $3.6 billion, which customer continue to pay for on their monthly bills. Those payments could continue, in part or in full, through 2032, depending how much money Santee Cooper can secure for a buy down in any final deal with Brookfield.

If the two companies manage to ink a contract, Staton pledged that Santee Cooper customers will face no new costs associated with the project. All of that will be borne by Brookfield, as well as big tech companies, such as Google or Meta, that could buy the nuclear power a finished plant would generate.

“We’ve protected the rate payers of South Carolina, and quite frankly, I think we’ve shifted the paradigm of how nuclear energy gets built here in the United States,” Staton said.

After the firms mothballed the reactors eight years ago, SCE&G’s parent company, SCANA, collapsed. The reactors’ designer, Westinghouse, spiraled into bankruptcy.

Virginia-headquartered Dominion Energy bought up SCANA.

Dominion is not part of the deal, so it won’t at all pay down debt saddled to its 800,000 South Carolina customers. They’ll continue to pay over the next 14 years for $2.3 billion worth of debt from the abandoned expansion.

Here’s how much SC power customers are still paying for a failed nuclear project

And it was Santee Cooper’s potential new partner, Brookfield, that took over Westinghouse in 2018.

To restart construction, Santee Cooper and Brookfield will need to find a construction firm. Westinghouse, which remains a part of Brookfield’s investment portfolio, won’t be the builder this time, Staton said.

It will take a year or more of due diligence, licensing and permitting before any construction on the inactive plants can restart, Staton added.

Among the funds Brookfield manages is a portfolio focused on clean energy and decarbonization. Earlier this month, the firm announced it had raised $20 billion for the effort.

The move to restart V.C. Summer follows calls by Gov. Henry McMaster earlier this year for a “nuclear power renaissance” in the state.

Sen. Graham on SC’s proposed nuclear reboot: ‘We’re going to finish these reactors’

And U.S. Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina has vowed his support for the effort, which will ultimately have to make its way through the federal regulatory process.

Staton also pointed to a May executive order signed by President Donald Trump, which calls on the Department of Energy to prioritize approvals for 10 large-scale nuclear reactors under construction by 2030.

“South Carolina is going to have number one and number two in that process,” Staton said. “You have placed South Carolina in the epicenter of the resurgence of nuclear in the United States.”

Still, nuclear power projects are expensive and take years to complete.

Vogtle Electric Generating Plant, operated by Southern Co. in Georgia, started construction around the same time as V.C. Summer. Work on the expansion wrapped up last year. Today the site is the nation’s largest nuclear plant, with four reactors.

But adding the two newest reactors cost more than $30 billion, more than twice the initial estimates.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/IMG_2264-2048x1411.jpg,N,,2025-10-25 15:18:42.962521

A new climate report from Ember brings good news

State governments have broad discretion over their energy policy, while some are prioritizing emissions reduction, others remain heavily dependent on fossil fuels.

Currently, Kentucky does not stand out as a leader in the transition to clean energy.

Also: 2 Dividend Legends to Hold Forever

A new report from the climate think-tank Ember reveals that in the first half of 2025 the world’s wind and solar farms generated more electricity than coal plants for the first time. Solar output surged nearly 30% year-on-year and met 83% of global electricity demand growth. China and India led the transition, helping drive a drop in fossil-fuel use. Unfortunately, slower renewables growth and rising demand still pushed up coal and gas generation in the U.S. and Europe.

The United States is one of the heaviest polluters in the world, and electric power generation is one of America’s heaviest polluting sectors. According to the Environmental Protection Agency, the U.S. emitted over 6.3 billion metric tons of harmful greenhouse gasses in 2022, more than every other country except China — and 25% of those emissions were created by electricity production.

With climate change emerging as a leading global threat, many countries are taking action to reduce emissions. In the United States, Biden had previously set a goal of achieving a 100% emissions-free power grid by 2035 — largely by cutting U.S. dependence on dirty power sources, like coal, and increasing our reliance on clean, renewable sources. (Here is a look at 11 American companies on the cutting edge of renewable technology.)

In the continuation of a longer-term trend, the amount of electricity produced in coal-fired power plants has fallen by over 57% in the United States over the last 10 years, from 1.6 billion megawatt-hours in 2014 to 675.1 million megawatt-hours in 2023. Over the same period, electricity production from wind and solar farms nearly tripled, from 199.3 million megawatt-hours to 586.7 megawatt-hours. The shift has had a meaningful impact, as emissions from electric power generation have fallen by nearly 24% in the U.S. since 2014, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.

The federal government has a long way to go to achieve its ambitious energy goals, and doing so will require the cooperation of states. Every state has its own climate, geography, and natural resources — as well as broad authority over energy policy. Given these variables, some states are doing far more to reduce the climate impact of their power grid than others. (Here is a look at the states where carbon emissions are skyrocketing.)

Among the 50 states, Kentucky stands out for its continued dependence on coal. Nationwide, coal accounts for only about 16% of electricity production and over half of all harmful gas emissions from the electric power sector.

Kentucky is the fifth largest coal-producing state in the country, and partially as a result, the state is one of only a handful nationwide where coal-fired plants account for over half of all electricity production. About 69% of the 63.2 million megawatt-hours of energy produced in Kentucky in 2023 came from coal-fired plants. Additionally, nearly 86% of the state’s 47.2 million metric tons in harmful power grid emissions in 2022 were created by coal.

This is how Kentucky generates electricity — and how much pollution its power grid produces. Electricity output is measured in megawatt-hours and harmful gas emissions are measured in metric tons. For context, a single megawatt-hour is enough to power an average American home for just over a month, and a metric ton is equal to about 2,205 pounds. All data is from the EIA.

This post was updated on October 25, 2025 to include news of Embers’ recent climate report.

Why It Matters

Electricity production is one of the heaviest polluting sectors in the United States. As demand for electricity continues to rise, much of the country is transitioning away from fossil fuels and toward clean and renewable energy sources to meet the Biden Administration’s climate change mitigation goals. Like many other resource rich states, Kentucky continues to rely heavily on fossil-fuels — particularly coal.

Energy Secretary Chris Wright sent the proposal to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) that he hopes will accelerate the connection of data centers to the grid, according to a department press release.

Data centers use a large amount of power and in some cases, are expected to raise electricity prices.

Wright’s rule particularly seems to favor centers that come with their own “dispatchable” power sources — allowing such facilities to have their studies “expedited.”

It’s not entirely clear how dispatchable is defined, but it often refers to fossil fuel and nuclear plants that can be turned on and off at will. It may also refer to renewables if they come with batteries that can store the power they produce.

Under law, the secretary is able to send proposals to the independent commission, but it will ultimately be up to FERC whether to go through with it. Currently, the five-member panel has two Democrats and two Republicans. A third Republican was recently confirmed by the Senate but has not yet been sworn in.

“To usher in a new era of American prosperity, we must ensure all Americans and domestic industries have access to affordable, reliable, and secure electricity,” Wright said in a letter to the commission. “To do this, large loads, including AI data centers, served by public utilities must be able to connect to the transmission system in a timely, orderly, and non-discriminatory manner. This is an urgent issue that requires prompt attention.”

Original story

Marion County Circuit Court Judge Matthew S. Delligatti issued a temporary restraining order Friday against the sale of the John Manchin Sr. Health Care Center in Fairmont to Marx Development Group. The order names Gov. Patrick Morrisey and Secretary Michael Caruso of the WV Department of Health Facilities, in their official capacities.

In August, Morrisey announced plans to sell Hopemont Hospital in Terra Alta, Jackie Withrow Hospital in Raleigh County, John Manchin Sr. Health Care Center in Fairmont and Lakin Hospital in Mason County by the end of September.

At the time of the announcement, Morrisey said the hospitals are licensed for 511 beds, although not all of them are currently in use.

“Marx Development Group, or MDG, has agreed to purchase these assets from the state of West Virginia for $60 billion,” Morrisey said. “And in addition, as part of the deal, MDG has also agreed that it would be investing in West Virginia to construct new facilities.”

Morrisey said the sale will help the state avoid an estimated $100 million in costs to renovate the buildings and that the four facilities have been operating at a $6 million annual loss.

As a private attorney, Sen. Joey Garcia, D-Marion, filed a motion to stop the sale on behalf of his client Mary Devito, a resident of the facility. Garcia indicated he planned to file a suit at the end of August. Plaintiffs must give 30 days notice before suing the state.

Garcia indicated he would not be making statements because of the pending litigation but in August he told West Virginia Public Broadcasting “My client and other residents have many concerns but very little information other than a potential sales deadline of Sept. 30, 2025. The only way to protect the residents of John Manchin Sr. now is to fight this in court.”

A hearing has been scheduled for Tuesday, Oct. 28, 2025, at 3:30 p.m. in the Circuit Court of Marion County.

Government incentives under the Inflation Reduction Act are still available to help cover the cost of a replacement, as outlined by the U.S. Department of Energy. However, many of these programs close at the end of 2025, so you need to act fast if you don't want to miss your chance.

If you are considering a stove upgrade, there's no better option than an induction cooktop.

Induction uses electricity to generate a magnetic field that heats up only the correct type of metal pans — not the stovetop itself or anything else you set on it that isn't made of magnetic metal. This helps minimize burns, in addition to avoiding the fumes from a gas stove. On top of all that, induction stoves heat up faster and boil water faster!

If you're interested in induction, you can get up to $840 off the cost of installing a new range. If it's still outside your price range or you want to try cooking with induction before you commit, you can get an affordable countertop burner, which start as low as $50.

If you do decide to install a full-sized induction stove, the Department of Energy has explained how to claim your rebate for the purchase.

First, check that the appliance you have selected qualifies for the program. If you make any upgrades to support the installation that are eligible for tax credits under the Inflation Reduction Act, make sure the installation is completed before the applicable period ends. Then, when filing your taxes for this year, use IRS Form 5695 to claim your tax credit.

Assuming you followed the guidelines, that amount will be subtracted from your taxes, so you will either owe a smaller amount or receive a larger refund — and in the meantime, you can enjoy the lower bills every time you cook.",https://www.thecooldown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Kitchen-5.jpg,N,,2025-10-25 12:08:21.476600

(AP) — Michigan is demanding millions of dollars in incentives back from a Chinese company after plans to build an electric vehicle battery plant collapsed following years of pushback against the project from neighbors and members of Congress.

Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer supported the $2.36 billion factory in 2022, and state lawmakers approved nearly $175 million in incentives for the project. The state is now holding Gotion Inc. in default of $23.6 million, accusing the company of abandoning the project.

“While this is not the outcome we hoped for, we recognize the tremendous responsibility we have to the people we serve to make sure their hard-earned tax dollars are spent wisely and appropriately,” Danielle Emerson, a spokesperson with the Michigan Economic Development Corporation, said in a statement.

Representatives for Gotion, which is headquartered in California, did not respond to multiple messages seeking comment.

In a letter dated Sept. 17, Michigan informed Gotion that it was in default of economic development grant obligations because no “eligible activities” had occurred on the site’s property in over 120 days.

According to the MEDC, the state is seeking to claw back $23.6 million that was disbursed toward the purchase of the site’s land near Big Rapids, about 200 miles northwest of Detroit. $26.4 million remaining from the grant that was not spent will be returned to the state, Emerson said. Citing a lack of progress on the project, a different $125 million grant was not distributed to Gotion.

The news was first reported by Crain’s Detroit Business.

The state also said two project-related lawsuits are imposing a “material adverse effect” on its progress, which counts as grounds for default. The letter said that if the defaults are not resolved in 30 days, the state expects repayment of $23.6 million. That deadline passed Oct. 17.

Residents of nearby Green Township so firmly opposed the project, some over environmental concerns, that voters in 2023 recalled five local elected officials who supported bringing the factory to the area.

Auto manufacturing is the lifeblood of Michigan’s economy, which has been hard hit by tariffs imposed this year on the industry and Canada. When the project was proposed, officials said the factory would produce cathodes and anodes, two components key to electric vehicle batteries, as well as over 2,000 jobs. The original economic development incentives came as officials sought to bolster manufacturing in the state.

Whitmer’s office did immediately respond to a request for comment.

Republican U.S. Rep. John Moolenaar, who represents a swath of rural Michigan, had been the loudest and most prominent critic of the project, accusing Gotion of ties with forced labor and the Chinese Communist Party. Moolenaar chairs the House Select Committee on China and introduced a bill that stopped companies like Gotion from receiving electric vehicle tax credits from President Joe Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act. Moolenaar’s bill was signed by President Donald Trump earlier this year.

“Now that its contract with the State of Michigan and MEDC is set to be terminated, the people of Green Charter Township can finally move on from Gotion’s lies and broken promises,” Moolenaar said in a press release.

Carter,,,,,https://currently.att.yahoo.com/att/michigan-embraces-gas-power-charging-122500377.html,"One way that states have decided to recoup the revenue lost by EV owners not paying gas taxes is by adding additional fees when EV owners register their cars.
That annual EV surcharge will soon skyrocket by another $100 each year, and make EV owners pay significantly more in taxes than gas car owners pay in gas taxes over the course of a year.
This will make Michigan tie with New Jersey as the states with the highest EV taxes in the United States.
Given that there were 30,206 F-150s sold in Michigan in 2024, that equates to a loss in annual gas tax revenue of over $1.35 million.
What do you think, is it fair to charge EV owners significantly more money than owners of gas-powered cars?","The automotive industry has relied on fossil fuels for over a century, and the roads those cars travel on have relied heavily on taxes that drivers pay on each gallon of gas purchased at the pump. As the effects of human-caused climate change continue to worsen and more drivers choose to drive less environmentally damaging electric vehicles, governments have had to reconsider how to go about collecting those infrastructure-funding taxes. One way that states have decided to recoup the revenue lost by EV owners not paying gas taxes is by adding additional fees when EV owners register their cars.

EV-owning Michiganders already pay an annual EV surcharge of $160 on top of their annual registration fees, and owners of EVs and hybrids that weigh over 8,000 pounds pay an additional $100 on top of that before even accounting for the standard registration cost. That annual EV surcharge will soon skyrocket by another $100 each year, and make EV owners pay significantly more in taxes than gas car owners pay in gas taxes over the course of a year. This will make Michigan tie with New Jersey as the states with the highest EV taxes in the United States.

EV owners could soon pay an additional $1.88 for every cent the gas tax increases

The proposed bill that would further increase the fees that EV owners pay is Senate Bill 593, and according to M Live News, ""a plug-in hybrid vehicle's annual fee would increase 94 cents for every cent the fuel tax increased above 19 cents per gallon. For EV, the increase would be $1.88 per 1 cent of fuel tax."" That's right, even plug-in hybrid owners are paying more in taxes than folks who drive gas-powered cars.

Critics say that raising fees for PHEV and EV registrations discourages EV adoption, and signals to the automakers that are based in the state that Michigan is not serious about electrification efforts. As a reminder, Ford, General Motors, and Stellantis are primarily based in Michigan.

According to ecocenter.org, EV drivers pay an average of $47 more in road funding taxes every year when compared to their most similar gas-powered counterparts. For example, the driver of a Chevrolet Equinox EV pays $40 more per year than the driver of a gas Chevrolet Equinox, and the driver of a Chevrolet Blazer EV pays $47 more per year than the driver of a gas Chevrolet Blazer. The gap widens with vehicles over the 8,000 pound mark; the driver of a Chevrolet Silverado EV pays $218 more toward road maintenance each year than the driver of a gas Silverado.

EVs are usually heavier than gas models

Since gas powered cars have become more efficient and use less fuel, the revenue from gasoline taxes has dropped significantly. For example, the owner of a 2024 Ford F-150 pays $45.15 less in gas taxes than the owner of a 2010 F-150. Given that there were 30,206 F-150s sold in Michigan in 2024, that equates to a loss in annual gas tax revenue of over $1.35 million. One of the biggest arguments against the increases in EV registration costs is that EV owners are paying significantly more in annual road taxes than gas car owners pay in gasoline tax over that same time span.

EVs tend to be heavier than their gas counterparts, which naturally puts more strain on the infrastructure that they use, but the gas tax doesn't reward owners of lighter ICE vehicles with lower rates than owners of full-sized SUVs. Yes, the Chevrolet Equinox EV weighs about 1,500 pounds more than a gas-powered Equinox, but a Miata weighs over 3,000-pounds less than a Chevrolet Suburban and yet they pay the same proportion in gas tax. What do you think, is it fair to charge EV owners significantly more money than owners of gas-powered cars?

Tens of thousands of good jobs in clean power are already here in Scotland and thousands more are coming.
And the same is true when it comes to nuclear energy.
Hunterston, just down the coast from us, produced power from nuclear generation for decades, but with the ban on nuclear there’s no chance of future investment there.","This was largely driven by China building more solar and wind power than the rest of the world combined.

Our future lies in renewable energy, backed up by new nuclear. It’s important for our energy security and for lowering energy bills, but it’s also important for the next generation of jobs in our country, and Scotland has the chance to lead the way.

That’s why, this week, the UK Labour Government announced its plans to create 40,000 new jobs in the clean energy sector in Scotland by 2030, and 400,000 across the UK.

We’re proud of the history of industry in our area but in recent years, young people have had to look further afield than home to find new and good jobs. I hope that these jobs can help to change that.

This is why I felt it was so important to bring employers from the renewables sector together with our education providers last month at my ‘Developing our Future Workforce’ event.

A generation of young people in Scotland – and here in Inverclyde and Renfrewshire West – will benefit from these jobs under this government, and we need to know what lies in the future of employment in our area in order to predict the educational and training needs.

One of the big complaints I hear from parents is that “there’s no such thing as a job for life”, but when it comes to Scotland’s renewable energy boom that couldn’t be further from the truth.

Jobs like cable engineers, welders and construction workers are needed to build the electricity grid that is going to power our country for years to come. But at the moment we aren’t training enough people in Scotland to do these jobs, meaning that companies have to recruit from overseas.

It doesn’t have to be like this. Tens of thousands of good jobs in clean power are already here in Scotland and thousands more are coming.

I want to see a future where young people can choose to stay here – to choose to study, to live and to work here in Inverclyde, and not be left without a choice but to move. And that’s what this Government wants too.

Sadly, I don’t know if the same can be said of the SNP Scottish Government. They have hollowed out our vital college sector, taking away routes for people to access work and retrain if needed. And just when we need the support to make sure people can take advantage of these new jobs in the renewables sector, our colleges aren’t there to provide the opportunities.

And the same is true when it comes to nuclear energy. With their ban on nuclear power stations in Scotland, the Scottish Government aren’t just turning their back on a safe, clean and reliable source of energy, they’re also rejecting highly skilled jobs and investment in our communities.

Hunterston, just down the coast from us, produced power from nuclear generation for decades, but with the ban on nuclear there’s no chance of future investment there.

A Labour Government would change that and this week, Ed Miliband committed to support nuclear power development in Scotland if Labour wins the Scottish Parliament election next year.

This has been a turbulent year for North Carolina’s solar industry:

The Trump administration nixed the 25d Residential Clean Energy Credit, which would have expired in 2032. Now, it expires at the end of the year.

New FEOC requirements, or Foreign Entity of Concern, are leaving solar installers struggling to determine which solar panels still qualify for the Clean Energy Investment and Production tax credits.

The EPA also cut funding for EnergizeNC, which would have lowered energy bills for thousands of low-income residents, according to North Carolina Attorney General Jeff Jackson.

Clean energy tax credits have saved people money on home solar installations for more than 20 years. However, it might already be too late for homeowners to save on new solar. Bryce Bruncati, with 8MSolar in Raleigh, said it’s been a busy few months, meeting a surge of demand that followed the passage of Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill.

“When the Big Beautiful Bill passed, and they ended 25d, we signed up like 200 people in a couple weeks,” Bruncati said. “So, all solar installers in North Carolina right now are booked through the year.”

It was the same story with other solar installers I spoke with in the Carolinas. One reported that it has some spots available for upgrades and small projects, but the queue is otherwise full.

The story of solar so far

Home solar systems have steadily grown in popularity in North Carolina since the mid-2000s. In recent years, they’ve added significant capacity to the grid, approaching the size of a small power plant. That role has only expanded as new battery storage systems and power management agreements allow utilities such as Duke Energy to draw power from homes, reducing energy demand on the system during peak hours.

However, the solar ship had already encountered some headwinds before President Trump returned to office. In 2023, new solar installations declined for the first time in six years, falling by over 15% from the year prior. They dropped again in 2024 — this time by nearly 44%.

Creating energy islands after the flood

Even if 2024 was a low-performing year overall for solar, Asheville-based Rhino Renewables got an unexpected boost after Hurricane Helene.

“Since the storm, we’ve been very busy. A lot of people realize the need for solar,” said Glynnis Hollifield, office manager at Rhino Renewables. “Even people with existing systems wanted to add a battery, just because they were like, ‘I should have had one for the storm.’”

Rooftop or standalone solar panels that are connected to the grid won’t work during a blackout without battery storage. The utility requires panels to switch off when the grid goes down to prevent energy from backfeeding while lineworkers restore power. An at-home battery enables homes to function like an energy island, powering them without risking the electrocution of lineworkers. In this way, they can replace their noisier, more polluting counterpart — the diesel generator.

“People were realizing that to have power when nobody else does, or when the grid goes down, is just so important,” Hollifield said.

Immediately after Helene, organizations such as The Footprint Project deployed battery and solar systems in western North Carolina to power Starlinks, phone chargers and more. Buncombe County installed its first two battery storage systems earlier this year at the county’s Public Safety Training Center and the Health and Human Services building.

“We didn't initially design these battery systems to be like resilience projects in the traditional sense,” said Jeremiah Leroy, deputy recovery officer for Buncombe County, in an interview this past spring. “They were really more designed to be like cost savings projects, to shed peak load and reduce demand charges.”

Leroy said that changed with Helene, and the county shifted to asking questions about emergency preparedness. Suddenly, these battery systems meant more than the sum of their cost savings.

“Resilience is our big focus, and probably will be for the foreseeable future,” He said.

Rhino Renewables had also been part of EnergizeNC, a federally funded program that would have expanded community and residential solar installations in low-income and disadvantaged communities to lower electricity bills. The $156 million program was scheduled to launch later this year, but the Trump Administration canceled funding for the project. North Carolina Attorney General Jeff Jackson has since joined several other states in a lawsuit against the EPA over the Solar for All funds.

“These funds were going to help low-income and rural North Carolinians save money on their energy bills,” said Attorney General Jeff Jackson in a written statement. “Thousands of families were going to have the option to install solar power, save money, and have another energy option after a major storm. Now the EPA has illegally cancelled those funds — so I’m going to court to bring $150 million back to our state.”

Looking ahead

For companies that have diversified their services, such as South Carolina’s Southern Energy Management, other home electrification programs, such as Duke and Dominion’s HERO rebate program or Energy Saver NC, have been a boon. Graham Alexander, co-owner of Southern Energy Management, said his industry will weather the new changes, tax credit or no.

“We’d rather see the energy industry in North America on a level playing field,” Alexander said. “Take the subsidies away from the natural gas and the coal and everything else, and let’s see where the field balances out to.”

The One Big Beautiful Bill expanded federal subsidies for oil extraction and reduced the royalties that fossil fuel companies pay for federal leases.

8MSolar’s Bruncati was similarly optimistic about the future of his industry.

“Even without the tax credit, I'm selling systems that have about a 10-year breakeven,” Bruncati said, referring to the amount of time it takes for new panels to pay for themselves.

Bruncati said that math gets more favorable as electrical rates increase. Duke Energy’s proposed 2025 resource plan forecasted that rates will rise an average 2.1% annually over the next decade. Similarly, at-home battery storage has begun to compete more with gas generators as unit prices decrease.

The federal policy shift may favor other business models. In California, where electricity rates are higher, solar leasing has overtaken outright ownership in the past.

When a homeowner signs a solar lease, they don’t own the panels or battery system, but they do benefit from the savings. The leasing company claims the commercial tax credit and charges the homeowner monthly for the panels. These agreements typically last 10-20 years.

“It's a little more tricky. You have to have a really good site. You have to be okay with having someone else owning the equipment we roof,” Bruncati said.

A 2017 law legalized solar leasing in North Carolina and put a cap on leased solar relative to the utility’s total peak demand. Solar leases tend to decline in popularity when panel prices decrease or financial incentives lower the barriers to ownership. It’s possible that solar installers might pivot to so-called third-party ownership models after 25D expires.

In the Carolinas, there are still other incentive programs to offset the upfront cost of solar and battery systems. South Carolina offers a state tax credit for 25% the cost of a new solar system, including installation. In Mecklenburg County, the Solarize Charlotte-Mecklenburg campaign is a group-purchase program that has lowered the price of a solar system to below $2.00 per watt.

Duke Energy’s PowerPair program offers up to $9,000 back to homeowners who install both solar and battery systems on their homes.

“We have 100 projects booked for [quarter one] of next year where those homeowners are not getting the 30% tax credit, but they're still getting that PowerPair incentive,” Bruncati said.

But the program's future is uncertain. This three-year pilot is already nearing capacity after just over a year. Duke Energy Progress has started a waitlist.

Duke Energy will need to request permission from state regulators to extend the pilot program. The company provided the following written statement:

“Currently, there is no plan for expansion of upfront solar + battery incentives programming. However, Duke Energy continues to offer demand side programs that provide eligible customers with opportunities to earn incentives.”

In fact, the park’s onsite solar array produces nearly as much electricity as the entire park utilizes on an annual basis, including electricity for their buildings and electric vehicle charging stations found in the park’s marina.

To help raise awareness about this impressive achievement, PennEnvironment’s Clean Energy Associate Carolena Bellini hosted a solar tour at Prince Gallitzin State Park’s solar array alongside DCNR Secretary Cindy Adams Dunn, and DEP Secretary Jessica Shirley. Local elected officials from Cambria County gathered with local residents and partner non-profit groups to celebrate one of DCNR’s many solar projects in Pennsylvania’s state parks!

“This solar array isn’t just a model for how public lands across PA and the nation can go solar,” said PennEnvironment’s Clean Energy Associate Carolena Bellini. “It is also a reminder that with creativity and drive, we can jumpstart local homegrown renewable solar projects on schools, churches, warehouses, homes, or other ingenious sites.”

Numerous local news outlets covered the solar tour, including articles in the Altoona Mirror, the Johnstown Tribune-Democrat, and the Mainline Newspaper, as well as TV news coverage on local WJAC and WTAJ. By garnering media attention to the Prince Gallitzin solar array, we’re able to increase our reach to every-day Pennsylvanians and educate them about the benefits and opportunities for going solar.

Not only is the solar array at Prince Gallitzin the largest solar array in Pennsylvania’s state park system, it provides a variety of benefits for the state park and taxpayers’ pocketbooks.

Prince Gallitzin Park Manager Jessica Lavelua explained how the solar array provides over $90,000 in energy bill savings to the park each year, and how park officials are able to use those newly-saved monies and invest it back into park improvements like new grills and campsites, a new roof at the ranger station, and much more. The array also helps Pennsylvania’s park system lower its global warming pollution by an estimated 700 tons each year.

At the event, DEP Secretary Jessica Shirley emphasized PA’s progress towards increasing renewable energy. “In May, the Commonwealth reached the momentous milestone of 2 gigawatts of installed solar energy…. enough capacity to power around 377,000 homes,” she noted.

DCNR Secretary Dunn highlighted how “projects like the Prince Gallitzin solar array demonstrate how we can save taxpayer dollars, support local clean energy jobs, and protect our natural resources for future generations. By incorporating solar and other energy innovations across state parks and forests, we’re building a cleaner, stronger, and more resilient Pennsylvania.”

Alongside the Secretaries and PennEnvironment, attendees heard from Park Manager Jessica Lavelua and Steven Spotts with Gridsmart who installed the solar array. Attendees also heard from both Democratic and Republican local elected officials–Cambria County Commissioners Tom Chernisky and Keith Rager–showing the bipartisan support that exists for this project.

A bus full of students from Cambria Heights High School were also in the audience at this event. Having young folks present to learn about sustainability practices showcased one of the goals of the event: to bring together a group of people varying in age, political background, careers, amongst other things, all here to celebrate clean energy.

“The sky is our future,” said Cambria County Commissioner Keith Rager. “If it means reducing taxpayer money, and it means less taxes on me and these young folk [coming from Cambria Heights High School], that’s what I want to do.”

Cambria County Commissioner Tom Chernisky emphasizes how “this project will continue to help Prince Gallitzin State Park make Cambria County a great place to live, work, invest, volunteer, and play.”

Superintendent Ken Kerchenske of the Cambria Heights School District stated that “Cambria Heights School District is venturing into the solar business in the coming months, both through a Power Purchase Agreement on our secondary campus and the direct purchase of a rooftop solar array at Cambria Heights Elementary School, made possible, in part, by a Solar for Schools grant the district received earlier this year. Monday’s event showed that solar is an excellent, fiscally-responsible option for public entities in Cambria County.”

This event was a great opportunity for people to come together and learn more about the environmental and economic benefits of the Prince Gallitzin State Park solar array. It also was a way to highlight DCNR’s leadership and discuss how Pennsylvania can continue to move forward towards a renewable energy future.

The 2025 Oregon Legislative Session ran from January 21 to June 27 and was marked by fiscal uncertainty and systematic challenges as the Capitol community grappled with how to process a record 3,466 bills introduced. Within this context, the session did not feature any of the signature climate or environmental packages that have been a hallmark of Oregon policymaking in recent biennia. Instead, legislators grappled extensively with how to address imminent major challenges in a constrained budget environment, namely issues relating to wildfire and water. The legislature also authorized significant fee increases across many environmental and natural resource agency programs.

As the Legislative Liaison to the Oregon State Bar Environment and Natural Resources Section Executive Committee, I had the honor this summer of providing a legislative update in the Section’s E-Outlook newsletter, published this August, and will be expanding on that report during the ENR Section’s upcoming annual Year-in-Review CLE on October 16, 2025. A few of the most salient session highlights relevant to environment and natural resources policy are outlined below.

General Environmental Protection & Climate

While 2025 lacked signature climate legislation, conceptual groundwork was laid with SJR 28, a proposed constitutional amendment asserting a “fundamental right to a clean, safe and healthy environment.” SJR 28 failed, but a similar measure—Initiative Petition 45—was submitted by petitioners to be included on the 2026 ballot. Chief petitioner recently withdrew the petition for IP 45, but this conversation is likely to continue in future sessions.

Other notable failed bills that may resurface in future sessions included:

SB 680: Greenwashing liability

SB 681: Moratorium on fossil fuel investments by State Treasury

SB 682 and SB 1187: Separate formulations of Climate Superfund Cost Recovery Program

Separately, efforts to repeal and replace Oregon’s Climate Protection Program (CPP) with a Cap & Invest model gained traction, as evidenced by HCR 42, a resolution introduced during the last week of session declaring the legislature’s intent to reduce proposed transportation taxes if the Legislative Assembly enacts a cap-and-invest program.

Other environmental protection discussions focused on PFAS, a topic that continues to garner attention nationally and in Oregon. Enrolled SB 91, which becomes effective January 1, 2026, prohibits use of “PFAS firefighting foam” with exceptions, and enrolled HB 2947 requires a study on PFAS in biosolids applied to land, with the final report due September 1, 2028. A bill proposing to prohibit the distribution or sale of certain products that contain intentionally added PFAS, HB 3512, received a public hearing but otherwise did not move forward.

Water

Legislators considered a broad slate of water bills this session, with 26 bills ultimately receiving hearings that addressed water quantity policy, and another 12 addressing water quality. Discussions on water policy during 2025 were a significant, bipartisan priority, with several successful water-related bills of note passing. The most important of those include:

HB 3372: Expands exempt well use on small farms

HB 3544: Establishes uniform processes for water-related contested case proceedings

HB 3342: Modifies laws related to regulation and administration of water rights

SB 1154: Groundwater Quality Protection Act update

HB 3525: Drinking water well testing by landlords for rented dwelling units

Wildfire

Wildfire was a topic of considerable discussion this legislative session. Regarding wildfire funding, legislators considered various proposals but ultimately adopted HB 3940, establishing a new “Zyn tax” on nicotine pouches and directing those funds toward wildfire prevention; redirecting a portion of interest earned on the rainy-day fund to purposes related to wildfire; restructuring how landowners pay for fire protection; and creating a grant program for retrofitting dwellings for wildfire resilience. The legislature also appropriated funds to ODF for ongoing wildfire costs through the end-of-session budget package, HB 5006. This funding, while helpful, totaled well short of legislator’s goals and is largely considered just a first step in addressing mounting wildfire costs. It is all but guaranteed that wildfire funding will continue to be a significant conversation in future sessions.

The agency also stressed that it was eyeing to collaborate with Japan, Singapore and some European countries for bilateral or multilateral trade agreements for carbon credits.
“Now, under the guise of ‘carbon credits,’ these destructive undertakings will profit twice: from environmental exploitation and from selling off supposed ‘emission savings’ to wealthy polluters abroad,” the group said.

The DOE issued on Oct. 10 a circular that provides the guidelines for the generation, management and monitoring of carbon credits, which would allow an organization or even a country to produce a certain amount of carbon emissions.

According to the Peoples Rising for Climate Justice-Philippines (PRCJ-PH), the new order from the DOE was “illegitimate and anti-people,” as this also opens doors to foreign and even local corporations to purchase “cheap offsets” instead of reducing their own emissions.

“It allows polluters to greenwash business-as-usual operations while other Filipino people bear the brunt of environmental destruction and climate disasters,” the group said in a statement.

The new policy also threatens the country’s sovereignty over natural resources, as well as undermines grassroots, non-market solutions led by indigenous peoples, farmers and fisherfolk, being the “real stewards of our environment”.”

By issuing the order, the PRCJ also criticized the DOE for going “beyond its mandate” in coming up with such a policy.

The DOE has said that the new circular was in line with the international treaty Paris Agreement. The agency also stressed that it was eyeing to collaborate with Japan, Singapore and some European countries for bilateral or multilateral trade agreements for carbon credits.

However, the group said the DOE cannot use the Paris agreement as a “blanket justification for such overreach, as they are not self-executory without enabling legislation.”

“Worse, this regulation was railroaded at the department level with little-to-no participation from frontline communities, civil society groups or independent environmental experts,” the PRCJ said. “It sidelines the Climate Change Commission, the body legally mandated to coordinate national climate policy and centralizes authority in energy bureaucrats who have long been beholden to corporate interests.”

The “deeper danger” of the DOE circular also includes the “eligible mitigation activities” for the carbon emissions, such as in mega-dams, large-scale solar and wind farms, waste-to-energy incinerators and nuclear energy.

“Now, under the guise of ‘carbon credits,’ these destructive undertakings will profit twice: from environmental exploitation and from selling off supposed ‘emission savings’ to wealthy polluters abroad,” the group said.

A judge blocked Trump’s cuts in March, according to the lawsuit, and Hill thought her organization’s funding was safe.
“The grant was released in February, (and we added) on three additional communities,” Hill said.
“The loss of this funding will immediately curtail 4CORE’s planned programs for mobility planning in four communities, and commercial and residential energy efficiency outreach,” the release said.
To Hill, the move to cut the funding is strictly based on ideology, she said.","Half-million dollar cut resulted in job loss

The U.S. Department of Energy announced on Oct. 2 that it would be slashing more than $7.5 billion in funding approved through the Bipartisan Infrastructure Act and the Inflation Reduction Acts.

According to a release from the department, the funds, which were allocated for 223 energy projects nationwide, were found to be wasteful.

“DOE determined that these projects did not adequately advance the nation’s energy needs, were not economically viable, and would not provide a positive return on investment of taxpayer dollars,” the release read.

Some of the Congressionally-approved funds were to be sent to Durango-based nonprofit Four Corners Office for Resource Efficiency, according to a release from the organization.

4CORE Executive Director Jenny Hill said the cuts came after a coalition of state attorneys general, including Colorado AG Phil Weiser, sued the Trump administration, which tried to cut the funds through an executive order early on in 2025. A judge blocked Trump’s cuts in March, according to the lawsuit, and Hill thought her organization’s funding was safe.

“This one was completely out of the blue,” she said. “So we had been working under the assumption since February that these were obligated funds that we were already spending, and that they wouldn't ever be under threat of being cut again. So when this did happen, it was a big shock to us.”

The guiding ethic of 4CORE was to help communities across Southwest Colorado where 65% of households are at or below the federal poverty level – including Ignacio, Cortez, Pagosa Springs and Saguache. The nonprofit lost $531,240 due to the cuts, and as a result had to lay off two employees, reduce hours for two others and roll back operations, the release said. Hill said she had to cut her own time back to 20 hours a week.

“The grant was released in February, (and we added) on three additional communities,” Hill said. “We’re right in the middle of the work. For Pagosa Springs, we’re about 75% done with the transportation planning work. For Saguache we are roughly 50% done. So it really did impact and hurt those two communities when we received the stop work order.”

According to the nonprofit’s website, 4CORE helped provide funding, guidance and community organization for clean energy initiatives, such as solar installation projects and an e-bike lending program for low-income and car-less residents. On Friday, for example, Hill was in Towaoc working to get kids from the Ute Mountain Ute Tribe on e-bikes to help address their transportation needs.

Additionally, the organization sought to help communities become more climate resilient through groundwater conservation projects and sustainable economic practices.

What’s more, Hill said, is that community surveys about 4CORE’s work in both Saguache and Pagosa Springs was positive, regardless of political affiliation.

“The loss of this funding will immediately curtail 4CORE’s planned programs for mobility planning in four communities, and commercial and residential energy efficiency outreach,” the release said.

The reduction in the nonprofit’s staffing has already halted the organizations efforts to gather information and to help communities identify transportation needs, plan for affordable transportation, enable homeowners to make their houses more energy efficient and provide education about sustainable business practices to boost economic resiliency.

To Hill, the move to cut the funding is strictly based on ideology, she said. 4CORE’s work was non-partisan and helped communities save money, increase efficiency and become more environmentally friendly.

“It feels strictly political,” Hill said. “That’s why in 2020 through 2024, we were receiving more grant funds and getting more awards, and kind of wrapping up the services we offered. And then this whole year has been a roller coaster of determining the strategy moving forward.”

that greenhouse gases endanger public health and therefore must be regulated by the federal government.

But some business leaders said they are wary that the move could lead to a costly legal quagmire.

The rule, known as the “endangerment finding,” is the conclusion by the E.P.A. that greenhouse gases endanger public health and therefore must be regulated by the federal government. Lee Zeldin, the E.P.A. administrator, has said the agency would repeal the finding, claiming that the burden to industries of cutting greenhouse gas emissions is more harmful than a warming planet.

And yet carmakers, electric utilities and even the oil and gas industry have asked the E.P.A. to tread carefully. If the federal government were to stop regulating greenhouse gases, it could clear the way for states and municipalities to sue companies for damages from climate change. And it could spur individual states to come up with their own pollution limits, creating a patchwork of regulations. Environmental groups have also promised to sue the E.P.A. if it repeals the finding, leading to more uncertainty for businesses.

“This is something that the vast majority of industry didn’t ask for and doesn’t want,” said Zach Friedman, the senior director of federal policy at Ceres, a nonprofit group that submitted a letter from 59 companies and investors opposing the E.P.A. plan.

Human activities, mainly the burning of coal, oil and gas for energy, have produced the greenhouse gases that have been the primary driver of climate change for more than half a century. Carbon dioxide, methane and other gases have accumulated in the atmosphere and are warming the planet by trapping the sun’s heat. That has contributed to more intense wildfires and heat waves, rising seas and extreme weather events.

In its proposal to repeal the endangerment finding, the E.P.A. cited a recent Energy Department report that downplayed the severity of climate change. That report was written by five prominent climate contrarians chosen by the Trump administration.

Their work has been sharply criticized by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine, the American Meteorological Society and more than 85 climate scientists in the United States, who found that the Trump administration’s climate report has numerous inaccuracies and misrepresents climate science.

Scott Saleska, a professor of ecology and evolutionary biology at the University of Arizona, said the evidence that supported the endangerment finding 16 years ago has only grown stronger since then. Air temperatures have increased, sea levels have risen, ocean acidification has worsened. Heat-related deaths are rising, smoke from wildfires is increasingly severe and the spread of climate-enabled diseases is on the uptick.

Ignoring that evidence, as the E.P.A. appears poised to do, Dr. Saleska said, “puts an exclamation point on the idea that science, as the best method the human species has ever come up with for discerning objective reality, has no role in this government.”

But they still said the federal government should retain the ability to regulate greenhouse gases under the Clean Air Act.

Rescinding the endangerment finding “will serve not as a path to regulatory stability, but rather a route to prolonged legal battles, possible market fragmentation and technological stagnation,” wrote Jim Kliesch, the director of regulatory affairs at American Honda Motor Company Inc.

The American Petroleum Institute, which represents oil and gas companies, wrote that “federal government action is a necessary part of the solution” to climate change and said it believed the E.P.A. had the authority to regulate greenhouse gases.

The Edison Electric Institute, a trade association representing the electric power industry, said that if without a federal role in regulating greenhouse gases, states and cities could “attempt to fill that perceived void through increased regulatory requirements that could vary significantly from one jurisdiction to the next.”

But other business groups supported removing the endangerment finding. The National Mining Association, which represents mining companies, and the Steel Manufacturers Association backed the agency, as did energy associations from several states, including coal and gas-rich Wyoming.

When the public comment period closed on Sept. 22, the agency had received more than 500,000 comments, about 2 percent of which have so far been posted on the E.P.A.’s website, according to an analysis Wednesday by InfluenceMap, a London-based sustainability think tank. In its report on the comments released so far, the group said that companies and trade groups across many sectors of the economy were concerned about the legal viability of the agency’s proposal, and some proposed weakening greenhouse gas standards instead of jettisoning them.

“I was definitely surprised to see the level of concern that some of these companies and industry associations are voicing about the proposal, especially the companies that have traditionally tried to weaken emissions standards,” said Leo Menninger, a senior analyst for the group. “They’re generally concerned about the entire framework being removed.”

Repealing the finding would almost certainly lead to litigation that could eventually reach the Supreme Court. The endangerment finding, which dates from 2009, came out of a Supreme Court decision two years earlier, Massachusetts v. E.P.A., in which the justices concluded that greenhouse gases were pollutants, and that the agency was obligated to determine whether they were a danger to public health.

Nixing the finding could also have another unintended consequence for fossil fuel producers: It would potentially weaken a primary argument that they have used to fight some of the lawsuits filed against them in state courts.

The industry has said in court that the E.P.A. has exclusive authority to oversee emissions that cross state lines, overriding other state and federal laws. (Plaintiffs in many of the suits have countered that their lawsuits are based on corporate misbehavior, not actual emissions.) But if the E.P.A. removes its own authority to regulate emissions, that could open up the potential for some lawsuits against the industry to proceed more easily.

In its proposed rule, the E.P.A. said the Clean Air Act and the structure of the federal system would still block such lawsuits, even without the endangerment finding in place. But that reading of the law would most likely be challenged in court.

“I think that’s one reason why Trump didn’t try to do this in his first term,” said Robert Percival, director of the environmental law program at the University of Maryland’s law school. “They were warned that it was too dangerous to open up this Pandora’s box.”",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/22/multimedia/22cli-endangerment-01b-jbhz/22cli-endangerment-01b-jbhz-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-10-25 06:58:52.586661

In response, U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright has proposed a significant regulatory change aimed at expediting the connection of these power-intensive data centers to the national grid. This proposal, submitted to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), is designed to streamline the interconnection process and reduce the lengthy review periods that often impede grid development. As the country grapples with increased energy needs, this initiative could reshape how the grid meets modern demands.

Accelerating Grid Connections: A New Rule Proposal

The U.S. Department of Energy has put forth a new rule to FERC that seeks to hasten the connection of data centers to the electric grid. Spearheaded by Energy Secretary Chris Wright, this rule allows for joint, co-located load and generation interconnection requests. The aim is to significantly cut down on the time and cost associated with grid improvements. Typically, reviews for grid projects can take several years, but Wright’s proposal suggests that a 60-day review period could be feasible.

This streamlined process is crucial as the demand for electricity rises, fueled by the expansion of data centers and the AI sector. The current administration, led by President Donald Trump, is focusing on boosting power capacity primarily through fossil fuels and nuclear energy. However, this focus has sparked a mixed reaction from various stakeholders. While some industry representatives see it as a necessary step for modernizing the grid, environmentalists have voiced concerns about the potential environmental impact and the administration’s energy priorities.

Support and Criticism: Diverse Stakeholder Reactions

The proposed rule has garnered both support and criticism from different corners. The Edison Electric Institute, representing publicly-traded electric utilities, has endorsed the initiative, highlighting its potential to strengthen the grid and lower costs for consumers. The organization believes that faster interconnection times will be beneficial for the overall energy infrastructure.

Conversely, environmental groups have criticized the proposal. Camden Weber from the Center for Biological Diversity expressed concerns over the administration’s priorities, particularly during a government shutdown. Weber argued that fast-tracking grid connections without thorough environmental reviews could have detrimental effects. This criticism underscores the ongoing debate between expanding energy capacity and maintaining environmental safeguards, a key issue in the current energy policy landscape.

Hydropower Development: Removing Permit Burdens

In addition to the grid connection proposal, Secretary Wright has also urged FERC to consider a rule aimed at easing the preliminary permitting process for hydroelectric projects. This move aligns with efforts to diversify energy sources and increase reliance on renewable energy. Malcolm Woolf, president and CEO of the National Hydropower Association, praised the initiative, emphasizing the need to prevent unnecessary barriers from federal resource agencies that could hinder hydropower development.

Hydropower is considered a critical component of a sustainable energy future, offering a reliable and renewable energy source. By reducing permit burdens, the U.S. could potentially accelerate the development of hydroelectric projects, contributing to a more balanced energy mix. This proposal reflects a broader strategy to ensure that renewable energy sources are not sidelined in the pursuit of increased power capacity.

The Role of FERC: Independence and Influence

FERC, an independent agency within the Department of Energy, plays a pivotal role in shaping U.S. energy policy. While the energy secretary can propose rules, FERC maintains the authority to accept or reject them. With a current 3-2 Republican majority, the commission’s decisions are closely watched by industry and environmental groups alike.

The independence of FERC is crucial for maintaining a balanced approach to energy regulation. As the commission reviews the proposed rule changes, it must weigh the benefits of expedited processes against potential risks to environmental integrity and regulatory oversight. This decision-making process highlights the delicate balance FERC must maintain to ensure that energy policies are both forward-thinking and responsible.

As the U.S. navigates its energy future, the proposals put forth by Secretary Wright represent a significant shift in how the country addresses growing power demands. These initiatives highlight the tension between rapid development and environmental stewardship, a core challenge for modern energy policy. As FERC deliberates on these proposals, the outcome will likely shape the trajectory of the U.S. energy landscape. What balance will be struck between innovation, capacity, and environmental responsibility in this evolving energy narrative?

Santee Cooper’s management plans to ask its board to approve a letter of intent for Brookfield to resume construction of two partially built reactors at the VC Summer site, Chief Executive Officer Jimmy Staton said during a board meeting on Friday.

The abandonment of VC Summer in 2017 marked a low point for the US nuclear industry, which has seen more than a dozen reactors shut down over the past decade or so amid increasing competition from cheaper natural gas and renewable energy. Now, demand for clean energy is driving enthusiasm for fission, with dozens of companies seeking to develop new reactor technologies and power plants.

But high costs continue to hinder the development of new reactors. VC Summer would feature traditional technology akin to the Vogtle project that was completed last year in Georgia, which came in about seven years late and roughly $20 billion over budget.

Staton didn’t provide financial details about the Brookfield negotiations. He said a key component was moving the burden away from the utility.

“We think we’ve shifted the paradigm of how nuclear gets built here in the US,” Staton said. “Instead of the risk being absorbed by customers, it will be absorbed by the private entities seeking to build these assets.”

US electricity consumption is set to soar as technology companies build out power-hungry data centers supporting artificial intelligence applications. That’s driving interest in nuclear plants that can supply around-the-clock clean energy. Microsoft Corp. has agreed to pay above-market prices for power from a shuttered Three Mile Island reactor, which owner Constellation Energy Corp. expects to bring back into service in mid-2027.

Santee Cooper and the VC Summer plant’s former co-owner, Scana Corp., halted construction of the reactors about eight years ago after estimated costs soared above $20 billion and contractor Westinghouse Electric Co. went bankrupt. Four former executives involved with the project, including Scana’s former CEO, were convicted in a federal criminal investigation that found the state’s ratepayers had been defrauded over delays and cost overruns.

Santee Cooper began soliciting bids to restart the project in January. Brookfield already has a connection to the site; it now owns a majority stake in Westinghouse, which designed the two reactors that have about 1,100 megawatts of capacity each.

Staton reiterated that the restart is unlikely to lead to a repeat of the financial debacle. There were no Brookfield executives speaking at the meeting.

“There are no additional risks for our customers, at all,” he said. “We won’t have to contribute any additional dollars.”

Our permitting system must evolve beyond its 1970s framework to address the challenges and opportunities of 2025 and beyond.","Arizona stands at a pivotal moment where rapid growth meets an urgent need for reliable, affordable energy to power homes, schools, businesses and the innovative industries driving tomorrow’s economy. Yet, progress continues to be stifled by a federal permitting system that is outdated, overburdened and in desperate need of modernization.

In Arizona — where nearly 40% of our land is federally managed — even straightforward energy projects like updating or expanding existing project sites can face months or years of unnecessary delay due to repetitive reviews. These hold-ups hinder job creation, stall economic opportunity in rural communities,and delay the reliable energy that Arizona families and businesses depend on. Inefficient policy is crippling growth and innovation.

There is a roadmap for reform. Federal agencies should follow through on proven streamlining tools and remove barriers that provide little or no additional environmental benefit. A prime example is implementing a permit-by-rule system for certain energy projects on federal lands, particularly those already developed or previously reviewed under the National Environmental Policy Act.

A permit-by-rule process would allow low-impact projects to move forward without triggering yet another full NEPA review from scratch. These projects have already been vetted, align with earlier approvals and pose no additional risk to the environment. Requiring another lengthy environmental analysis in these cases doesn’t protect the environment — it simply duplicates paperwork, wastes valuable agency resources and delays energy production.

Another area for needed improvement is modernizing the NEPA process to reduce endless litigation. In recent years, federal courts issued more than 420 rulings on 210 energy projects, with many of the cases dragging on for years after receiving agency approval and extensive reviews. These delays are directly stalling projects resulting in unpredictable timelines and rising costs. NEPA needs targeted judicial reforms that limit excessive litigation to move energy projects forward efficiently and responsibly.

We’re entering a new era of energy demand. Nationally, electricity use is expected to steadily rise by 50% by 2050. In Arizona, the situation is worse, with energy demand for our largest utilities projected to triple as a surge of data centers come online. Meeting this challenge requires expanding capacity, modernizing our grid and accelerating clean energy deployment.

Arizona has some of the nation’s greatest potential for solar, but permitting delays are slowing progress on the transmission lines needed to deliver that energy reliably. A smarter permitting process will help ensure we meet rising demand with resilient, sustainable power. Delays in building new infrastructure and energy connections are only hampering the grid, putting energy reliability at risk today. These are not distant scenarios; they are real-time challenges demanding practical action now.

The energy we produce here in Arizona must be able to move swiftly from concept to reality. But that can’t happen if every project — no matter how minor — is treated as if it’s breaking ground for the first time. Importantly, these reforms do not sacrifice environmental standards; they enhance them by allowing agencies to focus their time and expertise on the projects that could carry genuine environmental risks. Safeguards would remain in place for high-impact areas, but the needless red tape burdening simple, routine projects must be reduced.

This is a common-sense, bipartisan solution — and a local one. Arizona communities thrive when energy is affordable, jobs are plentiful and infrastructure is modern. Permitting reforms, like a permit-by-rule, would help achieve all of these goals without compromising our environmental values.

Our congressional delegation has history of supporting practical solutions to strengthen Arizona’s infrastructure and competitiveness. Now, permitting reform must be the next frontier in realizing our state’s energy future. Sens. Mark Kelly and Ruben Gallego maintain critical positions on the Senate Committees on Environment and Public Works and Energy and Natural Resources respectively. They are in positions to lead on permitting reform on behalf of Arizona.

Our permitting system must evolve beyond its 1970s framework to address the challenges and opportunities of 2025 and beyond. By streamlining approvals for low-risk, previously vetted projects, Congress can ensure faster deployment of energy, better use of agency resources and a stronger future for Arizona.",https://gamma.creativecirclecdn.com/yourvalley/original/20251024-110150-0eb-Cesar%20Chavez%20headshot.jpg,N,,2025-10-25 13:19:16.634921

His journey from East Texas roots to the helm of Energy Transfer offers valuable insights into strategic business leadership, infrastructure development, and community-focused giving.

Building an Energy Infrastructure Giant

Kelcy Warren co-founded Energy Transfer in 1996 with approximately 200 miles of natural gas pipelines in East Texas, transforming this modest beginning into one of North America’s largest energy companies that now operates nearly 125,000 miles of pipelines across dozens of states. The company currently transports roughly one-third of the United States’ natural gas and crude oil, representing an extraordinary scale of growth achieved through strategic vision and decisive leadership.

Warren’s business philosophy centers on identifying market needs and rapidly building infrastructure to meet them. In the mid-2010s, when independent oil and gas producers returned from overseas operations, Warren recognized they needed new pipeline capacity to transport burgeoning domestic shale production and quickly expanded Energy Transfer’s infrastructure to fill those gaps. This customer-focused approach has been fundamental to the company’s success.

Strategic Acquisitions and Market Adaptation

When natural gas prices plummeted during the 2008-09 downturn and the Barnett Shale boom cooled, Warren led a transformative pivot to diversify Energy Transfer’s business through strategic acquisitions and expansion into natural gas liquids and oil. One pivotal moment came with a rapid $2 billion acquisition of Louis Dreyfus energy assets in 2011, demonstrating Warren’s ability to seize opportunities with remarkable speed.

The 2012 acquisition of Sunoco greatly expanded Energy Transfer’s footprint into new regions including the Marcellus Shale in the Northeast, adding oil transportation and retail capabilities to the portfolio. These bold moves exemplify Warren’s strategic thinking and willingness to transform his company’s direction when market conditions demand adaptation.

Operational Excellence and Innovation

Under Warren’s leadership, Energy Transfer became the world’s largest exporter of ethane and now ships liquefied petroleum gas to 93 countries around the globe, positioning the United States as a major global energy supplier. By finding profitable outlets for resources like ethane that were previously considered waste products, Warren helped revolutionize energy logistics.

During the 2020 pandemic when energy demand plunged, Energy Transfer emerged from the downturn stronger than before, thanks to its diversified portfolio and Warren’s steady long-term vision. This resilience demonstrates the company’s operational excellence and Warren’s ability to guide the organization through major industry challenges.

Transforming Urban Spaces Through Philanthropy

In 2012, Warren donated $10 million to help create Klyde Warren Park in Dallas, a 5.2-acre urban park built over a downtown freeway that has become a beloved community hub reconnecting the city’s Uptown and Downtown areas. Warren and his family later contributed an additional $20 million to expand the park, ensuring it can continue serving as a vibrant gathering place with free public programming.

The park, named after Warren’s son, stands as one of the nation’s most successful urban park projects and represents his commitment to improving quality of life in Dallas. His service on the Woodall Rodgers Park Foundation board demonstrates ongoing engagement with causes he supports.

Advancing Education and Energy Engineering

In 2023, Warren made a $12 million gift to the University of Texas at Arlington, the largest single donation in the university’s history, to help establish a cutting-edge resource and energy engineering program aimed at training the next generation of energy professionals. This transformational gift builds on 25 years of support to UTA, during which Warren previously gave around $4 million funding scholarships and research initiatives including a graduate fellowship honoring a professor who mentored him.

Warren’s commitment to education extends beyond universities to institutions from grade schools to other Texas universities, reflecting his belief in the power of learning to change lives. His educational philanthropy addresses the critical need for skilled graduates in the energy field while honoring his own educational journey.

Supporting Health and Youth Development

Warren has donated to prominent medical and children’s organizations including the MD Anderson Cancer Center, Dallas Children’s Advocacy Center, and March of Dimes, focusing his philanthropy on vulnerable populations and community well-being. Since 2018, he has been a steadfast supporter of the West Dallas Youth Academy through a partnership between Energy Transfer and the Texas Rangers, providing education, mentoring, and sports opportunities to underserved youth.

For years, Warren personally hosted an annual charity music event through his foundation, Cherokee Crossroads, Inc., to raise funds for children’s charities in Texas, demonstrating hands-on involvement with the causes he champions.

Leadership Recognition and Industry Honors

Warren has received high-profile awards from Hart Energy, the Texas Oil & Gas Association, and Southern Methodist University’s Cox Maguire Energy Institute, among others, recognizing his innovative leadership. D CEO Magazine named Warren as a top energy industry figure in 2023, and he was selected as a Laureate of the Dallas Business Hall of Fame in 2020.

Warren is a member of the Texas Business Hall of Fame and has been inducted into the Ammys Hall of Fame, in addition to receiving the prestigious Hanlon Award from the Gas Processors Association, the midstream industry’s highest honor for outstanding leadership. In 2016, he was inducted as a lifetime member of the Horatio Alger Association of Distinguished Americans after receiving the Horatio Alger Award, a national honor given to individuals who have overcome adversity to achieve great success while remaining committed to philanthropy.

Civic Engagement and Public Service

Texas Governor Greg Abbott appointed Warren to the University of Texas System Board of Regents, where he has served since 2019 with a term through 2025, contributing to higher education governance at the state level. Warren was also appointed to the prestigious Kennedy Center Board of Trustees in 2019, reflecting his support for arts and culture.

These appointments demonstrate how Warren leverages his experience and resources beyond business ventures, actively participating in governance of major educational and cultural institutions.

A Lasting Legacy of Vision and Service

Warren’s career exemplifies how business success can align with benevolence and community impact, as his four decades in the energy industry have not only reshaped America’s energy infrastructure but also touched countless lives through charitable initiatives. The breadth of his awards and honors in the energy sector is matched by substantial philanthropic contributions, highlighting a commitment to improving lives and supporting meaningful causes.

Kelcy Warren’s story offers important lessons for business leaders: strategic vision requires both bold decision-making and adaptability, true success extends beyond financial metrics to community impact, and transformational leadership means building infrastructure both physical and social. His dual legacy in energy infrastructure and philanthropy demonstrates that the most influential leaders use their success as a platform to create lasting positive change for future generations.",https://cdndailyexcelsior.b-cdn.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/kelcy-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-10-25 11:20:24.217564

Facts About Renewable Energy in Guinea-Bissau Implementing Renewable Energy is a Challenge: Guinea-Bissau’s electric sub-sector is one of the least efficient in West Africa.
Possibility of Increased Renewable Energy: Even with the lack of resources, renewable energy in Guinea-Bissau is possible.
The types of renewable energy Guinea-Bissau is hoping to implement in the country’s future has been recorded as recently as 2021, specifically from the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA).
Furthermore, a closer look into Guinea-Bissau’s renewable energy use found that 100% of the renewable energy used in 2021 came from bioenergy.","Located in West Africa, with about 2 million residents, the country of Guinea-Bissau has struggled with both economic and political instabilities for decades. However, with its coastal location, fishing has become an integrated part of the country’s economy. However, Guinea-Bissau has the power to improve both its economy and country with renewable energy. Here is information about energy poverty and renewable energy in Guinea-Bissau.

Energy Poverty in Guinea-Bissau

Energy poverty in Guinea-Bissau is very high. In fact, half of the country, more than a million people, are still unable to access electricity. As of 2023, only 0.8% of the country had access to clean fuels that are able to be used for cooking. While one may associate clean fuels with a more efficient way of cooking, there are other benefits of cooking with clean fuels as opposed to cooking with non-clean fuels, such as a lower risk of dying from indoor air pollution. Non-clean fuel sources, such as charcoal, crop waste or even dung, leave people at risk of death and ill-health, as opposed to those who use clean cooking fuels. While one may think of renewable energy in Guinea-Bissau as something that will help out our planet, citizens of Guinea-Bissau think of it as a life-altering and potentially life-saving change to their everyday lives.

Facts About Renewable Energy in Guinea-Bissau

Implementing Renewable Energy is a Challenge: Guinea-Bissau’s electric sub-sector is one of the least efficient in West Africa. This is due to several factors, including, but not limited to, waste, supply and demand issues, financial issues and low investments. This means that renewable energy in Guinea-Bissau may be harder to implement.

Low Electricity Availability: The availability of electricity in the West African country is low; however, the addition of renewable energy in Guinea-Bissau would change this. In fact, as late as 2022, more than one million people across the nation still do not have access to electricity. On the other hand, more than a million people across the country do have access to power. Out of the country’s entire population, rural areas were the smallest group to have that access, typically staying at the same low levels from 2015 to 2022. With the implementation of renewable energy in the country, more communities would have access to electricity, which could benefit their businesses, home lives and education.

A Delayed Power Plant: The development of renewable energy in Guinea-Bissau experienced a delay due to an unfinished power plant. A 15MV power plant was supposed to reach completion in November 2018 as a replacement for another power plant; however, the power plant did not begin operating in 2019.

Increasing Renewable Energy: Despite the electricity issues Guinea-Bissau faces, its electricity supply, particularly that which is renewable, has increased. In fact, in 2021, electricity that was generated from renewable sources was at its highest, at 18.3 (GWh).

Possibility of Increased Renewable Energy: Even with the lack of resources, renewable energy in Guinea-Bissau is possible. Currently, the country has a huge potential to commit to using renewable energy more than ever. Since 2018, the country has had more electricity than before, growing from 28.3 MW to 29.1 MW in about three years. Furthermore, more advancements are to come to the country’s renewable energy use in the near future.

Investments in Renewable Energy in Guinea-Bissau

The European Commission has collaborated with Guinea-Bissau in an attempt to help better the country and its citizens. Aside from strengthening education and climate-resilient practices when it comes to agriculture and fishing, Team Europe is investing in clean and renewable energy with solar plants in rural areas of the country. In addition to this, the two are working to promote sustainable and climate-resilient practices, which include the use of renewable energy and agricultural techniques to protect the environment.

As of March 2015, the European Union pledged 160 million euros (which is just less than $2 million in the United States) in order to help strengthen the rule of law within the country and consolidate democracy. While this was over a decade ago, it shows good signs as to what is to come to Guinea-Bissau, thanks to the EU. In fact, the article states that this is the resumption of support towards the country from the union, rather than the start. In a more recent development, in 2020, during the Universal Periodic Review by the United Nations Human Rights Council, Guinea-Bissau received 197 recommendations; the country taking 193 into account, most of which involved the issue of sustainable development.

The types of renewable energy Guinea-Bissau is hoping to implement in the country’s future has been recorded as recently as 2021, specifically from the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA). IRENA’s 2021 energy profile release of the West African country found that out of the total energy supply available in the country, 85% of it was renewable, compared to the other 15%, which was oil. Furthermore, a closer look into Guinea-Bissau’s renewable energy use found that 100% of the renewable energy used in 2021 came from bioenergy. As of 2023, the renewable energy capacity of the country was 100% solar instead of bioenergy. This may be due to the increase of solar power installations across the country.

Looking Ahead

While Guinea-Bissau is a low-energy country, more than a million citizens are still unable to access electricity; renewable energy in Guinea-Bissau would do wonders for the country. Between boosting the country’s economy to improving countless families’ lives, renewable energy would create access to a feature that half of the country has not had exposure to. While progress might seem far away, due to the issues involving the West African country’s resources, the European Union is working to make the seemingly impossible, not only possible, but possible in the near future. Right before the pandemic, the EU had implemented suggestions to the country to help it improve its sustainable development, and Guinea-Bissau took nearly all of them into account. While the future is always uncertain, the use of renewable energy in Guinea-Bissau is looking up.

Since 2021, electricity demand within the Texas electricity grid operated by the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) has steadily increased. In the first nine months of 2025, electricity demand in ERCOT, which manages about 90% of the state’s load, reached a record high compared with the same period in previous years. Over those same months, ERCOT had the fastest electricity demand growth among U.S. electricity grids between 2024 and 2025. From January through September 2025, demand for electric power in ERCOT increased 5% compared with the same period in 2024 to 372 terawatthours (TWh), 23% more than the same months in 2021. Since 2023, wind and solar generation, especially utility-scale solar, have been the fastest-growing sources of electricity in ERCOT and are increasingly meeting rising demand.

Utility-scale solar generated 45 TWh of electricity in the first nine months of 2025, 50% more than the same period in 2024 and nearly four times more than the same period in 2021, when utility-scale solar only produced 11 TWh. Wind generation through the first nine months of this year totaled 87 TWh, up 4% compared with the same period in 2024 and 36% since the same period in 2021. Together, wind and solar generation met 36% of ERCOT’s electricity demand in the first nine months of 2025.

Natural gas-fired generation also increased after 2021 but flattened more recently. Natural gas-fired generation between January and September increased to 161 TWh in 2023, 24% more than the same period in 2021. Since 2023, natural gas-fired generation remained relatively flat, totaling 158 TWh between January and September 2025. Although it is still the largest source of electricity for ERCOT, natural gas-fired generation averaged 43% in the first nine months of 2025, compared with 47% in the first nine months of 2023 and 2024.

The types of energy sources used for electricity generation can vary on an hourly basis, especially during the summer. Solar output is highest during midday hours, and the increased availability of solar generation in ERCOT in recent years has reduced the need for natural gas-fired generation during that time of the day. Solar generators in ERCOT produced an average of 24 gigawatts (GW) between noon and 1:00 p.m. during the summer months of June through September compared with an average of 12 GW of solar generation at noon in the summer months of 2023. Over the same period, the share of natural gas-fired generation at midday fell from 50% in 2023 to 37% in 2025.

Batteries store electricity during daytime when generation from wind and solar is the highest, and they supply electricity when generation from wind and solar is declining. Beginning in October 2024, ERCOT began reporting battery output separately in its hourly grid data. In the summer months of 2025, batteries helped supply electricity in the evening as solar output declined, supplying an average of 4 GW in the 8:00 p.m. hour.

ERCOT’s electricity demand is forecast to grow faster than that of any other grid operator in the United States through at least 2026. In our October Short-Term Energy Outlook, we forecast demand will rise another 14% in the first nine months of 2026 compared with the same period this year, reaching 425 TWh.",https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/ERCOT-electricity-sources-trend-change-3.png,N,,2025-10-25 11:20:28.050535

Our two BESS projects are currently in the proposal stage. We are preparing an application to submit to the LT2 RFP. We are conducting community engagement, assembling the submission materials, and requesting a Municipal Support Resolution (MSR) from Council. If awarded an MSR, we would finalize the LT2 application submission. Please note that neither the MSR nor our application guarantees a contract award. If we are selected for a contract, we would then proceed with detailed permitting a nd development work; only after meeting all regulatory requirements (Municipal, MECP, ESA, etc.) would we finalize engineering and move into procurement and construction.

Post-award approvals (including but not limited to)

Municipal approvals: Official Plan and Zoning By-law review or amendment, Site Plan Approval, and Building Permit.

Provincial approvals: Environmental Compliance Approvals (MECP) for stormwater or sewage works, and coordination with other provincial bodies (e.g., conservation authorities, heritage or natural feature reviews) as applicable.

Electrical Safety Authority (ESA) approvals: Plan review, electrical permits, inspections, and connection authorization under the Ontario Electrical Safety Code (OESC).

Specific requirements may vary by municipality and site. All applicable processes will be followed, and the public will be updated as key milestones are reached.

Developer Information and Procurement Participation

The project owner, SUNN LT23 Corp., is a subsidiary of PowerBank Corp., a Canadian renewable and clean energy project developer and asset operator. Since 2013, PowerBank has advanced the growth of renewable and clean energy projects, helping to reduce carbon emissions through its development, engineering, and asset management services across Canada and the United States.

We are currently preparing applications for the IESO’s Long-Term 2 (LT2) RFP (C-1), which are due on December 18, 2025. If selected for a contract, permitting and development activities would begin in late 2026, following all applicable protocols related to safety, environmental protection, wetland conservation, and visual screening. Construction is anticipated to begin in 2027 at the earliest, with commercial operation expected by 2030. The project will operate for 20 years under the LT2 contract.

Environmental and Community Impact

Community

Community engagement includes an open house held on September 22, 2025, at 6:30 p.m. at the McGregor Recreation Centre (800 Lakeshore Dr, Shuniah, ON). This meeting provided community members with an opportunity to learn about the project and ask questions directly to the project team. Ongoing communication will continue throughout development and operation. A Community Benefits Agreement, to be entered into with the Municipality of Shuniah, will guide how the project supports local priorities and ensures that the surrounding area benefits directly from the investment over its lifetime.

Economy

The projects will support local economic growth by creating employment opportunities during the construction phase — including jobs for construction workers, electricians, and other skilled trades. Over the long term, operations and maintenance activities will provide stable technical positions and ongoing employment. The projects will also generate municipal tax revenue that contributes to essential public services and infrastructure improvements.

Environment

By storing clean energy and releasing it when needed, the projects will help optimize Ontario’s electricity grid using proven, safe technology. This supports the province’s climate goals, reduces reliance on fossil fuels, and lowers greenhouse gas emissions — all while maintaining a minimal environmental footprint.

Technology and How It Works

BESS plays a crucial role in storing excess electricity, making it available during peak demand or supply disruptions. This reduces reliance on costly and environmentally harmful peaking plants. Through this approach, BESS helps stabilize the grid, ensuring that Ontario’s energy system can meet both growing and peak demand using cost-effective and environmentally friendly solutions. The project contributes to the creation of a flexible and resilient power grid that aligns with the government’s long-term energy goals, while also minimizing environmental impact and maintaining affordability for consumers.

Fire Safety and Protection

Safety is built into both the equipment and the overall project design from the start.

The system is remotely monitored 24/7/365. It can be remotely shut off.

All equipment meets strict safety certifications and follows national safety standards, such as:

NFPA 855

UL 9540 and 9540A

Before construction begins, we will work closely with local fire departments to plan safe access, training, and prepare a full emergency response plan.

Expected Timeline

December 2025: Application Submission

The project team will prepare and submit the full proposal to the IESO as part of the Long-Term 2 (LT2) procurement. This is the first key milestone and marks the official entry into the selection process for grid-connected battery storage projects in Ontario.

Fall 2026: Development Phase Begins

With contracts in place, the project moves into detailed engineering, permitting, procurement, and construction mobilization. This phase covers site preparation, equipment manufacturing, and early construction activities.

2029 – 2030: Commercial Operation Date (COD)

The BESS is expected to reach full commercial operation within this window. Once operational, the system will begin providing grid services such as peak load management, renewable energy integration, and improved grid reliability.

Frequently Asked Questions

Why do we need Battery Energy Storage Systems?

Battery storage plays a critical role in keeping Ontario’s power system stable and reliable. It stores clean energy when demand is low and releases it when demand is high, helping prevent blackouts and grid stress. It also supports renewable energy by storing power when the sun isn’t shining or the wind isn’t blowing, ensuring consistent electricity supply even when natural conditions change.

What is the current status of this project?

The project is currently in the application stage. The project team is preparing the submission for the IESO’s Long-Term 2 (LT2) procurement while conducting preliminary site studies and coordinating required municipal and provincial approvals. Once the permitting process is complete and approvals are secured, construction will begin, followed by testing and commissioning. If selected for a contract, the project would be expected to reach commercial operation by May 1st, 2030.

How safe is BESS technology?

Battery storage has been safely deployed in thousands of projects around the world with a strong safety record. Systems are designed with multiple layers of protection, designed to prevent any thermal event before it should occur. Lithium iron phosphate (LFP) chemistry, used in modern BESS, is much more stable and less flammable than older battery types. Fires are extremely rare, and the technology meets strict international standards.

What happens in the unlikely event of a BESS incident?

The risk of fire is very low, but safety systems are designed to keep it contained if it occurs. Battery units are built to prevent fires from spreading, and the design ensures it does not propagate. If a fire does occur, it will burn itself out without releasing harmful chemicals. Any gas produced disperses rapidly, and air quality impacts are minimal. People can remain in nearby areas safely.

We work closely with local fire departments — including volunteer teams — to ensure they receive specific BESS training and are fully prepared, including an Emergency Response Plan. The site is designed with wide access roads and clear entry points for emergency vehicles

What is the environmental impact of the BESS?

The BESS is a fully containerized system, meaning all battery components are enclosed within sealed, weatherproof units designed to prevent any interaction with soil or groundwater. These systems use non-toxic materials and do not release harmful substances during normal operation or in the unlikely event of an incident. They pose no risk to groundwater, drinking water, or nearby ecosystems.

The project will comply with all applicable environmental regulations and permitting requirements, including those of the local Conservation Authority, to ensure protection of natural features, wetlands, and watercourses. The LFP (lithium iron phosphate) chemistry used is among the safest and most stable available, producing no toxic runoff or long-term contamination.

What impact will this project have on the local community?

The project is designed to minimize its visual and physical footprint. Low-profile fencing and landscaping will limit visibility from nearby roads and homes, and noise will remain well within provincial standards. Property values are not expected to be affected. Safety buffers, vegetation clearance, and other proactive measures will ensure the site remains secure and non-intrusive.

What economic and social benefits will the project bring?

The project will create local construction and maintenance jobs, generate tax revenue, and support local community with a Community Benefits Agreement. It will also improve grid reliability, support local industry and economic growth, and strengthen the grid resilience by ensuring reliable electricity during peak demand or emergencies.

What happens when the BESS reaches end-of-life?

When the system reaches the end of its operational life, it will be safely decommissioned. Equipment will be removed, the site will be restored to its original condition as much as possible, and all battery materials will be responsibly recycled as per the requirements. Decommissioning plan is a requirement of the lease and typically a part of the permitting process.",https://powerbankcorp.com/wp-content/uploads/favicon-1.svg,N,,2025-10-25 07:18:12.215679

The risk to the taxpayer is nil,” Santee Cooper Board Chairman Peter McCoy said.
The permits to build and the licenses to operate the nuclear plants will need to be renewed, likely starting from scratch, Clements said.
Santee Cooper heard from 70 bidders and received 15 formal proposals to restart construction of the reactors.
“You have placed South Carolina in the epicenter of the resurgence of nuclear power in the United States,” Santee Cooper CEO Jimmy Staton said.","COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) — South Carolina’s state-owned utility is looking to a private company to revive a project to build two nuclear power plants that was abandoned eight years ago, losing more than $9 billion without generating a watt of power.

Santee Cooper’s board agreed Friday to start six weeks of negotiations with Brookfield Asset Management that they hope will lead to a deal that lets the private company build the nuclear plants at the V.C. Summer site near Jenkinsville at their own risk to generate power that they could mostly sell to whom they want, such as energy-gobbling data centers.

Santee Cooper said Brookfield preliminarily agreed to provide the utility with some of the power generated. But that and probably thousands of other details will have to be negotiated. In a twist, Brookfield took over the assets of Westinghouse Electric Co., which had to declare bankruptcy because of difficulties building new nuclear reactors.

Utility officials said the agreement gives hope the state can get something out of a debacle that led to four executives going to prison or home confinement for lying to regulators, shareholders, ratepayers and investigators and left millions of people paying for decades for a project that never produced electricity.

“The risk to the ratepayer is nil. The risk to the taxpayer is nil,” Santee Cooper Board Chairman Peter McCoy said.

There are still too many hurdles for the project to get past to consider this a win right now, said Tom Clements, executive director of the nuclear watchdog group Savannah River Site Watch.

After eight years in the elements, all the equipment and the structure of the plant, which was less than halfway finished, will need to be carefully inspected before it can be used. The permits to build and the licenses to operate the nuclear plants will need to be renewed, likely starting from scratch, Clements said.

“I still believe that the cost, technical and regulatory hurdles are too big to lead to completion of the project,” Clements said, adding the agreement appears to let Brookfield walk away if it decide it’s not feasible.

Santee Cooper heard from 70 bidders and received 15 formal proposals to restart construction of the reactors. Interest in the project has grown as power demand in the U.S. surges with the increase in data centers as artificial intelligence technology develops.

Santee Cooper executives credited President Donald Trump’s executive order in May calling for the U.S. to quadruple the amount of power generated by nuclear plants over the next 25 years for opening the door to the potential agreement.

“You have placed South Carolina in the epicenter of the resurgence of nuclear power in the United States,” Santee Cooper CEO Jimmy Staton said.

Santee Cooper was the minority partner with what was then South Carolina Electric and Gas when construction on the two new nuclear plants started in 2013 at the V.C. Summer site — about 25 miles (40 kilometers) northeast of Columbia — where SCE&G was already operating a reactor.

The project needed to be finished in seven years to get tax credits to keep the project’s cost from overwhelming the utilities, but it ended up behind schedule almost immediately.

Executives lied about the problems to keep money coming in. Taxpayers and ratepayers ended up on the hook because of a state law that allowed the utilities to charge for costs before any power was generated.",https://www.wccbcharlotte.com/content/uploads/2025/10/n/h/ap25297648011787-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-10-25 12:08:27.493144

EVANSVILLE, Indiana – Today, CenterPoint Energy announced an intention to delay plans to retire Unit 3 of its F.B. Culley Generating Station, backtracking on their commitment to be entirely coal-free by 2027. In previous CenterPoint plans, the utility wrote that “Coal plants have not been able to consistently compete on short term marginal price with renewable and gas energy” and that the plants, being old and outdated, were not designed to frequently cycle on and off, resulting in “increased maintenance costs and more frequent outages.”

Unit 3 of the Culley power plant has continued to have reliability issues and power outages, requiring costly upkeep and maintenance for CenterPoint that was then passed onto customers. Extending the life of the Culley plant poses more threats to reliability and affordability for customers.

Although the lowest cost resource plans in this study include retiring Culley Unit 3, CenterPoint did not even study a retirement prior to 2032.

In response, Nicole Chandler, Southwest Indiana Beyond Coal Campaign Organizer, released the following statement:

“The Culley coal plant is outdated, expensive, and unreliable. There’s no reason for CenterPoint to try to extend the life of a 50-year-old coal plant that continues to have power outages and costs even more to upkeep and maintain, while CenterPoint customers have been saddled with some of the highest utility bills in Indiana for years now.

“Instead of prioritizing solar and wind that’s more affordable and reliable for customers, the Trump Administration and Indiana legislators have continued to double down on expensive, polluting, and unreliable coal that costs more for all of us to keep our lights on and heat our homes. We can’t afford to keep throwing lifelines to coal. CenterPoint should stick to the promise they made to their customers by retiring coal at Culley and transitioning to clean energy, not backtrack and leave us with higher energy bills for years to come.”

Several interested parties petitioned for review of the CTC Final Rule, and, after consolidation in the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals, EPA announced its decision to reconsider the CTC Final Rule in September 2025.

The CTC Final Rule would implement TSCA’s requirement that EPA address any unreasonable risk of injury identified in a TSCA risk evaluation and apply requirements so that the chemical no longer presents unreasonable risk.

While EPA will receive comments on any aspect of the CTC Final Rule, it has specifically requested comment on the appropriate exposure limit for CTC. In full, EPA is looking at:

The Existing Chemical Exposure Limit (ECEL) of 0.03 parts per million (ppm) as an 8-hour time weighted average (TWA) promulgated in the CTC final rule as part of the Workplace Chemical Protection Program (WCPP), including feasibility of exposure monitoring and whether the use of a different exposure limit would be more appropriate to inform risk management.

(Reuters) — U.S. natural gas dealmaking has surged in 2025 and is set to accelerate, analysts say, driven by record power demand from AI data centers, rising LNG exports and renewed Asian investment.

The United States is poised to see a record surge in power demand this year, led by data centers' outsized energy needs, the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) says.

A steep pullback in benchmark gas prices last year from 2022's multi-decade highs after sanctions on Russia slowed talks, but a subsequent rebound, along with long-term LNG and domestic demand, has kept global buyers active.

Already the world's top LNG exporter, the United States is set to lift nameplate capacity to 115 million tons per annum (MTPA) this year, EIA data show.

The ramp-up has reignited mergers and acquisitions across key shale basins and the LNG value chain, with deal value climbing to about $30 billion in the first nine months of 2025 from $22.5 billion a year earlier, according to Rystad Energy.

More than $28 billion in gas and LNG assets are currently up for sale, Rystad's Palash Ravi said, citing potential deals involving Ascent Resources, BP, GeoSouthern, Williams and NextDecade's Rio Grande project.

In the Haynesville basin, Asian firms will outbid U.S. producers to secure feedstock for LNG imports, said Enverus analyst Andrew Dittmar.

U.S. LNG shipments to Asia are set to hit 3.61 million tons in October, the second-highest on record, driven by regional growth, cleaner energy goals, and Taiwan’s recent closure of its last remaining nuclear reactor.

Under the terms of the agreement, Don Jones, founder and managing partner of Verite Capital, will become a minority owner of Buffalo Biodiesel and assume the role of chairman of the board upon full completion of the funding.

The funding will support the construction of two new renewable natural gas (RNG) plants, with one located in the Northeast and another in Mississippi. At full funding, Buffalo Biodiesel expects to add more than 600 new employees as it scales its operations and processing infrastructure. The funding rollout will occur in three stages, aiming to support growth throughout “all states east of the Mississippi” once the rollout is fully executed.

“This partnership marks a pivotal moment not just for our company, but for the region’s clean-energy future,” Sumit Majumdar, president and CEO of Buffalo Biodiesel, says. “With Verite’s backing, we can double down on our mission: collecting used cooking oil from tens of thousands of restaurants, converting organic waste into renewable natural gas and expanding sustainably from Montreal down to Miami. The two new plants and the hundreds of new jobs they bring will deliver real economic impact across underserved markets.”

Dive Brief:

Levi Strauss & Co. is updating its water strategy to reduce freshwater use across its operations and boost water recycling and reuse within its manufacturing process, the company announced Thursday.

The denim giant said it aims to cut its freshwater use by 15% across its garment manufacturing supply chain and processing facilities by 2030, compared to a 2022 baseline. These processes include cutting, sewing, laundry — activities the company said have the “largest impacts to water and nature” — and fabric dyeing and weaving.

Levi’s also has a goal to recycle and reuse 40% of water consumed during its manufacturing process by 2030 and has plans to publish an industry guide on water conservation and restoration.

Dive Insight:

The apparel manufacturer said it has a 2030 target for all of its direct discharge supplier facilities to achieve the “foundational” level established by the Zero Discharge of Hazardous Chemicals Foundation — an organization which seeks to help the fashion industry phase out harmful substances from their supply chain and help brands and suppliers manage chemicals more sustainably.

Levi’s said it also aims for 25% of these facilities to hit the “progressive” level established by the ZDHC framework. This level entails facilities adopting advanced wastewater treatment processes and exhibiting a deeper knowledge of chemical management practices, according to the framework.

The company’s updated water strategy builds on goals it established in 2019 to reduce freshwater use across its manufacturing processes by 50% in areas of high-water stress by 2025, compared to a 2018 baseline. However, the company said it was only able to achieve 27% of this target by the end of 2024, causing it to revise its strategy and target date.

Levi’s new water stewardship strategy comes almost a year after the company unveiled its first climate transition plan. At the time, the company committed to achieving net-zero emissions across its supply chain by 2050 and set a few near-term sustainability targets. These included a goal to reduce absolute scope 1 and scope 2 greenhouse gas emissions by 90% by 2025, compared to a 2016 baseline, as well as a goal to cut absolute scope 3 emissions by 42% by 2030, compared to a 2022 baseline.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/SnlJAaxEDHBG3xTdYqQQbAiTbYrCwMy_-SN_5KTwIQk/g:nowe:0:397/c:3923:2216/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9JTUctMTUzMC5qcGc=.webp,N,,2025-10-25 01:17:42.726746

Subscribe now and take control of your AI investment future!","When Jeff Bezos said that one breakthrough technology would shape Amazon’s destiny, even Wall Street’s biggest analysts were caught off guard.

Fast forward a year and Amazon’s new CEO Andy Jassy described generative AI as a “once-in-a-lifetime” technology that is already being used across Amazon to reinvent customer experiences.

At the 8th Future Investment Initiative conference, Elon Musk predicted that by 2040 there would be at least 10 billion humanoid robots, with each priced between $20,000 and $25,000.

Do the math. According to Musk, this technology could be worth $250 trillion by 2040.

Put another way, that’s roughly equal to:

175 Teslas

107 Amazons

140 Metas

84 Googles

65 Microsofts

And 55 Nvidias

And here’s the wild part — this $250 trillion wave isn’t tied to one company, but to an entire ecosystem of AI innovators set to reshape the global economy.

It’s a leap so massive, it could reshape how businesses, governments, and consumers operate worldwide.

Even if that $250 trillion figure sounds ambitious, major firms like PwC and McKinsey still see AI unlocking multi-trillion-dollar potential.

How could anything be worth that much?

The answer lies in a breakthrough so powerful it’s redefining how humanity works, learns, and creates.

And this breakthrough has already set off a frenzy among hedge funds and Wall Street’s top investors.

What most investors don’t realize is that one under-owned company holds the key to this $250 trillion revolution.

In fact, Verge argues this company’s supercheap AI technology should concern rivals.

Before I reveal the details, let’s talk about how some of the richest people on the planet are positioning themselves.

Bill Gates sees artificial intelligence as the “biggest technological advance in my lifetime,” more transformative than the internet or personal computer, capable of improving healthcare, education, and addressing climate change.

Larry Ellison — through Oracle, is spending billions on Nvidia chips and partnering with Cohere to embed generative AI across Oracle’s cloud and apps.

Warren Buffett — not known for tech hype — says this breakthrough could have a ‘hugely beneficial social impact.

When billionaires from Silicon Valley to Wall Street line up behind the same idea — you know it’s worth paying attention to.

Even as we admire what Tesla, Nvidia, Alphabet, and Microsoft have built, we believe an even greater opportunity lies elsewhere…

But the real story isn’t Nvidia — it’s a much smaller company quietly improving the critical technology that makes this entire revolution possible.

And judging by what I’m hearing from both Silicon Valley insiders and Wall Street veterans…

This prediction might not be bold at all:

Artificial intelligence is the greatest investment opportunity of our lifetime. The time to invest in groundbreaking AI is now, and this stock is a steal!

AI is eating the world—and the machines behind it are ravenous.

Each ChatGPT query, each model update, each robotic breakthrough consumes massive amounts of energy. In fact, AI is already pushing global power grids to the brink.

Wall Street is pouring hundreds of billions into artificial intelligence—training smarter chatbots, automating industries, and building the digital future. But there’s one urgent question few are asking:

Where will all of that energy come from?

AI is the most electricity-hungry technology ever invented. Each data center powering large language models like ChatGPT consumes as much energy as a small city. And it’s about to get worse.

Even Sam Altman, the founder of OpenAI, issued a stark warning:

“The future of AI depends on an energy breakthrough.”

Elon Musk was even more blunt:

“AI will run out of electricity by next year.”

As the world chases faster, smarter machines, a hidden crisis is emerging behind the scenes. Power grids are strained. Electricity prices are rising. Utilities are scrambling to expand capacity.

And that’s where the real opportunity lies…

One little-known company—almost entirely overlooked by most AI investors—could be the ultimate backdoor play. It’s not a chipmaker. It’s not a cloud platform. But it might be the most important AI stock in the US owns critical energy infrastructure assets positioned to feed the coming AI energy spike.

As demand from AI data centers explodes, this company is gearing up to profit from the most valuable commodity in the digital age: electricity.

The “Toll Booth” Operator of the AI Energy Boom

It owns critical nuclear energy infrastructure assets, positioning it at the heart of America’s next-generation power strategy.

It’s one of the only global companies capable of executing large-scale, complex EPC (engineering, procurement, and construction) projects across oil, gas, renewable fuels, and industrial infrastructure.

It plays a pivotal role in U.S. LNG exportation—a sector about to explode under President Trump’s renewed “America First” energy doctrine.

Trump has made it clear: Europe and U.S. allies must buy American LNG.

And our company sits in the toll booth—collecting fees on every drop exported.

But that’s not all…

As Trump’s proposed tariffs push American manufacturers to bring their operations back home, this company will be first in line to rebuild, retrofit, and reengineer those facilities.

AI. Energy. Tariffs. Onshoring. This One Company Ties It All Together.

While the world is distracted by flashy AI tickers, a few smart investors are quietly scooping up shares of the one company powering it all from behind the scenes.

AI needs energy. Energy needs infrastructure.

And infrastructure needs a builder with experience, scale, and execution.

This company has its finger in every pie—and Wall Street is just starting to notice.

Wall Street is noticing this company also because it is quietly riding all of these tailwinds—without the sky-high valuation.

While most energy and utility firms are buried under mountains of debt and coughing up hefty interest payments just to appease bondholders…

This company is completely debt-free.

In fact, it’s sitting on a war chest of cash—equal to nearly one-third of its entire market cap.

It also owns a huge equity stake in another red-hot AI play, giving investors indirect exposure to multiple AI growth engines without paying a premium.

And here’s what the smart money has started whispering…

The Hedge Fund Secret That’s Starting to Leak Out

This stock is so off-the-radar, so absurdly undervalued, that some of the most secretive hedge fund managers in the world have begun pitching it at closed-door investment summits.

They’re sharing it quietly, away from the cameras, to rooms full of ultra-wealthy clients.

Why? Because excluding cash and investments, this company is trading at less than 7 times earnings.

And that’s for a business tied to:

The AI infrastructure supercycle

The onshoring boom driven by Trump-era tariffs

A surge in U.S. LNG exports

And a unique footprint in nuclear energy—the future of clean, reliable power

You simply won’t find another AI and energy stock this cheap… with this much upside.

This isn’t a hype stock. It’s not riding on hope.

It’s delivering real cash flows, owns critical infrastructure, and holds stakes in other major growth stories.

This is your chance to get in before the rockets take off!

Disruption is the New Name of the Game: Let’s face it, complacency breeds stagnation.

AI is the ultimate disruptor, and it’s shaking the foundations of traditional industries.

The companies that embrace AI will thrive, while the dinosaurs clinging to outdated methods will be left in the dust.

Wright sent the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission a rule on Thursday that allows customers to file joint, co-located load and generation interconnection requests. The energy department said the rule would reduce study times and costs for improving the grid, while reducing the time needed for additional power to come online. The rule also pushes FERC to mull whether reviews for grid projects, which sometimes take years, can be done in 60 days.

As U.S. power demand spikes for the first time in two decades on artificial intelligence, President Donald Trump’s administration is trying to boost power capacity, mainly from fossil fuel and nuclear plants, and grid access for the data center industry.

Energy secretaries can direct FERC, an independent panel of the Energy Department set to have a 3-2 Republican majority, to consider rules, but cannot force it to adopt them.

Edison Electric Institute, which represents publicly-traded electric utilities, said it supported Wright’s effort, saying it would strengthen the grid and drive down costs for customers.

An environmentalist slammed the move. “Pushing FERC to rubber-stamp connections in just 60 days while the government’s shut down and Trump builds a $300 million White House ballroom shows (how) out of touch his administration is from everyday Americans,” said Camden Weber of environmental group Center for Biological Diversity.

Wright also urged FERC to consider a rule to remove burdens for preliminary hydroelectric permits.

Malcolm Woolf, president and CEO of the National Hydropower Association, praised Wright’s move. “It is incumbent upon FERC, the Trump Administration, and Congress to ensure that third parties, such as Federal resource agencies, do not unduly inhibit hydropower development and instead foster its necessary growth to meet current challenges.”

IRVING, TEXAS – Caterpillar Inc. (NYSE: CAT) announced that Indiana will be among the first states to receive funding from its five-year, $100 million workforce pledge, and has committed up to $5 million to training and upskilling efforts across the state. The pledge, announced as part of the company’s Centennial celebration, aims to grow interest in advanced manufacturing careers and prepare U.S workers for the future, unlocking quality jobs and industry-wide innovation.

“The future workforce will need skills for what comes next,” said Caterpillar Chief Human Resources Officer Christy Pambianchi. “We have our experts working on innovative training and resources to help skill and inform the next generation on how to navigate the worksite of tomorrow, and we’re excited to be starting here in Indiana to enable U.S. workers to enter high-quality jobs in the American manufacturing industry.”

Caterpillar will announce future workforce pledges in other states soon.

“Indiana is proud to be among the first states selected for Caterpillar’s workforce investment, which is a testament to our pro-growth policies, world-class workforce, and reputation as one of the best states in America to start and grow a business,” said Governor Braun. “Caterpillar’s continued commitment to Indiana demonstrates the strength of our business climate and our shared vision for the future of American manufacturing. We look forward to working together to prepare more Hoosiers for the high-quality careers of tomorrow.”

Caterpillar made the future workforce announcement at the company’s large engine facility in Lafayette, Indiana, which recently announced a $725 million capital expansion – one of the largest single manufacturing investments in the company’s global history – to greatly increase engine production and help meet the nation’s growing power needs.

“The demand for energy is increasing like never before,” said Jason Kaiser, Caterpillar Energy & Transportation Group President. “Many of the engines manufactured here in Lafayette will support power generation customers by providing reliable power – keeping operations running during outages and helping meet the growing energy needs driven by AI, data centers and other critical infrastructure across America and around the world.”

One of America’s oldest manufacturers, Caterpillar is a part of the country’s infrastructure, with more than 65 primary locations across 25 states and independent dealers from coast to coast. As a net exporter, Caterpillar workers in the United States build products that are shipped around the world, growing U.S. exports by 75% since 2016.

Caterpillar employs 51,000 people in the United States, including over 4,100 workers at 12 facilities across Indiana.

The funds are expected to help the startup scale its patented 3D solar towers which are designed to have high levels of energy density for space-constrained areas. The product has applications for data centers, EV charging hubs, telecom towers, universities, and a range of industrial facilities, said Janta Power.

Janta said its single-axis sun tracking tower’s geometry achieves approximately three times the solar surface area exposure of traditional flat arrays in the same land footprint. Each tower’s stacked vertical design captures both low-angle morning and evening light, producing a dual-peak power curve that better aligns with real energy demand, said the company.

The company said its solar tower has a capacity factor 50% greater than traditional solar installations. Capacity factor is the amount of actual electricity produced as compared to the theoretical maximum capacity of solar installed. While typical flat installations have a capacity factor of about 22%, Janta Power said its typical installations achieve a capacity factor of about 32%.

The company said it can achieve a levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) as low as $0.05 kWh.

The company currently offers a 5 kW solar tower, with 1.5 kW rooftop models as well as 8.5 kW and 10 kW towers under development.

The towers are currently deployed in pilot programs at major global airports, including Munich International Airport, and Dallas–Fort Worth International Airport.

Each structure is engineered to withstand winds of at least 110 miles per hour and as much as 170 mph, and feature steel construction and modular helical or pier foundations that eliminate the need for extensive grading, said Janta Power.

While single-axis tracker installations concentrate output near midday, Janta said its 3D configuration smooths energy delivery throughout the day, reducing ramp stress on grids and lowering reliance on peaker plants.

While energy services, including utility gas, were down for September by about 0.7%, the cost of these services was also up by 6.4% for the year.

Only prices for energy commodities, including gasoline, saw yearly decreases of about 0.5%. However, gasoline prices did rise month to month by 4.1%.

Broadly, energy prices increased by 1.5% from the month of August and were also up by 2.8% for the year.

Electricity prices have steadily risen since President Donald Trump took office in January, making it difficult for the president to keep his campaign promise of slashing the cost of energy and electricity in half.

INFLATION TICKED UP TO 3% IN SEPTEMBER AS SHUTDOWN DRAGS ON

“Under my administration, we will be slashing energy and electricity prices by half within 12 months, at a maximum 18 months,” Trump said during an August 2024 campaign rally in North Carolina.

“We’re going to get your energy prices down. We’re going to get your energy prices down by 50%,” he echoed just a few days later during a Pennsylvania rally.

As prices remain high, Trump and his administration have pinned the blame on the deployment of renewable energy resources combined with the accelerated phaseout of fossil fuels.

Electricity experts have insisted that the underlying cause of soaring prices is not that simple, pointing to factors such as the replacement and maintenance of transmission lines, risk mitigation for extreme weather, and increased costs associated with maintaining and operating older power plants.

Plus, Energy Information Administration data compiled by the American Clean Power Association this fall revealed that the top 10 states with the largest share of renewables in their energy makeup have also seen significantly smaller electricity price hikes over the last year when compared to the national average.

Paul Cicio, chairman of the Electricity Transmission Competition Coalition, said he believes that transmission costs have been the biggest driver of rising costs.

He has repeatedly urged the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to pass an order that would require transmission projects to be subject to competitive bids, which he has claimed can reduce costs by about 25%.

“Competition promises fair prices for Americans. A competitive market means accountability, innovation, reliability, efficiency, and modernization,” Cicio said in a statement.

Project Stakeholders Celebrate as Construction on Nimbus Pushes Forward

Nimbus Wind Farm Blade Signing Event

GREEN FOREST, Ark., Oct. 24, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Scout Clean Energy (“Scout”), a leading North American renewable energy developer-owner-operator, held a blade signing event yesterday at the Nimbus Wind Farm (“Nimbus”) in Green Forest, Arkansas, joining project stakeholders to celebrate the project’s successful progress as construction continues. Joining Scout staff at the event were construction and financing partners, community members and officials, as well as many of the 50+ landowners participating in the project.

Scout began development of the 180 MW Nimbus project, located in Northwest Arkansas’ Carroll County, in 2016. Construction is expected to finish early next year, after which the project will begin commercial operations and start generating enough electricity to power more than 40,000 homes annually.

“Nimbus is nearing completion after a decade of hard work by our team and the support of our incredible landowners, stakeholders, site workers, and the community that is making the project a reality,” said Michael Rucker, Founder and CEO of Scout Clean Energy. “The blade signing honors that work and allows us to pause to memorialize their contributions by signing a turbine blade that will fly above the project.”

Joining construction officials from Scout were representatives from MasTec, the general contractor for Nimbus. Construction commenced for the project in late 2024.

“From unpredictable weather to rugged terrain, the path to completion has demanded innovation, perseverance, and teamwork,” said Brendon Lamppa, VP of Wind Construction at MasTec Renewables. “Seeing the hard work of so many skilled individuals and community partners come to fruition through those challenges is the ultimate reward. The Nimbus Wind Farm will stand as a lasting source of renewable energy and economic value for Carroll County and the surrounding region for years to come.”

Electricity generated by the project will enter the Midcontinent Independent System Operator’s (MISO’s) grid at the Dry Creek Substation in Green Forest.

Santee Cooper Selects Brookfield to Complete Two AP1000s at V C Summer

Brookfield, the Canadian private equity firm that holds a majority share of the ownership of Westinghouse, has been selected by South Carolina utility Santee Cooper to complete two partially built Westinghouse 1,150 MW AP1000 PWR type nuclear reactors.

Brookfield won the VC Summer development contract with the main factor being a commitment to paying down $2.7 billion of an existing $3.6 billion obligation Santee Cooper has on the site and sharing ownership and power. Ratepayers have been stuck with the debt since the project collapsed in 2017. Neither unit is more than 50% complete.

Three other bidders reached the best and final stage out of a reported field of 15 interested firms. The other bidders were reported to be the Nuclear Company, Elementl and the Oppenheimer Project. Brookfield’s proposal was the only one which put $2.7 billion on the table to address ratepayer obligations tied to the new project.

The company also agreed to allow Santee Cooper to retain a 25% stake in the final project – and receive 25% of the power it provided (at a below market cost). None of the other bidders had the financial capabilities to make a commitment to pay off the debt as part of the deal.

The utility launched a competitive bidding process in January 2025, receiving initial expressions of interest from over 70 potential bidders and 15 formal proposals. Working with industry experts, Santee Cooper developed key financial, risk mitigation and execution criteria by which the final proposals were measured.

Centerview Partners LLC served as financial advisor to Santee Cooper on the competitive process to sell its interest in the two partially built AP1000 nuclear units. J.P. Morgan also served as financial advisor to Santee Cooper.

What’s Next for the V C Summer Project?

Where things stand now is that the Santee Cooper Board of Directors approved on 10/24/25 a letter of intent with Brookfield Asset Management. The letter of intent establishes a six-week initial project feasibility period.

In that period, the parties will jointly select a project manager and evaluate construction providers that would be used in resuming construction of the two nuclear units. The six weeks also would allow for advanced discussions with entities interested in buying nuclear power generated by the units and facilitate additional due diligence, leading to execution of a Memorandum of Understanding.

Santee Cooper President and CEO Jimmy Staton said, “As we move closer to a final deal, our goal remains the same: to enable completion of these two units and thus provide 2,200 MW of carbon-free, reliable nuclear power that delivers energy security for South Carolina and specific benefits to Santee Cooper customers who are paying our initial investment.”

Staton noted that Santee Cooper’s strategic decision to maintain the equipment over the past eight years positions the V C Summer units for a quicker and less costly path to completion.

“The state of the units, and the fact that they use the same Westinghouse AP1000 technology that is now operating in Georgia and overseas, make these assets very attractive to the nuclear power industry.”

One key element of resuming construction is the continued involvement of Westinghouse Electric Co., which designed and owns the AP 1000 technology. “Brookfield is a majority owner of Westinghouse, which added to their proposal,” Staton said.

Completion of the two units could:

Generate thousands of temporary construction jobs.

Generate hundreds of highly skilled, permanent operational jobs.

Strengthen and diversify South Carolina’s energy portfolio.

Enhance grid reliability.

Help attract new industries, bringing more jobs and other economic benefits.

Unhappy Losing Bidder Writes a Strong Letter of Protest

According to a letter written by the CEO of the Nuclear Company, the firms withdrew its proposal. The firm had raised $100 million and hired a cadre of top level nuclear executive talent. It opened an office in Columbia, SC, and was widely seen as positioning itself win the business of completing the two reactors.

The letter challenged the utility on its assumptions tied to the cost of the restart and completion of the two reactors. The company’s CEP, Jonathan Webb, writtng from the company HQ in Lexington, KY, accused Santee Cooper of rigging the bidding process. (FITS News in South Carolina published the complete text of the letter on its website. The Nuclear Company did not respond to a media inquiry from Neutron Bytes. ( Full text of the letter – PDF file)

Webb wrote in his letter to the Santee Cooper board, “We are further concerned that the RFP process itself may have been fundamentally compromised by the evaluation of bids outside the established framework, by parties previously involved in the V.C. Summer project, and with access to information that the other parties did not have,”

“Sadly, this creates an uneven playing field and undermines the transparency and fairness essential to a project of this importance.”

“Restoring the confidence of South Carolinians in our ability to build nuclear power will require a transparent, rules-based process, one that ensures equitable treatment of all participants and safeguards the long-term interests of the people of South Carolina,” Webb continued.

“The lessons of this industry’s history are clear: when nuclear projects advance outside disciplined and transparent frameworks, the consequences are not hypothetical; they are catastrophic.”

Webb wrote in the letter that completing the two reactors would likely cost $20 billion. He noted that before a final investment decision is to be made that a six month period of technical and financial due diligence would be required to validate the design, assess site infrastructure, and build a project management organization.

Santee Cooper defended its decision. The utilituy did not address the concerns raised by CEO Webb. Instead it issued a statement on the benefits of its decision.

“Brookfield came to Santee Cooper with a proposal that set out the path to turn our prior nuclear investment into lasting value for our customers and all South Carolinians,” Santee Cooper board chairman Peter McCoy said in a statement.

“Our goals include completing these reactors with private money and no ratepayer or taxpayer expense, delivering financial relief to our customers and gaining significant additional power capacity for South Carolina. Brookfield’s proposal would do just that, and the company has the financial capability to stand behind its proposal.”

How V C Summer Went Wrong in 2017

It was the failure of one of the largest capital construction projects in the U.S. Every time another newspaper headline appeared about what went wrong at the V C Summer project, the dark implications of what it all means for the future of the nuclear energy industry got all the more foreboding.

A number of the principals at Westinghouse, SCE&G and Santee Cooper knew about the project’s problems and documented them to greater or lesser degrees as long as three years ago, 2014, that the project was a train wreck in the making that was racing towards a derailment of epic proportions. Eventually, four key executives were convicted of fraud in cases brought by the U.S. Department of Justice and sentenced to jail terms.

Instead of looking forward to a triumph for completion of two massive nuclear reactors generating 2300 MW of CO2 emission free electricity, the nation got endless political fallout, and lawsuits, plus billions in debt, which since 2017 have dominated the the complex contractual debris left behind like storm damage from a hurricane.

The failure of the V C Summer nuclear reactor effort had global implications for Westinghouse and for every country that planned to build nuclear reactors as CO2 emission free source of electrical power. Opponents of these projects at the policy level in government had a ready made anti-nuclear boogey man.

The surprise is that there are no surprises. All of the faults that caused the project in South Carolina to come to an early halt are with failures to follow project management schedule and cost control standard practices that have been known since Admiral Rickover supervised the construction of the first nuclear submarines in the 1950s. Gantt charts were developed as a project management innovation in 1910.

In addition, there were major supply chain woes ,including litigation, plus problems with compliance with nuclear quality standards and NRC regulations resulted in expensive rework.

Microreactor Company Announces Plans For Pilot Project At Texas University

Last Energy will use scaled-down version of its commercial PWR-20 plant

(NucNet) Microreactor developer Last Energy and the Texas A&M University System have announced plans for a microreactor pilot project at Texas A&M-Rellis, an applied research and advanced technology campus.

The project will feature Last Energy’s PWR-5, a microreactor design physically identical to the company’s commercial product, the PWR-20, scaled to 5 MW of electrical output. Last Energy said the PWR-5 will demonstrate low-power criticality and the ability to generate electricity for commercial output.

The PWR-20 is designed to be mass manufactured so production can be scaled to user demand. It is designed for flexible siting and “plug-and-play” installation.

Last Energy, which moved its corporate headquarters to Austin, Texas in May, has secured a lease agreement at Texas A&M-Rellis, procured a full-core load of fuel, signed an “other transaction agreement” (OTA) with the US Department of Energy (DOE) and begun formal licensing submissions with the NRC.

In February the Texas A&M University System selected four companies to explore developing advanced nuclear power reactors on the Rellis campus.

Each of the four companies, Kairos Power, Natura Resources, Aalo Atomics and Terrestrial Energy, could potentially build at least one commercial nuclear power plant at Rellis.

South Africa Reimagines the Pebble Bed Reactor

As part of a new Integrated Resource Plan, South Africa plans to invest in new effort to commercialize the pebble bed reactor. According to wire service reports, South Africa expects to lift the care and maintenance status of its Pebble Bed Modular Reactor (PBMR) by the first quarter of next year.

The pebble-bed reactor (PBR) is a design for a graphite-moderated, gas-cooled nuclear reactor. It is a type of very-high-temperature reactor (HTGR), one of the six classes of nuclear reactors in the Generation IV initiative.

South Africa shelved its PBMR research and development effort in 2010 after spending $980 million and before building a planned demonstration model. Several of the key technical leaders of the effort left South Africa going to work for US SMR developer X-Energy which has been working to develop a commercial 80 MW HTGR nuclear reactor.

Kgosientsho Ramokgopa, the electricity and energy minister, told a media briefing the work on the pebble bed project is part of a long range Integrated Resource Plan that will raise the use of gas and nuclear power to 16% of total energy generation. Dependence on coal will drop from 58% to 27% by 2042. South Africa relies on coal to generate the bulk of its electricity.

New nuclear generation capacity of 10 GW, most of its from conventional SMRs and full size nuclear reactors, is foreseen, with gas at 16 GW, wind at 34 GW and solar PV at 25 GW by 2039. All of these numbers are for now aspirational as the country must still figure out how to finance the IRP’s objectives.

The energy minister told Reuters, “We are seeing huge opportunities around the world, with major players on data centers the biggest investors on SMRs (small modular reactors).”

Duke Sets Plans for New Light Water Reactors and SMRs

(NucNet) Duke Energy has filed its 2025 long term energy plan outlining supply and infrastructure investments for North and South Carolina, including expanded plans for new nuclear generation to meet rapidly rising electricity demand.

The Carolinas Resource Plan is Duke Energy’s biennial roadmap for how the company is to meet future electricity needs across in the two southern states. The plan is reviewed by regulators in both North Carolina and South Carolina and updated every two years.

Duke said in a statement that the updated 2025 plan includes evaluation of both small modular reactors (SMRs) and large light-water reactors, targeting potential new nuclear capacity in service by 2037.

The statement said the company will expand licensing activities to preserve the option of developing either an SMR at its Belews Creek coal-fired site in North Carolina or a large-scale reactor unit at the William States site in South Carolina, which includes a new 750-MW combined-cycle natural gas plant, a 180-MW natural gas boiler and two dual-fuel 42-MW simple-cycle units.

The Lee site was previously selected by Duke more than a decade ago but the utility never broke ground to build twin AP1000s on the site. It cancelled the project in 2017. Since then electricity demand in the Carolinas is growing at eight times the rate of the past 15 years, driven by strong manufacturing and data center investments.

GLE Hits Technology Maturity Milestone for Laser Enrichment

(WNN) GLE, the exclusive licensee of the SILEX laser enrichment technology invented by Australian company Silex Sytems Ltd, began large-scale demonstration testing of the uranium enrichment process at its Test Loop facility in Wilmington, NC, in May. By mid-September, it had collected extensive performance data which the company said gave it the confidence that the process can be commercially deployed.

GLE has now reached TRL-6, as defined by the US Department of Energy’s DOE Technology Readiness Assessment Guide (G 413.3-4A), which means the technology has now been demonstrated in a relevant environment at the prototype or pilot scale, and is ready to move forward to full-scale systems.

The nine-point Technology Readiness Level (TRL) scale was pioneered by NASA in the 1980s as a measurement system to assess the maturity level of a particular technology, from TRL-1 (basic principles observed) through to TRL-9 (total system used successfully in project operations).

“In plain language, this independent validation means that GLE has demonstrated large-scale, integrated system performance under relevant operational conditions and that our schedule for initial commercial deployment is achievable,” GLE CEO Stephen Long said.

“We now turn our attention to full-scale detailed design and disciplined deployment of our Paducah Laser Enrichment Facility (PLEF) in Paducah, KY. The PLEF would be built from an entirely-US supply chain, maintaining control of this vital new technology in the US and is expected to create first-rate advanced manufacturing jobs not just in Paducah, but around the country.”

GLE said its commercial deployment is backed by more than $550 million in privately funded engineering, design, manufacturing, and licensing activities across North Carolina and Kentucky and is one of six companies awarded an Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity contract under the Department of Energy’s Low-Enriched Uranium program.

The company completed its full license application to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission for the Paducah Laser Enrichment Facility in July. If approved, the facility would represent a multi-billion-dollar investment opportunity in the state, creating more than 300 permanent jobs when the plant is in operation.

If commissioned, the facility is expected to re-enrich more than 200,000 tonnes of high-assay depleted uranium tails acquired from the US Department of Energy and produce up to 6 million separative work units of LEU annually, delivering a domestic, single-site solution for uranium, conversion, and enrichment.

American Fuel Resources Plans Re-Start of Uranium Deconversion Project

American Fuel Resources (AFR) announced that it has formally submitted an application in conjunction with International Isotopes, Inc. (INIS) to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) requesting approval for the transfer of Materials License Sub-1011 from INIS’s subsidiary, International Isotopes Fluorine Products, Inc. to AFR’s wholly owned subsidiary Green Salt Products, LLC (GSP). The 40- year license, issued in October 2012, is for a depleted uranium hexafluoride (DUF6) deconversion site in Lea County, NM.

The application marks a key milestone in AFR’s mission to expand America’s DUF6 deconversion capacity. Upon NRC approval and financial close, GSP will assume full operational, regulatory, and safety responsibilities under the license.

Virginia Davies, Chief Financial Officer of AFR. said, “With proven technology, top-tier partners, and an experienced team, we’re advancing an asset that offers infrastructure-like durability and strategic importance to the U.S. nuclear fuel cycle.”

About American Fuel Resources

American Fuel Resources (AFR) is developing critical nuclear-fuel-cycle infrastructure to strengthen U.S. energy security and industrial resilience. Through its subsidiary Green Salt Products (GSP), AFR will convert DUF6 into DUF4 and high-purity fluorine, unlocking reliable domestic supply for nuclear conversion and strategic materials.

According to a report by the ANS Nuclear Newswire, the 40-year license for the project, which International Isotopes called the Fluorine Extraction Process and Depleted Uranium Deconversion Plant, was issued to Fluorine Products in October 2012.

The plant was to convert DUF6 into fluoride products for commercial resale (the deconversion process) and into uranium oxides for disposal. The facility was expected to process as much as 11 million pounds of DUF6 per year. However, no construction activities were carried out after the license approval.

Urenco Announces Plans To Double New Uranium Enrichment Capacity At Netherlands Site

The company aims to build reliable supply as West seeks to reduce reliance on Russia

(NuNet) Multinational uranium enrichment company Urenco has announced plans to double the expansion of uranium enrichment capacity at its site in Almelo, the Netherlands. Under the company’s capacity program, the first stage of expansion at Almelo was announced in December 2023, representing approximately 750,000 separative work units (SWU). The plant is scheduled to come online from 2027.

A new second stage of expansion will involve the construction of an additional centrifuge hall, representing another approximately 750,000 SWU, which is expected to come online from 2030. In total, the two expansions represent approximately 1.5M SWU of extra capacity at Almelo. Globally, Urenco has now committed to 2.5M SWU of new enrichment capacity and the first two centrifuge cascades are already online, in Eunice, NM.

Russia holds about 44% of the world’s uranium enrichment capacity and is a major global supplier of enriched uranium. Exports to the US are reported to be decreasing due to a 2024 law banning low-enriched uranium imports from Russia. The EU remains heavily dependent on Russian enriched uranium for its nuclear power plants, a reliance that grew in 2023 as countries stockpiled fuel.",https://neutronbytes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/v-c-summer-_thumb.png,N,,2025-10-24 21:58:34.837418

With more arriving soon, the South Korean auto giant is laying the groundwork for what’s shaping up to be a strong run.

Hyundai and Kia are betting on low-cost EVs.

Since launching the EV3 in Europe in late 2024, Kia’s compact electric SUV has quickly become one of the most popular EVs in the region.

The EV3 was the best-selling retail EV in the UK and ranked sixth in Europe in the first half of 2025. Hyundai’s Inster EV, which also arrived in late 2024, is now also gaining traction.

According to the latest figures, Hyundai Motor Group, including Kia, sold 103,476 compact EVs in Europe from January through September.

The Kia EV3 remains a hot seller, leading the surge with 55,514 units sold in the first nine months of 2025. At this pace, the EV3 is now expected to become Hyundai’s top-selling electric vehicle in Europe by the end of the year, outpacing the Kona Electric and IONIQ 5.

Hyundai sold 20,493 Inster EVs in Europe through September, right behind the Kona Electric at 21,224. With full-scale sales kicking off, the Inster EV is expected to surpass the Kona by the end of 2025.

By the end of 2025, Hyundai Motor Group, including Kia, expects to sell over 200,000 electric vehicles in Europe this year.

The Inster EV was “Germany’s best-selling electric small car” through July, according to Ulrich Mechau, President & CEO of Hyundai Motor Germany.

With new mass-market electric vehicles, including the Kia EV2, EV4, EV5, and the Hyundai IONIQ 3, rolling out or set to launch in 2026, Hyundai expects to see even more demand in Europe over the next few years.

What about those in the US? Well, the low-cost Kia EV2 and Hyundai IONIQ 3 will not be offered in the States, but Kia is expected to introduce the EV3 sometime in 2026. It’s also set to launch the EV4 early next year, likely starting at around $35,000.

Meanwhile, Hyundai already offers one of the most affordable electric vehicles in the US with the IONIQ 5. After the federal tax credit expired at the end of September, Hyundai reduced prices on the 2026 IONIQ 5 by nearly $10,000 on some trims. The 2026 Hyundai IONIQ 5 now starts at under $35,000.

The IONIQ 5 remains one of the top-selling EVs in the US, alongside the Tesla Model Y, Model 3, Chevy Equinox EV, Honda Prologue, and Ford Mustang Mach-E.

OC Geology Professor Joshua Hardt was the faculty lead coordinating the forum. This was the first time the college had hosted an event like it.

“I was approached by people from Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory last year about a partnership where they were collecting seismic data from this area, and they wanted to distribute the information that they got from that data to the public,” Hardt said.

“They were looking for someone who could be a partner to them for sharing that information, and I accepted. And here we are. This is our first ever event where we are trying to bring some of that initial information to the public, and as the years progress, we will be able to bring more specific information about the seismic activity here to them, the people here in the Permian Basin,” he added.

He said a lot of misinformation exists about the oilfield and how it influences seismic activity.

“We are trying to clear the air on some of that. We’re trying to bring actual, legitimate information, actual science, to the public to answer their questions. I’ve always found that having the right information tends to allay fears more than just meaningless assurances and so we’re bringing the actual science from the actual mouths of the actual experts here to the Permian Basin to answer those questions and make everyone understand exactly what’s going on,” Hardt said.

He encouraged students to attend the forum.

“We’ve made this event to be friendly to both students and experts. Whether you’re someone who’s been in seismic science for 20 years, or if you’re a high school student, you will be able to get something out of this event,” Hardt said.

Senior Recruiter Petey Lozano and Production Operations Manager Cameron McCartney, both of Diamondback, spoke to a group of attendees about the company — what they do and what they look for in the hiring process.

“Today’s just kind of an overview of the Permian Basin and then an overview of Diamondback,” McCartney said.

Lozano then reviewed career opportunities at the company.

One of their points was that they hire people from diverse backgrounds.

McCartney said if the Permian Basin was its own country it would rank third in oil production. Diamondback has more than 8,000 producing oil and gas wells.

“But I think that shows, domestically, the Permian Basin is the largest in the United States, and it’s the cornerstone of … American energy. If we were our own country, we’d be number three in the world, which is great. Permian Basin production volumes account for nearly half of all our U.S. production, and it’s a significant portion of our natural gas output, which is really going to a lot of the power you see now,” McCartney said.

“It’s an economic engine for the State of Texas. Almost $13 billion comes out of the Permian Basin in taxes, and that’s directly from the Permian Basin in the form of severance taxes. We’re paying … university funds — University of Texas, Texas A&M but that culminates to $13 billion in benefit to the State of Texas,” he added.

Lozano noted that if you are from the Permian Basin, you are likely connected to someone who works in the oilfield.

It’s a dominant force in our area here. Without the people, we couldn’t get the job done.

“I think workers that are out here in the backbone of the oil and gas industry, if you think about it, the oilfield, roughly, employs 645,000 individuals in Texas and just in and, of course, nationwide, that’s 862,000, so if you think about it, almost three quarters of the people who work” in oil and gas are in Texas, Lozano added.

Diamondback covers the Permian Basin, everything from Big Spring to Coyanosa and everything in between. Lozano said almost 1,800 people work for the company.

He added that Diamondback is not laying people off.

Lozano said Diamondback is hiring. He added that they have 56 openings right now.

He said the company has finance, communications, community engagement, accountants, lease operators and other positions.

He advised people just getting out of high school to work on their resumes in terms of punctuation and don’t make them too long, interviewing skills, communication, working on technical skills and taking dual credit classes.

Other advice was to have a clean driving record.

30%: Why The Next Phase Of EV Charging Should Focus On Apartments

Voltpost's lamppost Level 2 EV charger

With the $7,500 federal clean vehicle credit now gone, analysts expect EV sales to decline in the near term. Still, there are ways to soften the blow with smarter policies and infrastructure. Automakers must build affordable, competitive EVs to start with. But buyers need more than just attractive models to make the switch.

Installing chargers at apartment complexes and rental properties could unlock a whole new pool of EV buyers, according to a new study.

Long-time Republican strategist Mike Murphy, who runs the EV Politics Project and the American EV Jobs Alliance, and was also a guest on the InsideEVs Plugged-In Podcast earlier this year, is reportedly lobbying California Governor Gavin Newsom to invest in home chargers at apartments and condos across the state.

If the experiment succeeds, it could serve as a blueprint for the rest of the country.

Murphy told Politico that multi-family home charging was lacking in California, where EV adoption is otherwise the highest in the country. California accounts for one-third of all EV sales in the U.S.

Renters, in particular, have little incentive to install chargers if they’re only living in an apartment temporarily. Landlords, meanwhile, may not fully understand the benefits of home charging or worry that the plugs could go unused if tenants drive gasoline cars.

Here’s more from that report:

Renters, who are far less likely to own EVs than homeowners, represent a potentially game-changing untapped market in a state where growth for battery-electric and plug-in hybrid cars has stalled in recent years.

Murphy’s plan would tap revenue from the state’s carbon-emissions trading program — a figure he said would be $100 million annually in an ideal world — to fund state-run installations and, in turn, let landlords charge a small monthly fee.

“It’s got to be landlord-friendly,” Murphy said. “We’re going to put it in for free, and you can charge a little money for it. It takes out all the headaches for the apartment building owner.”

This idea isn’t coming out of the blue. Politico cited a study which concluded that three out of four apartment renters in California were willing to pay up to $50 per month for a parking spot if it were equipped with a Level 2 charger.

It makes plenty of sense for the renter to use cheaper residential electricity to charge up their EVs, especially if their vehicle is lying idle for the vast majority of the time. If renters commute daily, they could wake up to a fully charged battery every morning, saving significantly on fuel costs, which are especially high in California.

Landlords, meanwhile, could earn a small monthly fee and make their properties more appealing by offering EV charging.

It’s a great idea on paper, but execution could be a different beast, especially when politics and governments are involved.

California has already backed out of Governor Newsom’s earlier proposal to replace the now-dead $7,500 federal tax credit with a state-funded alternative due to budget deficits. And getting lawmakers to agree on a friendly application framework to release the funds for the home chargers could be another big challenge.

Still, if the state can muster the political will to pull this off, it could be a game-changer for EV adoption locally and potentially even across the country.

60%: Rivian CEO RJ Scaringe Has A New Job

Rivian is undergoing a major restructuring as it gears up to launch its Tesla Model Y rival, the R2 SUV, early next year. CEO RJ Scaringe will temporarily take on a dual role as Chief Marketing Officer while the company searches for someone to take up the new position.

This comes after Rivian laid off 600 employees, The Wall Street Journal first reported, in what appears to be another effort to cut costs. The company continues to face intense competition and has yet to produce an EV profitably, losing thousands of dollars on every R1S and R1T it sells.

But Rivian is hoping the upcoming R2 will help turn things around. The mid-size electric SUV, expected to start at around $45,000 when it debuts next year, aims to disrupt the market much like the Model Y did five years ago.

But it will have to do so without the help of a $7,500 federal tax credit and succeed purely on merit. It's also arriving in an increasingly difficult economic and policy environment that keeps getting more uncertain due to tariffs and export controls from China.

California-based battery start-up QuantumScape said on Thursday that it had started shipping B1 samples of its solid-state lithium-metal batteries to customers.

These B1 samples typically refer to prototype or validation cells that are essentially pre-production batteries made to test and refine the design before full-scale manufacturing begins.

The Volkswagen Group is QuantumScape’s largest shareholder and one of its primary customers. The company has poured north of $200 million into the battery start-up to develop solid-state battery cells.

100%: Should Apartment Rentals Start Including Charging Stations?

According to the National Association of Realtors, roughly 45 million households in the U.S. are rented (as of 2022 data). That’s out of a total of about 130 million households, indicating a large pool of renters that could benefit from Level 2 home charging.

Do you think pro-EV states like California should do more to encourage landlords to install home chargers? If you rent, would access to a Level 2 plug be a deciding factor in choosing an apartment? And if you drive a gas car, would having a charger in your parking spot make you consider switching to an EV? Share your thoughts in the comments.

(""Aclara"" or ""Company"") (TSX:ARA) is pleased to announce its decision to construct the first heavy rare earths (HREE) separation facility in the United States, located in the State of Louisiana (the ""Project"") with an expected secured sustainable feed from two ionic clay deposits in Brazil and Chile.

Key Project Highlights

The Project is scheduled for completion in 2027, contingent upon the timely completion of funding and offtake agreements.

Upon the Company achieving a secured feed from its sources in Brazil and Chile, the Project will become the first HREE separation plant in the U.S. with an integrated HREE feed from two ionic clay deposits in friendly jurisdictions, which deposits are expected to be in operation by in mid-2028.

Designed as a comprehensive solution for rare earths, the Project is expected to produce high-purity Dysprosium (Dy), Terbium (Tb), and other restricted HREEs and light rare earths (LREEs), essential for advanced technologies such as electric vehicles, wind turbines, drones, and robotics.

Provided the achievement of full production, Aclara anticipates being able to supply more than 75% of the U.S. requirements of DyTb for electric vehicles by 2028.

Annual production upon the successful development of the Company's ionic clay deposits in Brazil and Chile is anticipated to be 200 tpy (Dy), 30 tpy (Tb) and 1,400 tpy (NdPr) of separated high-purity oxides, representing approximately 14% of China's official DyTb production.[1]

The State of Louisiana is supporting the Project with an estimated US$46.4 million in tax incentives and grants.

This initiative marks a major milestone in Aclara's mine-to-magnet strategy, establishing a vertically integrated supply chain for permanent magnets, starting from our two ionic clay deposits in Brazil and Chile, moving into our HREE separation facility in Louisiana and supplying alloys to our strategic alliance with magnet-maker VAC (VACUUMSCHMELZE), who are currently building a permanent magnet production facility in Sumter, SC.

Project Development

Aclara will invest approximately US$277 million to develop the Project on an 82-acre Louisiana Economic Development (LED) certified site at the Port of Vinton.

The site offers direct road and waterway access via the Gulf Intracoastal Waterway and proximity to chlor-alkali facilities, with the LED Certified designation allowing for immediate industrial development and fast-track construction.

The Company is also planning an additional investment to construct a metals and alloys plant on the property, to support the high-performance permanent magnet industry.

The separation technology being developed by Aclara is designed with scalability in mind, allowing potential capacity expansion to process material from other ionic clay deposits or compatible feedstocks in the future.

Hatch Ltd. (""Hatch"") has been retained to develop the engineering of the Project in addition to its work relating to the Company's Carina project located in the State of Goiás, Brazil (the ""Carina Project""), ensuring strong coordination across projects, driving cost efficiencies, and optimizing schedules, with an aim to reduce execution risk.

Virginia Tech Partnership for Technology Validation

Aclara is collaborating with Virginia Tech (""VT"") to validate its proprietary separation process through a pilot plant whose construction is currently underway and expected to be fully operational by Q1 2026.

By the time production is expected to start at the Louisiana plant, Aclara expects to have accumulated approximately 1.5 years of feed-specific operational data that will serve to accelerate the ramp-up, optimize efficiency and maintain steady-state operations.

Integration with Aclara's Ionic Clay Deposits

Once secured feed is achieved, the Project will become the only HREE separation facility in the United States that is integrated with ionic-clay deposits from friendly jurisdictions, ensuring the reliable production of significant quantities of HREEs.

Aclara's simultaneous optimization of mining and separation processes provides a competitive advantage among ionic clay developers and accelerates project execution.

Significant progress has been achieved at the Company's Goiania pilot plant to enhance the purity of the mixed rare earth carbonate that will supply the Louisiana separation facility upon successful production from the Carina Project.

The Carina Pre-Feasibility Study (PFS), prepared by Hatch, is scheduled for publication in early November 2025, with the Feasibility Study (FS) expected in Q2 2026.

Louisiana Governor, Jeff Landry, commented:

""By choosing Louisiana for its first U.S. facility, Aclara is recognizing what we already know, our state is leading the next generation of energy and technology innovation. We're excited to welcome the Aclara team to Louisiana, and we look forward to the jobs, growth and opportunity this project will deliver for our people, our communities - and for a Louisiana economy that's ready to power and lead our nation's future.""

LED Secretary, Susan B. Bourgeois, commented:

""Louisiana is proud to welcome Aclara and the innovation it brings to our industrial landscape. Aclara's investment underscores the importance of development-ready sites and strong local partnerships that give global companies the confidence to choose Louisiana. The Project builds on our state's strengths in advanced manufacturing and workforce excellence, reinforcing Louisiana's leadership in industries vital to the nation's energy and defense security.""

Aclara's CEO, Ramon Barua, commented:

""We are pleased to announce that we have secured a premium site in Louisiana for our U.S. heavy rare earth separation facility. Our priority was to identify a location that could support rapid development, given the urgent need to establish a reliable supply of these critical minerals. The reception from Governor Landry and his team has been outstanding, and Louisiana's LED program offers exactly the kind of pro-investment environment this strategic sector requires.

In addition, Louisiana provides ready access to the key reagents we require, helping ensure operational reliability and lower transportation costs. The state's highly established chemical industry and skilled workforce made the decision even more compelling. Simply put, Louisiana has everything we were looking for.

Our Project is unique in the Western world: with direct access to our ionic clay deposits, this will be the only fully integrated heavy rare earth separation operation currently capable of producing material volumes of heavy rare earths at scale. We are moving at an accelerated pace to bring supply online as quickly as possible, and we are working to have our projects converge and enter production by mid-2028.""

Aclara's COO, Hugh Broadhurst, commented:

""This facility will become a cornerstone of critical minerals reindustrialization in the Western Hemisphere. Louisiana was selected for its robust chemical and manufacturing ecosystem, attractive investment policies, experienced industrial workforce, and strategic geographic location. The incentive package offered by the State of Louisiana underscores the State's commitment to attracting high-technology and sustainable manufacturing investments.""

Dr. Aaron Noble, Professor and Department Head Mining and Minerals Engineering at Virginia Tech, commented:

""Aclara's leadership in rare earth extraction and processing complements our department's commitment to advancing technology and preparing future leaders in the mining industry. Their pilot facility will bring cutting-edge industrial innovation to our doorstep while creating transformative opportunities to advance our ongoing R&D efforts in REE separations.""

Hatch's Managing Director of Minerals, Conrad Blake, commented:

""We are excited to have been retained by Aclara to work on an integrated project that encompasses the Carina Project, the concentrator and the separation plant. Leveraging our decades of experience in solvent extraction technologies, this holistic approach is designed to drive operational efficiencies and minimize execution risk of the project across the entire value chain.""

LED Incentive Programs

The State of Louisiana, through LED, is supporting Aclara's investment with a suite of tax incentive programs and grants designed to encourage high-impact industrial development and job creation.

Industrial Tax Exemption Program (ITEP): Provides an 80% ad valorem tax exemption for an initial five-year term with a potential five-year renewal. Estimated value: US$29.3 million

High Impact Jobs Program (HIP): Provides performance-based cash grants ranging from 18% to 22% of wages for qualifying new jobs, depending on wage levels relative to parish averages. Initial three-year term with two-year renewal option. Estimated value: US$11.6 million

(Apple wasn’t the first company to make a smartphone, nor was VHS the first tape-playing system). For a time, it seemed like Rivian could be that successful fast follower. Now it’s a lot less clear.

The fate of Rivian is important, if only because the company has one potentially good car coming soon and one possibly great car a little further down the track. Can the company overcome its loss of momentum to get there? That’s a big question in today’s Morning Dump.

It’s questions all around, today, actually. Can South Korea come to terms with a White House that wants a lot of cash now? Are Canada and the United States going to be able to make it work, or is the World Series suddenly something of more importance?

And, ending on a positive note, is Toyota’s SEMA concept the tamest SEMA concept ever?

Rivian Settles Lawsuit, Lays Off A Bunch Of People

There are so many advantages that Rivian had coming into the EV space. It had two attractive products that filled important niches in the market (large SUV and truck, plus a van). It was building those vehicles in America. The CEO comes off charming and not at all delusional. And, at the time, there was a huge amount of buzz around EVs, allowing the company to take in a lot of money in its IPO.

Now the company is hovering around 10% of its initial high share price, the buzz around EVs is dying, EV trucks are less popular, many incentives are going away at the federal level, and building cars in America now comes with a bunch of added materials costs thanks to tariffs.

Also, some of that IPO money is going back. Shareholders sued Rivian, claiming that the company knew it was going to raise the price of its R1 truck and SUV before it listed shares, which caused the value of those shares to drop once this was announced. While Rivian has not admitted any wrongdoing, Reuters reports that the company will pay $250 million to settle the case so it can focus on its big swing: Another two-row SUV called the Rivian R2.

People love their Rivians, generally, so perhaps a two-row SUV that costs about $45,000 and gets over 300 miles of range will appeal to a lot of people. It does feel like there are already a ton of those for sale now, although that price does make it cheaper than some potential gas-powered equivalents like the Audi Q5.

This launch is extremely important because, even with a cash injection from Volkswagen, the company continues to lose money on every vehicle it sells. Will its Q3 numbers show any improvement? Maybe.

In order to save money and “streamline,” the company announced it was laying off around 600 people, and forming “a single marketing organization” with CEO RJ Scaringe as the interim CMO, according to an email seen by Automotive News. Lowering costs is probably a good idea, though, until I drive it, I’m going to be a little skeptical that, in this market, a two-row SUV is going to move the needle enough to reverse the company’s fortunes.

You know what might? The dope as hell Rivian R3. This is a cool hatchback-type thing that’ll hopefully start in the upper-$30k range (though more for the hot version). Perhaps it’s overly optimistic to think a Hyundai Ioniq 5-sized vehicle will do any better than the Ioniq, but there is something indescribably alluring about it.

Does the R2 launch have to work for us to ever get an R3? Probably.

President Trump Demands Cash From South Korea, Which South Korea Is Not Wont To Do

One of these days, I’ll write my big piece on how the car market is way more influenced by the relative strength of different currencies than most normal people consider. A good example might be what’s happening with South Korea.

The country badly wants a deal with the United States so it can, among other things, sell cars with roughly the same tariffs as Japan. In order to get that, it pledged a lot of money in investment in the United States (a big chunk of which would be coming from Hyundai). The White House thanked Hyundai for its commitment by arresting a bunch of its citizens helping to build one of those investments.

Whereas Japan and the United States have a somewhat detailed outline of a trade deal, South Korea’s potential treaty depends on how much of that investment in America is in cash. And how fast that cash comes into the country.

This is tough for South Korea because, historically, the country’s exports helped make it money by building cars cheaply in the South Korean won and selling them in dollars, euros, and pounds. I won’t get into the complexity of the currency markets, but the won ain’t the dollar, and the country’s leaders fear that without having the ability to swap currencies freely with the United States, it’ll destabilize its own currency. Given that South Korea has faced currency issues before, this seems like a reasonable fear.

The South Korean plan has seemingly been to send over some cash, but mostly loans and guarantees. President Trump, though, seems to want that JG Wentworth speed.

Per Bloomberg:

Washington has pressured South Korea to accept conditions included in the agreement with Japan, such as the deadline for investments being Jan. 19, 2029, when Trump’s term ends, and allowing the U.S. government to select where the money goes. U.S. media also reported that Washington sought an increase in the investment amount.

“We are doing our utmost to persuade them that there are differences between Japan and South Korea, using various objective data and analyses,” Yeo told reporters last month.

South Korea’s foreign exchange reserves stood at about $422 billion as of the end of September, according to its central bank. The $350 billion that the U.S. is demanding is equivalent to 83% of that. Japan’s $550 billion investment promise is equivalent to approximately 40% of its foreign exchange reserves.

There are concerns that a short-term outflow of dollars could destabilize the country’s exchange rate.

The constant request for cash immediately on various fronts from the Trump Administration can be viewed in many ways. All presidents want stuff to happen in their own terms, which is why President Kennedy called for the United States to put a man on the moon before anyone knew how to do it. Perhaps it comes from a view that this long period of simmering inflation and cooling employment can’t last. Or maybe there’s some sort of massive remaking of the presidency that gives it unprecedented power to spend the money of private corporations.

Either way, destabilizing South Korea’s currency isn’t great if you want that country to also invest in the United States.

Trump V. Canada, Part Tres

President Trump was on Truth Social this morning and, in between ads for hearing aids and gold coins with the President’s face on them, was some angry messaging about the trade relationship between the United States and Canada.

What happened? The head of the Canadian Province of Ontario put out an ad campaign in the United States, just using a video of Ronald Reagan, pointing out that tariffs are bad.

If you want to read the full speech, btw, it’s here. I think this is the bit that’s upset the President:

You see, at first, when someone says, “Let’s impose tariffs on foreign imports,” it looks like they’re doing the patriotic thing by protecting American products and jobs. And sometimes for a short while it works — but only for a short time. What eventually occurs is: First, homegrown industries start relying on government protection in the form of high tariffs. They stop competing and stop making the innovative management and technological changes they need to succeed in world markets. And then, while all this is going on, something even worse occurs. High tariffs inevitably lead to retaliation by foreign countries and the triggering of fierce trade wars. The result is more and more tariffs, higher and higher trade barriers, and less and less competition. So, soon, because of the prices made artificially high by tariffs that subsidize inefficiency and poor management, people stop buying. Then the worst happens: Markets shrink and collapse; businesses and industries shut down; and millions of people lose their jobs.

The memory of all this occurring back in the thirties made me determined when I came to Washington to spare the American people the protectionist legislation that destroys prosperity. Now, it hasn’t always been easy. There are those in this Congress, just as there were back in the thirties, who want to go for the quick political advantage, who will risk America’s prosperity for the sake of a short-term appeal to some special interest group, who forget that more than 5 million American jobs are directly tied to the foreign export business and additional millions are tied to imports.

If there’s one thing that the President pays attention to, it’s television, and this ad has made him real mad. So mad that he’s stopped talks with Canada. According to NBC, this has happened before:

Trump’s termination of talks Thursday is not the first time he has cut off trade negotiations with Canada. In June, he said he was “terminating ALL discussions on trade with Canada,” citing the treatment of American tech companies and dairy farmers.

Canada quickly retaliated, slapping a quota on steel products, over what Finance Minister François-Philippe Champagne called “unjust U.S. tariffs.”

But days later, Canada announced it would rescind its digital services tax, which would have hit major U.S. companies, to appease Trump.

So, we’ll just have to wait and see what Canada can do to lower the temperature.

Toyota’s SEMA Camry GT-S Is Extremely Orange

Toyota is out with a SEMA Camry concept, and this version doesn’t come with a NASCAR-sourced V8 or wild powertrain. It doesn’t have 9,000 horsepower. It’s just a little lower, a little more agro, and a lot more orange.

As the company explains in a press release:

Unlike the over-the-top builds that often headline SEMA, the GT-S stays rooted in reality with its 232 horsepower, stock 2.5-liter four-cylinder hybrid system remaining unchanged. The interior, too, remains true to the production Camry, underscoring the build’s mission to highlight exterior design, stance, and chassis tuning as a natural extension of Camry’s existing capabilities.

[…]

“The Camry GT-S Concept is more than just a SEMA one-off—it’s a study in what a performance and style package could mean for Camry in the future,” said Adam Rabinowitz, chief designer, Toyota CALTY Design Research. “Our goal was to create something aspirational yet attainable, and to use this platform to gather valuable feedback from consumers.”

The team also focused on upgrades to complement the pronounced GT-S bodylines. At each corner, adjustable coilovers lower the chassis by 1.5 inches, yielding a more aggressive stance and improving handling. A high-performance brake upgrade includes massive 8-piston calipers squeezing 365mm front rotors with 6-piston calipers matched with 356mm rear rotors. To enhance mechanical grip, 20-inch performance wheels mounted with 245/35R20 tires fill the wheel wells.

You know what? I’m into it. This car could easily see the light of day, as Toyota hints approximately 400 times in its press release. I love a wild SEMA concept, too, don’t get me wrong, but production-intent stuff has its place.

What I’m Listening To While Writing TMD

Thanks to the reader who sent in this salsa tune, which, I think you’d agree, is the sonic version of the Toyota Camry above. It’s “Lección de Amor” by Adalberto Alvarez. Che romantica!

What’s your favorite SEMA concept?

On Saturday, October 18, 2025, my wife and I marched, protested, and rallied for democracy in Houston, Texas. We came to Discovery Green to see what the “No Kings” protest was like and stayed to march to City Hall, shout chants, and show that we don’t support President Trump’s policies and police state tactics for citizens or non-citizens in the United States of America.

Already in the Conservation and Environmental part of our lives I have seen what is in store for those who believe and support in a present and future that is based upon humans as one living thing on Earth that has a right to exist and evolve but also includes the right of all other living and non-living things to exist and evolve.

For me, I have seen the government, which before President Trump stated it wanted citizens to be partners, stakeholders, and participants in the protection and management our public lands, forests, parks, wildlife refuges, conservation lands, and other lands that we own, reject collaboration and cooperation that before was stated as a regular part of our laws, policies, rules, and regulations.

I have seen public servants, who before were friendly to my suggestions and advances for protection and management of our public lands, put up a wall of resistance against accepting citizen comments in the spirit of give and take to make proposed projects greener for us now and in the future.

I have seen the government delay, refuse, and mislead with words the right of citizens to obtain documents that we own. The rule of law, via the Freedom of Information Act, is treated as a formality, not a right and a legal mandate.

In some ways this has been coming for years, but under President Trump this kind of inappropriate behavior and illegal and criminal action now is policy that is demanded of all public servants at the risk of being fired if they resist and obey the law.

This has got to be the most anti automobile industry administration in my career.","With help from Noah Baustin, Garrett Downs and Heather Richards

BACK IN THE DRIVER’S SEAT: Chris Grundler thought he’d mostly closed the book on his career in environmental regulation. After 42 years at the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, where he helped write America’s clean car rules and oversaw the Volkswagen emissions fraud investigation, he retired in 2022 to a medieval village in southern France.

Then President Donald Trump won a second term.

Now, Grundler is back in the trenches. But this time he’s in Sacramento, where Gov. Gavin Newsom and other California officials are pitching the most populous state in the country as a counterweight to the Trump administration’s rollbacks of environmental rules.

In May, Grundler joined the California Air Resources Board as its new deputy executive officer for mobile sources and incentives. It’s his job to flesh out California’s response to the Trump administration’s move to deny the state’s special authority to enforce its own clean car rules, which effectively ended the state’s electric vehicle sales mandate. Beyond having major implications for the nation’s entire auto market, the response Grundler cooks up will determine whether a smoggier California can meet federal air quality standards and continue to receive highway funding.

“This is a galvanizing moment in history for the state of California,” Grundler said in an interview. “I told my staff, there’s no time for hand wringing, there’s no time for catastrophizing. We have a job to do. This is a public health agency.”

Grundler spoke to POLITICO about his decision to join California, his experience with Trump administrations, and how he sees the state’s role in bolstering the EV market.

This interview has been edited for length and clarity.

How did you decide to come out of retirement to work for California?

It was just heartbreaking to watch the systematic dismantling of my and colleagues life’s work and very painful to watch the attacks on federal workers, watch the attacks on my colleagues in California, who I worked with for many years. I had to decide, and this is how I explained it to my kids, I could be angry about it, I could be sad about it, I could be depressed about it, or I could try to do something about it. And this opportunity emerged. I was living in a small medieval village at the time in the southern part of France, and applied and interviewed from France, accepted the job from France, signed a lease for an apartment in Sacramento, sight unseen, and rushed back to work, and I haven’t looked backwards. I have no regrets. I came in with my eyes open. I knew it was going to be challenging, but I really didn’t have a choice. I needed to feel as though I was at least trying to do something, because there’s just so much at stake.

What was your experience like working in the first Trump administration? How does it compare to what we’ve seen so far out of Trump 2.0?

I thought it was very important for me to serve during the Trump administration. I had responsibility for 400 some people that I cared a lot about. At first, I really thought that I would be able to reason with the new political leadership, because I served in the Reagan administration, both Bush administrations, and they believed in the mission of EPA, they just had different policy ideas and strategies. In Trump One, they thought very, very differently and they did not listen to the career staff. We did our best to try to explain, if you want to do this, here’s the proper way under the law to make these changes. They chose not to accept that advice, which is why so many of the actions in Trump One failed in court.

But then I retired and this administration, for many different reasons, came to power and came to EPA with a very, very different agenda in mind. The speed of what they’re doing has really surprised me, and their very transparent contempt for public servants is bewildering, frankly. Every previous administration came in with a goal to win the hearts and minds of the people, the experienced people, talented people, to execute their agenda. It’s really hard to do that when you come in very clear that you don’t trust, value or even respect.

What do you see as California’s role in making policies for vehicles right now?

I’ve been a part of this business for many, many years. I grew up in Michigan, near the auto industry. I have family that worked in the auto industry. I love cars. I had a subscription to the Road & Track magazine before I had a driver’s license. This has got to be the most anti automobile industry administration in my career. I feel like we’re the only ones standing up for the industry right now, as strange as that might sound.

This industry has allocated enormous amounts of capital in building these cleaner cars, and a big part of my job, and the governor’s focused on this as well, but we think we need to protect that investment, and we’re going to do that by growing the market here for these cleaner air vehicles in California. I’m inviting my colleagues in the auto industry to help shape that future, and my job is to persuade them that long term certainty with the California Air Resources Board is their friend… We’re trying to be the responsible actors here.

California is running out of tools, though, with the repeal of its Clean Air Act waivers to enforce its own clean car rules. What’s left? What can you realistically deliver?

We have other rules we can enforce, and we have fiscal tools that we’re employing. We have consumer incentives. We have a very important heavy duty, Clean Truck Check to make sure that trucks are complying with the law as they drive our streets and highways. We’re working with the Legislature on clarifying existing tools and inventing new tools.

We’re launching these new regulatory initiatives precisely to continue to send the signal to the market that investing in these cleaner technologies still matters. Congress can’t kill the electric car. [U.S. EPA] Administrator [Lee] Zeldin can’t kill the electric car. That remains the future. Just ask [General Motors CEO] Mary Barra, and she continues to say that, and they’re competing in a global market. It might take us a little bit longer. We might need to find different ways to get there, and we’re looking at everything available to us that exists and that hasn’t existed. But the story of our demise is premature. — CvK

GLOVES UP: The Trump administration is in for a fight over its push to open federal waters to oil drilling off the Pacific and Atlantic coasts, including areas abutting Southern California. A slew of lawmakers are coming out in opposition to the idea, and it’s not just Democrats throwing up red flags, reports Garrett Downs for POLITICO’s E&E News.

Republican Rep. Nancy Mace, a South Carolina Trump ally running for governor, threw her weight behind a ban on drilling off her coast that the president implemented during his first term.

“President Trump put protections in place to prevent offshore drilling off South Carolina’s coast, and those remain in effect through 2032,” Mace’s communications director, Sydney Long, said in a statement. “Congresswoman Mace continues to oppose offshore drilling in South Carolina to protect our coastline, economy, and way of life.”

Republican Sen. Rick Scott of Florida expressed similar concern.

“I haven’t supported drilling in the eastern Gulf of America,” Scott said, using Trump’s preferred name for the Gulf of Mexico. “It’s important to Florida.”

Democrats weighed in with their own full-throated condemnation.

“President Trump’s Big Oil agenda will have devastating impacts on our coastlines if the administration decides to open California’s waters to dangerous offshore oil projects,” said California Sen. Adam Schiff in a statement. — NB

FAILURE TO RESTART: Did someone say offshore drilling fight?

In September, Sable Offshore Oil Corp. asked for permission from the California Office of the State Fire Marshall to restart a pipeline system that once carried oil from the three rigs it owns off the Santa Barbara coast to shore. But State Fire Marshal Daniel Berlant on Wednesday sent the company a letter throwing up a serious road block.

Sable has not made all the repairs it must and has a “deficiency” in meeting the terms of waivers his agency previously issued to the company, according to Berlant.

“The above findings alone and the inconsistencies with the State Waiver requirements prevent restart under the law,” Berlant wrote, adding that his agency’s review of the company’s restart plan is ongoing.

Sable clapped back in a letter Thursday.

“OSFM conclusions are in error, ignore the remainder of the Waivers and are inconsistent with numerous discussions between OSFM and Sable,” wrote company representative Lance Yearwood. — NB

THE PARKS HAVE EYES: The National Park Service is trying to show that it’s cracking down on illegal BASE jumpers in Yosemite National Park as the government shutdown has left only a skeleton crew at national parks.

On Friday, the National Park Service touted the recent convictions of three men for illegal BASE jumping in incidents in 2020 and 2024. The men must collectively pay thousands in fines, spend several days in jail and stay away from Yosemite during one to several years of probation.

An Interior Department spokesperson also told Heather Richards of POLITICO’s E&E News that the agency is investigating three additional incidents from earlier this month in the iconic Sierra Nevada park, but did not provide specific dates.

Social media posts with video reportedly shot this month show jumpers leaping from Yosemite’s famous El Capitan cliff face and parachuting down. Interior Secretary Doug Burgum has downplayed reports that understaffing has led to such activities, calling it “misinformation.” — HR, CvK

EBB AND FLOW: The Board of Directors of the Kern County Water Agency named Eric Averett as its next general manager at its meeting on Thursday. Averett previously managed another local water district and most recently was one of the board’s own directors, though he stepped down from that position in early October.

As part of the investment in Louisiana LNG, Williams assumes LNG offtake obligations for 10% of produced volumes.
“This is Williams’ first investment in LNG and its participation in Louisiana LNG is a testament to the quality of the project.
HoldCo owns 60% equity in Louisiana LNG Infrastructure LLC (InfraCo), with the remainder being owned by Stonepeak.","Woodside has simultaneously signed and closed a transaction with Williams, a leader in US natural gas infrastructure, for an integrated investment in Louisiana LNG. The strategic partnership involves the sale by Woodside of a 10% interest in Louisiana LNG LLC (HoldCo) and an 80% interest and operatorship of Driftwood Pipeline LLC (PipelineCo) to Williams for a purchase price of US$250 million at the effective date of 1 January 2025. The total proceeds received are US$378 million including proportionate capital reimbursement since the effective date.

The transaction represents the next key stage towards realising Woodside’s strategy for Louisiana LNG. It not only secures capital and offtake commitments but also brings a strong strategic partner with complementary capabilities in US natural gas infrastructure and an existing gas sourcing platform, Sequent Energy Management.

Williams will contribute its share of the CAPEX for the LNG facility and pipeline, of approximately US$1.9 billion. As part of the investment in Louisiana LNG, Williams assumes LNG offtake obligations for 10% of produced volumes.

Williams currently operates more than 33 000 miles of pipeline across 24 states in the US and its Sequent platform has a marketing and optimisation footprint of more than 7 billion ft3/d. It will utilise its extensive pipeline experience to construct and operate the Line 200 pipeline to the Louisiana LNG terminal.

Leveraging the established Sequent platform and capabilities, a gas supply team will operationalise and optimise daily gas sourcing and balancing in accordance with Louisiana LNG’s gas procurement strategy. Sequent's proven gas marketing and asset optimisation expertise will support reliable feedgas supply for the benefit of all Louisiana LNG participants.

Woodside CEO, Meg O’Neill, said: “We are excited to have Williams join us as a strategic partner in Louisiana LNG given its leadership in US natural gas infrastructure and ability to add value and deliver operational benefits to enhance the project.

“This is Williams’ first investment in LNG and its participation in Louisiana LNG is a testament to the quality of the project.

“The bringing together of Woodside’s proven track record in developing and operating LNG facilities and global marketing, and Williams’ expertise in pipelines and gas sourcing, creates an energy partnership that has the combined capability to realise opportunities for long-term global energy demand.

“With strong LNG contracting momentum from Louisiana LNG and our portfolio, our existing infrastructure partner New York-based Stonepeak, and our key contracting partners including Bechtel, Baker Hughes, and Chart, we are on track to deliver first LNG in 2029 and create long-term value for our shareholders.”

President and CEO of Williams, Chad Zamarin, added: “This transaction marks an important step forward in Williams’ wellhead to water strategy – integrating upstream, midstream, marketing, and LNG capabilities to deliver the cleanest, most reliable energy to global markets. We look forward to partnering with Woodside, and together, reinforcing and strengthening our collective roles as trusted providers of sustainable energy solutions that meet growing global demand.”

This follows a September 9 Commission authorization that directed the Port of Seattle’s executive director to enter into an Administrative Settlement and Order on Consent (“Order”) with the EPA and a Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) with King County and the City of Seattle to complete the remedial design. Together, the Order, MOA, and bid solicitation reflect a shared commitment to restoring the river and protecting adjacent communities — helping to create a healthier environment and a more resilient working waterfront for future generations.

The East Waterway is an “operable unit” of the Harbor Island Superfund Site and is part of a long-running, federally directed cleanup effort with the Port, the City of Seattle, and King County working together under EPA oversight. Over the past several decades, five of the six Harbor Island operable units have been completed, addressing contaminated soil, groundwater, and sediment from historical industrial activity.

The East Waterway is the last and most complex operable unit, and its cleanup will remove sediments that are contaminated with polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), arsenic, dioxins/furans, mercury, and carcinogenic polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (cPAHs) — pollutants that pose risks to people, fish, and the broader ecosystem.

“This is a significant moment in a long-term effort to restore the health of the Duwamish River and the communities that depend on it,” said Commissioner Ryan Calkins. “We are committed to transparency and collaboration every step of the way. This milestone is another element of the Port’s broader commitment to environmental stewardship. By planning ahead and investing now, we’re ensuring that future cleanups can move forward responsibly and predictably, while continuing to protect public health, habitat, and the working waterfront.”

The Duwamish River is ecologically significant estuarine habitat vital to juvenile salmon, shellfish, and other marine life, and it plays a key role in the health of Puget Sound. It also holds cultural and treaty-protected importance for local Tribes, who have stewarded and fished these waters since time immemorial and continue to rely on them for fishing and other traditional practices.

The EPA continues to oversee the East Waterway cleanup to ensure that it will meet federal and state standards for environmental protection and public health. While the Port is highlighting its recent milestones, the cleanup remains a shared responsibility among the three partner agencies.

Americans spent 3.6% more on electricity and gas in the third quarter of this year than they did during the same time last year, according to a study led by Bank of America economist David Tinsley.

Taking a longer view, electricity prices rose 5.1% over the past 12 months through September, while gas service went up a whopping 11.7%, the Bureau of Labor Statistics said Friday.

That came as the feds and state governments have been offering financial incentives for companies to build data centers. There are over 4,000 such sites throughout the US today, according to datacentermap.com, though there is no official count.

“The rising demand for electricity generation capacity and grid investments, due in part to the build-out of data centers, appears to be placing more upward pressure on bills,” stated the Bank of America report, which was released last week.

When electrical grids get enhanced to accommodate increased power demands from new data centers, at least some of the cost appears to get passed on to consumers, the report explained.

On top of that, the increased use of electric vehicles has added to electricity demand, helping to keep prices high, according to the study.

More price hikes could be in store this winter.

“Consumers may again feel the pressure on their utility bills in the coming months, particularly if the winter is a cold one,” BofA’s report warned.

Electricity and natural gas prices actually ticked down slightly from August to September, according to the Consumer Price Index, though that’s likely due to consumers flipping off the A/C and waiting to turn on the heat.

Meanwhile, expanding the US power grid faces a number of barriers, with massive amounts of capital needed to build “more generation and transmission capacity,” the BofA report stated.

Regulatory hurdles and supply chain pressures also pose a roadblock, according to the analysis, who pointed to difficulties acquiring large turbines.

BofA warned that higher utility bills could hammer overall consumer spending.

Americans are already concerned about higher prices, sinking consumer sentiment to a five-month low in October, according to a University of Michigan report released Friday.

Average utility payments over the summer varied by city. Chicago and Tampa, Fla., for example, saw much higher bills, while prices dropped in Las Vegas.

It was notably hot this summer in parts of Phoenix – so prices increased alongside the demand for cooling, the study said.

Higher utility bills also tend to disproportionately hit lower-income households, which are already dealing with slower wage growth, according to BofA’s report.

Despite intense pressure on the grid, tech giants have continued to announce massive investments in AI infrastructure.

Just last week, a group of investors including Nvidia, Microsoft, BlackRock and Elon Musk’s xAI agreed to purchase Aligned Data Centers for $40 billion.t

GM boss holds his hands up

It’s not very often that the head figure of a car company publicly admits getting it wrong.

And yet that is exactly what has happened in the last few days.

A few days ago, GM boss Mark Reuss made a podcast appearance.

And he made something of a startling admission – one that car companies very rarely do.

During his appearance on the InsideEVs podcast, the GM boss discusses a variety of issues.

And one of the most interesting topics was that of the Cadillac CT6.

The podcast hosts asked the GM boss if he would have handled things differently, knowing what was ahead.

“I wish we didn’t have to stop the CT6 for Cadillac, but we did,” the GM boss admitted.

“And we converted factory zero, and we wouldn’t have the trucks that are in that factory.”

For those who don’t know, Factory ZERO is GM’s plant in Detroit-Hamtramck.

It was turned into a facility to build electric vehicles back in 2020.

Prior to that shift, it was the location of Cadillac CT6 production.

Cadillac CT6 was very competitive – for a few years

Speaking of the Cadillac CT6 – what actually was it?

Well, it was a saloon option from the GM brand – but also one of the most powerful Cadillacs ever made.

GM introduced the CT6 back in 2016 as a sedan with a more accessible price point.

It was the only GM vehicle built on the new Omega platform, and was actually meant to be the Cadillac LTS.

When the Cadillac CT6 debuted, the 2.0-liter base model came with a price of $53,495.

By contrast, the top-tier 3.0L turbo platinum model was priced at $87,465.

What made the Cadillac CT6 so special was its ability to deliver power and torque at a competitive price.

Of course, this was especially impressive – and important – for a full-size sedan.

Unlike other GM models, the CT6 was light yet rigid, making it a very popular model.

At least for the three full years it existed as a model option.",https://supercarblondie.com/wp-content/uploads/Cadillac-CT6.webp,N,,2025-10-24 21:02:54.368309

The decision grants a petition brought by Citizen Action of New York, PUSH Buffalo, Sierra Club, and WE ACT for Environmental Justice and finds that New York’s Department of Environmental Conservation (DEC) violated the law by failing to promulgate regulations that ensure compliance with the state’s emissions limits by the statutory deadline of January 1, 2024.

Environmental Defense Fund, with partners Riverkeeper and Save the Sound, submitted an amicus — or ""friend of the court” — brief in support of petitioners claims. That brief made clear DEC had failed to promulgate rules to ensure compliance with statutory emissions targets by demonstrating that existing regulations were insufficient to meet the Climate Act’s emissions requirements. The brief also argued that DEC had violated the Climate Act by failing to prioritize measures to maximize reductions of emissions and co-pollutants in disadvantaged communities.

The Court’s decision today requires DEC to promulgate regulations to ensure compliance with the Climate Act’s requirements no later than February 6, 2026.

“The Albany County Supreme Court’s decision confirms that New York’s Climate Act requires the swift adoption of standards that ensure the state achieves its climate pollution limits,” said Erin Murphy, Director & Sr. Attorney, Clean Air & Energy Markets at Environmental Defense Fund. “Strong standards that reduce climate pollution to the levels required by law will deliver cleaner air, lower energy bills, and more resilient communities across New York State.”

Fortunately, New York does not have to start from scratch. State agencies have been working since 2023 to develop cap-and-invest regulations, now known as the Clean Air Initiative, specifically to fulfill the requirements under the CLCPA. In addition to slashing climate-warming pollution, the Clean Air Initiative is projected to generate more than $3 billion annually for investments that can save New Yorkers money on energy bills, create family-sustaining jobs and deliver massive health benefits, particularly in communities most impacted by climate and air pollution.

“The Clean Air Initiative, New York’s cap-and-invest program, is the best tool available to deliver pollution cuts that support a healthy future in line with the Climate Act’s requirements,” said Kate Courtin, Senior Manager, State Climate Policy & Strategy at EDF. “New York can establish a strong program that will clean our air, lower our bills, and generate new economic opportunities across the state. The New York legislature passed nation-leading requirements for tackling climate change and protecting our communities from pollution; the Hochul administration has an opportunity to deliver on that leadership promise.”

In addition to being a cost-effective, flexible and proven approach to cutting climate pollution, research released by state agencies as well as a growing body of independent studies confirm the affordability, job growth, and health benefits of the Clean Air Initiative, including:

Over $3 billion per year of new investments in New York families and communities. This includes over $1 billion annually in direct rebates to consumers and small businesses to reduce energy costs.

With targeted rebate investments, nearly all households earning under $200,000-per-year see net cost savings under cap-and-invest.

Savings of up to $1,000 per year on energy bills for the average family, through deployment of new clean energy technologies and efficiency programs, such as robust heat pump incentives.

Supporting the creation of over 28,000 jobs by 2030, representing continued growth of New York’s clean energy workforce, which already employs 178,000 New Yorkers.

Significant investments in community-directed grant programs that drive local economic development, cleaner air and affordability in disadvantaged communities.

Her name is Amelie Chen, and she's already thinking about how to power the future.

""I learned how to turn algae into biofuel in a $7 million lab at UC Berkeley, and that was throughout a summer program in my freshman year [of high school],"" Chen said. ""And I ended up creating biofuel in my kitchen with no lab.""

Creating biofuel from coconuts and algae

Without access to expensive equipment, Chen improvised. She used coconut ash to extract the chemicals she needed, turning a local resource into a key ingredient for innovation.

""I was able to extract potassium iodide from the coconuts and use that to separate the oils from the algal cell parts,"" she said.

That creativity earned her national attention. Chen was named a National STEM Champion, joining students from around the country and its territories for their achievements in science, technology, engineering, and math. At Harvard, she's found a new community of innovators including a fellow National STEM Champion, Rohan Bhosale at MIT, driven by a shared goal to ""make the world a better place.""

""It's a way to say thank you to my island""

But the idea that started it all came from home...a small island surrounded by the Pacific.

""American Samoa,"" Chen said. ""It's a small island in the South Pacific. It's actually an American territory. We only have 50,000 people living there.""

Growing up there, she saw how rising sea levels and coral bleaching were changing her world.

""Finding another renewable energy source can help fight climate change,"" she said. ""I think it's a way to say thank you to my island.""

Now studying environmental engineering and economics, Chen hopes to scale her biofuel project and one day launch her own company focused on algae-based renewable energy.

The Louisiana plant is being designed for scalability, allowing it to process material from other ionic-clay deposits or compatible feedstocks.
Founded in 2021 following its spinout from Hochschild Mining, Aclara focuses on extracting rare earths from ionic clays using a patented water-based process that avoids traditional acid leaching.","Aclara Resources (TSX: ARA) plans to invest $277 million to build a heavy rare earth separation facility in Louisiana, marking what it calls a milestone for US critical minerals independence.

The plant is to process feed from Aclara’s ionic-clay projects in Brazil and Chile and is scheduled for completion in 2027, subject to financing and permitting, the company said on Friday. Louisiana is supporting the project with $46.4 million in tax incentives and grants. Currently, nearly all heavy rare earths are refined in China.

The facility is slated for a 33-hectare (82-acre) site at the Port of Vinton near Lake Charles, offering access to the Gulf Intracoastal Waterway and nearby chlor-alkali facilities used in Aclara’s refining process. The site’s infrastructure, chemical industry base and access to logistics were key factors in its selection, the company said in a release.

“Our project is unique in the Western world,” Aclara CEO Ramon Barua said. “With direct access to our ionic clay deposits, this will be the only fully integrated heavy rare earth separation operation currently capable of producing material volumes of heavy rare earths at scale.”

Aclara shares rose 14% on Friday morning in Toronto to C$3.15 apiece, valuing the company at C$686 million ($489 million).

Virgina Tech

Aclara, which is 57% owned by Hochschild Mining (LSE: HOC), says it plans to supply more than three-quarters of US dysprosium (Dy) and terbium (Tb) demand by 2028. That amounts annually to 200 tonnes dysprosium, 30 tonnes terbium and 1,400 tonnes neodymium praseodymium (NdPr) of separated high-purity oxides.

The goal represents about 14% of China’s official DyTb production, positioning the Louisiana plant as the anchor of a Western supply chain for magnets and electric motors used in electric vehicles, wind turbines, drones and defence systems.

The company plans to use technology co-developed with major public research university Virginia Tech, whose pilot plant is expected to be operational in early 2026. Engineering partner Hatch is coordinating the design with Aclara’s Carina project in the central Brazilian state of Goiás, where a pre-feasibility study is expected in November and a full feasibility study in the second quarter of 2026.

Ucore plant

Aclara joins Ucore Rare Metals (TSXV: UCU) in Louisiana, where the rare earths technology company is building its own processing plant in Alexandria. Ucore also operates a rare earths demonstration facility in Kingston, Ontario.

Carina hosts 236.3 million indicated tonnes grading 293 parts per million (ppm) NdPr, 43 ppm Dy and 6.8 ppm Tb for 371,492 tonnes of total rare earth oxides (TREO), the company reported this month. It also has 48 million inferred tonnes grading 236 ppm NdPr, 41 ppm dysprosium and 6.4 ppm terbium for 61,675 tonnes TREO.

The project could generate as much as 191 tonnes of Dy and Tb annually, according to a January 2024 preliminary economic assessment. The study estimated a mine life of 22 years and a net present value of $1.5 billion, using an 8% discount rate, with an internal rate of return of 27%. In September, Aclara received $5 million in US government support for development work at Carina under a bilateral critical minerals cooperation framework.

Penco project

In Chile, Aclara is advancing the smaller Penco project on a similar timeline. It hosts 27.5 million measured and indicated tonnes grading 2,292 ppm TREO for 62,900 tonnes of contained TREO. Penco received environmental approval last year after revisions to improve its social and water management standards.

The Louisiana plant is being designed for scalability, allowing it to process material from other ionic-clay deposits or compatible feedstocks. Aclara intends to expand production as its South American resource base grows. Earlier this year, the company commissioned a semi-industrial pilot plant in Brazil to test metallurgical recovery and refine its proprietary separation process.

The move into Louisiana builds on a wave of North American investment in rare earths separation, processing and magnet manufacturing, including stakes by Apple and the federal government in MP Materials (NYSE: MP). The US Department of Defense has supported several magnet and processing projects under its Title III program to reduce reliance on Chinese supply chains.

Founded in 2021 following its spinout from Hochschild Mining, Aclara focuses on extracting rare earths from ionic clays using a patented water-based process that avoids traditional acid leaching. It says the method reduces waste and eliminates radioactive by-products, addressing one of the key environmental hurdles facing the sector.",https://www.mining.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/aclara-pilot-plant.jpg,N,,2025-10-24 21:02:58.868116

—Carrie Albright Feature Report: Now lets listen to Amelia Bucher talk about the growing invasive species threat to Monroe Lake.","Hello and welcome to Eco Report.

In today’s feature report, we are looking at a growing threat to one of Monroe County’s most important natural resources. Invasive species are spreading through Monroe Lake, threatening native plants, animals, and the lake’s overall ecosystem. WFHB Environmental correspondent, Amelia Bucher has the story. That’s coming up later in the program.

And now for your environmental reports:

October is Leave the Leaves Month and as Bloomington’s trees turn shades of red, orange, yellow, and brown, you might ask, “what role do these leaves play in health of local plants, insects, and animals?” The National Wildlife Federation (or NWF) is urging residents to support the butterflies, lightning bugs, and songbirds that depend on fallen leaves for survival by foregoing the raking process this year.

“Refraining from clearing leaves from your lawn can also reduce large-scale organic gas emissions, too. According to the NWF, Americans dispose of over 35 million tons of yard waste annually, and leaves account for more than 13% of the country’s solid waste. In landfills, this organic matter releases methane gas—25 times more potent than carbon dioxide at trapping heat.”

Meanwhile, the layer of leaves that accumulate in your lawn each fall offers critical habitat to many species who “overwinter” in the protection of fallen leaves. Many moth and butterfly species don’t migrate, making Bloomington a necessary home for recurring sightings of these winged beauties. Lightning bug (or firefly) larvae rely on leaves for up to two years and bumblebee queens are known to hibernate through winter in this habitat, too. The vast majority of backyard birds—96 %—rely on butterfly and moth caterpillars as primary food for their babies during nesting season.

While a National Wildlife Federation survey found that 72% of people know fallen leaves benefit wildlife, only 25% actually leave the leaves. Often home- or property-owners are concerned about the appearance, turfgrass survival, or pests. But wildlife experts emphasize you don’t need to smother your lawn. Birds, insects, and reptiles benefit from smaller plots of natural leaf litter. You can leave specific areas of your lawn undisturbed to provide smaller habitats, or rake leaves from sidewalks, driveways, and grass into garden beds where they act as natural mulch.

The NWF offers tips and answers to frequently asked questions on their website, making it simple for residents to engage in lawn care that directly supports biodiversity right here in Bloomington.

A federal judge ordered the U.S. Forest Service to temporarily halt a massive logging project in the Hoosier National Forest last week, ruling that the agency failed to adequately explain potential environmental impacts. The USFS Houston South Vegetation Management and Restoration Project involves clear-cutting 400 acres, logging an additional 4,000 acres, enacting prescribed burns on 13,500 acres, and constructing several miles of roads.

Chief Judge Tanya Pratt found this project lacked proper environmental analysis, particularly regarding Lake Monroe’s water quality and soil erosion. The Forest Service claimed that “Best Management Practices” would mitigate any harm, but the court determined that the studies they cited were either 30 years old or used metrics that “carry little to no weight” for measuring logging impacts within the affected counties. Judge Pratt wrote that the agency offered “only generalized assurances,” failing to provide actual analysis to satisfy the National Environmental Policy Act.

This marks the third lawsuit attempting to stop the logging since 2020, supported by parties including the Monroe County Board of Commissioners, Indiana Forest Alliance, Hoosier Environmental Council, and Friends of Lake Monroe. The project remains halted until the Forest Service provides proper environmental findings and meets with the judge to determine an appropriate remedy and timeline. This ruling sets a critical precedent that federal agencies can’t just rubber-stamp major environmental projects with outdated science and vague promises—they must demonstrate that their actions won’t harm the water, air, soil, and ecosystems Hoosiers throughout the state are working to protect.

A state grant program is helping Indiana students discover the outdoors, a welcome reprieve amidst the rising transportation costs for field trips. The “Discover The Outdoors Field Trip Grant”, run by the Indiana Natural Resources Foundation, provided grants to 68 schools across Indiana this year to visit state parks. Since the program launched in 2013, it’s awarded 345 grants totaling over $92,000. This funding means more than 30,000 Indiana kids have had the chance to experience outdoor education.

Westlane Middle School in Indianapolis has already taken 130 middle schoolers to Fort Harrison State Park. Because the state parks charge just one dollar per student for guided interpretive nature tours, schools can afford to bring more young people out into nature. Kevin Melrose, a seventh-grade teacher at Westlane, says getting kids outside is crucial for teaching Indiana history, ecology, and earth sciences—but without grant support, many schools simply can’t afford it.

During a recent Fort Harrison trip, students climbed over logs, waded through creeks, examined the mysteries of the tree canopy, and never stopped engaging with their natural surroundings. Park staff led guided hikes, teaching about different ecosystems and animals while incorporating lessons about the park’s history. The school’s parent-teacher association also helped fundraise to cover additional costs beyond the grant.

Applications for the 2026-2027 school year open in March at the DNR State Parks website. Teachers and parents interested in getting kids outdoors can find more information about the program and start planning now. Research confirms time and time again that exposure to nature has a positive impact on students. In fact, analysis by Stanford researchers verifies that environmental education promotes competence, confidence, and connection as well as knowledge gains across multiple subjects, including environmental issues, science, and mathematics. And as Melrose says, “The point of school is preparing them to be global learners, and the best way we can do that is to get them out on the globe.”

On Monday, the Trump administration announced plans to eliminate over 2,000 positions at the Department of the Interior, targeting scientists who study water resources, endangered species, and toxic contamination like PFAS (pronounced P’-FAS). According to the court filing, the cuts will hit hardest at the U.S. Geological Survey, Bureau of Land Management, and regional National Park Service offices. Meanwhile, EPA staff received another round of furlough notices as the agency’s funding dries up during the government shutdown.

Conservation groups identify this as the next stage of a broader campaign to eliminate environmental data collection. EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin has described this sequence of decisions as the largest rollback of environmental protections in U.S. history. President Trump recently stated the shutdown provides an opportunity to dismantle what he calls “Democrat programs” and “woke” environmental protections, despite the fact that major environmental laws and the EPA itself originated during Nixon’s presidency, a Republican administration.

The Interior Department manages national parks, wildlife refuges, and public lands while conducting critical environmental research. The EPA layoffs specifically target staff who enforce anti-pollution laws and protect drinking water. As these cuts move forward, communities will lose access to crucial scientific research on flooding, wildfires, water quality, and wildlife—data that has guided public safety decisions for decades. ​​Without scientists monitoring water contamination, tracking endangered species, and researching the impacts of climate change, we’re moving through global environmental crises without guidance—losing not just data, but the ability to protect public health and respond to natural disasters before they become catastrophes.

“The claim that American Prairie ‘threatens the economic vitality’ of the state, is on its face absurd,” Geddes said.
Grazing permits have also been a source of contention for American Prairie, and the letter states the organization is violating federal law.
Challenges to the Bureau of Land Management over American Prairie grazing their bison say the act doesn’t allow for conservation grazing.
American Prairie asserts that’s not true and Geddes said nowhere in Taylor Grazing Act does it limit grazing permits to production livestock.","Montana Gov. Greg Gianforte, as well as all four members of the state’s federal delegation signed on to a letter last month claiming American Prairie’s bison restoration project is at odds with the state’s economy.

The five men sent the letter to Department of Interior Secretary Doug Burgum, the former governor of North Dakota. The Interior Department holds decision-making power over grazing rights on Bureau of Land Management land, which under former President Joe Biden were granted to American Prairie in 2022.

The state, along with livestock industry groups, appealed the federal decision. Some ranchers have also expressed concern about added costs of having bison near their cattle, including fears of brucellosis, a bacterial disease that can spread between the animals.

“For us, a decision in favor of APR will re-shape the entire landscape of our state,” the letter reads. “Montana’s most profitable economic industry, for decades, has been agriculture. Agriculture drives our economy, sustains our small rural towns, and is the cultural epicenter of our state.”

While there’s no question agriculture is a cultural hallmark of the state, as a percentage of the state’s real gross domestic product, the industry ranked 12th in 2022. That year, Montana generated around $4.6 billion in agricultural cash receipts.

The letter goes on to argue removing “vast swaths” of land from agricultural production will harm the state and allowing American Prairie those grazing rights “threatens the economic vitality of our most important industry.”

American Prairie has sought to reintroduce bison to parts of Montana and owns more than 500,000 acres in the state. They own and manage 900 head of bison across 46,000 acres. The organization leases much of its land to cattle producers, supporting about 7,000 head and 25 ranchers, the organization spokesperson Pete Geddes said in a statement. There are almost a half million cattle in the seven counties they work, he added. Including calves, there are about 2.1 million head of cattle in the state.

“The claim that American Prairie ‘threatens the economic vitality’ of the state, is on its face absurd,” Geddes said. “American Prairie has little influence on the long-term demographic and economic trends in Central Montana. Extended drought, market fluctuations, international trade policies, personal family decisions, and global integrated agricultural markets have much larger impacts.”

Geddes went on to say that since 2020, the organization has paid $7 million in payroll, supporting 23 local jobs in Fergus and Phillips Counties, which infused $17 million into those economies, he said. They’ve also paid $877,000 in property taxes and $345,000 to ranchers participating in a wildlife abundance program, he added.

Some ranchers, including Gilles Stockton, an author and former president of the Montana Cattlemen’s Association, have other concerns.

“If you’re ranching in a brucellosis designated area, which they have in southwestern Montana, it’s hugely expensive,” Stockton said. “And it’s doubly expensive if one of your cows happens to become brucellosis positive.”

Some elk and about 60% of female bison in Yellowstone National Park test positive for brucellosis, a disease that attacks the reproductive system and causes abortions in pregnant cattle, elk, and bison. It’s a nonnative disease to the area, brought into Yellowstone by cattle in the 1900s and can also cause sickness in humans, though human infection is uncommon and the state hasn’t reported an official case since 2017.

“One of the primary mechanisms of historical transmission to people is through the milk, but pasteurization has made that a nearly obsolete pathway,” Dr. Tahnee Szymanski, State Veterinarian, said in an interview with the Daily Montanan. “In the 1930s and ’40s, here in the United States, we had a much higher incidence of brucellosis in our cattle herds all across the country, and they started the national brucellosis eradication program.”

The U.S. Department of Agriculture has what’s called Brucellosis Class Free status, a tool used to maintain compliance so infected animals aren’t being moved around or consumed.

Montana has a “Designated Surveillance Area” for the disease in southwestern Montana — stretching from Dillon to past Livingston, and down to Gardiner and the Wyoming and Idaho borders.

Those borders are built through a partnership with Montana Fish, Wildlife and Parks, Szymanski said. FWP will go out, capture, tag and test elk and track their movement. Park County and Madison County elk have tested positive for brucellosis, she said.

That said, Montana is considered brucellosis free.

“The only population of infected animals in Montana is Yellowstone National Park, bison or elk in the Greater Yellowstone Area, we have a couple of livestock herds that are under quarantine for past detections, but any other domestic bison or cattle herd in the state of Montana is considered to be free of brucellosis,” Szymanski said. “That includes tribal populations of bison, APR, bison, people should not be concerned about those animals because of potential disease risk.”

About 100,000 brucellosis tests are administered in that area each year to keep the state’s class free status, according to the Montana Department of Livestock. Cattle vaccinations do have hurdles and have to be performed by a licensed veterinarian.

“If a human accidentally injected themselves with it, that it would make them kind of substantially sick,” Szymanski said.

That costs about $630,000 per year, according to the agency. Losing the status would incur even more testing costs by places that receive bison and cattle from the state.

“Loss of Class Free status would lead to required testing of livestock exported from anywhere in the State (not just southwest Montana) and cost the livestock producers millions of dollars for testing as well as revenue from lost sales due to a negative stigma,” a Department of Livestock information sheet reads.

American Prairie tests their animals regularly, Geddes said, and brucellosis is not present in their bison.

Grazing permits have also been a source of contention for American Prairie, and the letter states the organization is violating federal law.

The letter mentions the Taylor Grazing Act, legislation dating back to 1934 that created stipulations for grazing cattle and eventually led to the creation of the Bureau of Land Management.

Challenges to the Bureau of Land Management over American Prairie grazing their bison say the act doesn’t allow for conservation grazing. American Prairie asserts that’s not true and Geddes said nowhere in Taylor Grazing Act does it limit grazing permits to production livestock.

“The BLM is authorized to issue grazing permits to ‘stock owners.’ American Prairie qualifies as both a ‘stock owner’ and ‘engaged in the livestock business.’ AP bison are livestock and we are operating as a non-profit business,” Geddes said. “American Prairie’s primary purpose for obtaining grazing permits is for grazing livestock.”

One of American Prairie’s goals is returning the land to a state more similar to when hundreds of thousands of bison roamed free before colonization and westward expansion.

The Taylor Grazing Act was in part intended to preserve and protect that same grassland, Stockton said, who feels ranchers have done a pretty good job of that.

“The results of that is that we were able to take land that had been really badly overused and restore it across eastern Montana,” Stockton said. “So, you know, the grasslands that you have in eastern Montana are really in the best shapes that they’ve ever been.”

Stockton ranches near Grass Range, is close to American Prairie holdings and feels the Bureau of Land Management overstepped their authority. There’s frustrations with who gets to graze when, fencing problems — keeping cattle away from bison, in a ranchers eyes — and costs associated with vaccinations if brucellosis does spread further.

But, even then, other concerns for Stockton trump issues with the bison nonprofit.

“We got a feeling that the APR, when they moved in here, they were at war with our culture, I guess, our communities and our cultures,” Stockton said. “But the fact of the matter is that in terms of actual impact, say, for me, personally, I’ve got more trouble with my billionaire neighbors.”",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/s3/files/styles/social_large/s3/articles/feeds-state-89/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/52100233780_02eb91d8f6_k-1024x6831761343452.jpg?h=199d8c1f&itok=qXcwLnyj,N,,2025-10-25 10:18:52.695756

Dear Alumni, Students, and Colleagues:

At the University of Michigan, we have a rich legacy of supporting the economy.

More than 170 years ago, business leaders in Detroit needed help. Specifically, they needed more accurate timekeeping for railroads, which were the lifeblood of many industries.

At the same time, the University’s president asked business leaders to support the mission of research and science.

The result was that the business community stepped forward to fund a new observatory on the Ann Arbor campus. Astronomical science enabled accurate timekeeping, which improved shipping arrivals and departures. And the University of Michigan had a cutting-edge laboratory to create new knowledge.

The building with its magnificent telescopes still stands today. It is called the Detroit Observatory, in honor of its benefactors, and is the oldest research facility on our campus. It embodies collaboration for the improvement of society.

Ripple effect

When our scientists and researchers receive federal funding, those dollars have a tremendous ripple effect on the economy. This past year, our University spent over $332 million on goods and services to support federally funded projects. That meant hiring services, purchasing materials and equipment, and renting space in cities and towns throughout our state — and it happens every year.

This type of impact is amplified when considering that our state has four R1 research universities, whose collective economic impact from federal R&D funding exceeds $8.3 billion.

I strongly encourage business, community, and alumni leaders to join us in advocating for the contributions and impact of research universities, as well as the partnerships we build with businesses, industry, and nonprofits.

We all benefit from a robust higher education ecosystem.

Return on investment

Higher education in this country is currently under attack. I believe it is an assault grounded in misinformation and misunderstanding. Our universities transform a public investment into a public good. This includes supporting communities and economies through our discoveries and the talents of our graduates. Every year, employers can tap into thousands of the world’s top students who graduate from our three campuses.

Here’s something else to remember about partnering with higher education: Universities don’t move. We don’t pull up stakes and relocate to other countries. At the University of Michigan, we are firmly committed to our three home communities, the state of Michigan, and the nation. We are dedicated to the common good.

I’d like to share one of the most inspiring stories of recent economic impact and success.

Twenty years ago, several researchers at U-M developed a radical method for noninvasive surgery. They used focused ultrasound waves to target and destroy tissue like cancerous tumors.

The researchers called this new method histotripsy. A U-M startup company, HistoSonics, is commercializing histotripsy and this completely non-invasive form of surgery.

Two years ago, they obtained FDA approval to use histotripsy to eradicate liver tumors. Today, they have clinical trials underway to expand the use of this technology to tumors of the pancreas and kidney.

Last year the company celebrated the opening of its advanced R&D facility in Ann Arbor where they anticipate adding 40 high-growth jobs.

Then, just last month, a group of public and private investors acquired HistoSonics for an astounding $2.25 billion. An idea launched in a University of Michigan laboratory sold for more than $2 billion.

Investment to impact

Patients are receiving highly effective treatment that is relatively painless and requires less time in the hospital.

Ann Arbor has an R&D company that continues to thrive, as HistoSonics now plans to apply its technology to kidney, pancreas, and prostate cancers with more disease areas in the future.

And the University of Michigan has yet another proof point of how it energizes the local and state economy.

A robust economy — one that draws upon university resources and talent — translates to well-paying jobs, good neighborhoods, and strong schools. That is genuine impact.

We are here to serve society. Over 200 years ago, we were founded in the public interest, and this mission has been our core ever since.

Look to Michigan for discovery and collaboration.

Look to Michigan for talent and technology.

And look to Michigan, and all of higher education, as a valued partner in building and sustaining vibrant economies.

Thank you, and Forever Go Blue.",https://michigantoday.umich.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/89/mc-image-cache/2025/10/Presidents-Message-Domenic-Grasso-UMCI-MPHOTO-UMCI_GndBk_gal03-1536x1024-1.jpg,N,,2025-10-24 19:19:23.789146

""The transformation of US resource independence policy represents both unprecedented opportunity and significant risk for investors.","US resource independence has become a cornerstone of American strategic policy, with the current administration implementing comprehensive measures to reduce foreign mineral dependencies that threaten national security. Furthermore, this strategic shift encompasses critical materials essential for everything from defense systems to renewable energy infrastructure, marking a fundamental transformation in how America approaches resource security.

The transition represents more than traditional energy independence, extending to dozens of critical minerals currently dominated by foreign producers. However, achieving true resource independence requires overcoming complex supply chain challenges and substantial infrastructure development across multiple sectors.

Understanding America's Strategic Resource Position

Resource independence differs significantly from energy independence in both scope and complexity. While energy independence primarily focuses on oil, gas, and renewable energy production, resource independence encompasses over 50 critical minerals essential for national security and economic competitiveness.

The Department of Energy's Critical Materials List identifies materials where supply disruptions could severely impact the economy or national security. These range from rare earth elements used in military applications to lithium powering electric vehicle batteries. Current US import dependency exceeds 50% for 31 of these critical materials, with complete reliance on imports for 14 minerals.

China's market position creates particular vulnerability, controlling approximately 60% of global rare earth mining and 87% of rare earth processing capacity. This dominance extends beyond raw materials into refined products, with Chinese companies processing materials mined in other countries before selling finished products globally.

The geopolitical implications extend beyond simple supply security. Control over critical mineral processing allows influence over pricing, quality standards, and supply allocation during international tensions. Recent trade disputes have demonstrated how quickly mineral access can become a diplomatic weapon, highlighting the uranium market volatility that can result from geopolitical tensions.

Strategic Minerals Driving Policy Changes

Rare Earth Elements and Defense Applications

Rare earth elements represent perhaps the most critical vulnerability in US supply chains. These 17 elements are essential for precision-guided munitions, satellite communications, and advanced radar systems. A single F-35 fighter jet contains approximately 920 pounds of rare earth materials.

Current US rare earth mining occurs primarily at the Mountain Pass facility in California, which produces concentrate that must be shipped to China for processing due to lack of domestic separation capabilities. This creates a strategic dependency that administration policies aim to eliminate within the next decade.

The Russian uranium ban impact demonstrates how quickly geopolitical events can disrupt critical mineral supply chains. Consequently, diversifying supply sources and developing domestic processing capabilities has become a national security priority.

Copper's Infrastructure Role

Copper demand for renewable energy infrastructure significantly exceeds current production capacity. Wind turbines require 3-5 tons of copper each, while electric vehicles use four times more copper than conventional vehicles. The International Energy Agency projects copper demand could increase by 70% by 2030 under current clean energy scenarios.

US copper production faces challenges from aging mines and lengthy permitting processes. Major deposits in Arizona and Nevada could supply domestic demand, but require substantial infrastructure investment and regulatory streamlining to reach production targets. Moreover, copper price insights suggest significant price appreciation potential for domestically produced copper.

Uranium Energy Security

Nuclear energy provides approximately 20% of US electricity generation, yet domestic uranium production has declined dramatically since the 1980s. The US imports roughly 95% of uranium requirements, with significant portions coming from Russia and Kazakhstan.

Recent legislation prohibits Russian uranium imports beginning in 2028, creating urgency around domestic production revival. Wyoming and New Mexico possess substantial uranium reserves, but production restart requires both capital investment and regulatory support for in-situ recovery operations.

Lithium for Battery Technology

Global lithium demand is projected to increase by 2,000% by 2030 driven by electric vehicle adoption and energy storage requirements. The US possesses significant lithium resources, particularly in Nevada's Clayton Valley and North Carolina's hard rock deposits.

However, domestic lithium production requires overcoming technical challenges in brine processing and environmental concerns around water usage in arid regions. Current US production meets less than 2% of domestic consumption, highlighting the magnitude of required capacity expansion. Additionally, lithium industry innovations provide insights into technological advances that could enhance domestic production efficiency.

Current Administration's Policy Reshaping

Regulatory Fast-Tracking Mechanisms

The administration has implemented sweeping changes to mineral project permitting, reducing environmental review timelines from an average of 7-10 years to 12-24 months for projects designated as nationally significant. This acceleration applies to both mining and processing facilities deemed critical for supply chain security.

Priority designation systems now categorise projects based on strategic importance, with highest-priority developments receiving dedicated federal coordination teams. These teams streamline inter-agency reviews and resolve regulatory conflicts that historically delayed projects for years.

Federal land access has expanded significantly, with previously restricted areas now available for critical mineral exploration. The Bureau of Land Management has identified over 2 million acres suitable for expedited mineral development, representing a 40% increase in available federal mining lands.

Nevertheless, mining permitting challenges remain substantial despite regulatory streamlining efforts. Furthermore, successful project development requires navigating complex environmental and community stakeholder requirements.

Financial Incentives and Government Backing

Direct government equity participation marks a dramatic shift in US resource policy. The Inflation Reduction Act allocated $500 million for direct investment in overseas critical mineral projects, with additional funding available through the Development Finance Corporation.

Recent investments include equity stakes in lithium projects in Argentina and rare earth developments in Australia. These investments position the US as an active participant rather than passive purchaser in global mineral markets. Moreover, these investments often include offtake agreements ensuring material flows to US processing facilities.

Tax incentives for domestic mining operations now include accelerated depreciation for processing equipment and research credits for innovative extraction technologies. Infrastructure funding exceeds $2 billion for rail, port, and processing facility development in mining regions.

Strategic tariff implementation creates preferential pricing for ally-nation mineral imports while penalising Chinese-processed materials. Section 232 investigations have expanded beyond steel and aluminium to cover rare earths, graphite, and other strategic materials.

Bilateral agreements with Australia, Canada, and selected African nations establish preferential trade status for critical minerals. These agreements are often coupled with technology sharing arrangements and joint infrastructure development commitments.

Investment screening through the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States now explicitly covers mineral processing facilities and technology companies. This prevents foreign acquisition of strategic capabilities essential for US resource independence.

Investment Opportunities in US Resource Independence

Domestic Mining Sector Potential

Established mining companies with shovel-ready projects represent the most immediate investment opportunities. Copper developments in Arizona's copper triangle could begin production within 18-24 months given current regulatory support, while Nevada lithium projects benefit from existing infrastructure and water rights.

Key Development Projects by Mineral Type:

• Copper – Arizona (Resolution): Production start 2027-2028, Investment required $2.8 billion

• Rare Earths – Texas (Round Top): Production start 2026-2027, Investment required $1.2 billion

• Lithium – Nevada (Clayton Valley): Production start 2025-2026, Investment required $800 million

• Uranium – Wyoming (Nichols Ranch): Production start 2025, Investment required $150 million

Junior mining companies with advanced-stage projects face particular opportunities given current government support and streamlined permitting. However, these investments carry higher execution risk and require careful due diligence on management capabilities and financing arrangements.

Processing and Refining Infrastructure Gaps

The most significant opportunity exists in midstream processing and refining capabilities currently absent from US supply chains. Rare earth separation facilities could generate returns exceeding 20% annually given current supply-demand imbalances and government support.

Critical Processing Capacity Gaps:

• Rare earth separation: 100% import dependent

• Lithium hydroxide production: 85% import dependent

• Copper smelting: 40% import dependent

• Uranium conversion: 95% import dependent

Technology development for cleaner, more efficient processing methods attracts both government grants and private investment. Advanced separation technologies, automated processing systems, and waste reduction innovations represent high-growth subsectors within the broader resource independence theme.

Strategic Overseas Investments

Government-backed overseas projects offer risk-adjusted returns through shared financing and political risk insurance. Recent investments in Ukrainian titanium projects and Zambian copper developments demonstrate the model's structure and potential returns.

Joint ventures with allied governments often include preferential terms for US companies, including tax incentives, infrastructure support, and long-term supply agreements. These arrangements provide exposure to high-quality international assets while maintaining alignment with US strategic objectives. However, comprehensive assessment of US energy independence initiatives shows the complexity of achieving true resource autonomy.

Risk Considerations for Investors

Political and Timeline Pressures

The emphasis on shovel-ready projects within 12-24 months creates both opportunity and risk. Companies unable to achieve rapid production may find themselves excluded from current policy support, while those that can capitalise face potential windfalls from expedited approvals and financial backing.

Critical Timeline Considerations:

• Environmental permits must be substantially complete

• Financing arrangements should be finalised within six months

• Construction capability must be immediately available

• Offtake agreements provide demand certainty

Policy continuity represents the primary political risk, as regulatory approaches could shift significantly with future administrations. Successful investment strategies require projects capable of generating returns under various policy scenarios rather than dependence on current regulatory advantages.

Environmental and Legal Challenges

Expedited permitting invites legal challenges from environmental groups arguing inadequate review processes. Several fast-tracked projects already face litigation that could delay or halt development despite government support.

Water rights issues particularly affect lithium and copper projects in arid western states, where competing agricultural and municipal demands create complex legal environments. Climate change impacts on water availability add long-term uncertainty to water-intensive extraction operations.

Indigenous land rights and cultural site protection represent additional legal complexities, especially for projects on or near federal lands with tribal significance. Successful developers increasingly invest in early community engagement and benefit-sharing agreements to minimise opposition.

Global Competition and Market Dynamics

China's Strategic Response

China has responded to US resource independence efforts by accelerating Belt and Road Initiative mineral investments, particularly in Africa and South America. Chinese companies now control approximately 70% of lithium processing capacity in Chile and Argentina, the world's largest lithium-producing nations.

Processing capacity expansion within China aims to maintain downstream control even if raw material sourcing diversifies. New facilities in Jiangxi and Sichuan provinces will increase Chinese rare earth processing capacity by 40% by 2026, potentially offsetting US domestic development efforts.

Technology export restrictions now limit Chinese equipment and expertise availability for non-Chinese processing facilities. This creates technical challenges for US and allied nation development projects. Alternative technology sources from Japan, Germany, and Australia carry higher costs and longer deployment timelines.

Alternative Benchmarking Systems

Price discovery outside Chinese-controlled markets requires new benchmarking mechanisms and trading platforms. London Metal Exchange initiatives for rare earth pricing and lithium futures markets attempt to create alternative reference points, though liquidity remains limited.

Long-term supply agreements increasingly incorporate risk-sharing mechanisms that protect both producers and consumers from price volatility. These include sliding-scale pricing, volume flexibility, and force majeure protections that traditional spot markets cannot provide.

Regional market development focuses on creating supply chains among allied nations, reducing dependence on global commodity markets dominated by Chinese participants. The US-Canada-Australia critical minerals partnership exemplifies this approach through preferential trading arrangements and shared infrastructure development.

Processing and Refining Opportunities

Midstream Value Chain Development

The greatest value creation potential exists in processing and refining operations that transform raw materials into battery-grade and industrial-grade products. Current US capabilities meet less than 15% of domestic demand for processed critical minerals, creating substantial market opportunities.

Processing Investment Requirements by Mineral:

• Rare Earth Separation – Facility Cost: $800M-1.2B, Annual Capacity: 5,000-8,000 tons, Payback Period: 4-6 years

• Lithium Hydroxide – Facility Cost: $400M-600M, Annual Capacity: 25,000-40,000 tons, Payback Period: 3-4 years

• Copper Smelting – Facility Cost: $1.5B-2.2B, Annual Capacity: 200,000-300,000 tons, Payback Period: 5-7 years

• Uranium Conversion – Facility Cost: $200M-350M, Annual Capacity: 8,000-12,000 tons, Payback Period: 3-5 years

Technology innovation requirements focus on environmental compliance and energy efficiency improvements that make US processing competitive with lower-cost international alternatives. Advanced extraction techniques, automated operations, and waste heat recovery systems represent key technological differentiators.

Infrastructure Investment Needs

Transportation infrastructure improvements require substantial capital investment to connect mining regions with processing facilities and export terminals. Rail capacity expansion in Wyoming and Nevada could require $2-3 billion in private and public investment over the next decade.

Strategic storage facilities for critical minerals represent both opportunity and necessity, given supply chain vulnerability concerns. Government partnerships for strategic stockpile management could provide stable revenue streams for storage facility operators while enhancing national security preparedness.

What Are the Key Political Risk Indicators for Resource Independence Projects?

Political risk assessment requires evaluation of government stability, regulatory consistency, and policy continuity across mine lifecycles spanning decades. Traditional metrics like credit ratings provide insufficient insight into mining-specific risks such as royalty changes, environmental regulation evolution, and resource nationalism trends.

Key Political Risk Indicators:

• Regulatory framework consistency over election cycles

• Government revenue dependence on mineral exports

• Historical treatment of foreign mining investments

• Infrastructure development support and maintenance

• Community relations and social licence stability

Operational risk management extends beyond traditional financial metrics to include community relations, environmental compliance, and workforce availability. Mining projects in remote locations require comprehensive assessment of infrastructure adequacy, skilled labour availability, and emergency response capabilities.

Geographic Diversification Strategies

Portfolio construction across multiple jurisdictions reduces concentration risk while maintaining exposure to resource independence themes. Balanced exposure between US domestic projects and overseas developments in allied nations provides both policy alignment and risk mitigation.

Risk-adjusted return calculations must incorporate political risk insurance costs, currency hedging requirements, and longer-term policy stability factors that traditional investment analysis may overlook. Joint venture partnerships with local companies often provide valuable risk mitigation through local knowledge and government relationships.

Future Outlook for US Resource Independence

Production Capacity Projections Through 2030

Domestic mining output could increase by 300-500% for critical minerals under current policy support, though achieving these targets requires sustained investment and regulatory consistency. Rare earth production capacity could reach 50,000 tons annually by 2030, meeting approximately 30% of domestic demand.

Processing facility development timelines suggest domestic refining capacity could achieve 40-60% self-sufficiency for most critical minerals by 2030, assuming current investment trends continue. However, technical workforce development and technology transfer remain significant challenges requiring sustained attention.

Projected US Self-Sufficiency by 2030:

• Rare Earths – Current Level: 15%, 2030 Target: 45%, Key Constraints: Processing technology

• Lithium – Current Level: 2%, 2030 Target: 35%, Key Constraints: Water rights, permitting

• Copper – Current Level: 65%, 2030 Target: 80%, Key Constraints: Environmental approval

• Uranium – Current Level: 5%, 2030 Target: 25%, Key Constraints: Market demand uncertainty

Market share evolution will depend heavily on continued policy support, technological advancement, and successful resolution of environmental and community concerns. International competition from state-supported Chinese and other foreign producers creates ongoing pricing pressures that could affect project economics.

Sustainability and Environmental Integration

Future mining operations must integrate clean technology requirements and carbon footprint reduction mandates that reflect growing environmental consciousness and regulatory requirements. Advanced extraction techniques that minimise water usage and environmental disruption will become competitive necessities rather than optional enhancements.

Community benefit-sharing models increasingly influence project approval and social licence maintenance, requiring mining companies to demonstrate long-term value creation beyond traditional employment and tax revenue. These evolving requirements affect project economics and require early integration into development planning.

Moreover, current US energy policy initiatives emphasise the critical link between mineral security and broader energy independence objectives. This integrated approach recognises that achieving comprehensive resource independence requires coordinated development across multiple sectors.

""The transformation of US resource independence policy represents both unprecedented opportunity and significant risk for investors. Success requires careful navigation of political timelines, technical challenges, and evolving environmental requirements while maintaining focus on long-term strategic value creation.""

The window for capitalising on current policy support appears limited, making decisive action and thorough preparation essential for investment success. Furthermore, the strategic importance of achieving US resource independence extends beyond economic considerations to encompass fundamental national security interests that will likely maintain bipartisan support regardless of future political changes.

Disclaimer: This analysis involves forecasts and speculative elements regarding future policy developments, market conditions, and investment outcomes. Political and regulatory environments can change significantly, affecting project viability and investment returns. Mineral development projects carry substantial technical, environmental, and market risks that require professional evaluation and due diligence.

TOP NEWS IN THE FIGHT AGAINST CLIMATE CHANGE

STATE NEWS

ENERGY AFFORDABILITY IS ON THE BALLOT IN NEW JERSEY, VIRGINIA, AND GEORGIA ELECTIONS: In upcoming elections in Georgia, New Jersey, and Virginia, there has been a clear line drawn between the candidates responding to voters’ concerns on energy costs with real solutions and those toeing the MAGA party line by supporting the Trump administration’s ban on clean energy and multi-million dollar taxpayer bailout for expensive, dirtier energy sources like coal. LCV’s affiliates in these states are running multi-million dollar campaigns to drive the conversation around costs ensuring the public understands who is focused on the issues that matter and who is making the problem even worse. Read the full memo for more.

OUR TAKE: LCV Senior Vice President of Campaigns Sara Schreiber said, “Donald Trump and Congressional Republicans’ work to undermine, stall, and flat out ban wind and solar projects have led to higher utility bills for Americans nationwide. The Republican budget is expected to add more than $100 a year to Americans’ bills, and his administration’s attempt to block and limit wind and solar energy could cost even more. Affordability should be seen as the path to winning back voters’ trust. Candidates that are fully focused on bringing down utility costs and building homegrown clean energy will show voters they are serious about the issue. MAGA Republicans who are beholden to Trump’s disastrous energy agenda, will face the consequences of ignoring voters’ most pressing concerns.”

NJLCV HOSTS SOLAR FOR ALL TOUR AND ROUNDTABLE: New Jersey LCV hosted an event with New Jersey Attorney General Matthew Platkin to raise awareness of the cancellation of $7 billion in funding for the Solar for All program. New Jersey joined 19 other states in filing a lawsuit against the Trump administration for its cancellation of the program, which would provide $156 million for clean energy in the state.

NJLCV TAKE: New Jersey LCV said, “Yesterday, Attorney General Matt Platkin visited the Social Profit Center in Hamilton, NJ where he viewed a rooftop solar and garden to highlight the lawsuit he filed alongside 22 other plaintiffs against the EPA for ending funding for the Solar for All program. The community solar program would have provided clean energy to more than 22,000 households in low-income and disadvantaged communities right here in New Jersey.

“This visit provided an opportunity to discuss how New Jersey is fighting back against Trump’s extreme energy agenda, which is raising electricity costs for working families in New Jersey while enriching billionaire oil and gas CEOs.”

INDIANA CONSERVATION VOTERS DELIVER ADDITIONAL PETITION SIGNATURES AGAINST MID-DECADE REDISTRICTING: Indiana Conservation Voters (ICV), Common Cause Indiana, the League of Women Voters of Indiana, Citizens Action Coalition and Women for Change, delivered more than 10,000 new signatures opposing mid-decade redistricting to the Indiana Statehouse. This more than doubles the initial petition drop delivered in early September.

ICV TAKE: Indiana Conservation Voters Executive Director Megan Robertson said, “Hoosiers have spoken—again and again and again. For more than two months, communities across the state have made it clear that they don’t want lawmakers to reopen the maps.

“The question for Governor Braun is simple: What will it take for him to listen to Hoosiers instead of Washington outsiders? When he came back to Indiana to run for Governor, Braun said it was because D.C. is broken. If that’s the case, why allow Washington operatives to come into our state with their outrageous demands. Hoosiers deserve better, and the Governor has a chance to say ‘no’ right now.”

ARIZONA COMMUNITIES CALL TO REINSTATE SOLAR FOR ALL: This past week, Chispa Arizona joined Activate 48, Vote Solar, and partners at the State Capitol to call out the EPA’s decision to pull $156 million in Solar for All funding — a program meant to help, not harm, communities. Leaders from across the state emphasized that all Arizonans, regardless of their race, zip code, or income, deserve the clean energy jobs, cost savings, and health benefits that this program would bring.

NEVADA ADVOCATES PUSH TO RESTORE SOLAR FOR ALL FUNDING: At a news conference on Tuesday, community advocates and Nevada Attorney General Aaron Ford came together to discuss the importance of the Solar for All program for community members struggling with high energy costs.

NEVADA FAMILIES SAY NO TO MORE RATE HIKES: Chispa Nevada and Nevada Conservation League (NCL) joined community members and partners — including Make the Road Nevada, Nevada Environmental Justice Coalition, EcoMadres, and PLAN Nevada — at the Public Utilities Commission of Nevada (PUCN) General Consumer Session to demand that commissioners say no to more rate increases from NV Energy. Over 65 people attended and nearly 50 people gave public comments opposing the PUCN’s recent approval of another NV Energy rate hike. Chispa NV and NCL are supporting an effort to seek reconsideration of the rate increase.

CHISPA NV TAKE: Chispa Nevada member Ana Gonzalez said, “We’re here once again to raise our voices and make ourselves heard. The PUCN’s rate case decision is unjust and shows that they don’t understand what Nevada working families are going through. We are willing to pay a fair price. But these constant price increases, overcharges and abuses by monopoly utility companies are increasing poverty in our state, with no relief in sight. We can’t go on like this. We demand change.”

NCL TAKE: Nevada Conservation League Southern NV Communications Organizer Yesi Castro Lopez said, “We deserve real accountability. Decisions that deeply impact our lives — like raising rates, changing solar billing, and approving this new demand charge — should balance everyday Nevadans like me and our interests in a fair, impartial manner. I urge the Public Utilities Commission of Nevada to demand transparency and fairness from these utilities to be more prudent, efficient, economically responsible, and reliable.

NEW STUDY SHOWS CIATTARELLI’S ENERGY PLAN WOULD RAISE ENERGY COSTS: A new study found that New Jersey Republican gubernatorial nominee Jack Ciattarelli’s energy plan would raise energy prices by nearly $900 a year. Rather than lower prices for New Jersey families as promised, the Ciattarelli plan would decrease access to energy efficient appliances, electric vehicles, and cleaner renewable energy, raising costs for working families.

LCV RELEASES ENERGY AFFORDABILITY MESSAGING MEMO: LCV released a memo detailing how the Trump administration’s policies to ban clean energy are raising already sky-high energy prices at a time when everyday people are struggling to pay for basic necessities. The memo recommends messaging on energy in a way that acknowledges energy bills are too high, goes on offense to call out who is raising them, and promotes policy focused on lowering costs. Read the full memo for more.

OUR TAKE: LCV President Pete Maysmith said, “The climate threat remains real, present and costly. People are losing their homes in massive floods, parents are keeping their kids inside because of wildfire smoke, families are struggling with insurance premiums, energy bills, and groceries. Trump’s attacks on cleaner, cheaper and faster renewable energy not only worsen future impacts of a warming world–they have created a rising cost crisis for people right now. This provides us an opportunity, if we take it, to win this debate once and for all and make progress on clean energy that is both immediate and lasting.”

CLIMATE ATTACKS FROM THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION

DOI ANNOUNCES PLANS TO OPEN ARCTIC REFUGE FOR OIL AND GAS DRILLING, BUILD ROADS IN NATIONAL WILDLIFE REFUGE: Yesterday, the Alaska congressional delegation, Governor Mike Dunleavy, and Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum made a slew of announcements advancing oil and gas leasing in the Coastal Plain of the Arctic Refuge, greenlighting a road through the Izembek National Wildlife Refuge, and approving the right-of-ways for the Ambler Road Project to enable dirty mines in another Alaskan wilderness.

OUR TAKE: LCV Conservation Program Director America Fitzpatrick said, “While the government remains shut down and everyday people across the country are struggling with increasing healthcare, grocery, and energy costs, the Trump administration is once again putting the interests of its Big Oil billionaire donors over the public good. Today’s decisions from the Department of the Interior to build roads through Alaska’s sacred and treasured lands and push forward with oil and gas leasing in the entire Coastal Plain of the Arctic Refuge ignore decades of science and engagement with Indigenous communities. These decisions are reckless, not economically viable, and will hurt Alaska Native communities, their ways of life, and Alaska’s wildlife. LCV will continue to fight at every step of the way to protect these lands that sustain Alaska Native communities.”

TRUMP PLANS TO OPEN COASTS TO OFFSHORE DRILLING: Leaked federal documents revealed the Trump administration’s plans to open large sections of both the east and west coasts for offshore drilling. The proposal has drawn opposition from both Democrats and Republicans from coastal states. President Trump attempted a similar move during his first term, but backed down after bipartisan pushback threatened his reelection campaign.

The Climate and Community Institute and Public Grids report suggests overhauling the current system, shifting from investor-owned utilities to public power.","ALBANY, N.Y. (NEXSTAR) — The New York State Assembly held a hearing on Thursday to examine rising energy costs for everyday utility customers tied to new consumers on the electric grid, like artificial intelligence and cryptocurrency data centers. The Assembly Energy Committee addressed concerns that surging demand from these massive energy users will drive up bills for New Yorkers.

The hearing convened just as a new report from the Climate and Community Institute and Public Grids concluded that the design of electricity rates itself—which prioritizes private profit over universal public service—is the core reason for soaring utility bills. Authored by Isaac Sevier and Roshan Krishnan, “Overcharged: The Rules Of The Electricity Affordability Crisis” said that the data center boom merely aggravates flaws that already plague the broken energy system.

The New York Independent System Operator has estimated that the state could be short some 1,600 megawatts of power by 2030, largely because of demand from these new, large consumers of power. The state’s grid operator has 36 current projects in its interconnection queue, a waiting list potentially representing over 10,000 megawatts of new demand. National Grid alone is reviewing 10 active requests totaling 2.28 gigawatts of new demand, with 65% of that coming from manufacturing or industrial projects and 35% from data centers.

Sevier also warned that one in four New Yorkers struggles to pay their utility bills. He said corporations repeatedly raise rates because they are designed to prioritize their own profits and ignore externalities like pollution. He also underlined the federal government shutdown, costing New York access to financial lifelines like the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program and Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program.

“We need to ban utility shutoffs to protect New Yorkers today from the pressures of the extreme costs of living, buying us all more time to work on the core functions of the grid,” Sevier said.

The hearing questioned who should pay for vast infrastructure upgrades necessary to support rising demand from data centers. Representatives from utility companies, the digital infrastructure industry, and the New York State Public Service Commission said companies already pay for the interconnection costs they cause under the state’s current regulatory framework.

Rory Christian, Chair and CEO of the PSC, explained that they follow a “beneficiary pays” principle, meaning large new loads have to cover infrastructure costs they generate so residential customers do not pay the bill. And Javier Cobo, a Vice President at Avangrid—the parent company of New York State Electric and Gas and Rochester Gas and Electric)—agreed, insisting that their costs aren’t passed down to their customers.

But advocates doubted the beneficiary pays principle holds up. Laurie Wheelock, Executive Director of the Public Utility Law Project, suggested that the surge in wholesale power prices and the need for new capital infrastructure to support large users could still affect ratepayers. That’s because, for example, consumption spikes when AI models run, straining the grid and increasing costs on the supply side, while the new infrastructure translates to more capital costs on the delivery side.

Democratic Assemblymember Didi Barrett, Chair of the Energy Committee, cited reports of ratepayers in states like Illinois paying over 91% of the costs incurred by new, large energy consumers. She asked Christian about a reports that ratepayers upstate pay an extra $88 a year because of large-scale cryptomining. She also noted that tech companies like Amazon, Google, Meta, and Microsoft declined to send representation to the hearing despite being invited.

Christian acknowledged that sometimes, required grid upgrade costs are so high they that developers can’t or won’t pay:

Legislators have proposed a new measures that specifically cover large energy users. Barrett said she has a bill, the Accountable Costs for Data Center Act (S8540/A9039A), to create a new customer classification for large energy users like data centers for crypto or AI.

Republican Assemblymember Phil Palmesano, ranking member of the Assembly Energy Committee, questioned utility executives about the hundreds of millions of dollars that utilities collected from ratepayers for the state’s green energy mandates. He alleged that utilities are sitting on this money, which should be used for direct relief by and paying down customers’ high, overdue energy bills before funding green energy.

He also pointed out that unpaid arrears eventually get built into the next rate cases. Palmesano pushed for his legislation (S6412A/A6152A) requiring transparency by making utilities specifically disclose how much of the cost of a utility bill represents a surcharge from such mandates. The PSC and other state agencies would also publicly post that cost breakdown, itemized to include the Climate Leadership and Community Protection Act and programs related to offshore wind, electric heat pumps, or public policy transmission projects.

Advocates testified their backing for the ACDC Act. Elizabeth Moran, policy advocate for Earthjustice, supported the requirement that operations using at least 20 megawatts cover all of the associated costs and sign 10-year contracts to mitigate the risk that they’ll abandon projects. Earthjustice recommended meeting new demand with new, clean, and local energy supplies.

Wheelock pointed out that the specific service class would let the state monitor companies and set rates to accurately reflect the real costs. She added that utilities already include lots of detailed data on bills. That’s why she favored more transparency about how large consumer contribute to the system rather than a breakdown of costs for green mandates. PULP also recommended a dedicated technical panel for large energy users in every rate case.

The hearing also interrogated whether the state can maintain reliable and affordable energy supply. Zach Smith, Senior Vice President for NYISO, said that the New York power grid stands at an inflection point:

Smith owed the grid’s profound challenges to an aging fleet of power plants, the difficulty of building new resources quickly, and the rapid growth of larger energy demands. He warned that new large load connections are likely to outpace construction for generating and supplying power from new sources.

Still, large load users like cryptominers are more flexible than other, traditional industrial energy consumers. Hayley Miller, Director at the Digital Power Network, explained that Bitcoin miners can reduce consumption by over 95% in minutes without harming their operations. And Clint Plummer, CEO of Rise Light and Power, recommended requiring companies to pay for new power projects through long-term purchase agreements.

Tyler Norris, a research fellow at Duke University’s Nicholas School of the Environment, agreed that data center flexibility could exploited for better outcomes, temporarily reducing power when the grid is under strain. He suggested that modest changes, like cutting back power for about 44 hours per year, would let New York handle about four more gigawatts of consumption without any major upgrades. Norris said load flexibility could save hundreds of millions of dollars, since the price of new gas turbines is about $2 million per megawatt.

Utility representatives maintained that new load growth benefits all customers by spreading the fixed costs of the electric grid across a larger base of customers. Matt Barnett, Chief Operating Officer for National Grid’s New York Electric Business, said thoughtful growth helps customer affordability so communities prosper. Joe Halley, Vice President of Regulatory Affairs at Central Hudson, noted that new revenues from large customers usually cover infrastructure costs and can benefit existing customers, because increased sales reduces rates.

But environmental justice advocates said the scramble to meet new demands on the grid would force the state to rely on polluting power plants that damage vulnerable communities. Conor Bambrick, Senior Climate Advisor for the New York City Environmental Justice Alliance, pointed out that many of New York City’s peaker power plants—which only run during hours of high demand—are in disadvantaged communities and cost ratepayers some $400 million or more each year.

Bambrick added community concerns like massive water use for cooling electronics, decreasing water and supply, while increasing water bills in other states. He noted that data centers pose the most significant threat to the state meeting its goals for renewable energy and greenhouse gas emissions. And Moran warned that data centers would erase any of those clean energy gains by forcing the grid to use dirtier, more expensive fuels.

The Climate and Community Institute and Public Grids report suggests overhauling the current system, shifting from investor-owned utilities to public power. The state could use public banks or other public finance authorities and terminate privately held franchise agreements to buy back the grid from private owners. They could reevaluate grid investments as if they were made under public ownership, with a 0% rate of return on equity premium. The goal would be prioritizing electricity as an affordable public good rather than a corporation maximizing shareholder profits, thus keeping costs low for new infrastructure.

Besides New York’s energy burden, the report also details local wealth inequality. The state’s “ultra-rich—households with over $30 million in net worth—hold $6.7 trillion in wealth. Meanwhile, the most vulnerable are under a “high energy burden,” meaning they spend at least 6% of household income on energy. In regions like the North Country and the Bronx, that applies to one in three households.

The report found that New York’s poorest households spend up to 34% of their income on energy on average. As of December 2024, over 1.3 million New York households were 60 days or more behind on utility bills, collectively owing more than $1.8 billion.",https://www.news10.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/64/2025/10/AdobeStock_1307828176.jpeg?w=1280,N,,2025-10-24 21:02:48.182163

New Transfer Provision EPA proposes to establish new transfer provisions to increase flexibility in the face of unexpected operational changes.
Alternative Applicability Date and Late NOPP EPA proposes a requirement for permitting authorities to extend applicability dates under the 2020 or 2024 ELG rules when an unexpected and uncontrollable circumstance occurs.
Clarifications to Must-Run Provision EPA proposes to clarify four aspects of the 2024 Rule’s “must-run” provision.","On October 2, EPA published the proposed effluent limitations guidelines (ELG) Deadline Extension Rule for the steam electric power generating industry to revise a series of provisions in the 2024 ELG rule. These revisions include extending the notice of planned participation (NOPP) and zero-discharge compliance deadlines, adding a new transfer provision to allow facilities to switch between compliance alternatives, and creating new authority for state permitting agencies to include alternative applicability dates based on site-specific factors. EPA also seeks comment on several key issues, including some that may inform a separate, future rulemaking. Comments on EPA’s proposal are due November 3.

The proposed rule, if issued as a final rule, would likely provide greater flexibility for electric generating units (EGUs) to meet ELG compliance deadlines, respond to unexpected market changes and supply chain uncertainty, and switch between compliance alternatives.

Background

The Clean Water Act (CWA) prohibits the unauthorized discharge of any pollutant to waters of the United States (WOTUS). Dischargers can obtain authorization to discharge limited pollutants through a National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit. An NPDES permit limits the amount of pollutants that can be discharged based on water quality standards and technology-based limits. Technology-based limits are set in accordance with effluent limitation guidelines (ELGs) promulgated by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Included in the 59 industries for which EPA has promulgated ELGs is the steam electric power generating industry (e.g., coal-fired power plants). EPA previously promulgated final regulations revising these ELGs in 2015, 2020, and 2024.

Key Elements of EPA’s Proposed ELG Extension Rule

EPA’s proposed rule includes provisions to extend NOPP and zero-discharge compliance deadlines, allow transfers between zero-discharge and 2034 subcategory compliance regimes, require alternative applicability dates, allow late NOPP submissions, and clarify the must-run provision.[1]

Extension of NOPP Submission Deadline

EPA proposes to extend the deadline to submit a NOPP for the 2034 cessation subcategory by six years to December 31, 2031. According to EPA, this deadline will give the owner or operator of an EGU more time to decide whether to participate in the 2034 cessation subcategory, which requires them to comply with certain requirements set forth in the 2024 rule. EPA is soliciting comments on alternative deadlines for submitting a NOPP and whether there are significant reliance interests related to the 2025 deadline.

Contemporaneously with EPA’s notice of proposed rulemaking, it published a direct final rule to extend the NOPP submission deadline to December 31, 2031, because, according to EPA, this change is noncontroversial, and notice-and-comment proceedings are unnecessary. This direct final rule will take effect on December 1 without further notice, unless EPA receives adverse comments by November 3. In that case, EPA will withdraw the direct final rule and address comments in any subsequent final rule.

Extension of Zero-Discharge Compliance Deadline

EPA proposes to extend the zero-discharge compliance deadlines for flue gas desulfurization wastewater (FGDW), bottom ash transport water (BATW), and combustion residual leachate (CRL) effluents standards by five years. In the 2024 rule, zero-discharge requirements must be met as soon as possible but “no later than” December 31, 2029. EPA proposes to extend the “no later than” deadline to December 31, 2034. EPA cites three primary reasons for this revision. First, the 2029 deadline may not be feasible due to possible unavailability of control technologies or their component parts. Second, extending the deadline will allow facilities that recently invested to comply with the 2020 rule more time to amortize technology costs, which could make it more feasible to comply with the 2024 rule. Third, the proposed deadline will allow facilities to transfer out of the 2034 subcategory and continue to generate electricity to satisfy national energy needs.

New Transfer Provision

EPA proposes to establish new transfer provisions to increase flexibility in the face of unexpected operational changes. Specifically, EPA proposes to allow transfers between zero-discharge requirements and the 2034 cessation subcategory compliance tracks. Under this proposed provision, facilities would be able to transfer, in either direction, up until the December 31, 2034, deadline.

Alternative Applicability Date and Late NOPP

EPA proposes a requirement for permitting authorities to extend applicability dates under the 2020 or 2024 ELG rules when an unexpected and uncontrollable circumstance occurs.[2] In particular, EPA proposes to require permitting authorities to establish an alternative applicability date where a facility 1) transfers between limitations or backs out of a commitment to permanently cease coal combustion due to an unexpected change in regional capacity markets or local demand, 2) faces unexpected supply chain issues, or 3) faces any other circumstance that requires additional time and is wholly outside both the facility’s control and the facility’s ability to plan.[3] As proposed, this requirement would allow an alternative applicability date and associated milestones to be included in the permit, despite existing regulatory requirements. Additionally, EPA proposes to add a provision that would allow a permitting authority to accept a late NOPP submission if the facility experiences one of these circumstances. According to the proposal, a facility wishing to submit a late NOPP must submit an initial request letter and regular progress reports to its permitting authority.

Clarifications to Must-Run Provision

EPA proposes to clarify four aspects of the 2024 Rule’s “must-run” provision. First, the “must-run” provision is intended to cover any reliability must-run agreement or similar order, including FERC’s acceptance of a reliability must-run agreement. Second, an EGU’s certification to cease coal combustion followed by a Balancing Authority’s projection that it will cause a resource adequacy shortfall constitutes a qualifying event under the must-run provision. Third, any event listed in the must-run provision would trigger the reporting and recordkeeping requirements. Lastly, the term “increased production” in 40 C.F.R. § 423.19(i)(3) includes extended production.

EPA Solicits Comment on Key Issues

In response to industry feedback, EPA also seeks comment on the “availability” and “economic achievability” of zero-discharge technologies, cessation subcategories, and unmanaged CRL.

Zero-Discharge Technologies. EPA solicits information on: pilot study and bench test information (technological availability); cost projection information (economic achievability); newly installed systems (technological availability and economic achievability); and resource adequacy and reliability.

Cessation Subcategories. EPA solicits comment on repealing the 2028 and 2034 cessation subcategories.

Unmanaged CRL. EPA solicits comment on any pilot or full-scale treatment data for unmanaged CRL. EPA also solicits comment on any engineering cost estimates, bids, vendor quotes, or other cost information regarding treatment of unmanaged CRL.

[1] EPA’s proposed rule would clarify the must-run provision and associated reporting requirements in 40 C.F.R. § 423.18.

""This letter is responding to something even bigger than the Solar for All program,” Fletcher said.","Congressional Democrats are pressing the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to restore funding to a program expanding the deployment of solar energy for working families. The move follows Harris County's lawsuit against President Donald Trump’s administration to restore the program.

The EPA announced on Aug. 7 that it would terminate the Solar for All program and take back $7 billion in funds from grant recipients, saying the Trump administration's rescission package required it to do so. Houston Congresswoman Lizzie Fletcher played a key role in passing the program into law three years ago.

""This is a huge, important renewable energy program, and here in Texas, Harris County led a statewide coalition that won one of the five largest awards of any group in the country,"" Fletcher said. ""It got a $250 million grant to deliver solar and battery storage to nearly 30,000 households in Texas.""

Fletcher stressed that the program was designed to create thousands of well-paying jobs and to boost American manufacturing, in addition to making the electrical grid more reliable.

""All of that was happening here in Texas, in Houston, in Port Arthur, and in Waco,” she said. “Training programs were already underway to certify Texans in solar installation and energy efficiency. So, we’re talking about benefits for consumers, benefits for workers, and benefits for our environment and our economy.""

Fletcher co-led 100 House Democrats in sending a letter to EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin demanding he restore the program and reinstate the grant funding. Fletcher said Zeldin's office has yet to respond.

""This letter is responding to something even bigger than the Solar for All program,” Fletcher said. “It’s about responding to the Trump administration’s continued efforts to consolidate power and overrule the other branches of government, and that would be Congress and the courts. What we see here is yet another example of the administration ignoring or rejecting the law that Congress has passed and programs that Congress has put into place for no reason or for reasons that they just don't agree with it.”",https://cdn.houstonpublicmedia.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/11221318/DJI_0074-1-1067x800.jpg,N,,2025-10-24 18:19:25.779326

“I haven’t supported drilling in the eastern Gulf of America,” Sen. Rick Scott (R-Fla.) said Thursday, using Trump’s preferred name for the gulf.
“President Trump put protections in place to prevent offshore drilling off South Carolina’s coast, and those remain in effect through 2032,” said Mace spokesperson Sydney Long.
A Paris court is making the French oil major TotalEnergies pay for misleading consumers about its climate strategy.","Coastal lawmakers of both parties are starting to get wind of what President Donald Trump’s “drill, baby, drill” agenda means for energy production off their shores. And they aren’t pleased.

Areas off the southern coast of California, swaths of the Atlantic Coast and a part of the eastern Gulf of Mexico are potentially up for grabs in the Interior Department’s forthcoming five-year plan, Ben Lefebvre reported this week.

The plan is not as extensive as the one Trump floated in 2017 that alarmed politicians in Florida and was ultimately pulled back. But the proposal is nonetheless running into a bipartisan buzz saw on Capitol Hill, Garrett Downs reports, and potential encroachment on the Florida coastline is getting a reaction again.

A person familiar with the planning told Ben that “at least a small sliver” of area in the eastern Gulf of Mexico is expected to be opened for drilling.

“I haven’t supported drilling in the eastern Gulf of America,” Sen. Rick Scott (R-Fla.) said Thursday, using Trump’s preferred name for the gulf. “It’s important to Florida.”

Floridians of both parties have long opposed drilling off their shoreline, asking for a hard line to be drawn between the dominant offshore oil and gas drilling areas along the coasts of Louisiana and Texas and waters even remotely close to the Florida coast. Politicians and residents from the state fear that offshore rigs or an oil spill would devastate its tourism-dependent economy — and the 2010 Deepwater Horizon disaster, which tarred stretches of the Panhandle’s white-dune beaches, is still fresh in many people’s minds.

‘Poke of the day’

Along the Atlantic, Rep. Nancy Mace (R-S.C.) wants Trump to uphold his 2020 order that closed off South Carolina, Georgia and Florida’s Atlantic coast from drilling. Mace is running for governor.

“President Trump put protections in place to prevent offshore drilling off South Carolina’s coast, and those remain in effect through 2032,” said Mace spokesperson Sydney Long. “Congresswoman Mace continues to oppose offshore drilling in South Carolina to protect our coastline, economy, and way of life.”

Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) agreed, telling Josh Siegel he supports continuing the 2020 moratorium.

Coastal Democrats are unified in their opposition to drilling and predicted more Republicans would join them.

“It’s going to be unacceptable for not just Democratic-run states, but for everybody. We don’t need to be moving in that direction,” said Sen. Andy Kim (D-N.J.).

Sen. Alex Padilla (D-Calif.) speculated that floating the California proposal could be Trump’s way to antagonize Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom, a potential presidential candidate and outspoken Trump foe.

“That may be the poke of the day,” Padilla said.

But not all coastal lawmakers are opposed to drilling. Sen. Thom Tillis (R-N.C.), who previously opposed drilling off of his state’s coast, said he backs the idea, though he wants the state to get offshore wind, too. He said the equipment is so far from the shore that people cannot see it from land.

Green groups brace for impact from Trump

Environmental groups are taking precautions including hiring extra security and lawyers as they brace for scrutiny from the Trump administration, Scott Waldman writes.

The administration has been stepping up attacks on the president’s perceived enemies, as well as its targeting of antifascist or “Antifa” groups. Some conservative groups have claimed that climate activists are part of a wider Antifa network, and have asked the president to investigate.

“These misguided and dangerous attacks on our First Amendment rights will ultimately fail and backfire,” said Denae Ávila-Dickson, a spokesperson for the Sunrise Movement.

Changing of the guard at FERC — again

The White House on Thursday designated Laura Swett chair of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, marking the agency’s third leadership change in nine months, Francisco “A.J.” Camacho reports.

Swett — a Republican who previously served as an adviser and attorney at FERC and an energy litigator at the firm Vinson & Elkins — will replace Democrat David Rosner at the commission’s helm.

Energy Secretary Chris Wright last night announced he had called on FERC to propose new rules for speeding the interconnection of data centers and other large electricity consumers to regional power grids.

Israeli-U.S. startup Stardust Solutions announced the largest-ever fundraising round for any company that aims to cool the Earth by spraying particles into the atmosphere, Corbin Hiar and Karl Mathiesen report.

Its plan to limit the sun’s heat raised $60 million from a broad coalition of investors that included Silicon Valley luminaries and the Agnelli family, an Italian industrial dynasty.

Critics of the effort to engineer an atmospheric climate solution says it’s a largely untested, thinly researched and mostly unregulated technology that could disrupt weather patterns.

By Sarah Vogel, Senior Vice President, Healthy Communities, EDF, Dr. Arnab Ghosh, Assistant Professor of Medicine, Weill Cornell Medical College and Stefanie Le, Writer, Data Smart Cities

Extreme weather is no longer a distant threat—it’s here. NASA reports that in the past year alone, the U.S. saw twice as many extreme weather events as the 2003–2020 average. Storms are stronger, heat waves last longer and wildfires spread faster.

At New York Climate Week, leaders from cities, universities and health organizations gathered to ask a pressing question: how can data help communities protect themselves? The panel, hosted by Cornell Atkinson Center for Sustainability and Environmental Defense Fund with the Community Data Health Initiative, City of Detroit, NYC Department of Health, NYU’s City Health program and the African American Mayors Association, emphasized the role of data in shaping health-focused climate solutions.

Here are five takeaways:

1. Data is the backbone of climate and health solutions

Mount Vernon Mayor Shawyn Patterson-Howard described how data revealed a stark divide in her city: tree-lined streets in the north are up to 7 degrees cooler than the south side, where residents face higher asthma rates and utility bills.

“We don’t have the luxury of ignoring climate because we live at its intersection,” she said. “With a 5 to 7 degree difference in heat because urban heat islands on the south side, tree lined streets on the north side. And what does that cause? More asthma, more pulmonary issues and higher utility bills for the people that can afford them the least.”

2. Cities must adapt and mitigate—at the same time

Detroit is turning vacant land into opportunity. With more than 124,000 empty parcels, the city is converting lots into urban farms.

“It can’t be one or the other,” said Trisha Stein, Detroit’s Chief Strategy Officer. “We’re protecting the vulnerable, stabilizing neighborhoods, growing locally sourced food and generating $23 million in health benefits.”

3. Climate and health aren’t political—they’re personal

Savannah Mayor Van Johnson put it bluntly:

“Seventy percent of our most intense storms have occurred since 2015. If we’re ever hit by a Category 3 hurricane, three-quarters of Savannah would be underwater.”

4. Lived experience shapes the strongest policies

Margot Brown of EDF reminded the audience that climate change doesn’t create inequities—it deepens them.

“Climate change is what we call a threat multiplier. So it doesn’t just create new challenges, it worsens the ones that we already face, especially for the most vulnerable populations. People already facing poverty or racism are hit first and worst. That’s unfair—and avoidable.”

5. Leaders don’t choose their crises—climate chooses for them

Representative Maxine Dexter (OR-03) recalled Oregon’s devastating 2020 wildfires, which burned more than a million acres. The smoke spread far beyond the fire line, endangering firefighters and residents alike.

“We must act with urgency and care,” she said. “The smoke literally goes where the wind blows it. Wildland firefighters have been out there with bandanas over their faces, fighting for generations. You don’t see mainland firefighters doing that anymore and we need that for our wildland firefighters.”

In recent years, both utilities have faced repeated criticism for high energy prices and poor reliability, with the Citizens Utility Board, an energy utility watchdog, noting that the companies have “some of the highest outage durations among all investor-owned utilities in the nation.”

Ballot initiative seeks to ban political contributions from monopoly corporations, like utilities

While both companies have each pledged to improve their services, customers and advocacy groups have remained frustrated with the utilities’ near yearly requests to increase their rates, with DTE requesting a $574 million rate increase earlier this year, while Consumers Energy requested a $436 million increase for its electrical rates.

Dana St. Couer, a senior communication strategist for DTE said customers saw 70% improvement in time spent without power in 2024 due to $1.5 billion in investments in the electric grid last year coupled with less extreme weather.

In a statement on Jan. 14, Consumers Energy said the average customer spent 21 fewer minutes without power in 2024, with 93% of customers seeing their power restored within 24 hours.

Katie Carey, Consumers Energy’s director of media relations, emphasized in an email to the Michigan Advance that the company’s rate requests fund future investments.

“For example, clearing trees away from power lines is critical to our plan, addressing the #1 cause of outages. We are proposing a five-year timetable to clear all of our system’s low-voltage lines, which serve homes and businesses directly,” Carey said. “We had previously been working toward a seven-year effective cycle. We plan to clear 8,000 miles of high- and low-voltage power lines this year. We expect a 30% reduction in tree-related outage incidents by 2030.”

In the interim, lawmakers have offered their own solutions through legislation seeking greater accountability from energy providers, while providing customers additional protections.

The ratepayer bill of rights includes legislation sponsored by McKinney that would increase the outage credit customers receive on their bills to $5 an hour, gradually increasing to $15 an hour after 24 hours without service and $25 dollars per hour in interruptions longer than 72 hours.

The current credit offers customers $42 if their outages last 16 hours or longer under normal conditions, 48 hours if skies are gray and 96 hours under catastrophic weather conditions, with customers receiving an additional $42 for each day they are without power.

The package also includes Myers Phillips’ House Bill 5047, which would ensure winter shut off protections for households with seniors 65 and older, and children 16 and younger.

The ratepayers bill of rights also includes legislation to allow for the establishment of community solar energy programs, and to ban utility companies and businesses seeking government contracts from making political contributions.

Chang told the Michigan Advance on Thursday that the event is aimed at raising awareness and getting more community members engaged on issues of energy affordability and reliability, while providing those affected with concrete solutions they can take action on.

Oftentimes when there is a major storm, Chang said her office will hear from residents and see the resulting power outages firsthand. While the outage credit has increased in recent years, it does not match the impact felt by those facing the outage Chang said, pointing to individuals losing the food in their refrigerator as one example.

When looking at the ratepayer’s bill of rights as a package, Chang emphasized that these policies focus on what ratepayers need.

Even as interest picks up across North America in deploying traditional large light-water reactors, and as stock markets overheat with eye-popping valuations for advanced nuclear and SMR start-ups, enough utility-scale projects for both the BWRX-300 and the Xe-100 are getting concrete enough that serious fleets may be in sight for both GE Vernova-Hitachi and X-energy.

That real progress comes as the background noise only increases. Just this week, small modular reactor (SMR) developer start-up ""One Nuclear Energy"" went public via a Special Purpose Acquisition Co. that values the pre-revenue brand at $1 billion.

Compare that to the C$3 billion (US$2 billion) government investments announced this week at the first-of-a-kind (FOAK) BWRX-300 SMR project at Darlington, Ontario, which is ramping up to full construction and slated to become the first land-based commercial SMR project outside of China. Or to the expansion of the Xe-100 SMRs planned by Washington state's Energy Northwest — alongside Amazon — into a gigawatt-scale newbuild, something that was announced last week. These developments mark concrete progress on real projects further along than fevered equity investor nuclear plays.

BWRX-300 Fleet Takes Shape

""We're here to make a generational investment, an investment that will extend Canada's world leadership in clean energy,"" Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney said as he announced on Oct. 23 a C$2 billion investment from the Canada Growth Fund in the Darlington SMR project being built by province-owned Ontario Power Generation (OPG). A further C$1 billion of investment was announced by the province's Building Ontario Fund. Constructing the four BWRX-300s at Darlington ""will position Canada as the global leader in the deployment of small modular reactors, a leadership we can take to other markets,"" said Carney.

The first BWRX-300 at Darlington is arguably already under construction, after OPG stepped up work in May after Ontario took a positive final investment decision to proceed with the ambitious newbuild. The construction project — as with many SMR, microreactor and advanced reactor newbuilds — won't have the standard nuclear island basemat concrete pour that is the traditional metric of the commencement of nuclear construction. Instead, the BWRX-300 will be built on a base of construction ""bricks,"" or ""diaphragm plate steel composite (DPSC) modules"" that are fabricated offsite.

The first of these DPSCs will make up a basemat module, and once a reactor building shaft is excavated, ""a heavy crane will lift the Basemat and place it at the bottom of the shaft, 35 metres in the ground,"" OPG said in an Oct. 23 statement. An OPG spokesperson declined to give the date that this emplacement is targeted, claiming instead that the Darlington project is already fully under construction. The International Atomic Energy Agency's Power Reactor Information System (PRIS) database, the traditional arbiter of these metrics, has not yet listed the Darlington SMR as under construction but also has not yet finalized how it will measure novel reactor construction projects. Agency officials are planning to consider, in a March 2026 technical meeting, an expanded definition of a construction start to better reflect the characteristics of SMR and microreactor projects currently under development.

That decision ought to be able to capture the construction starts of the other BWRX-300 newbuild projects in the queue, although not by much. At the end of August, Polish oil and gas firm Orlen announced the selection of the Wloclawek site in central Poland for the inaugural two Polish BWRX-300s to be deployed by Orlen Synthos Green Power, the Orlen joint venture with Synthos, a Polish chemicals company.

The companies hope to build at least two BWRX-300s at Wloclawek by 2035 — three years after the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) hopes to complete an inaugural US BWRX-300 at its Clinch River site in the southeastern US state of Tennessee. TVA, which is controlled by the US government, has plans to build four BWRX-300s at Clinch River, comparable to the Darlington project, but has received inordinate pressure from the White House to speed up its nuclear deployments. The administration of US President Donald Trump has even stripped the TVA board of its required quorum — for five of its nine seats being filled — by firing multiple board members in an effort to jump-start new nuclear work.

This week, four nominees to join the TVA board testified before a Senate committee, and all four made clear they had heard the marching orders and that they were ready to press the accelerator. ""Our best hope is nuclear,"" nominee Jeff Hagood told the committee in an Oct. 22 testimony. Fellow nominee Arthur Graham added that ""we have the opportunity"" to make the Clinch River SMRs ""happen as quick as we can."" Added a third nominee, Randall Jones: ""We've got to have the sense of urgency to make this happen.""

Growing Xe-100 Orders

Last week's announcement that the X-energy-supplied new nuclear plant at Energy Northwest's at WNP-1 site on the government's Hanford nuclear reservation in eastern Washington state will be called the ""Cascade Advanced Energy Facility"" buried a major development: The scale of the project has ballooned from ""at least"" four Xe-100s to ""up to"" 12 Xe-100s in the year since Amazon partnered with Energy Northwest to help fund — and ultimately, purchase power offtake — from the utility's planned Xe-100 reactors.

""Key features of the future SMR facility include the modular nature of the plant with three 320 megawatt sections to make up the full 960 MW plant in just a few city blocks,"" Amazon said in an Oct. 16 update. The nearly 1 gigawatt that Amazon is supporting at the Cascade project is only a fraction of the 5 GW of capacity that Amazon and X-energy — in which Amazon led a $500 million financing round last year — hope to deploy by 2039 in the US and possibly beyond.

This summer, these two firms announced a partnership with South Korea's Doosan Energibility and Korea Hydro & Nuclear Power to ""accelerate the deployment of new Xe-100 advanced nuclear reactors in the United States to meet increasing power demands by data centers, advanced manufacturing, and electrification,"" X-energy said in an Aug. 25 statement. ""The parties aim to mobilize up to $50 billion in public and private investments for Xe-100 projects and the expansion of associated supply chain capacity to support the future of American energy dominance and artificial intelligence growth.""

It's not clear how much of that $50 billion Amazon itself intends to provide, but beyond its X-energy financing, notes from a June meeting of Energy Northwest's board reveal Amazon is funding $334 million for the Cascade project. Beyond that funding, which is likely all devoted to preconstruction project development, Amazon and Energy Northwest must conclude a power purchase agreement (PPA) for offtake from the Cascade plant. That PPA will, in turn, be used to provide ballast to Energy Northwest's loan application to the US Department of Energy's Loan Programs Office.

In late August, Energy Northwest submitted ""a preliminary working draft of the Part II loan application, marking a key milestone in securing federal support for the project,"" an Energy Northwest spokesperson told Energy Intelligence, and an Oct. 23 presentation to the board revealed the formal application is targeted for submittal by Nov. 30. ""This is a complex process, and we’ve collaborated with a broad group of industry partners to prepare the documentation. While this submission represents meaningful progress, substantial work remains ahead as we move toward a formal application later this year.""

Just this week, Energy Northwest selected an equal-share joint venture of Kiewit Nuclear Solutions, Black & Veatch and Aecon, creatively named ""Cascade Nuclear Partners,"" to ""collaboratively complete the planning, design, and construction of the first four of 12 Xe-100 SMRs under a progressive design-build (PDB) model,"" the utility announced Oct. 23. The PDB model is meant to facilitate cooperation between the project owner and the contractors during early stages of the project. Energy Northwest is targeting submitting its construction permit application to the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) in August next year, according to the Oct. 23 presentation.

Not yet clear is to what extent Amazon will be actively involved in project development, although its role will be much greater than that of a traditional offtaker: One Amazon executive visited Doosan's manufacturing plant in Changwon, South Korea, last month, where he saw prototypes of the Xe-100.

The Cascade project is in the comfortable position of being a second adopter of the Xe-100: It will follow chemical giant Dow, which plans to build a FOAK four-unit Xe-100 plant at its Seadrift complex, in what Dow is calling the ""Long Mott"" project. Both projects ""will share a common core design, but their configurations will differ based on intended use,"" noted the Energy Northwest spokesperson. ""Dow’s installation will be integrated with industrial operations to provide process heat and power, while Energy Northwest’s will focus on grid-scale electricity generation with potential for future expansion. Both sites will deploy four-reactor 'packs,' with supporting systems and operational goals tailored to their respective contexts.""

The NRC confirmed in June that it plans to issue a final safety evaluation on the construction permit application for Long Mott by November 2026, setting the stage for the inaugural Xe-100 newbuild to be under construction well before the end of the decade. Unlike Energy Northwest or UK utility Centrica, which last month signed a deal to build three Xe-100 four-packs at the Hartlepool brownfield nuclear site in North East England, Dow has no history in nuclear operations.",https://energyintel.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/c6836be/2147483647/strip/true/crop/906x476+0+0/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fenergy-intelligence-brightspot.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com%2F10%2F1b%2F9e9991b04eb089a2502e88e4df00%2Fshutterstock-2161610045.jpg,N,,2025-10-24 18:19:38.306414

These actions are diminishing scientific capacity and deconstructing the infrastructure created after World War II and during the Cold War. During that time, we got serious about water and air pollution and formed the Environmental Protection Agency during the Nixon Administration.

Since early 2025, scientists, professors, research labs, and universities have been cast by the administration as an enemy, and what we are experiencing now is the government’s attempt to disarm and disperse that enemy. To diminish their agency and power.

My analyses have focused on fundamental motivations and consequences, and I have tried to encourage thinking about next steps. However, the federal layoffs, the withholding and elimination of research funding, the closing of institutions, the evictions of organizations, and the decisions of political appointees are so far outside the norm that it’s difficult to know what to do.

Lessons learned

In this column, I am going to reflect on my experiences leading and managing scientific organizations.

Though the government’s current efforts are extraordinary in terms of intent and effectiveness, we need to remember that science has been through tough times in the past. The science “recession” of the late 1960s, early 1970s, and the 2016 Trump administration are key examples.

My personal experience, however, dates to the 1990s when the Mission to Planet Earth, a centerpiece of NASA’s research, was reduced from a $30-billion program to a $7-billion program.

This descoping of NASA Earth Science was accompanied by congressional attacks on climate and environmental science. Even so, effective science advocates still existed in the U.S. Congress of the 1990s. Those advocates assured that scientists had a voice. There were people in power who listened to and trusted scientists.

What can we control?

When faced with difficult situations, one of the first things to do is identify what you can and cannot control. For example, you may be fearful and outraged by certain events, but you have still control over how you respond.

In managing people through crisis or complexity, I knew some people in my organization would respond with anxiety, others with sarcasm, and still others with indifference.

Some were immediately ready to solve the problem. They might have thought, “This is bad. This is challenging. But we need to figure out how to go on.” We ask: What does our experience tell us about what we should do? If we don’t have that experience, where can we find those who do?

I used to advise people in my organization to limit their exposure to their anxious and sarcastic colleagues, whose response did not reflect a useful reality. I would tell them to be careful about what they said and did; that there is no requirement to state every thought in your head. Such discretion limits self-inflected anxiety that can make the situation worse.

I’d remind them it’s important to evaluate a situation from different perspectives: How do I manage this crisis as an individual and as an organization or institution?

As efforts persisted to discredit both individuals and institutions, I would counsel people not to interpret every decision as a personal attack, to put some distance between events and oneself.

These questions of reflection and efforts at self-control are characteristics of leadership.

Active and passive resistance to management is normal in any organization. Anxiety and fear were always present in mine, but I could manage my staff up and down the hallway.

Now that hallway includes social media, and it is daunting to manage the impact of online discourse.

If all one can do is react and proclaim, there is little foundation for a productive path forward.

Presence

Once you can manage the reactive state, it becomes possible to strategize, prepare, and achieve longer-term outcomes. You can adapt and adjust by asking: What are the potential resources? How do I collect things together? Who are my allies? What power do my allies and I have? Before long, you are building a foundation to respond to the crises.

To build a foundation for response, you need to be present in the public and political process.

You may dislike what is happening, but it’s crucial to present the alternative you prefer.

If we only say that we want what we no longer have, we remain trapped in the reactive state, limited to expressions of outrage.

You must be able to articulate specific, achievable goals. Presence without goals has limited potential.

Exercise Due Process

Due process at times seems futile, but it is a mistake to give up and walk away.

A first line of action is adjudication and litigation: appeals to ethics, norms, and reason. In many cases, you will lose, but presence, persistence, and continuity are essential.

If you walk away from due process, you walk away from rules and law and the checks and balances that are integral to the American system. If you walk away, you are saying that laws are not worth preserving.

Due process includes writing to your elected officials, saying what you want, and reminding them that you vote.

Support an independent, objective press

The free press has been a pillar of American democracy from its inception. A strong, independent press fosters accountability. It is essential to being present and bearing witness.

The press is a source of influence and power.

Large news organizations are increasingly owned by a handful of individuals and corporations that align with political agendas or social goals. An emphasis on profits and ratings distorts priorities and erodes journalistic integrity.

As the mainstream press has consolidated under fewer owners and smaller newsrooms, journalists have organized at local, state, and national levels. Many are focused on integrity in journalism and objective news. But funding is perilous.

Such self-organizing leaves us with a fragmented landscape, with news outlets finding hundreds or thousands of customers, not millions.

And with the rise of social media, many would-be citizen journalists identify as independent alternatives to legacy media. Though “free,” they often eschew the ethical and professional protocols that define a fair press. Influencers and supposed experts abound, and many are sympathetic to political goals. But these are advocates, not journalists. Many are wildly popular and quite effective with their messaging.

A crisis of truth

Misinformation, disinformation, and propaganda have always been part of the political process. They are methods people use to steer resources toward personal and collective goals.

Social media platforms are open to all points of view. Unfortunately it is easier to gain a following by poking at human foibles and the uncertainties of knowledge than it is to methodically present a legitimate, evidence-based point of view.

When the Department of Energy published A Critical Review of Impacts of Greenhouse Gas Emissions on the U.S., it presented a platter of propaganda.

Misinformation, manipulative media – even pranks – stand next to established knowledge, actual events, proven facts, and science-based knowledge as legitimate points worthy of discussion. Opposing points of view regarding the same sets of knowledge, events, and facts are distorted into tribal truths and lies. One’s self-identified truth becomes a set of beliefs, independent of evidence, facts, or reality.

We erroneously maintain that fairness requires equal representation of the correct and the incorrect.

Speaking lies is equated with freedom of speech.

We are faced with George Orwell’s chilling proclamation: “Whatever the Party holds to be the truth, is truth.”

Where we are now

With the deconstruction of institutions in today’s political environment, an individual’s response tends to focus on their own well-being. And that’s a rational response.

But we are at a moment in history that requires us to envision how the overall scientific enterprise will look in four, eight, 12 years. We must think of something new.

This requires organization on a large scale.

Decisions by government leaders are eliminating or corrupting the resources that support research to discover, advance, and innovate. To cure, help, and solve.

The dispersal and defunding of this skill base will, at least in the short term, diminish rather than enhance our nation’s presence and competitiveness.

Voices in science need to be heard. We need to be present and to speak.

It is important to support organizations that present science to our elected representatives and that represent the case for science in the courts.

People have the power

We need to vote.

We need to build and support credible and legitimate journalism.

We need to press our institutional allies to support organization, nurture leadership skills, and develop the next generation of leaders.

As we organize, act, and build new capacity, we must consider the long term. How do we support data gathering, analysis, and interpretation? How do we organize and provide knowledge in ways that are trusted and durable?

In our federal laboratories these past six months, we have seen the deterioration of what many consider the most secure scientific capacity in the world. How do we insure the preservation and growth of future knowledge? What is government’s role?

As a start, we must get past reaction and dismay. We need to rise above the emotional convulsions that take us from one outrage to the next. We need to understand, and put into practice, the elements of leadership that lift us above the chaos. We must find our power.",https://michigantoday.umich.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/89/mc-image-cache/2025/10/Climate-Biue-Abandoned-Laboratory.jpg,N,,2025-10-24 18:04:49.320836

As chief of staff for the Office of Domestic Climate Policy in the Biden Administration and special assistant to the president for climate, Maggie Thomas ’15 MEM was charged with overseeing the enactment of federal policy aimed at decarbonizing the U.S. economy. Her purview included the $550 billion Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act and the Inflation Reduction Act, which as the largest climate investment in U.S. history, provided more than $370 billion to address climate change and advance the clean energy transition.

There were immense challenges in enacting this legislation. Thomas said some people told her that it simply could not be done, but she worked to meet each challenge and get it to the finish line. As the federal landscape on environmental policy changes, Thomas said she is taking the lessons she learned at the White House on overcoming barriers with her in her new endeavors as a consultant on environmental issues.

“Many people did not believe that the federal government could take the action that we took as quickly as we took it. Knowing that we were able to have an impact in a short period of time gives me hope and belief that we will be able to do it again,” she said.

Thomas became interested in government and politics at early age, accompanying her parents as they canvassed door-to-do in their neighborhood in Sacramento, California, during election season. Her childhood dream was to become a marine biologist, but after earning a bachelor’s degree in environmental science from Trinity College in Hartford, she took a job with NextGen America. That job profoundly altered her career path. Founded by Tom Steyer in 2013, NextGen works to turn out millions of young people to vote on issues that matter to them. As senior advocacy manager and Pennsylvania state director at NextGen, Thomas realized she could combine her interest in political action and the environment.

“We worked to motivate young people to vote and help them understand the consequences of the election, particularly as it related to climate,” she said. “I became focused on how to create conditions so that voters will feel compelled to want to take action on environmental issues.”

After leaving NextGen America, Thomas went on to advise several presidential candidates on climate policy, including former Washington Governor Jay Inslee, whose campaign focused almost exclusively on environmental and climate issues, and Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass.

In 2021, she was hired to build President Biden’s newly created Office of Domestic Climate Policy where she implemented the IRA and infrastructure act that created more than 300,000 clean energy jobs.

One of the accomplishments she is most proud of was launching the American Climate Corps, which was established to employ young Americans in clean energy, conservation, and climate resilience jobs. The funding for the Corps was removed in the final IRA legislation but Thomas built the program without any new money from Congress. By 2024, the corps had put 20,000 young people to work in the field.

While her positions focused on policy, Thomas said she learned that there are many paths to decarbonizing the economy.

“One of the big things I learned being in the White House is that there are a lot of different ways to wield power. It’s not just about Congress,” she said. “The climate is built on fluid systems, and we shouldn’t just take the same approaches as in the past.”

Thomas gave birth to a son on Christmas Day in 2024, and she said the desire to build a cleaner, greener world for him has given her renewed energy to tackle climate issues in her work now and in the future..

“In my positions, I wrote talking points about the work we have to do for future generations and that work hits home a little differently now — it’s about the world my son is going to grow up in,” Thomas said.

Since his birth, Thomas has been consulting for clean energy industry and climate-related philanthropy, and she remains optimistic, despite tough obstacles.

“We have more barriers than we did last year, but I do believe we are going to turn a corner. My work is helping to make that pivot and think about where the opportunities are now,” she said. “We’re already seeing cities, states, tribes, and the private sector coming together. We need to be as creative as possible. We need to constantly be thinking outside the box.”",https://environment.yale.edu/sites/default/files/styles/metatag_1200x630/public/2025-10/M-Thomas_2025_16x9.jpg?h=d1cb525d&itok=Em1919Z9,N,,2025-10-24 18:04:53.211958

It would create jobs, accelerate infrastructure developments, lower energy costs and make our grid more dependable.","Every day, as I listen to business owners across the Central Valley, I hear the same refrain: they want to grow, hire, and invest in our communities, but red tape too often stands in their way.

In the energy sector especially, entrepreneurs eager to expand local operations face mounting costs, delayed permits and aging infrastructure. These barriers don’t just stall innovation — they hold California back. Federal permitting reform would unleash private investment, accelerate critical projects across all energy sources and deliver broad community and economic benefits. It’s time for Congress to act.

California is facing a harsh reality: energy prices have surged in recent years and may continue climbing. Over the last decade, electricity costs have nearly doubled, soaring 96 percent. In fact, Californians now face the second most expensive energy prices in the entire nation. These increases are simply not something our residents can manage as they already face some of the highest cost of living averages in the country.

These price hikes are happening simultaneously with energy demands that are rising to record highs driven by the rise of AI and advanced manufacturing. These industries promise enormous economic opportunity, but they’re also straining electric grids already pushed to their limits. Yet, as our need for reliable energy grows, permitting uncertainty and delays nationwide continue to halt investment.

The path to solving these issues is clear: empower innovative companies to unleash American energy production and capacity in every corner of the country. Unfortunately, our current system — slow, outdated, and mired in red tape — makes that almost impossible. Bipartisan, common-sense reforms are already on the table in Congress. Enacting them would be a major step toward meeting our energy needs, strengthening grid reliability, and lowering costs for consumers.

Chief among these reforms is an update to the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) — a law passed decades ago that has yet to be meaningfully modernized. While its original intent was noble, NEPA’s vague and outdated provisions have turned it into the most litigated environmental law in the country. Too often, projects that could deliver more reliable energy are tied up in lawsuits that last years. Congress has the power to restore NEPA’s original purpose by focusing reviews on real environmental impacts, establishing proportional timelines, and curbing endless litigation.

Another major challenge lies in the misuse of the Clean Water Act (CWA). While the CWA plays a vital role in safeguarding our nation’s water resources, it has increasingly been used to delay or block critical development projects not over genuine environmental concerns, but to advance unrelated ideological agendas. Protecting our natural resources is no place for partisan politics. Congress must act to curb these abuses by clarifying the scope of the CWA and establishing clear project timelines that give both developers and regulators the certainty they need.

Faster, smarter permitting isn’t just good policy — it’s good for California workers, consumers, and families. It would create jobs, accelerate infrastructure developments, lower energy costs and make our grid more dependable. It would also strengthen America’s energy security at a time when global competitors like China are racing ahead.

Our congressional delegation has the power to advocate for real, long overdue change. Californians are desperate for reliable and affordable energy, and they are counting on their representatives in Congress to push for durable reforms. By cutting red tape and modernizing outdated laws, Congress can help unlock California’s full potential while preserving the environmental safeguards we all value. It’s time to act so that innovation, investment, and opportunity can flourish here in the Golden State.",https://thebusinessjournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Olivier-Clint-Headshot-.jpg,N,,2025-10-24 18:05:18.814326

The Broadwing Energy facility, located in Decatur, Illinois, is set to have more than 400 megawatts of generating capacity and will be able to capture approximately 90% of its carbon dioxide emissions for permanent underground storage.

The project is also Google's first collaboration with Low Carbon Infra, a portfolio company of infrastructure investor I Squared Capital, to develop CCS facilities across the US.

""Today, Google is taking a major leap forward to unlock the next generation of advanced clean energy technology, through a new agreement to support a first-of-its-kind gas power plant with carbon capture and storage,"" says Kate Brandt, Google's Chief Sustainability Officer.

Industrial site uses existing infrastructure

The power plant will be constructed at an industrial facility operated by Archer Daniels Midland, which has nearly a decade of experience storing CO₂ from ethanol production.

The carbon dioxide that is captured at the site will then be permanently stored in ADM's adjacent EPA-approved Class VI sequestration facilities, more than a mile underground.

Google has committed to purchasing the lion’s share of the electricity generated by the plant, where commercial operation is slated to begin in early 2030.

The project is expected to create around 750 full-time jobs over the next four years and will support dozens of permanent positions once operational.

The growing prominence of carbon capture and storage

CCS is a sophisticated form of technology that is able to capture CO₂ from power plants or industrial facilities and store it permanently underground.

Both the IEA and the IPCC have identified CCS as a valuable tool for reducing emissions from power generation and carbon-intensive industries, like steel manufacturing and cement production.

“Through this partnership, Low Carbon Infra and Google are joining forces on Broadwing Energy in Decatur, Illinois, our first in a series of carbon capture and storage projects,” says Jonathan Wiens, CEO of Low Carbon Infrastructure.

“The project marks a major step forward in demonstrating how industrial and power sector decarbonisation can work together to meet growing energy needs sustainably,” he adds.

Transparency measures and performance standards

The Broadwing project is set to incorporate a newly released standard for CCS-specific Energy Attribute Certificates, developed by industry experts to ensure that the quantification of emissions is as accurate as possible.

Google and Low Carbon Infra intend to use their collaboration to advance technical and operational improvements, including raising CO₂ capture rates and improving system performance and economics.

""It was a privilege to lead this deal and collaborate with an extraordinary internal team and forward-thinking partners,"" explains Donna Calderon, Senior Lead for Energy Strategy at Google.

The company has emphasised that transparency will be critical to ensure the environmental integrity of its CCS projects.

Growing energy demands and AI development

The announcement comes at a time when technology companies need more energy than ever, with the rise of AI and the expansion of data centres dependent on huge levels of electricity.

In 2024, Google revealed that five of its AI-powered products helped users collectively reduce an estimated 26 million metric tonnes of CO₂, which is roughly equivalent to emissions from the annual energy use of over 3.5 million US homes.

The company views this CCS investment as part of a broader strategy to harness AI's potential while also managing the associated energy demands through diverse clean energy technologies.

If the governor does declare an energy emergency, it would allow immediate state intervention and expand the city's available resources, McNally said.
The primary goals of state intervention would be to stabilize SOBE's system and ensure reliable heat for the community.
McNally also regarded the current ""replacement boiler"" as ""wholly inadequate"" in her letter to the governor.
Youngstown city officials are also asking the state for emergency funding for the SOBE plant.","State Representative Lauren McNally (D-Youngstown) and Youngstown Mayor Tito Brown penned letters to Ohio Governor Mike DeWine Thursday, seeking help with what Representative McNally called an ""ongoing crisis with SOBE Thermal LLC financial and service issues.""

McNally says she is asking the governor to use his power to declare an energy emergency in Youngstown.

If the governor does declare an energy emergency, it would allow immediate state intervention and expand the city's available resources, McNally said. The primary goals of state intervention would be to stabilize SOBE's system and ensure reliable heat for the community. McNally added that a long-term plan is also necessary for further oversight and accountability.

“My city has fought too hard to rebuild its downtown only to be left freezing in the dark — again. This is not just a utility issue; this is about public safety, economic stability, and basic human dignity,"" McNally said.

In his letter, Mayor Brown says that approximately 90 residents and 27 commercial businesses rely on the steam heat provided by the plant, and that the ""inadequacy and failure"" of SOBE's services ""continues to wreck untold injury and economic harm upon SOBE's customers and, indeed, upon the infrastructure of the City of Youngstown itself.""

In her letter to Governor DeWine, McNally included a timeline dating back to January of 2021 when a petition for purchase was filed, resulting in the acquisition of one boiler rather than two. The timeline concludes with a September 18, 2025 entry which stated the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio (PUCO)'s ""Finding and Order"" acknowledged multiple violations of statutory requirements to provide reliable thermal services.

McNally also regarded the current ""replacement boiler"" as ""wholly inadequate"" in her letter to the governor. She says reports from tenants confirm that replacement boiler is providing little to no heat.

""We are on the doorstep of winter. If this continues, pipes will freeze, businesses will close, and people will face unsafe living conditions. Youngstown cannot afford another drawn-out receivership or bureaucratic delay,"" McNally wrote.

Additionally, Mayor Brown says in his letter to state officials, although the circumstances the city is now facing were not thought of when discussing public utility laws, the time to address them is now.

""The notion that the sole means of production of a public utility may be rendered inoperable due to mechanical failure or to inadequacy of service remains preposterous. Such circumstances seemingly existed beyond the contemplation of lawmakers and officials when drafting Ohio's public utilities laws. But they exist here and now and must be addressed.""

McNally's full letter to Governor DeWine is attached below.

Youngstown city officials are also asking the state for emergency funding for the SOBE plant.

In a letter to state officials, the city is asking for emergency relief funds, if SOBE would once again experience issues with its boiler, or any other problems that would hinder them from providing services.

""It is a rather urgent matter, winter's upon us, temperatures are dropping and we need this to happen quickly,"" Senior Assistant Law Director Jason Small told 21 News.

The city says when it comes to other sources of funding, it's the state's responsibility to provide them with alternatives.

The rule, announced Thursday night by Energy Secretary Chris Wright, asserts the federal government’s authority over matters now controlled by states and utilities.
Faster deployment of data centers is almost certainly bad for the climate.
It focuses on so-called hybrid projects, which are large power users built alongside power plants.

The rule, announced Thursday night by Energy Secretary Chris Wright, asserts the federal government’s authority over matters now controlled by states and utilities. In doing so, utilities would lose some of their ability to manage the pace of development and profit from that development.

“To usher in a new era of American prosperity, we must ensure all Americans and domestic industries have access to affordable, reliable, and secure electricity,” Wright said in a letter announcing the proposal. “To do this, large loads, including AI data centers, served by public utilities must be able to connect to the transmission system in a timely, orderly, and non-discriminatory manner.”

Wright is directing the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to initiate a rulemaking process and finalize the rule by April 30.

Faster deployment of data centers is almost certainly bad for the climate. The growth of these massive computing facilities is driving a rapid increase in electricity demand, which, when combined with the Trump administration’s promotion of fossil fuels, casts doubt on the prospects of reducing greenhouse gas emissions from the power sector.

But there is also broad acknowledgement that the current system for connecting new projects to the grid has deep flaws, with long delays and economic harm.

From a business perspective, utility companies would be the big losers.

“The rule would deny utilities billions in easy money,” said Ari Peskoe, director of the Electricity Law Initiative at the Harvard Law School Environmental and Energy Law Program, in an email. “Data centers are a generational opportunity for utilities, in part because new data centers require transmission upgrades.”

The rule would undermine this by allowing developers to finance their own upgrades, reducing utilities’ ability to pursue projects that would boost their profits, he said.

It would not be surprising if utilities fight the rule at FERC and then in the courts. But the Edison Electric Institute, a trade group for utilities, is revealing little about its plan for dealing with the proposed rule.

“We share the administration’s commitment to American energy dominance and appreciate their leadership to accelerate energy to win the AI race and fuel our economy,” said Drew Maloney, the institute’s president and CEO, in a statement. “We look forward to working with FERC to strengthen the grid, drive down costs for customers, and improve reliability across our country.”

Wright’s letter argues that the rule is a narrow expansion of federal authority. He then lists 14 principles that describe how this authority would work.

The rule would apply to projects with electricity demand of at least 20 megawatts, which is roughly equivalent to the demand of a town of 10,000 to 20,000 people. It focuses on so-called hybrid projects, which are large power users built alongside power plants. The letter doesn’t specify whether certain power plant technologies would receive favorable treatment.

The proposal aims to streamline the planning process for large power users to gain approval for grid connections. Instead of potentially lengthy waits, which could last a year or more, Wright is asking FERC to consider a shortened 60-day timeline. But he specifies that this accelerated timetable would apply only to projects that are “curtailable,” which means they are capable of adjusting their power demand as needed.

As energy policy experts review the rule, a recurring theme is that it could mark a major shift in the federal government’s approach to managing the grid, but the full implications are not yet clear.

The rule “inserts FERC in a pretty central way into an issue that the regions are really struggling with,” said Jeff Dennis, executive director of the Electricity Customer Alliance, a coalition that includes data center developers and other large businesses on issues related to the grid and electricity prices. “I think it’s a big deal because it’s federal leadership to try to set some rules of the road here that we haven’t had in a focused way to date.”

Dennis worked at the Department of Energy during the Biden administration and at FERC during the George W. Bush and Obama administrations.

He said it would be premature to predict how this rule would affect carbon emissions. In some ways, it could help slow the growth of emissions, he said, because it gives large power users greater ability to build their own power plants, and many of the companies building data centers have commitments to use zero-emission energy sources. But his larger point is that the rule’s direct impact on U.S. climate policy is limited.

Mike Haugh, a policy director at Advanced Energy United, a trade group for clean energy companies, said he sees potential for this rule to help expedite grid connections for renewable energy and energy conservation systems.

“Realistically, they aren’t asking for anything all that crazy,” he said.

Others are more pessimistic about the implications.

“Pushing FERC to rubber-stamp connections in just 60 days while the government’s shut down and Trump builds a $300 million White House ballroom shows how out of touch his administration is from everyday Americans,” said Camden Weber, climate and energy policy specialist at the Center for Biological Diversity, in a statement. “As families struggle with skyrocketing utility bills and exorbitant grocery costs, Trump wants to serve Big Tech a feast and expects the rest of us to eat AI slop.”",https://insideclimatenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/GettyImages-2226519690-1024x682.jpg,N,,2025-10-24 17:19:33.911932

Lower Valley Energy’s about 8% average price increase comes alongside the onset of winter, the highest energy use season of the year.

“The impact might even seem greater than the average 7.9% because it’s so cold here for so long,” said Brian Tanabe with the cooperative. “We have the cheapest product in the country, but we use a lot of it.”

LVE is the county’s sole energy provider and Tanabe said their rates are still likely among the nation’s lowest, even with the increase.

Wyomingites pay about 14 cents per kilowatt hour (kWh) for residential electricity, according to 2025 data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration. The cheapest power was in Nevada and Nebraska, paying less than 13 cents per kWh and the most expensive was in Hawaii, nearing 40 cents per kWh. He’s personally paying about $10 more this October than last for his home’s energy.

“I don’t want to downplay 7.9%. That is an increase that will be noticed for sure,” he said.

The member-owned co-op’s August decision came after the recommendations of a third-party cost analysis that found they’re paying more to buy and transmit power as prices surge across the country. Part of that increase needed to be passed along to the consumer, he said.

“We were experiencing a lot of pressure just procuring the power for our Lower Valley Energy membership,” Tanabe said.

Bonneville Power Administration provides the majority of LVE’s energy and recently raised its transmission and wholesale rates by about 14%.

The Oregon-based federal agency is legally required to cover its cost through its rates, which reflect many factors like inflation and operations.

Several states, such as California, already have some form of mandatory GHG reporting in place. Others are introducing similar programs to take effect over the next several years.

In particular, New York is expected to finalize a rule establishing a Mandatory Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program. The state announced its proposal in spring 2025 and public comments closed on July 1. New York’s program appears to be similar to both the federal GHGRP (which EPA will likely roll back) and California’s Mandatory Reporting Regulation (“MRR”) and applies to companies with significant direct emissions from facilities located in New York state and fuels and electricity consumed within the state. This blog post provides an overview of New York’s proposed program and compares it with California’s MRR.

While the specific thresholds and verification requirements vary between California’s MRR and New York’s proposed program, the two programs are similar in scope. Whether an entity is subject to the requirements depends on the type of entity and the amount of GHG the entity emits. Further, each of these programs is distinct from California’s climate disclosure laws, SB 253 and SB 261, which apply broadly to companies that do business in California and exceed certain annual revenue thresholds. (See our most recent blog post on the climate disclosure laws here.)

New York’s Proposed GHG Reporting Program: Overview and Comparison with California’s Longstanding MRR

New York’s proposed regulation would require entities responsible for emissions in New York to monitor their annual GHG emissions and report those emissions to the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation (“NYSDEC”). If the regulation is finalized as expected, the first reports will be due June 1, 2027 for emissions data collected in 2026. The proposed program is for data collection only; it does not impose any requirements to reduce GHG emissions or obtain emissions allowances. However, according to an FAQ document issued by NYSDEC, the reporting regulation is part of a broader plan to implement a cap-and-invest program, which the state plans to develop in the future.

New York’s program is very similar to California’s MRR. Created in 2007, the MRR also requires facilities located in California, as well as suppliers of transportation fuels and electricity consumed within California, to monitor and report their annual GHG emissions. California adopted the MRR prior to establishing its Cap-and-Trade Program, and the data from the MRR is used to implement the Cap-and-Trade Program.

Covered Entities

While the California MRR and New York’s program are similar in scope, there are some slight differences in the specific criteria for who must report. In general, both programs require some entities to report regardless of their emissions levels and require other entities to report if they emit 10,000 metric tons or more of CO2e per year. Below is a table summarizing the requirements for certain types of entities.

Verification Requirements

In general, both California’s MRR and New York’s program require verification of data only for entities that emit 25,000 MT CO2e or more per year.

California allows certain entities to submit an abbreviated report if they emit less than 25,000 MT CO2e per year, do not have a compliance obligation under the Cap-and-Trade Program, and are not subject to the federal GHGRP requirements for certain sectors. See Cal. Code Pub. Health § 95103(a).

Under New York’s proposed regulation, entities must verify their emissions data if they qualify as a “large emissions source.” This generally includes facilities with emissions located in New York that emit 25,000 MT or more of CO2e per year. The proposed regulation specifies that the following also qualify as a large emissions source and are subject to the verification requirement:

Suppliers of natural gas, liquefied natural gas, and compressed natural gas that supply more than 15 million cubic feet per year;

Liquid fuel and petroleum product suppliers that supply more than 100,000 gallons of affected liquid fuels per year;

Coal suppliers that supply more than 500 U.S. tons of coal per year;

Waste haulers and transporters that emit more than 25,000 MT CO2e per year, including the sum of emissions reported for out-of-state landfill facilities and out-of-state combustion facilities for all waste exported out of New York State.

Contrasting New York’s Proposed Program with California’s Climate Disclosure Laws

The scope and coverage of both California’s MRR and New York’s proposed program are distinct from California’s climate disclosure laws, SB 253 and SB 261, which passed in 2023 and have reporting requirements set to begin in 2026. Those laws require many corporate entities, regardless of the sector in which they operate and the location in which their emissions occur, to disclose their GHG emissions and climate-related financial risk. SB 253 applies to U.S.-based entities doing business in California with more than $1 billion in annual revenue and requires those companies to report Scope 1 and 2 emissions in 2026 and Scope 3 emissions in 2027. SB 261 applies to U.S.-based entities doing business in California with more than $500 million in annual revenue and requires those companies to report their climate-related financial risks, with the first reports due on January 1, 2026. For more details about implementation of the laws, please read our previous post covering key takeaways from California Air Resources Board’s public workshop on implementation. We also published posts spotlighting SB 253 and SB 261 when the California legislature originally passed them, as well as an alert detailing the 2024 amendments to the laws.

Similar bills have been introduced in Colorado, Illinois, New Jersey, New York, and Washington state; thus far, none have passed.

Conclusion

While New York’s proposed Mandatory Reporting Program mirrors California’s longstanding MRR, there are some differences in the two programs’ requirements. And because the proposed program uses a reporting threshold framework that is distinct from climate disclosure laws like California’s SB 253 and SB 261, companies will need to carefully assess its applicability and requirements, as well as its potential interaction with other laws.

In that period, the parties will jointly select a project manager and evaluate construction providers that would be used in resuming construction of the two nuclear units.
“Brookfield came to Santee Cooper with a proposal that set out the path to turn our prior nuclear investment into lasting value for our customers and all South Carolinians,” said Santee Cooper Board Chairman Peter McCoy.

The letter of intent establishes a six-week initial project feasibility period. In that period, the parties will jointly select a project manager and evaluate construction providers that would be used in resuming construction of the two nuclear units.

The six weeks also would allow for advanced discussions with entities interested in buying nuclear power generated by the units and facilitate additional due diligence, leading to execution of a Memorandum of Understanding.

“Brookfield came to Santee Cooper with a proposal that set out the path to turn our prior nuclear investment into lasting value for our customers and all South Carolinians,” said Santee Cooper Board Chairman Peter McCoy. “Our goals include completing these reactors with private money and no ratepayer or taxpayer expense, delivering financial relief to our customers and gaining significant additional power capacity for South Carolina. Brookfield’s proposal would do just that, and the company has the financial capability to stand behind its proposal.”

“We thank Governor Henry McMaster and the South Carolina General Assembly members who were instrumental in encouraging Santee Cooper to conduct this bidding process,” said Santee Cooper President and CEO Jimmy Staton. “As we move closer to a final deal, our goal remains the same: to enable completion of these two units and thus provide 2,200 MW of carbon-free, reliable nuclear power that delivers energy security for South Carolina and specific benefits to Santee Cooper customers who are paying our initial investment.”

Staton noted that Santee Cooper’s strategic decision to maintain the equipment over the past eight years positions the Fairfield units for a quicker and less costly path to completion. “The state of the units, and the fact that they use the same Westinghouse AP1000 technology that is now operating in Georgia and overseas, make these assets very attractive to the nuclear power industry.”

One key element of resuming construction is the continued involvement of Westinghouse Electric Co., which designed and owns the AP 1000 technology. “Brookfield is a majority owner of Westinghouse, which added to their proposal,” Staton said.

With surging residential and industrial customer demand, and with the support of state leaders, last year Santee Cooper recognized a potential opportunity to sell the assets to a third party who would complete the unfinished nuclear units, it noted.

The utility launched a competitive bidding process in January 2025, receiving initial expressions of interest from over 70 potential bidders and 15 formal proposals.

Working with industry experts, Santee Cooper developed key financial, risk mitigation and execution criteria by which the final proposals were measured.

Santee Cooper said completion of the two units could:

• Generate thousands of temporary construction jobs.

• Strengthen and diversify South Carolina’s energy portfolio.

SWEPCO submitted a request with the Arkansas Public Service Commission in March to raise residential rates by 27.3%.
Under state law, utilities may increase rates by 4% annually without filing a formal rate case, according to Arkansas Public Service Commission filings.
For example, Fayetteville's municipal cost would likely see about a $190,000 a year impact with the proposed rate increase, Nierengarten said.
COMMUNICATION URGED Speakers on Thursday's panel encouraged residents to leave a public comment about the SWEPCO rate case.","FAYETTEVILLE -- If a requested rate increase by Southwestern Electric Power Co. is implemented, Fayetteville alone would see a $15 million per year impact across all businesses and residents, members of the public were told during a panel discussion Thursday.

Fayetteville Environmental Director Peter Nierengarten made the claim during the nonprofit, nonpartisan Citizens Climate Lobby panel discussion at the Fayetteville Public Library. The event was focused on rising utility rates.

Other speakers on the panel included Riley Gambill, a volunteer for the Citizen Climate Lobby; David Stitt, the president and chief executive for Stitt Energy Systems; Virginia Paschal, senior associate of regulatory affairs at Cordelio Power; and Fort Smith Mayor George McGill.

The ongoing Southwestern Electric Power Co. rate case was the primary discussion topic used an example of rising utility rates affecting Northwest Arkansas residents.

Southwestern Electric Power, or SWEPCO, is owned by Columbus, Ohio-based American Electric Power. SWEPCO has about 126,000 customers in far west and Northwest Arkansas and serves a total of 547,800 customers across its entire service area, which includes parts of Arkansas, Louisiana and Texas.

SWEPCO submitted a request with the Arkansas Public Service Commission in March to raise residential rates by 27.3%. This would be about a $30.46 increase to residential electric bills each month, according to SWEPCO's commission filings.

Commercial and municipal rates would see about a 20%-40% increase, according to Nierengarten.

Under state law, utilities may increase rates by 4% annually without filing a formal rate case, according to Arkansas Public Service Commission filings.

The rate increases would provide about a $136 million retail revenue increase, according to the filings.

The increases would fund various projects including a new wind project, grid resilience, converting a coal plant in Texas to natural gas and improvements for the Flint Creek Coal Plant in Benton County, according to Nierengarten.

Walmart, the University of Arkansas' Board of Trustees, the city of Fayetteville, the National Audubon Society and the Sierra Club have all intervened in the docket before the Public Service Commission.

Melissa Gage, the utility's vice president of regulatory and finance, said in a statement earlier this year that SWEPCO was requesting the rate increase, ""not just as a necessity, but as a strategic investment in the future of reliable and sustainable energy for Arkansas.""

FAYETTEVILLE'S OPPOSITION

Fayetteville is specifically objecting to the $31 million that would be used for improvements to the Flint Creek Coal Plant, according to Nierengarten.

""The cost of renewables, the cost of clean energy, over the past 10 years has come down significantly, and all of those alternatives are much more cost effective for generating electricity than coal,"" he said Thursday. ""And so, as SWEPCO continues to invest money in the coal plant and continues to generate electricity from that coal plant, it's at the detriment of us, their ratepayers, because that electricity is more expensive to produce and that ultimately has to be passed on to us, their ratepayers.""

The continuation of the use of coal is contrary to Fayetteville's clean energy goals as well as the city's goals to reduce financial pressure on residents, Nierengarten said.

""The city is trying to be, as much as possible, sensitive to rising utility costs, and I think we saw that with our efforts to wrap our water and sewer improvements into the bond so that we don't have to increase water and sewer rates as much,"" he said. ""Maintaining low rates is part of the city's holistic affordability strategy for Fayetteville, and I think that's one of the main reasons we're intervening in this rate case is because we see this 27% amount that SWEPCO wants to increase undermining our strategy to hold our utility rates low for our residents and businesses.""

Residents are already dealing with rising costs of food, housing, health care and transportation. An electric rate increase that would add almost $400 to a resident's bill each year on top of that is too much, Nierengarten said in an interview Wednesday.

""Behind those bills are real people, families trying to stretch their paycheck, seniors living on fixed income, small business owners planning for an uncertain future,"" Sterling Smith, a Citizens Climate Lobby volunteer, said Thursday.

ALTERNATIVES

Stitt and Paschal spoke Thursday to two primary alternatives to coal that would decrease prices significantly: solar and wind energy.

For example, Fayetteville's municipal cost would likely see about a $190,000 a year impact with the proposed rate increase, Nierengarten said. However, a solar array project in southwest Arkansas the city is a part of would offset the cost to be closer to a $20,000 a year impact, he added.

Though wind and solar are significantly less expensive, it is difficult to get utility companies to make the change, Paschal said.

""The primary issue is that utilities don't make as much money off of the solar and wind as they do coal plants because their rate of return is based off of what they're paying for each month,"" she said. ""So the more that they invest in something, or the more that they pay for -- fuel is a big example of that, they're paying for coal, they're paying for gas -- they get a steady rate of return on that.""

The companies get a steady rate of return on things like coal and gas, but wind and solar are free so there is not a number for them to get a rate of the turn on and they would not make the same amount of money as if they remain with the more expensive option, according to Paschal.

COMMUNICATION URGED

Speakers on Thursday's panel encouraged residents to leave a public comment about the SWEPCO rate case.

There were 114 public comments as of Friday morning, all in opposition. Nierengarten said a rate case typically receives about 20.

A public hearing for the case will be held on Dec. 4 at Northwest Arkansas Community College in Springdale as well.

The panel also suggested contacting state representatives.

State legislation from the past two years is also a likely reason for increased utility rates, according to Nierengarten.

Over the past two legislative sessions strict restrictions have been placed on both solar and wind, Paschal said. The legislation on wind turbines has made it nearly impossible to build a project, she said.

""If we can change policy, we can keep rates down, but we have to take some ownership in that, and that's by doing things at your home or business,"" Stitt said.

He encouraged people to get creative and to start small.

""If you currently today have 100% of your energy coming from the grid and you're going to be 100% subject to a 27.3% energy price increase, what if you had three solar panels in your house or five or something, every little bit you get from an alternative source lowers your risk,"" he said.",https://wehco.media.clients.ellingtoncms.com/imports/adg/photos/211370346_FZ-CLIMATE-LOBBY-10-25-rgb_t1200.jpg?57a0c2296240c280e9492005c3cad63e7cbe80f4,N,,2025-10-24 18:05:51.805170

The changes to the registration fees were a consequence of how gasoline and diesel will be taxed starting on Jan. 1, 2026.

Registration fees for electric and hybrid vehicles are tied to Michigan's motor fuel tax on gasoline and diesel. Whenever the tax rises, so do the annual registration fees for those vehicles, which are collected by the Secretary of State.

The annual state budget, passed in early October, is set to change how some taxes on gasoline and diesel will be levied next year.

On Jan. 1, there will be no more sales tax on gasoline and diesel; however, the cost to Michiganders at the pump won't change much, if at all. That's because the 6% general sales tax on gasoline and diesel was removed, but then replaced with a relatively equal amount of motor fuel tax. Michiganders will soon be paying 51 cents per gallon in motor fuel tax instead of the previous 31 cents per gallon, making up for the loss of the general sales tax.

Under Michigan law, motor fuel tax revenue goes directly to the Michigan Transportation Fund (MTF), which is the main collection and distribution fund for state transportation revenue. Essentially, the MTF is the main source of money used in road maintenance and repair.",https://media.wtol.com/assets/WZZM/images/cb19a523-fa25-4561-83ef-a117d61615f3/20250124T150830/cb19a523-fa25-4561-83ef-a117d61615f3_1140x641.jpg,N,,2025-10-24 17:19:45.946208

If the company signs contracts with data centers, it plans to build a 700 megawatt natural gas plant — roughly the size of its Eagle Valley facility.
""It's really disheartening to see that AES Indiana is exploring building gas — and only gas — to power data centers.
With or without data centers, AES plans to build battery storage and work on energy efficiency and what's called ""demand response.""
AES Indiana will file its long-term plan with the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission next week.","The electric utility that serves Indianapolis is prepared to add a lot of natural gas to serve data centers that move into its territory. AES Indiana went over its plan for the next decade and a half with stakeholders Wednesday.

If the company signs contracts with data centers, it plans to build a 700 megawatt natural gas plant — roughly the size of its Eagle Valley facility. It would also add about the same amount of megawatts in gas peaker plants — which only run when energy demand is high.

Patrick Maguire is senior director of commercial with AES. He said because no data center has officially contracted with the utility, it's too early to say how AES would cover the cost of new gas to serve them.

""We're approaching all discussions with potential data center customers carefully and with the goal to protect existing customers, however we proceed,"" Maguire said.

NIPSCO and Indiana Michigan Power have taken different approaches to help shield their customers from rate increases.

All together, the plan for data centers could increase AES's carbon emissions by nearly 70 percent. AES is already working to convert part of its Petersburg coal plant to natural gas by the end of next year.

The move to more natural gas marks a change from what AES proposed three years ago, which called for mostly wind and solar.

Megan Anderson is with the Sierra Club's Beyond Coal campaign in Indiana.

""It's really disheartening to see that AES Indiana is exploring building gas — and only gas — to power data centers. And, you know, likely much of those costs will fall on to customers,"" she said.

Anderson said she's concerned a law passed this year to expedite power for data centers would mean less of a chance for the public to weigh in.

Maguire said the utility did consider a scenario to serve data centers with all clean energy sources, but that it wasn't as cost-effective for customers.

The utility's parent company, AES Corporation, aims to have net zero emissions from electricity sales by 2040 and go net zero entirely by 2050.

With or without data centers, AES plans to build battery storage and work on energy efficiency and what's called ""demand response."" That's where a utility offers incentives to some residents or businesses to use less power when the demand for electricity is high — which helps prevent blackouts.

Louisiana Economic Development officials this morning announced a $277 million investment by Aclara Resources Inc. to build the facility at the Port of Vinton in Calcasieu Parish.

LED characterizes the deal as one that will “establish Louisiana as a leader in sustainable rare earth production and strengthen the nation’s advanced technology supply chain.” With the new facility comes an anticipated 140 new direct new jobs.

LED Secretary Susan Bourgeois says the investment “underscores the importance of development-ready sites and strong local partnerships that give global companies the confidence to choose Louisiana,” also noting that it reinforces the central role Louisiana plays in energy and defense security.

Bloomberg reports that Aclara, in which the Hochschild Group owns a majority stake, has a $1 billion-plus plan to mine rare earths in Latin America and develop processing facilities.

The Louisiana project comes as President Donald Trump is focused on enhancing critical mineral-supply chains, currently dominated by China. The media outlet reported this morning that the Louisiana plant’s capacity for minerals dysprosium and terbium would represent about 14% of China’s official output.

The new facility will use Aclara’s proprietary sustainable extraction technology to produce the heavy rare earth elements essential for electric vehicles, wind turbines, drones and robotics, which rely on advanced permanent magnets. By processing material from Aclara’s mineral deposits in Brazil and Chile, the Louisiana operation is expected to create a “reliable and sustainable” U.S. supply of these materials, LED says.

Last month, Aclara secured funding from the U.S. government for a Brazilian mining project.

In a statement, Gov. Jeff Landry said that in choosing Louisiana for its first U.S. facility, “Aclara is recognizing what we already know: Our state is leading the next generation of energy and technology innovation.”

Aclara Resources CEO Ramón Barúa noted in the announcement that Louisiana’s access to key reagents made the location preferable, ensuring operational reliability and lower transportation costs.

“The state’s world-class chemical industry and highly skilled workforce made the decision even more compelling,” Barúa added. “Simply put, Louisiana has everything we were looking for.

Construction is expected to begin in 2026 and be completed in 2027. The facility will be built in phases, beginning with the rare earth separation plant, followed by potential future expansions to support downstream processing and alloy production as part of Aclara’s long-term growth strategy.

HALEU is essential for numerous advanced reactor designs—including fast reactors, molten salt reactors, and microreactors—and is a key component in TRISO fuel.
Longer term, deployment of advanced reactors requires a much larger and continuous supply of HALEU to meet commercial industry needs.
“A domestic supply of HALEU is critical to the deployment of advanced reactors,” said Jess Gehin, associate laboratory director for INL’s Nuclear Science and Technology directorate.
Treating the EBR-­II used fuel elements with this method creates high-­quality HALEU that meets the needs of some advanced reactor developer designs.","INL is tackling this challenge in part by providing small quantities of HALEU to companies with near-­term research needs and by converting used fuel from the Experimental Breeder Reactor-­II into larger amounts of usable HALEU for first-­of-­a-­kind advanced reactors. This work is intended to help meet the nation’s near-­ and mid-­term HALEU needs while the long-­term commercial HALEU supply chain is being established.

“We are trying to satisfy the immediate needs of the nuclear industry with our focus on short-­term and mid-­term goals,” said Josh Jarrell, director of INL’s Fuel Cycle Science and Technology Division.

Shortly after the nuclear energy industry identified the need to quickly develop a sustainable HALEU supply, INL began providing HALEU for small research activities, such as collecting performance data on new HALEU fuel types.

While recovery of uranium from EBR-­II used fuel has been ongoing for many years, that activity was accelerated to ensure HALEU was available to advanced reactor companies to meet their desired schedules.

The importance of HALEU

While the existing U.S. nuclear fleet uses uranium oxide fuel enriched up to 5 percent with uranium-­235, HALEU is enriched between 5 percent and 20 percent. HALEU is essential for numerous advanced reactor designs—including fast reactors, molten salt reactors, and microreactors—and is a key component in TRISO fuel. It can also significantly enhance the performance of current reactors.

There are two ways to obtain HALEU: enriching uranium to the desired level or downblending high-­enriched uranium from existing stockpiles that may have been recovered from used fuel.

Before making capital-­intensive investments in HALEU production capabilities, potential suppliers need confidence that there will be a reliable market for their product. In the near term, reactor developers require HALEU for research, fuel qualification, and first cores for demonstration reactors. Longer term, deployment of advanced reactors requires a much larger and continuous supply of HALEU to meet commercial industry needs.

“A domestic supply of HALEU is critical to the deployment of advanced reactors,” said Jess Gehin, associate laboratory director for INL’s Nuclear Science and Technology directorate. “There is an increased urgency as imports from Russia are no longer viable to support advanced reactors’ initial cores.”

While INL plays a pivotal role by jump-­starting the HALEU supply chain through its recovery and reuse efforts, several companies, including American Centrifuge Operating, General Matter, Louisiana Energy Services, and Orano Federal Services, are gearing up for commercial HALEU production.

Enabling innovation

In recent years, INL has provided HALEU for research and development use by repurposing surplus materials from various legacy programs. This effort involves identifying and processing suitable scrap HEU into the appropriate fuel forms for further irradiation testing, characterization, and data collection.

In 2023, INL facilitated the transfer of approximately 6 kilograms of HALEU to BWX Technologies for TRISO fuel development for the company’s BWXT Advanced Nuclear Reactor (BANR) project.

More recently, Southern Nuclear loaded nuclear fuel with uranium-­235 enriched up to 6 percent—higher than the usual 3–5 percent enrichment—into Vogtle-­2 to test it through irradiation. The fuel was developed as part of the DOE’s Accident Tolerant Fuel program. The pellets, which also include additives expected to enhance safety performance, were derived from uranium oxide (UO2) powder first prepared by INL.

Bridging the gap

In addition to directly providing small amounts of HALEU for research needs, INL is identifying surplus inventories of uranium scrap for conversion into useable HALEU.

“This [National Nuclear Security Administration]-­led scrap recovery program, which INL participates in, supports companies like Westinghouse for its eVinci microreactor, providing essential materials to continue their projects,” said Corey Shannon, who oversees INL’s HALEU scrap recovery efforts. “Over 80 kilograms of legacy fabrication scrap and other uranium forms are currently being stabilized, characterized, repackaged, and shipped for further processing.”

Along with the scrap recovery efforts that may provide hundreds of kilograms of HALEU, INL is going to provide reactor developers with thousands of kilograms of HALEU from EBR-­II used fuel recovery efforts funded through the DOE Office of Nuclear Energy.

EBR-­II operated at Argonne National Laboratory–West (now part of INL) from 1964 to 1994 and ran on high-­enriched nuclear fuel. As part of the deactivation of the reactor and management of the sodium-­bonded used fuel inventory, the irradiated elements have been undergoing a treatment process to neutralize the reactive sodium. This process enables the separation of uranium from the sodium and fission products, facilitating the recovery of the uranium.

“When EBR-­II shut down, there were 3 metric tons of used fuel containing [HEU], which is valuable because it can be recovered and diluted down to HALEU levels,” said Mike Patterson, program manager for used fuel treatment and disposition at INL’s Materials and Fuels Complex.

The recovered HEU is diluted with lower-­enriched uranium (a process known as downblending) to create HALEU. Treating the EBR-­II used fuel elements with this method creates high-­quality HALEU that meets the needs of some advanced reactor developer designs.

“Since 2019, we expanded from four-­day weeks to seven-­day weeks and eventually to a 24-­hour schedule for four days a week,” said Patterson. “We will complete the EBR-­II driver treatment by the end of 2028, aligning with the HALEU demand schedule.”

Going commercial

In helping bridge the gap between the industry’s near-­term needs and a fully fledged HALEU industry, one of the key challenges is the compatibility of EBR-­II HALEU with various reactor designs. While the material is ideal for fast reactors like those developed by Santa Clara, Calif.–based Oklo, there are some impurities that require additional processing for use with light water reactors or thermal reactors.

“The current material from EBR-­II seems to be a good fit for Oklo’s reactor concepts but may not be compatible with some other advanced reactor applications,” said Patterson.

Once the EBR-II driver fuel elements have been treated, INL will have recovered enough material to produce just under 10 metric tons of HALEU, half of which is allocated to Oklo for use in its Aurora Powerhouse on the INL Site.

To increase the range of fuels and thus the number the nuclear developers that could benefit from the remaining HALEU, INL demonstrated in 2019 a “polishing” process on 3 kilograms of HALEU that purified and cleaned the material. The process also converted it from a metal into an oxide, making it suitable for broader applications, including as a feedstock for TRISO fuel.

The polished material was then sampled, and those samples were sent to BWXT, which confirmed that the material may be received at its facility for fuel processing.

“Now, INL is scaling this polishing process up and will use a new glovebox line to produce hundreds of kilograms of purified HALEU oxide per year beginning in 2028,” Jarrell said.

In April, the DOE announced conditional commitments to provide HALEU to five U.S. nuclear developers through its HALEU Availability Program. These commitments will help developers meet their near-­term fuel needs and advance innovative American nuclear technologies as a step closer to commercialization.

In June, Centrus Energy announced a milestone in its contract with the DOE: a shipment that marked the first significant domestic production of HALEU.

These investments aim to advance commercialization, with national laboratories playing a supporting part.

“The role of national laboratories like INL is critical in bridging the gap between reactor design and market readiness,” said Jarrell. “By providing essential HALEU supplies while the commercial HALEU supply chain is being established, national labs ensure that the nuclear industry can innovate and advance, ultimately leading to an abundant supply of affordable and reliable energy.”

Last week, the student newspaper at the University of Indiana Bloomington was barred from putting out a print edition, and its advisor was fired. The Indiana Daily Student, one of the best student newspapers in the country, was censored. The school proposed that this decision was due to budget issues, but denied any extra funding that was given to the newspaper. In the New York Times, one of the co-editors-in-chief of the paper, 21-year-old Andrew Miller, shared,

“The media school tries to construe this as a business decision, but fundamentally they are trying to tell us what we can and cannot print,” Miller said.

This was not a budgetary decision. Any obstruction of the freedom of the press, or any other infringement on the Bill of Rights, is illegal and pervasively wrong. But that doesn’t mean it’s not happening.

Perhaps you’ve read an earlier editorial of mine and heard my plea for ethical journalism or increased numbers of student reporters. This is not because the paper does not have enough writers, but because writers are increasingly scared to write for us in this current political climate.

Since my start at the paper, I have only seen an increase in fearmongering from outside parties and news outlets. I have seen larger newspapers than ours and The Indiana Daily Student bow their heads and compromise their journalistic values due to political pressures, especially from pressures given by the Trump administration.

Let me be clear: The Old Gold & Black would never compromise any of our values due to institutional pressure.

At an event celebrating the Nicholas Institute for Energy, Environment and Sustainability’s 20th anniversary on Thursday, former EPA Administrators William Reilly and Michael Regan discussed finding climate solutions.

Regan, who is now a distinguished fellow at Duke’s Sanford School of Public Policy, served from 2021 to 2024 under former President Joe Biden, who signed the Inflation Reduction Act in 2022. This measure encouraged private sector, public sector, local and state governments, as well as households to invest in clean energy, electric vehicle tax credits and decarbonization efforts.

As a North Carolinian who also formerly served as secretary of the N.C. Department of Environmental Quality, Regan emphasized the importance of working with state leaders.

Regan said 70% of the EPA’s budget is passed through to the states. As a result, the agency is closely tied to state environmental departments, because the officials work together on strategic planning, setting priorities and measuring results.

“Most of those individuals at the state levels are the ones where the rubber meets the road, and they’re the ones that are having conversations with the private sector, with local communities, with environmental justice communities,” he said.

Former President George H. W. Bush appointed Reilly, who led the EPA from 1989 to 1993. Reilly now serves as chair of the Nicholas Institute’s advisory board.

Notably, Bush signed the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990, a major revision to the original 1970 law. The amendments targeted three major threats to the environment and public health: acid rain, urban air pollution and toxic air emissions, according to the EPA’s website.

In 1990, perception among members of Congress was that the EPA was “excessively oriented” toward regulation, Reilly said.

While the agency was initially popular during its inception in 1970, public support waned under the Reagan administration, which imposed budget cuts. EPA Administrator Anne Gorsuch resigned in 1983 because of an administrative scandal and another EPA official, Rita Lavelle, was convicted of lying to Congress.

To combat this and restore faith, the agency needed a new perspective, he said. The Bush administration worked with the Environmental Defense Fund to develop the clean air amendments and incorporate new ideas.

“We need to be more resourceful, more open to those kinds of approaches which have not really been tried before,” Reilly said.

A Duke student asked the pair how EPA leaders can continue to carry out their mission effectively while working under more narrow legal documents, such as West Virginia v. EPA. In that 2022 ruling, the Supreme Court limited the agency’s ability to regulate carbon emissions in the power sector, according to the Council on Foreign Relations.

Regan said these Supreme Court cases force the EPA to be more creative in terms of protecting public health, and place restrictions on the level of authority the agency can give to regulators.

“We don’t need a ton of new regulations,” Regan said. “We need smart regulations that give flexibility so that markets and technologies can achieve those environmental goals.”",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/s3/files/styles/social_large/s3/articles/feeds-state-102/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/img_4387-1024x7681761336586.jpg?h=ddb1ad0c&itok=pUeNrRU0,N,,2025-10-24 17:00:12.128705

This facility represents North America's inaugural dedicated cobalt sulfate production operation, specifically engineered to produce battery-grade materials meeting automotive industry specifications.
Unlike general cobalt processing facilities, this refinery focuses exclusively on ultra-pure sulfate production optimised for lithium-ion battery applications.","Electra Battery Materials Corp.'s completion of an $82 million financing package has positioned the company to develop North America's first cobalt sulfate refinery, marking a transformative moment for continental energy security and supply chain independence. This essential component, required for manufacturing lithium-ion batteries that power electric vehicles, has remained largely dependent on overseas processing facilities until now.

The Essential Chemistry Behind Electric Vehicle Performance

Cobalt sulfate serves as a fundamental building block in nickel-manganese-cobalt (NMC) battery chemistry, the dominant technology powering most electric vehicles currently on North American roads. The material enhances battery performance through several critical mechanisms that distinguish it from alternative cathode chemistries.

Energy density advantages make cobalt-enhanced batteries particularly attractive for automotive applications. NMC batteries containing cobalt sulfate typically achieve energy densities between 150-250 Wh/kg, significantly higher than iron phosphate alternatives that max out around 160 Wh/kg. This density differential translates directly into extended driving range for electric vehicles, addressing one of consumers' primary concerns about EV adoption.

Thermal stability characteristics represent another crucial performance factor. Cobalt's presence in cathode materials helps prevent thermal runaway events that can lead to battery fires or explosions. Operating temperatures for cobalt-enhanced batteries remain stable up to 60°C, while some alternative chemistries begin degrading at 45°C.

Battery Chemistry Energy Density (Wh/kg) Thermal Stability Cycle Life Cost Factor NMC (with cobalt) 150-250 Excellent (60°C max) 1,000-2,000 cycles High LFP (iron phosphate) 90-160 Good (45°C max) 2,000-3,000 cycles Low NCA (nickel-cobalt-aluminum) 200-260 Very good (55°C max) 500-1,000 cycles Very high

Supply Chain Dependencies That Threaten Regional Security

North America's reliance on Asian cobalt sulfate processing facilities creates multiple vulnerability points that extend beyond simple logistics concerns. Furthermore, understanding critical minerals energy security reveals that approximately 85% of battery-grade cobalt sulfate consumed in North American battery manufacturing originates from facilities in China, Finland, and Belgium.

Geographic concentration risks became particularly evident during recent supply chain disruptions. When COVID-19 restrictions affected overseas production facilities in 2021, cobalt sulfate prices increased by 340% within six months, forcing several North American battery manufacturers to halt production lines temporarily.

Transportation logistics add additional complexity layers to overseas sourcing strategies. Maritime shipping delays from Asian ports to North American destinations averaged 28 days longer than normal during 2022, while freight costs increased by 180% compared to pre-pandemic levels. These disruptions highlighted the fragility of extended supply chains for critical battery materials.

The vulnerability of depending on overseas cobalt sulfate processing became starkly apparent when supply disruptions forced North American battery manufacturers to reduce production capacity by an estimated 15% during peak shortage periods.

How Electra's Ontario Facility Revolutionizes Continental Manufacturing

Technical Specifications Driving Market Transformation

North America's first cobalt sulfate refinery represents more than symbolic progress toward supply chain independence. The facility's technical specifications position it to address significant capacity gaps in regional battery material production.

Annual production capacity of 6,500 metric tons places the facility among medium-scale global producers, sufficient to supply cobalt sulfate for approximately one million electric vehicle batteries annually. This volume represents roughly 15% of current North American EV production capacity, creating meaningful impact on regional supply security.

Processing methodology employs hydrometallurgical techniques specifically designed for battery-grade material specifications. Moreover, the facility's purification systems can achieve cobalt sulfate purity levels exceeding 99.8%, meeting or surpassing automotive industry quality standards that typically require 99.5% minimum purity.

Quality control infrastructure includes real-time monitoring systems for impurity detection, particularly nickel and iron contamination that can degrade battery performance. Automated sampling equipment tests every production batch for compliance with ASTM International standards governing battery-grade cobalt sulfate specifications.

Strategic Positioning in Ontario's Industrial Corridor

Temiskaming Shores location provides multiple logistical advantages that enhance the facility's competitive positioning. The site sits approximately 500 kilometres from major automotive manufacturing centres in Southern Ontario, including facilities operated by General Motors, Ford, and several battery manufacturers.

Transportation infrastructure connections include rail access to Canadian National Railway networks, enabling efficient raw material delivery from Northern Ontario mining operations. Highway access via Ontario Routes 11 and 101 provides truck transportation alternatives for time-sensitive deliveries.

Regional workforce availability benefits from Northern Ontario's established mining industry expertise. The area maintains technical colleges and training programmes focused on metallurgical processing, providing access to skilled workers familiar with hydrometallurgical operations.

In addition, understanding how EVs transforming mining operations demonstrates the broader industry evolution. Utility infrastructure supports energy-intensive refining operations through connections to Ontario's electrical grid, which derives approximately 60% of generation capacity from carbon-free nuclear and hydroelectric sources.

Financial Structure Enabling North America's Cobalt Independence

Investment Components Supporting Long-term Viability

The $82 million total funding package represents a carefully structured combination of private investment, debt restructuring, and government support designed to minimise financial risk while ensuring operational sustainability.

Funding Source Amount (CAD) Structure Purpose Private Financing $34.5 million Equity/convertible debt Construction completion Debt Equitisation $40 million Balance sheet restructuring Operational flexibility Government Commitment $7.5 million Grant funding Infrastructure development Total Package $82 million Mixed instruments Full commissioning

Private investor participation validates commercial viability while providing growth capital for construction completion. The financing structure includes provisions for additional funding if expansion opportunities emerge, suggesting investor confidence in long-term market demand.

Debt restructuring elements address previous financial obligations while creating operational breathing room for the startup phase. Converting $40 million in existing debt to equity positions reduces ongoing interest payments and improves cash flow projections during initial production ramp-up.

Government Support Reflecting Strategic Priorities

Federal and provincial government backing demonstrates official recognition of cobalt sulfate production as a strategic national interest. Canadian government support aligns with the country's Critical Minerals Strategy, which identifies cobalt as essential for economic security and clean energy transitions.

Regulatory approval processes proceeded expeditiously due to government prioritisation of critical mineral processing projects. Environmental permits, construction approvals, and operating licences received coordinated review through streamlined governmental procedures typically reserved for nationally significant infrastructure projects.

Continental Energy Security Through Domestic Processing

Reducing Critical Dependencies on Overseas Facilities

National security implications extend beyond commercial considerations into defence and infrastructure applications requiring reliable cobalt sulfate supplies. Military communication systems, missile guidance technologies, and naval vessel power systems all depend on cobalt-enhanced batteries for operational reliability.

Economic benefits of domestic value-added processing include job creation, tax revenue generation, and reduced foreign exchange outflows for critical material imports. Economic impact studies suggest that domestic cobalt sulfate production could retain approximately $150 million annually in economic value that currently flows to overseas processors.

Import substitution potential grows as North American electric vehicle production expands. However, as the mining industry evolution continues, current projections indicate regional EV manufacturing capacity will reach 3.2 million units annually by 2030, requiring proportional increases in battery material supplies to maintain production targets.

Integration with Continental Battery Strategy

United States Inflation Reduction Act requirements create preferential treatment for electric vehicles containing domestically processed battery materials. Vehicles using North American cobalt sulfate may qualify for enhanced tax credits, improving their cost competitiveness in consumer markets.

Cross-border collaboration opportunities emerge through integrated North American supply chains. Canadian cobalt sulfate production can serve U.S. battery manufacturers while American lithium processing facilities supply Canadian battery producers, creating mutually beneficial trade relationships.

Defence production coordination enables both countries to maintain secure supplies of critical materials for military applications. Joint procurement agreements and strategic reserves become more feasible when processing facilities operate within allied territories.

Market Dynamics Reshaping Battery Material Competition

Competitive Positioning Against Established Producers

Global market share analysis reveals that existing cobalt sulfate refineries concentrate primarily in China (45% of global capacity), Finland (20%), and Belgium (15%). North America's entry into this market represents the first significant capacity addition outside these established regions since 2018.

Cost competitiveness factors favour North American operations in several key areas despite higher labour costs. Proximity to end-users reduces transportation expenses, while stable regulatory environments minimise operational disruptions that can affect overseas facilities.

Quality differentiation opportunities exist for premium applications requiring ultra-pure cobalt sulfate. Furthermore, examining cobalt blue expansion projects illustrates how automotive manufacturers increasingly demand traceability and quality assurance that domestic suppliers can provide more effectively than distant overseas facilities.

Future Expansion Potential and Market Growth

Modular facility design enables capacity increases through additional processing lines without requiring complete facility reconstruction. Engineering studies suggest potential expansion to 12,000 metric tons annually using existing site infrastructure and utility connections.

Related product development opportunities include cobalt hydroxide, cobalt oxide, and other specialised materials used in battery manufacturing. Diversifying product lines could improve facility utilisation rates and financial performance while serving broader market segments.

Regional hub development potential exists for co-locating complementary battery material processing operations. Lithium processing, nickel refining, and cathode material manufacturing could cluster around the cobalt sulfate facility, creating an integrated battery materials complex.

Industry Applications Beyond Electric Vehicle Manufacturing

Automotive Sector Supply Chain Integration

Electric vehicle manufacturers with North American operations represent the primary customer base for domestic cobalt sulfate production. Companies including Tesla, General Motors, Ford, and Rivian all operate battery manufacturing or assembly facilities within economic transportation distance of the Ontario refinery.

Battery pack assembly facilities require predictable supply schedules and quality consistency that domestic suppliers can provide more reliably than overseas alternatives. Just-in-time manufacturing processes benefit significantly from shortened supply chains and reduced logistics complexity.

Quality assurance advantages include direct communication with suppliers, facility inspections, and rapid response to specification changes or quality concerns. These factors become increasingly important as automotive manufacturers face stricter liability standards for battery-related safety issues.

Energy Storage and Infrastructure Applications

Utility-scale battery installations for renewable energy integration represent growing demand segments for high-quality cobalt sulfate. Grid-scale energy storage systems require long-term reliability that premium battery materials help ensure.

Commercial and residential energy storage markets continue expanding as solar panel installations proliferate across North America. Home battery systems and commercial backup power applications both utilise cobalt-enhanced lithium-ion batteries for their energy density and safety characteristics.

Grid stabilisation technologies increasingly rely on fast-response battery systems to maintain electrical grid stability as renewable energy sources comprise larger portions of generation capacity. These applications demand ultra-reliable battery performance that cobalt sulfate helps provide.

Environmental and Social Impact Considerations

Sustainable Processing Technologies and Environmental Stewardship

Advanced refining techniques minimise environmental impact through closed-loop water systems, waste heat recovery, and emissions control technologies. The facility incorporates zero liquid discharge systems that prevent contaminated water from entering local waterways.

Carbon footprint comparisons with overseas alternatives reveal significant environmental advantages. Eliminating trans-oceanic shipping reduces carbon emissions by an estimated 2,400 tonnes CO2 equivalent annually compared to importing equivalent cobalt sulfate quantities from Asian facilities.

Waste reduction protocols include recycling of process chemicals and recovery of valuable by-products. Approximately 95% of process water undergoes treatment and reuse, while solid waste streams undergo additional processing to recover residual cobalt content.

Community Economic Development and Social Responsibility

Local employment opportunities include approximately 75 direct positions ranging from process operators to technical specialists, plus an estimated 150 indirect jobs in supporting industries and services. Average wages for direct positions exceed regional averages by approximately 25%.

Skills training programmes developed in partnership with local educational institutions provide career pathways for regional residents while ensuring adequate workforce availability for facility operations. Training curricula focus on hydrometallurgical processing, quality control, and industrial safety.

Indigenous community engagement follows consultation protocols that respect traditional territories and treaty rights. Economic participation opportunities include contracting preferences and potential equity partnerships in future expansion projects.

Implementation Timeline and Operational Milestones

Construction Progress and Commissioning Schedule

Current project status indicates construction completion expected by Q2 2026, with initial production trials beginning shortly thereafter. Major equipment installation, including processing vessels and purification systems, has reached approximately 70% completion.

Regulatory approval processes have cleared final permitting hurdles, with operating licences approved by provincial and federal authorities. Environmental monitoring systems and reporting protocols have received regulatory approval and remain subject to ongoing compliance verification.

Production ramp-up phases will begin with 25% capacity utilisation during initial operations, increasing gradually to full capacity over approximately 12 months. This conservative approach ensures quality standards while minimising operational risks during startup.

Market Penetration Strategy and Customer Development

Initial customer agreements have been secured with several North American battery manufacturers, though specific contract terms remain confidential for competitive reasons. Industry sources suggest long-term supply agreements covering approximately 60% of planned production capacity.

Pricing strategies aim for competitive positioning against imported alternatives while maintaining sufficient margins for profitable operations. Consequently, according to Invest Ontario's recent announcement, market analysis suggests pricing can remain 5-10% below imported cobalt sulfate while still generating acceptable returns.

Quality certification processes for automotive applications require extensive testing and validation procedures that may extend over 6-12 months. These certifications represent crucial prerequisites for accessing premium market segments with higher profit margins.

Understanding Continental Battery Material Independence

What distinguishes this refinery from existing cobalt processing facilities?

This facility represents North America's inaugural dedicated cobalt sulfate production operation, specifically engineered to produce battery-grade materials meeting automotive industry specifications. Unlike general cobalt processing facilities, this refinery focuses exclusively on ultra-pure sulfate production optimised for lithium-ion battery applications.

How does domestic production economics compare with imported alternatives?

Local manufacturing eliminates overseas shipping costs averaging $800-1,200 per metric ton, reduces supply chain risks that can cause price volatility, and provides quality control advantages through direct supplier relationships. Transportation savings alone can offset higher domestic labour costs in many market conditions.

What strategic significance does government support provide for project viability?

Public sector investment totalling $7.5 million demonstrates governmental commitment to critical mineral processing independence while providing financial stability for long-term operational planning. Government backing also facilitates regulatory approvals and may enable preferential customer relationships with defence and infrastructure applications.

Which factors determine long-term competitive sustainability?

Market competitiveness depends on maintaining cost parity with overseas alternatives, securing stable raw material supplies from North American sources, and developing customer relationships based on supply chain reliability rather than solely on pricing considerations. Additionally, as noted by Recycling Today's coverage, the facility's funding structure provides operational flexibility crucial for long-term success.

Transforming North America's Critical Mineral Processing Landscape

The successful completion of financing for North America's first cobalt sulfate refinery represents more than a single project milestone. This development signals a fundamental shift toward continental supply chain independence for critical battery materials, combining strategic governmental support with private sector innovation to address longstanding vulnerabilities in electric vehicle manufacturing.

The facility's 6,500 metric ton annual production capacity provides meaningful supply security for regional battery manufacturers while establishing technical capabilities that could support future expansion as electric vehicle adoption accelerates. Financial structure combining $34.5 million in private investment with government backing creates a replicable model for additional critical mineral processing investments.

Environmental advantages of domestic processing, including reduced transportation emissions and higher environmental standards, align with broader sustainability goals driving electric vehicle adoption. Community economic development benefits demonstrate how critical mineral processing can contribute to regional prosperity while serving national security interests.

This project's success could catalyse additional investments in lithium processing, nickel refining, and other battery material production facilities across North America, fundamentally reshaping the competitive landscape for clean energy technologies and reducing dependencies on overseas supply chains for generations to come.

That’s all good news for the electric sector. But experts believe that demand will start to dwindle, now that most EVs are effectively $7,500 more expensive.

Before that happens, though, I thought it would be a good idea to take a look at the best-selling electric cars in America, all of which have been helped by the sunsetted tax credit to get a foothold in the U.S. market. Whether or not they’ll keep their spots on the list when the year draws to a close–that’s for another article.

The Trump administration wants to move past the controversy by swapping refuge land for land owned by the local Alaska Native Corporation.","A MARTÍNEZ, HOST:

The Trump administration plans to open a large area of Alaska's Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil and gas leasing. The refuge is the size of South Carolina and includes one of the largest stretches of undeveloped wilderness in the U.S. It's also believed to hold significant oil reserves. Liz Ruskin is the Washington reporter for Alaska Public Media. Joins us now from Washington, D.C. Liz, there's been a lot of back-and-forth over drilling in this wildlife refuge. What's happening now?

LIZ RUSKIN, BYLINE: Well, the new announcement is kind of the old announcement, going back to what the first Trump administration imposed. We as a country have been debating what to do with this upper right-hand corner of Alaska for a really long time. Democratic administrations try to keep drilling rigs out. Republicans want the area leased and drilled and the oil flowing down the Trans-Alaska Pipeline. The state of Alaska wants that, so do a lot of Alaska Native groups, especially on the North Slope. They want the economic development and tax revenue. But drilling is opposed by other Alaska Native groups and by those who say it would be terrible for caribou and polar bear and climate change.

So during the first Trump administration, Congress finally managed to open the refuge to drilling. But it seems like for the oil industry, maybe that came too late because no major oil company bid when drilling rights were auctioned. The big oil developments that we've seen in the Arctic, like the Willow project, they are outside of the refuge.

MARTÍNEZ: There were other projects in Alaska that the Biden administration blocked that the Trump administration is reviving. What are those projects?

RUSKIN: They're reviving two proposals to build roads in parts of Alaska that don't have roads now. You have to fly in. Maybe the most significant is the Ambler Road. This would be a 200-mile road in northwest Alaska through an undeveloped area. It would open access to a place where there's a lot of interest in mining. The state government supports this road. The Trump administration wants it. But a bit of it would cut through Gates of the Arctic National Park and Preserve, so that's controversial. And also, dozens of tribes and people in the region worry that the project will damage fish streams and harm caribou and other wildlife and generally ruin people's ability to live off the land. They say they'll try to block it in court.

MARTÍNEZ: OK, what about that other road?

RUSKIN: OK, that's in southwest Alaska. It would link an isolated town called King Cove to a former Air Force base that has an all-weather airport. And that road would cut through a wildlife refuge. The Trump administration wants to move past the controversy by swapping refuge land for land owned by the local Alaska Native Corporation.

MARTÍNEZ: Liz, why does it feel like Alaska is constantly this partisan political battleground, so to speak?

RUSKIN: Well, the federal government owns more than half of the state. And Alaska is where America goes to fight about public land policy. Democratic administrations, you know, mostly want to preserve natural areas. Republican administrations mostly want economic development. And with each administration undoing what the previous one did, there's not a lot of progress in either direction and these proposals remain in limbo for a long time. I heard from Senator Lisa Murkowski yesterday. And she said maybe, just maybe, one of these decisions will stick this time.

MARTÍNEZ: That's Liz Ruskin with Alaska Public Media. Liz, thanks.

RUSKIN: Thank you.

The energy department said the rule would reduce study times and costs for improving the grid, while reducing the time needed for additional power to come online. The rule also pushes FERC to mull whether reviews for grid projects, which sometimes take years, can be done in 60 days.

As U.S. power demand spikes for the first time in two decades on artificial intelligence, President Donald Trump’s administration is trying to boost power capacity, mainly from fossil fuel and nuclear plants, and grid access for the data center industry.

Energy secretaries can direct FERC, an independent panel of the Energy Department set to have a 3-2 Republican majority, to consider rules, but cannot force it to adopt them.

Edison Electric Institute, which represents publicly-traded electric utilities, said it supported Wright’s effort, saying it would strengthen the grid and drive down costs for customers.

An environmentalist slammed the move. “Pushing FERC to rubber-stamp connections in just 60 days while the government’s shut down and Trump builds a $300 million White House ballroom shows (how) out of touch his administration is from everyday Americans,” said Camden Weber of environmental group Center for Biological Diversity.

Wright also urged FERC to consider a rule to remove burdens for preliminary hydroelectric permits.

Malcolm Woolf, president and CEO of the National Hydropower Association, praised Wright’s move. “It is incumbent upon FERC, the Trump Administration, and Congress to ensure that third parties, such as Federal resource agencies, do not unduly inhibit hydropower development and instead foster its necessary growth to meet current challenges.”

This summer, President Donald Trump signed the One Big Beautiful Bill Act into law, ending various tax credits a decade ahead of schedule. The credits could be used to buy electric vehicles and to install solar panels on homes.

The EV tax credit expired last month. Residential solar tax credits are still available until the end of the year. But Kathy Kuntz, director of Dane County’s Office of Energy and Climate Change, told WPR’s “Wisconsin Today” that it’s unlikely people will be able to qualify for the credits in time unless they’ve already started the process.

“There’s a difference between buying a car and getting solar on your roof,” she said. “You can go to a dealership and buy a car in a couple of hours. It takes more planning to have all of the pieces in place, the permits and everything, to install solar on your house.”

“If people haven’t started yet, it’s probably not realistic for them to take advantage of the solar tax credits at this point,” she added. “If an installer is telling you ‘no problem’ and that they can get this done by the end of the year, you need to be a smart consumer and ask a lot of questions.”

Kuntz said most solar companies her office talks with are saying they’re booked through the year.

Burke O’Neal is a managing partner for Full Spectrum Solar, a solar installation company based in Madison. He told “Wisconsin Today” that the cancellation of the solar energy tax credits is hurting his business.

“It’s certainly been a bit challenging to change course,” O’Neal said. “We were expecting the residential and commercial tax credits through 2032. We were planning additional vehicle and tool purchases and adding electrical and roof installation crews, and we’re still planning to grow but it’s going to be at a slower pace than we expected.”

O’Neal said his company is offering a 5 percent discount to people if they schedule solar installations next year instead of this year to “keep the momentum going.”

Even without solar tax credits, Kuntz said there’s still an economic incentive for installing solar panels. She said the cost of installing solar panels has dropped by 90 percent since the early 2000s. She also said it’s a similar case with EVs becoming more cost-competitive with gas-powered cars.

O’Neal is trying to stay optimistic. He said energy costs for residential homes are up 35 percent in the last four years but solar installation costs remain stable. And as massive data centers around the country continue to drive up the demand and cost for electricity, O’Neal expects solar installations will remain popular.

“Maybe we’re a lot more resilient than we first felt when we learned about these (tax credit) changes,” he said.",https://www.wpr.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Madison-Home-with-Solar-2-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-10-24 16:18:45.305333

EPA.","Two former U.S. Environmental Protection Agency leaders joined students and community members at Duke University to speak on advancing environmental goals in the face of federal resistance to climate change regulation.

At an event celebrating the Nicholas Institute for Energy, Environment and Sustainability’s 20th anniversary on Thursday, former EPA Administrators William Reilly and Michael Regan discussed finding climate solutions.

Regan, who is now a distinguished fellow at Duke’s Sanford School of Public Policy, served from 2021 to 2024 under former President Joe Biden, who signed the Inflation Reduction Act in 2022. This measure encouraged private sector, public sector, local and state governments, as well as households to invest in clean energy, electric vehicle tax credits and decarbonization efforts.

As a North Carolinian who also formerly served as secretary of the N.C. Department of Environmental Quality, Regan emphasized the importance of working with state leaders.

Regan said 70% of the EPA’s budget is passed through to the states. As a result, the agency is closely tied to state environmental departments, because the officials work together on strategic planning, setting priorities and measuring results.

“Most of those individuals at the state levels are the ones where the rubber meets the road, and they’re the ones that are having conversations with the private sector, with local communities, with environmental justice communities,” he said.

Former President George H. W. Bush appointed Reilly, who led the EPA from 1989 to 1993. Reilly now serves as chair of the Nicholas Institute’s advisory board.

Notably, Bush signed the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990, a major revision to the original 1970 law. The amendments targeted three major threats to the environment and public health: acid rain, urban air pollution and toxic air emissions, according to the EPA’s website.

In 1990, perception among members of Congress was that the EPA was “excessively oriented” toward regulation, Reilly said.

While the agency was initially popular during its inception in 1970, public support waned under the Reagan administration, which imposed budget cuts. EPA Administrator Anne Gorsuch resigned in 1983 because of an administrative scandal and another EPA official, Rita Lavelle, was convicted of lying to Congress.

To combat this and restore faith, the agency needed a new perspective, he said. The Bush administration worked with the Environmental Defense Fund to develop the clean air amendments and incorporate new ideas.

“We need to be more resourceful, more open to those kinds of approaches which have not really been tried before,” Reilly said.

A Duke student asked the pair how EPA leaders can continue to carry out their mission effectively while working under more narrow legal documents, such as West Virginia v. EPA. In that 2022 ruling, the Supreme Court limited the agency’s ability to regulate carbon emissions in the power sector, according to the Council on Foreign Relations.

Regan said these Supreme Court cases force the EPA to be more creative in terms of protecting public health, and place restrictions on the level of authority the agency can give to regulators.

“We don’t need a ton of new regulations,” Regan said. “We need smart regulations that give flexibility so that markets and technologies can achieve those environmental goals.”",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/IMG_4387-2048x1536.jpg,N,,2025-10-24 16:05:19.464880

10:08 Do many NACS-equipped vehicles use Ionna sites?","It has been about 10 months since Ionna opened its first four Rechargery on December 27, 2024, following the soft opening of the first site in Apex, North Carolina. State Of Charge‘s Tom Moloughney has taken the opportunity to revisit Ionna and discuss its accomplishments, challenges, and future outlook.

The visit to the company’s headquarters and its Quarterback engineering lab in Durham, North Carolina, for the Ionna interview was quite fruitful and will result in two videos. The first one is an in-depth discussion with Dan Bryant, Ionna’s senior vice president of Site Operations, about the network’s current state of affairs.

How Many Bays?

The Ionna DC fast-charging network is a joint venture between eight global automakers: BMW, General Motors, Honda, Hyundai, Kia, Mercedes-Benz, Stellantis, and Toyota. This provides it with the opportunity for significant funding to jump-start its expansion, and it appears that this is exactly what is happening, as the network is the fastest-growing new DC fast-charging network in the US.

According to Bryant, the number of stations (called Rechargeries) has increased to 31-32. The number of individual stalls (or bays) now exceeds 300. The company has 900 stalls under construction or beyond, and 3,600+ stalls contracted (up 20% from July 2025, when it was 3,000+).

When asked about the possibility of achieving the target of 1,000 bays in 2025, Bryant answered that “we will be pleasantly surprised by what we are going to hit this year”, which makes us believe that there will be a very strong fourth quarter.

Let’s recall that on average, Ionna’s Rechargeries have 10 stalls (five dual-head chargers), so the first 100 sites will mark an important milestone that could be reached within a few months. By the end of 2026, the number of Rechargeries should exceed 200 (with over 2,000 bays).

According to what we learned during Tom’s Ionna interview, Ionna’s long-term target is to deploy more than 30,000 fast-charging stalls by 2030. The average number of stalls might be higher than 10 at that point, so we are talking roughly 2,500 stations.

Nonetheless, as of today, the company’s primary focus is on quality, reliability, and refining all aspects of the stations, rather than on quantity. If necessary, Ionna adjusts its original design to improve the user experience (for example, installing better lighting). By the way, small details not directly related to charging are often the most challenging when building the stations (such as the placement of trash cans, canopies, lights, etc.)

Chargers & Stalls

Ionna currently uses Alpitronic HYC400 (Hypercharger 400) chargers with a power output of up to 400 kW and up to 1,000 volts. They have two charging ports each and can simultaneously charge two EVs (allocating power between them). In the future, power levels might even be higher.

In the case of Ionna, about 60% of the chargers have CCS1 charging connectors, while the other 40% have NACS (SAE J3400) charging connectors. This enables the locations to serve all EVs, aside from a few corner cases (such as older CHAdeMO models). It’s worth noting that Ionna is the only DC fast-charging network with both CCS1 and NACS connectors at all sites.

According to the company, so far, both CCS1 and NACS charging connectors have been relatively well utilized. Depending on the future demand, the company might gradually add more NACS chargers (or even switch CCS1 connectors to NACS).

An important challenge concerns pull-through stalls for larger EVs or EVs with trailers. At the moment, there are two Rechargeries with pull-through stalls and a couple more in the pipeline. Ionna knows the importance of this type of charging stall and plans to deploy them wherever possible to customize the station layout.

Geographic Expansion and Canada

According to the interview, Ionna’s expansion strategy includes various factors — sometimes it’s a particular area, sometimes a corridor, or sites at partners’ locations. There is no single approach, and the Rechargeries are gradually opening in new US states. In September, the network opened its first site in California — the US’s largest EV market.

Regarding Canada, there will be no Rechargeries planned in the short term, but the country is part of the company’s long-term strategy, it says.

Network Operation

According to Ionna, the network already notes a very high uptime of 99%. Uptime is defined in accordance with the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure (NEVI) program (although Ionna is not much engaged in the NEVI itself).

The company places strong emphasis on the reliability and prompt repair of charging ports.

A positive thing is that so far, the network has no issues with vandalism. There was also no issue with queues, and users reported very positive feedback on that topic. That’s probably why Ionna still does not have an idle fee, but it might have one in the future.

Another good thing is the Plug & Charge feature, which Ionna offers to several brands already, including BMW, General Motors, Hyundai, Kia, and Mercedes-Benz. This list recently expanded as Rivian joined the party.

A little surprising subject of discussion concerned app development. Ionna does not yet have an app, and according to the interview, it’s not focusing on this topic right now.

Pedal to the Metal

Amid policy changes in the US, Ionna says it is pushing hard on expanding the network, so we should see many new high-quality, high-power charging stations soon. Ionna network’s map can be seen here.

Our attention caught the upcoming new type of Rechargeries: Rechargery Beacon. Details about that are coming soon.

The risk to the taxpayer is nil,” Santee Cooper Board Chairman Peter McCoy said.
The permits to build and the licenses to operate the nuclear plants will need to be renewed, likely starting from scratch, Clements said.
Santee Cooper heard from 70 bidders and received 15 formal proposals to restart construction of the reactors.
“You have placed South Carolina in the epicenter of the resurgence of nuclear power in the United States,” Santee Cooper CEO Jimmy Staton said.","COLUMBIA, S.C. -- South Carolina's state-owned utility is looking to a private company to revive a project to build two nuclear power plants that was abandoned eight years ago, losing more than $9 billion without generating a watt of power.

Santee Cooper's board agreed Friday to start six weeks of negotiations with Brookfield Asset Management that they hope will lead to a deal that lets the private company build the nuclear plants at the V.C. Summer site near Jenkinsville at their own risk to generate power that they could mostly sell to whom they want, such as energy-gobbling data centers.

Santee Cooper said Brookfield preliminarily agreed to provide the utility with some of the power generated. But that and probably thousands of other details will have to be negotiated. In a twist, Brookfield took over the assets of Westinghouse Electric Co., which had to declare bankruptcy because of difficulties building new nuclear reactors.

Utility officials said the agreement gives hope the state can get something out of a debacle that led to four executives going to prison or home confinement for lying to regulators, shareholders, ratepayers and investigators and left millions of people paying for decades for a project that never produced electricity.

“The risk to the ratepayer is nil. The risk to the taxpayer is nil,” Santee Cooper Board Chairman Peter McCoy said.

There are still too many hurdles for the project to get past to consider this a win right now, said Tom Clements, executive director of the nuclear watchdog group Savannah River Site Watch.

After eight years in the elements, all the equipment and the structure of the plant, which was less than halfway finished, will need to be carefully inspected before it can be used. The permits to build and the licenses to operate the nuclear plants will need to be renewed, likely starting from scratch, Clements said.

“I still believe that the cost, technical and regulatory hurdles are too big to lead to completion of the project,” Clements said, adding the agreement appears to let Brookfield walk away if it decide it's not feasible.

Santee Cooper heard from 70 bidders and received 15 formal proposals to restart construction of the reactors. Interest in the project has grown as power demand in the U.S. surges with the increase in data centers as artificial intelligence technology develops.

Santee Cooper executives credited President Donald Trump's executive order in May calling for the U.S. to quadruple the amount of power generated by nuclear plants over the next 25 years for opening the door to the potential agreement.

“You have placed South Carolina in the epicenter of the resurgence of nuclear power in the United States,” Santee Cooper CEO Jimmy Staton said.

Santee Cooper was the minority partner with what was then South Carolina Electric and Gas when construction on the two new nuclear plants started in 2013 at the V.C. Summer site — about 25 miles (40 kilometers) northeast of Columbia — where SCE & G was already operating a reactor.

The project needed to be finished in seven years to get tax credits to keep the project's cost from overwhelming the utilities, but it ended up behind schedule almost immediately.

Executives lied about the problems to keep money coming in. Taxpayers and ratepayers ended up on the hook because of a state law that allowed the utilities to charge for costs before any power was generated.",https://i.abcnewsfe.com/a/921bb079-82af-4966-a581-db093e0f0b6e/wirestory_f7bcefe431672c4145f7c4acbd05d4e7_16x9.jpg?w=1600,N,,2025-10-24 16:04:50.617158

If it happens, history is likely to judge it as an obviously perverse outcome from what the government announced on Friday would be known as the Environment Protection Reform Bill.","In an age of monumental political shifts, the news that the Coalition doesn’t like, and very likely won’t support, Labor’s proposed revamp of national nature law has at least had one thing going for it. It is achingly predictable.

I mean … of course it was going to go this way. Australia’s rightwing parties are a mess, and threatening to tear themselves apart. It’s possible not every Coalition MP dismisses the evidence that the country’s extraordinary and unique environment is in long-term decline. But a significant number do.

Sussan Ley and David Littleproud are battling to hold their parties together and keep their jobs. The idea that a deal could be landed, with the support of the Nationals and many Liberals, that includes even mild nods to improving nature protection was always highly optimistic.

It’s hard to imagine the Albanese government believed it was possible. But for weeks we have been stepping through the political dance of the environment minister, Murray Watt, talking with both the Coalition and the Greens about what a future Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation (EPBC) Act might look like.

If nothing else, we should be grateful to Ley for ending the pretence on Thursday, when she declared the nature laws were a “red light” for jobs and suggested the creation of a national Environment Protection Agency (EPA) would be a form of “green ideology”. Most of what she said was not true – Alcoa quickly dismissed Ley’s claim that the legislation would stop a proposed gallium refinery expansion – but it made her position clear.

It means that unless something extraordinary happens in Australia’s rightwing politics, or Labor abandons any claim to wanting to protect the country’s extraordinary wildlife, the government will have to deal with the Greens in the Senate. In political terms, we are basically back to where we were a year ago, before Anthony Albanese intervened at the behest of Western Australian Labor and mining interests to scupper a deal between the then minister Tanya Plibersek and the Greens to legislate an EPA.

Agreement this time appears challenging, if not impossible. Lobbyists, campaigners and politicians have seen parts of the legislation, but key elements – the design of the EPA, for example – are yet to be released.

There are some things we know. The proposed changes to the EPBC Act do not deal with its fundamental problem: despite its name, the law does not prioritise protecting the environment. Its principle role is to allow projects – including fossil fuel developments – to go ahead, with some conditions attached to limit environmental damage.

That approach has failed, partly because the environment minister of the day has a remarkable amount of discretion to approve what they see fit. Ministers have routinely approved offsets that do not compensate for the nature that has been lost. Conditions have not been enforced. The cumulative impacts of multiple developments have not been considered.

Native forest logging overseen by the states has been effectively exempt, despite a long list of legal cases in which it was found to have breached the laws. Forest destruction on private land for agriculture – a major driver of biodiversity loss across vast areas of western New South Wales and Queensland, and the Northern Territory – has rarely been assessed.

Alongside these fundamental environmental problems, decision times on projects have often blown out – a major gripe of industry that it wants addressed.

Added up, it means major surgery will be needed to address the systemic problems set out in the last major state of the environment report. The risk is that the overhaul ends up as tinkering rather than transformation.

If the government’s first goal is to lift environmental protection – and it was prepared to lose skin to industry attacks in the process – there is a strong case it would replace the act entirely. Watt’s predecessor Plibersek flagged that as a possibility before dropping the idea. There seems to be no appetite for it now. Instead, the focus is on pushing legislation through as soon as possible.

There are some decent elements in what Watt is proposing.

He is leaning heavily on a 2020 review by the former competition watchdog head Graeme Samuel, including one of its central recommendations – the introduction of national environment standards against which development proposals could be tested. Two draft standards, covering matters of national environmental significance and offsets, are promised alongside the legislation, with others to follow. Their strength or otherwise will go a long way towards deciding whether the changes are meaningful.

The legislation will include a definition of an “unacceptable impact”. This could be crucial in setting a test of whether a project should be approved in an environmentally sensitive area. Business interests don’t like it and want it out.

The minister says there will also be broader “no-go zones” in which developments will be banned, and a requirement that industry will not only offset the damage it causes, but spend to create a “net gain” for nature. This is vital given what has been lost, but we know nothing about how net gain will be defined or enforced. For now, it’s just a phrase.

Watt is promising a legislated requirement that developers need to avoid or limit damage before buying offsets. And he says there will be beefed up penalties, with fines of up to $825m and a pledge that offenders would be stripped of financial gains made while breaking the law.

Most of these commitments are hard to assess without detail – including on whether the EPA will have the power, resourcing and culture needed to transform nature protection across the country.

Then there are the problems and unanswered questions – and they are significant.

There is little sign the legislation will tackle the huge problem of deforestation. Millions of hectares have been cleared without federal oversight, mostly for industrial farming. The state of the environment report cited evidence that 93% of the threatened species habitat cleared between 2000 and 2017 was not referred for assessment under national law. One hundred scientists wrote to Albanese this week calling for this to be urgently addressed.

The government is planning to create a “restoration contributions” fund that developers can pay into and officials would then use to buy offsets. But the legislation includes no requirement that the offset is “like-for-like”, which suggests spending on a completely unrelated environment project could be used to justify nature destruction elsewhere.

It is also unclear how the government plans to abolish the exemption granted to native forest logging – something Samuel, Plibersek and Watt have agreed is necessary – but which the timber industry and the Tasmanian government strongly oppose.

And on the epochal issue of climate change – which will transform so much of the natural environment as temperatures rise – the government has remained firm in rejecting calls for the greenhouse gas pollution of fossil fuel developments to be considered in the approval process.

Instead, developers will be required to just disclose in their application the expected emissions and a plan to reduce them – a step that many big companies already take. Rather than block big polluting projects, the likelihood is that coal and gas proposals could receive a greenlight more rapidly if the legislation is passed, in the name of cutting “green tape”.

If it happens, history is likely to judge it as an obviously perverse outcome from what the government announced on Friday would be known as the Environment Protection Reform Bill.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/70f07dddb6a1011695f64003315b4332ef717422/399_103_6752_5401/master/6752.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=68f60a30f6d111a2078b02e8f3ab6f38",N,,2025-10-24 16:05:04.279739

While the 118th Congress adopted some permitting reforms as part of the Fiscal Responsibility Act and nearly adopted a larger permitting reform as part of the Energy Permitting Reform Act, the topic is gaining traction under the 119th, with more bills and deeper policies proposed. While not exhaustive, this piece attempts to lay out the broad strokes of key legislation and explain their likely effects. It should not be considered an R Street endorsement of listed legislation.

SPEED Act

Reps. Bruce Westerman (R-Ark.) and Jared Golden (D-Maine) introduced the Standardized Permitting and Expediting Economic Development Act (SPEED Act) in July 2025. The bill is an extension of Rep. Westerman’s permitting proposals from last Congress, except more comprehensive and now bipartisan.

The SPEED Act includes three key policies:

Judicial Review Reform

The SPEED Act would make two major changes to judicial review under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA). The first is that plaintiffs litigating government permits must have submitted comments during the public comment period that are relevant to the issue they are litigating. This is significant, as research on NEPA permitting timelines has hypothesized that a lack of knowledge about which environmental effects must be considered sufficient in court leads agencies to err on the side of comprehensive review, thereby lengthening the process. The reform—which already partially exists for some major projects under Title 41 of the Fixing America’s Surface Transportation (FAST) Act—would reduce permitting timelines by ensuring agencies know exactly how their draft environmental reviews should be improved before a final permit is issued.

The SPEED Act would also reduce the statute of limitations under which a NEPA permit can be litigated from the current six years to 150 days. Although most litigations against NEPA permits occur almost immediately after issuance, a prolonged statute of limitations can deter market entry. This is because project developers may not want to commence construction while a permit is under threat of litigation.

Codification of SCOTUS Decision

Earlier this year, the Supreme Court of the United States (SCOTUS) heard a case that challenged the adequacy of a NEPA permit, contending that such permits should also consider any indirect environmental effects (e.g., pollution from activities supported by the permitted project). SCOTUS ruled that this was inappropriate, but importantly the majority opinion noted that lower courts had been improperly vacating permits and delaying projects. The opinion from SCOTUS was that permits should be vacated only when the asserted permit deficiency would have altered the decision to issue a permit.

The SPEED Act codifies some of this. First, it narrows the consideration of effects for review under permits to direct effects. Second, it clarifies that issued permits should still be considered active while agencies work to correct deficiencies. In other words, if a court finds that a permit’s supporting documentation is improper, a project can still move forward with construction unless the deficiency of the permit would have prevented it from being issued at all.

Paperwork Reduction

The SPEED Act has several provisions designed to make supporting documents for permits more durable and to expand the list of acceptable documents for consideration. The act also clarifies that agencies are not required to seek out or produce new environmental studies if there is sufficient existing available information, nor must they consider any new studies that emerge during the permitting process.

Furthermore, SPEED contains a number of provisions that narrow the applicability of NEPA, expand categorical exclusions, and prevent future reversals of issued permits between administrations.

SPEED and Reliability Act

Not to be confused with the SPEED Act, the Streamlining Powerlines Essential to Electric Demand and Reliability Act (SPEED and Reliability Act) proposed by Reps. Scott Peters (D-Calif.) and Andy Barr (R-Ky.) focuses on electric power transmission permitting issues.

The bill aims to ameliorate the difficulties of permitting large interstate transmission lines by enhancing federal backstop authority and removing some political authorities. Specifically, the bill would remove the Department of Energy’s authority to designate broad areas for transmission (called “corridors”) as within the national interest, transferring this authority to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) to apply to specific projects.

Additionally, the bill aims to expand state and local engagement in the federal permitting process of electric power transmission and mandates a one-year period of engagement before FERC can permit a project. The bill further aims to clarify “cost allocation,” where those who benefit from new federally permitted transmission (e.g., lower electricity costs) must also bear the project costs.

The thinking behind the SPEED and Reliability Act is that although the federal government currently has the authority to expedite the permitting of significant electric power transmission lines through its designation of national interest electric transmission corridors, this authority is almost never used. It is complicated, rarely applicable to real projects, and opposed by states and localities that might be impacted. The reformed approach would centralize authority within FERC to focus on approving proposed (rather than theoretical) projects while expanding state and local engagement to address concerns of project opposition, though this federal backstop authority is only utilized if the state-level process fails or is impossible.

FREE Act

The Full Responsibility and Expedited Enforcement Act (FREE Act) introduced by Rep. Celeste Maloy (R-Utah) is a proposed “permit-by-rule” (PBR) legislation. PBR allows developers to begin construction without a permit so long as the final construction complies with government regulations.

Although it is considered a PBR proposal, the legislation would not directly implement any PBR policies. Rather, the bill would require government agencies to identify and report to Congress opportunities for PBR implementation within their permitting guidelines and to adopt PBR processes for those opportunities.

PBR is a relatively novel concept and may only have limited applicability to large-scale projects that require significant environmental review before being permitted. However, most permits do not require significant review from the government, often falling within “categorical exclusions.” That makes it possible for PBR to cover a wide swath of low-impact projects permitted by the federal government.

ePermit Act

Introduced by Reps. Dusty Johnson (R-S.D.) and Peters (D-Calif.), the ePermit Act aims to digitize much of the NEPA-related permitting information collected and published by the federal government. There is little standardization or publication of permitting data from the federal government, making the analysis of relevant permitting trends difficult. It is also a problem for permitting expediency, because government agencies do not always know if the documentation they need for permits already exists.

The ePermit Act represents a potentially low-cost way to make necessary information more readily available to permitting agencies. It could also improve accountability by increasing the transparency of choke points within federal permitting processes.

Policy Insight

These efforts represent just some of the permitting policy efforts currently being contemplated this Congress. Importantly, they each target different elements of federal permitting identified as in need of reform. While different elements of reform will deliver varying levels of improvement for federal permitting timelines, it is unlikely that any single reform will be sufficient to remedy protracted federal permitting timelines.",https://www.rstreet.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/AdobeStock_84221257.jpeg,N,,2025-10-24 16:04:59.476890

(AP) — Michigan is demanding millions of dollars in incentives back from a Chinese company after plans to build an electric vehicle battery plant collapsed following years of pushback against the project from neighbors and members of Congress.

Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer supported the $2.36 billion factory in 2022, and state lawmakers approved nearly $175 million in incentives for the project. The state is now holding Gotion Inc. in default of $23.6 million, accusing the company of abandoning the project.

“While this is not the outcome we hoped for, we recognize the tremendous responsibility we have to the people we serve to make sure their hard-earned tax dollars are spent wisely and appropriately,” Danielle Emerson, a spokesperson with the Michigan Economic Development Corporation, said in a statement.

Representatives for Gotion, which is headquartered in California, did not respond to multiple messages seeking comment.

In a letter dated Sept. 17, Michigan informed Gotion that it was in default of economic development grant obligations because no “eligible activities” had occurred on the site's property in over 120 days.

According to the MEDC, the state is seeking to claw back $23.6 million that was disbursed toward the purchase of the site’s land near Big Rapids, about 200 miles (322 kilometers) northwest of Detroit. $26.4 million remaining from the grant that was not spent will be returned to the state, Emerson said. Citing a lack of progress on the project, a different $125 million grant was not distributed to Gotion.

The news was first reported by Crain’s Detroit Business.

The state also said two project-related lawsuits are imposing a “material adverse effect” on its progress, which counts as grounds for default. The letter said that if the defaults are not resolved in 30 days, the state expects repayment of $23.6 million. That deadline passed Oct. 17.

Residents of nearby Green Township so firmly opposed the project, some over environmental concerns, that voters in 2023 recalled five local elected officials who supported bringing the factory to the area.

Auto manufacturing is the lifeblood of Michigan’s economy, which has been hard hit by tariffs imposed this year on the industry and Canada. When the project was proposed, officials said the factory would produce cathodes and anodes, two components key to electric vehicle batteries, as well as over 2,000 jobs. The original economic development incentives came as officials sought to bolster manufacturing in the state.

Whitmer's office did immediately respond to a request for comment.

Republican U.S. Rep. John Moolenaar, who represents a swath of rural Michigan, had been the loudest and most prominent critic of the project, accusing Gotion of ties with forced labor and the Chinese Communist Party. Moolenaar chairs the House Select Committee on China and introduced a bill that stopped companies like Gotion from receiving electric vehicle tax credits from President Joe Biden's Inflation Reduction Act. Moolenaar's bill was signed by President Donald Trump earlier this year.

“Now that its contract with the State of Michigan and MEDC is set to be terminated, the people of Green Charter Township can finally move on from Gotion’s lies and broken promises,” Moolenaar said in a press release.

“There are real issues here that are at stake,” said veteran Democratic strategist Gale Kaufman, who has represented several unions that have contributed to Newsom’s committee supporting Proposition 50.
“But the truth is on Proposition 50, I think it’s much less calculated than normal contributions.
Money from California unions pours in Although much of the money supporting the efforts comes from wealth Democratic donors and partisan groups aimed at helping Democrats take control of Congress, a significant portion comes from labor unions.
“The governor’s support for labor would be exactly the same with or without Proposition 50 on the ballot.","With the fate of President’s Trump’s right-wing agenda at stake, the California ballot measure crafted to tilt Congress to Democratic control has turned into a fight among millionaires and billionaires, a former president, a past movie-star governor and the nation’s top partisans.

Californians have been inundated with political ads popping up on every screen — no cellphone, computer or living-room television is spared — trying to sway them about Proposition 50, which will reconfigure the districts of the largest state congressional delegation in the union.

Besides opposing pleas from former President Obama and former California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, the state’s powerful, left-leaning labor unions are another factor that may influence the outcome of the Nov. 4 special election.

Unions representing California school teachers, carpenters, state workers and nurses have plowed more than $23 million into efforts to pass Proposition 50, according to an analysis of campaign finance disclosure reports about donations exceeding $100,000. That’s nearly one-third of the six-figure donations reported through Thursday.

Not only do these groups have major interests in the state capitol, including charter school reform, minimum wage hikes and preserving government healthcare programs, they also are deeply aligned with efforts by Gov. Gavin Newsom and his fellow Democrats to put their party in control of the U.S. House of Representatives in the 2026 election.

“There are real issues here that are at stake,” said veteran Democratic strategist Gale Kaufman, who has represented several unions that have contributed to Newsom’s committee supporting Proposition 50.

“There’s always a risk when making sizable donations, that you’re putting yourself out there,” Kaufman said. “But the truth is on Proposition 50, I think it’s much less calculated than normal contributions. It really is about the issue, not about currying favor with members of the Legislature, or the congressional delegation, or the governor. Even though, of course, it benefits them if we win.”

High stakes brings in big money from across the nation

Newsom’s pro-Proposition 50 committee has raised more than $116 million, according to campaign disclosure filings through Thursday afternoon, though that number is sure to increase once additional donations are disclosed in the latest fundraising reports that are due by midnight Thursday.

The multimillion-dollar donations provide the best evidence of what’s at stake, and how Proposition 50 could determine control of the House during the final two years of Trump’s presidency. If the Democrats take control of the House, not only could that derail major parts of Trumps agenda, it probably would lead to a slew of congressional hearings on Trump’s immigration crackdown, use of the military in American cities, accepting a $400-million luxury airliner from Qatari’s royal family, the cutting of research funding to universities and the president’s ties to sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, among many others.

The House Majority PAC — the Democrats’ congressional fundraising arm — has donated at least $15 million to the pro-Proposition 50 campaign, and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.) was in Los Angeles to campaign for the ballot measure last weekend. Obama joined Newsom on a livestream promoting the proposition Wednesday, and Democratic National Committee Chairman Ken Martin hosted a bilingual phone bank in Los Angeles on Thursday.

“Make no mistake about what they’re trying to do and why it’s so important that we fight back,” Martin said. “We’re not going to be the only party with one hand tied behind our back. If they want a showdown, we’re going to give them a showdown and in just a little under two weeks it starts right here with Prop. 50 in California.”

Billionaire financier George Soros — a generous donor to liberal causes and a bogeyman to Republicans — has contributed $10 million. Others have chosen to fund separate entities campaigning in favor of Proposition 50, notably billionaire hedge-fund founder Tom Steyer, who chipped in $12 million.

On the opposition side, the largest donor is Charles Munger Jr., the son of the longtime investment partner of billionaire Warren Buffett, who has contributed $32.8 million to one of the two main committees opposing Proposition 50. The Congressional Leadership Fund — the GOP’s political arm in the House — has donated $5 million to the other main anti-Proposition 50 committee and $8 million to the California Republican Party.

Although Republicans may control the White House and Congress, the California GOP wields no real power in Sacramento, so it’s not surprising that Republican efforts opposing Proposition 50 have not received major donations from entities with business before the state.

The California Chamber of Commerce opted to remain neutral on Proposition 50. Chevron and the California Resources Corp., petroleum companies that have given to California Republicans in the past, also remain on the sidelines.

In contrast, Democrats control every statewide office and hold supermajorities in both houses of the California Legislature. The pro-Proposition 50 campaign has been showered with donations from groups aligned with Sacramento’s legislative leaders — with labor organizations chief among them.

Among the labor donors, the powerful carpenters unions have donated at least $4 million. Newsom hailed them in July when he signed legislation altering a landmark environmental law for urban apartment developments to boost the supply of housing. The California Conference of Carpenters union has become one of the most pro-housing voices in the state.

“This is the third of the last four years we’ve been together signing landmark housing reforms, and it simply would not have happened without the Carpenters,” Newsom said at the time.

Daniel M. Curtin, director of the California Conference of Carpenters, pointed to a letter he wrote to legislators in August urging them to put redistricting on the ballot because of the effect of Trump’s policies on the state’s workers.

“These are not normal times, and this isn’t politics as usual. Not only has the Trump administration denied disaster assistance to victims of California’s devastating forest fires, he’s damaging our CA economy with mass arrests of law-abiding workers without warrants,” wrote Curtin, whose union has 70,000 members in the state. “The Trump administration is now unilaterally withdrawing from legally binding union collective bargaining agreements with federal workforce unions. The President has made it clear that this is just the beginning.”

Proposition 50 was prompted by Trump urging Republican leaders in Texas to redraw their congressional districts to boost the number of GOP members in the House and keep the party in control after the 2026 election. Newsom sought to counter the move by altering California’s congressional boundaries in a rare mid-decade redistricting.

With 52 members in the House, the state has the largest congressional delegation in the nation. But unlike many states, California’s districts are drawn by an independent commission created by voters in 2010 in an effort to end partisan gerrymandering and incumbent protection.

The state’s districts would not have been redrawn until after the 2030 U.S. census, but the Legislature and Newsom agreed in August to put Proposition 50, which would give Democrats the potential to pick up five seats, on the November ballot.

Money from California unions pours in

Although much of the money supporting the efforts comes from wealth Democratic donors and partisan groups aimed at helping Democrats take control of Congress, a significant portion comes from labor unions.

The Service Employees International Union, which represents more than 700,000 healthcare workers, social workers, in-home caregivers and school employees and other state and local government workers, has contributed more than $5.5 million to the committee.

On Oct. 12, the union celebrated Newsom signing bills ensuring that workers, regardless of immigration status, are informed about their civil and labor rights under state and federal law as well as updating legal guidance to state and local agencies about protecting private information, such as court records and medical data, from being misused by federal authorities.

“Thank you to Governor Newsom for … standing up to federal overreach and indiscriminate, violent attacks on our communities,” David Huerta, president of SEIU California, said in a statement.

Huerta was arrested during the first day of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement raids in Los Angeles in June and charged with a felony. But federal prosecutors are instead pursuing a misdemeanor case against him, according to a Friday court filing.

An SEIU representative did not respond to requests for comment.

The California Teachers Assn., another potent force in state politics, has contributed more than $3.3 million, along with millions more from other education unions such as the National Education Assn., the California Federation of Teachers and the American Federation of Teachers.

CTA had a mixed record in this year’s legislative session.

Newsom vetoed a bill to crack down on charter school fraud, Senate Bill 414. The CTA opposed the bill, arguing that it didn’t go far enough to target fraud in some of the schools, and had urged the governor to reject it.

Newsom signed CTA-backed bills that placed strict limits on ICE agents’ access to school grounds. But he also vetoed union-backed bill that would have required the state Board of Education to adopt health education instructional materials by July 1, 2028.

CTA President David Goldberg said their donations are driven not only by issues important to the union’s members, but also the students they serve who are dependent on federally funded assistance programs and impacted by policies such as immigration.

“It’s about our livelihood but it really is about fundamental issues … for people who serve students who are just incredibly under attack right now,” Goldberg said.

“The governor’s support for labor would be exactly the same with or without Proposition 50 on the ballot. But he would acknowledge this year is more urgent than ever for labor and working people,” said Newsom spokesperson Bob Salladay. “Trump is taking a wrecking ball to collective bargaining, to fair wages and safe working conditions. He would be backing them up under any circumstances, but especially now.”

Critics of Proposition 50 argue that these contributions are among the reasons voters should oppose the ballot measure.

“The independent redistricting commission exists to prevent conflicts of interest and money from influencing line drawing,” said Amy Thoma, a spokesperson for the Voters First Coalition, the committee backed by Munger Jr., who bankrolled the 2010 ballot measure to create the independent commission. “That’s why we want to preserve its independence.”

Other labor leaders argued that although they are not always in lockstep with Newsom, they need to support Proposition 50 because of the importance of Democrats winning the congressional majority next year.

Lorena Gonzalez, the head of the powerful California Labor Federation, said the timing of the member unions’ donations of millions of dollars to Newsom’s ballot measure committee for an election taking place shortly after the bill-signing period was “unfortunate” and “weird.”

“Because we have so many bills in front of him, we were gun-shy,” she said, noting that the federation has sparred with the governor over issues such as the effect of artificial intelligence in the workplace. “Never be too close to your elected officials. Because we see the good, the bad, the ugly.”",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/17fc91a/2147483647/strip/true/crop/7760x4074+0+231/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F68%2F9f%2Fe80f266e40b0bb8f5f4ae1d0afb5%2F1523944-me-human-chain-standalone-cmh-01.jpg,N,,2025-10-24 17:00:07.569734

Aclara Resources Inc., headquartered in Vancouver, British Columbia, announced a $277 million investment to construct the first U.S. heavy rare earth separation facility at the Port of Vinton, according to a Friday news release from Louisiana Economic Development.

The company plans to mine deposits of rare earth metals in South America and ship them to Louisiana for processing at its proposed facility in Vinton. The facility will use hydrochloric acid to extract and separate the metals from the clay mineral deposits.

Rare earth elements — such as dysprosium, neodymium, praseodymium and terbium — are considered critical materials for many industries. Some are used as high-powered magnets in wind turbine motors, vehicle alternators and heat-seeking missiles, according to ScienceNews. Others are used as high-temperature alloys in aircraft engines and nuclear reactors, or as signal amplifiers in fiber optic cables, among other applications.

Aclara’s Louisiana facility is expected to directly employ 140 people. It will occupy an LED Certified Site at the Port of Vinton, prequalified for industrial development through environmental and engineering reviews.

“Louisiana provides ready access to the key reagents we depend on, helping ensure operational reliability and lower transportation costs,” Aclara Resources CEO Ramón Barúa said in the news release. “The state’s world-class chemical industry and highly skilled workforce made the decision even more compelling. Simply put, Louisiana has everything we were looking for.”

The state is giving Aclara a $3 million grant to pay for infrastructure and an additional job-creation grant for as much as 22% of wages paid. Additionally, the company will be eligible for the state’s lucrative Industrial Tax Exemption Program through which it will be largely exempt from property taxes in Calcasieu Parish.

In addition to the restructuring, both SAIC - GM and SAIC - GM - Wuling have made management adjustments.
Xue Haitao, the former deputy general manager of SAIC - GM - Wuling, replaced Lu Yi as the deputy general manager of SAIC - GM.","On October 21st, General Motors released its financial results for the third quarter of 2025. Its revenue reached $48.6 billion, remaining flat year - on - year; net profit was $1.3 billion, a 57% year - on - year decrease; and adjusted EBIT was $3.4 billion, an 18% year - on - year decline.

Meanwhile, General Motors expects its full - year net profit in 2025 to be between $7.7 billion and $8.3 billion; adjusted EBIT is projected to be between $12 billion and $13 billion, compared with the previous quarter's expectation of $10 billion to $12.5 billion; automotive business cash flow is expected to be between $19.2 billion and $21.2 billion; and adjusted automotive business cash flow is expected to be between $10 billion and $11 billion.

In the third quarter of 2025, General Motors sold 469,000 vehicles in China, a 10.9% year - on - year increase, marking the third consecutive quarter of year - on - year sales growth. General Motors pointed out that in China, the sales of its new energy vehicles and pure - electric vehicles have achieved year - on - year growth for ten consecutive quarters since the second quarter of 2023. Benefiting from the sales recovery, General Motors has achieved profitability in China for four consecutive quarters.

Can General Motors completely emerge from the trough in China and return to its former glory?

Restructuring the Chinese Business after Losses

In recent years, General Motors has faced development bottlenecks in the Chinese market, with its sales gradually declining. From 2022 to 2024, its sales volumes were 2.3 million, 2.09 million, and over 1.8 million vehicles respectively.

Data shows that General Motors mainly has two joint - venture companies in China: SAIC - GM and SAIC - GM - Wuling. According to the official website of General Motors (China), it operates five major brands in China: Buick, Chevrolet, Cadillac, Baojun, and Wuling. Among them, Buick, Chevrolet, and Cadillac are managed by SAIC - GM; Wuling and Baojun are managed by SAIC - GM - Wuling.

The decline in General Motors' sales is mainly due to SAIC - GM. From 2022 to 2024, SAIC - GM's sales volumes were 1.1701 million, 1.001 million, and 0.435 million vehicles respectively, with year - on - year decreases of 12.13%, 14.45%, and 56.54% respectively; SAIC - GM - Wuling's sales volumes were 1.6 million, 1.4031 million, and 1.3401 million vehicles respectively, with year - on - year decreases of 3.62%, 12.31%, and 4.49% respectively.

With the significant decline in sales, General Motors initiated the restructuring of its Chinese business. In December 2024, General Motors announced that it would record a non - temporary impairment of $2.6 billion to $2.9 billion for its equity in Chinese joint - ventures, and recognize an additional equity loss of approximately $2.7 billion due to the implementation of the SAIC - GM restructuring plan. This part of the loss includes the impairment charges related to factory closures and portfolio optimization to be recognized by Chinese joint - ventures.

In the same month, SAIC Group announced that it would record asset impairment provisions of 23.212 billion yuan for SAIC - GM and its holding subsidiaries, including SAIC - GM Dongyue Automobile Co., Ltd., SAIC - GM (Shenyang) Beisheng Automobile Co., Ltd., and SAIC - GM Dongyue Power Assembly Co., Ltd. (i.e., Dongyue Factory) in the fourth quarter of 2024.

Due to the significant decline in sales in 2024 and the recording of asset impairment, SAIC - GM incurred losses. In 2024, SAIC - GM's revenue was 68.747 billion yuan, and its net profit attributable to the parent company was - 26.688 billion yuan; SAIC - GM - Wuling's revenue was 77.934 billion yuan, and its net profit attributable to the parent company was 1.045 billion yuan.

In addition to the restructuring, both SAIC - GM and SAIC - GM - Wuling have made management adjustments. Lu Xiao, the former executive deputy general manager of Pan Asia Technical Automotive Center, replaced Zhuang Jingxiong as the general manager of SAIC - GM. Xue Haitao, the former deputy general manager of SAIC - GM - Wuling, replaced Lu Yi as the deputy general manager of SAIC - GM.

After this adjustment, General Motors has given the Chinese management team greater autonomy in product definition and business decision - making. The two newly appointed managers, Lu Xiao, leads the product - side reform, and Xue Haitao is responsible for marketing.

Chinese Team Leads Electrification

Since the business restructuring, General Motors' electrification process in China has been accelerating, and the Buick brand has become the ""pioneer"" of the reform.

In February 2025, SAIC - GM's Buick brand officially adopted a new pricing model for new energy vehicles, becoming the first in the joint - venture camp to fully implement the ""fixed - price"" strategy, that is, a unified national price.

In April, Buick launched the new energy MPV, the Buick GL8 Lushang, with a starting price of 249,900 yuan. In August 2025, the new plug - in hybrid version of the Buick GL8 Avenir was launched, targeting the mid - to - large luxury new energy MPV market, with a price range of 339,900 to 399,900 yuan. According to media reports, after General Motors decentralized power to the Chinese team, the new plug - in hybrid version of the GL8 Avenir completed its replacement in 16 months, while previously, General Motors' iteration cycle was basically 36 months.

According to the electric vehicle sales ranking on Chezhuzhijia, in the first nine months of 2025, the Buick GL8 new energy vehicles sold 40,852 units, with an average monthly sales volume of about 4,539 units. In 2024, the cumulative sales of the Buick GL8 new energy vehicles were 23,056 units, with an average monthly sales volume of 1,921 units. Obviously, after the launch of new models led by the Chinese team, the sales of the Buick GL8 new energy vehicles have significantly increased.

It is worth mentioning that in April 2025, Buick launched its high - end new energy brand, Buick Zhijing, and released the new Buick ""Xiaoyao"" super - integrated architecture, which can support three full - body forms: MPV, SUV, and sedan, as well as three new energy technologies: pure - electric, plug - in hybrid, and range - extended. Buick also announced that starting from 2025, all new model line - ups launched by Buick in the Chinese market will be new energy vehicles; within the next two years, Buick will achieve full coverage of the main price segments of new energy vehicles.

Lu Xiao said that six Zhijing models will be launched in the market in the next 12 months. ""The goal of these new energy products is definitely to be profitable, and they will all be equipped with the new - generation intelligent cockpit and assisted - driving technologies."" ""By 2026, the sales of new energy vehicles of SAIC - GM will account for more than 50%, and by 2027, it will even reach 60%. All these new energy products must be profitable.""

In September, its first model, the Zhijing L7, was launched, targeting the mid - to - large range - extended sedan market, with an official starting price of 169,900 yuan. Buick officially announced that within 19 days of its launch, the number of firm orders exceeded 12,000 units.

Data shows that the Zhijing L7 is equipped with the ""Xiaoyao Zhixing"" assisted - driving system and the Momenta R6 Flywheel large - scale model based on end - to - end ""reinforcement learning"", which can provide full - scenario assisted - driving functions such as ""seamless"" urban NOA and ""one - key parking without stopping"". At the same time, in the new energy sedan market between 200,000 and 300,000 yuan, the range - extended segment remains a market gap, mainly consisting of pure - electric and fuel - powered vehicles. SAIC - GM plans to increase sales with the range - extended sedan, the Zhijing L7.

On October 20th, the Zhijing L7 started deliveries, and its current sales data is not yet known.

After the Chinese team took the lead, General Motors' electrification process in China has been accelerating. However, changes in the US market have also slowed down General Motors' overall electrification process. On October 14th, General Motors said in a regulatory filing that with a series of recent policy adjustments by the US government, including the termination of some consumer tax credits related to electric vehicle purchases and the relaxation of emission standards, it expects the penetration rate of electric vehicles in the US to slow down. At the same time, General Motors announced that it would record $1.6 billion in related expenses for re - evaluating its electric vehicle production capacity, of which $1.2 billion is for non - cash impairment and other expenses related to the adjustment of electric vehicle production capacity.

Through business restructuring, management reshuffle, and granting greater autonomy to the local team, General Motors' electrification process in China has significantly accelerated. The transformation of the Buick brand has initially shown results, especially the increase in the sales of the GL8 new energy vehicles and the launch of the Zhijing series, which demonstrate certain market potential. However, despite the continuous growth in sales and the improvement in profitability, whether General Motors can truly return to its peak still depends on its ability to continuously launch competitive products and achieve large - scale profitability in the fierce new energy competition.",https://img.36krcdn.com/hsossms/20251024/v2_c3d9353b578a4177b8367a1e5f582751@5888275@ai_oswg1048118oswg1053oswg495_img_png~tplv-1marlgjv7f-ai-v3:600:400:600:400:q70.jpg,N,,2025-10-24 19:19:11.446976

The project has elements of a ready-to-build acquisition, with the path to construction mostly cleared with a reported fully secured site control, clean title, and completed environmental and interconnection milestones.

A timely decision on the NTP will be key: Energy Vault also said it will safe harbor the asset with construction beginning on-site in Q4 2025, meaning it will aim to qualify the project for tax incentives under U.S. federal law by completing “significant” work or incurring at least 5% of total project.

Providing details of revenues, Energy Vault said it is in “advanced negotiations” with a counterparty for an eight-year offtake agreement, noting that the structure will be underwritten, and that the project is expected to deliver $17–20 million in annual revenues over the technical life of the project, or “$350 million in total.”

Asset Vault is backed by a $300 million preferred equity investment by Orion Infrastructure Capital (OIC), along with the “monetization of Federal Investment Tax Credit-related funds,” and is said to be dedicated to developing, building, owning and operating energy storage assets globally.

Robert Piconi, Chairman and CEO of Energy Vault, said, “The SOSA BESS is a strong addition to Energy Vault’s growing global portfolio of energy storage deployments, with top quartile project performance attributes consistent with all project acquisitions and development under the Asset Vault platform.”",https://www.ess-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/B-VAULT-Product-Overview-2048x1147-1.jpg,N,,2025-10-24 18:05:37.565352

A proposed annex on water delivery and trade compliance would treat water obligations as enforceable under USMCA chapter 24 of the environment.
There is the treaty of the Rio Grande and there is the Colorado treaty where the US delivers water to Mexico without fail.
Editor's Note: The above commentary formed part of the U.S.-Mexico Water Treaty discussion Dale Murden gave at a press conference hosted by the Texas International Produce Association","MISSION, Texas - I have been a longtime grower and water advocate in the valley and currently represent over 400 citrus growers as president of Texas Citrus Mutual. The purpose of today's press conference is to call on valley residents, city, county leaders, our farmers and ranchers to unite and urge the United States trade representatives to act in the upcoming USMCA review and tie the 1944 water treaty obligations through the trade act.

Linking the treaty to USMCA would make these obligations enforceable, finally allowing the United States to respond if Mexico fails to deliver. Water availability affects this region in every way. Whether it is regional growth, the economy, the environment, agriculture sustainability, or our community's health, we have for far too long traded with a partner in good faith that simply does not return that courtesy.

Over 6 million people rely on the Rio Grande for their daily water, including drinking, sanitation and public use. Reported repeated shortfalls by Mexico leave Valley City scrambling for emergency measures during droughts. Without guaranteed water, municipal systems cannot plan or invest for long-term reliability. Rio Grande is not just a water source, it is a living ecosystem. Reduced flows lead to dying wetlands. rising salinity, loss of fish and wildlife habitat. Healthy river systems mean cleaner water, stronger biodiversity and sustainable communities across the valley. By including the 1944 treaty under USMCA, the U.S. gains enforceable tools to protect both people and the environment through trade accountability.

A proposed annex on water delivery and trade compliance would treat water obligations as enforceable under USMCA chapter 24 of the environment. Protecting the river's flow is protecting the valley's health, welfare and future. Rio Grande is our lifeline. It is our drinking water. It is our wildlife habitat and the foundation of our health. When the river suffers, our communities do, too.

We want to encourage the public participation in the USTR comment process and highlight the importance of uniting the values of voice on water security and environmental protection. This is very important.

Whatever happens to us, happens to them on the Tamaulipas side. We are in it together really. It all stems from the Chihuahua State. There are two treaties. There is the treaty of the Rio Grande and there is the Colorado treaty where the US delivers water to Mexico without fail. We just want to see the same courtesy.

The risk to the taxpayer is nil,” Santee Cooper Board Chairman Peter McCoy said.
The permits to build and the licenses to operate the nuclear plants will need to be renewed, likely starting from scratch, Clements said.
Santee Cooper heard from 70 bidders and received 15 formal proposals to restart construction of the reactors.
“You have placed South Carolina in the epicenter of the resurgence of nuclear power in the United States,” Santee Cooper CEO Jimmy Staton said.","COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) — South Carolina's state-owned utility is looking to a private company to revive a project to build two nuclear power plants that was abandoned eight years ago, losing more than $9 billion without generating a watt of power.

Santee Cooper's board agreed Friday to start six weeks of negotiations with Brookfield Asset Management that they hope will lead to a deal that lets the private company build the nuclear plants at the V.C. Summer site near Jenkinsville at their own risk to generate power that they could mostly sell to whom they want, such as energy-gobbling data centers.

Santee Cooper said Brookfield preliminarily agreed to provide the utility with some of the power generated. But that and probably thousands of other details will have to be negotiated. In a twist, Brookfield took over the assets of Westinghouse Electric Co., which had to declare bankruptcy because of difficulties building new nuclear reactors.

Utility officials said the agreement gives hope the state can get something out of a debacle that led to four executives going to prison or home confinement for lying to regulators, shareholders, ratepayers and investigators and left millions of people paying for decades for a project that never produced electricity.

“The risk to the ratepayer is nil. The risk to the taxpayer is nil,” Santee Cooper Board Chairman Peter McCoy said.

There are still too many hurdles for the project to get past to consider this a win right now, said Tom Clements, executive director of the nuclear watchdog group Savannah River Site Watch.

After eight years in the elements, all the equipment and the structure of the plant, which was less than halfway finished, will need to be carefully inspected before it can be used. The permits to build and the licenses to operate the nuclear plants will need to be renewed, likely starting from scratch, Clements said.

“I still believe that the cost, technical and regulatory hurdles are too big to lead to completion of the project,” Clements said, adding the agreement appears to let Brookfield walk away if it decide it's not feasible.

Santee Cooper heard from 70 bidders and received 15 formal proposals to restart construction of the reactors. Interest in the project has grown as power demand in the U.S. surges with the increase in data centers as artificial intelligence technology develops.

Santee Cooper executives credited President Donald Trump's executive order in May calling for the U.S. to quadruple the amount of power generated by nuclear plants over the next 25 years for opening the door to the potential agreement.

“You have placed South Carolina in the epicenter of the resurgence of nuclear power in the United States,” Santee Cooper CEO Jimmy Staton said.

Santee Cooper was the minority partner with what was then South Carolina Electric and Gas when construction on the two new nuclear plants started in 2013 at the V.C. Summer site — about 25 miles (40 kilometers) northeast of Columbia — where SCE&G was already operating a reactor.

The project needed to be finished in seven years to get tax credits to keep the project's cost from overwhelming the utilities, but it ended up behind schedule almost immediately.

Executives lied about the problems to keep money coming in. Taxpayers and ratepayers ended up on the hook because of a state law that allowed the utilities to charge for costs before any power was generated.

Two nuclear reactors built in a similar way in Georgia went $17 billion over budget before they were fully operational in 2023.

SolarPower Europe submitted its position paper to the European Commission’s Call for Evidence on the ‘Revision of the EU Energy Security Framework’.

SolarPower Europe calls for a comprehensive strategy to strengthen Europe’s energy resilience

Europe has pioneered the adoption of the renewable energy sector. While some nations still rely on the traditional oil and gas sectors, like Australia, Europe is aiming to accelerate the transition to renewable energy, which has been on the cards for the past decade at least.

SolarPower Europe’s submission to the European Commission calls for the energy sector to move beyond fossil fuel supply and build energy security on solar, storage, flexibility, and electrification.

“Europe’s energy security strategy must evolve with its energy system. Energy security policies can no longer incentivise fossil fuel storage or imports. It must be built on renewables, flexibility, and electrification.” – Dries Acke, Deputy CEO of SolarPower Europe

Solar power and battery storage systems already play a vital role in Europe’s energy market, saving about $33 billion in fossil fuel imports in the summer of 2022 alone. By implementing measures that strengthen the renewable energy sector, Europe can potentially reduce its dependence on imported fossil fuels, which would protect consumers from price volatility in the energy market.

SolarPower Europe has suggested several measures to ensure energy security and stability

SolarPower Europe is a pioneering organization focused on the promotion of the renewable energy sector, with a particular importance placed on the solar power sector. The organization submitted a document to the European Commission outlining several measures that the EU could undertake to accelerate the transition to renewable energy sources. Among the suggestions are:

Unlock the full potential of the renewable energy sector in Europe: SolarPower Europe suggests measures to ensure solar, batteries, and inverters are allowed to provide flexible power to the European energy sector, balancing and grid stability services.

Establish a robust EU cybersecurity framework: Cybersecurity is not only important for protecting your emails and private information, but could also protect distributed energy systems and inverters in Europe through a variety of measures, including strict remote-control limitations and strong harmonized standards in the energy sector in Europe.

Build resilience against economic and climate issues: The EU should develop a flexible, decarbonized, renewables-based system that shields citizens from fluctuating energy prices due to geopolitical and climate change problems.

SolarPower Europe’s position paper could become the standard for the global energy sector to address the issues that have stagnated the adoption of renewable energy across the world. As Europe sees record-breaking solar projects being commissioned, the need to accelerate the transition to the energy sector has become more pressing than ever.

On Friday, Aclara Resources Inc. announced plans to build a $277 million facility at the Port of Vinton. The project will strengthen the nation's advanced technology supply chain, according to a Louisiana Economic Development news release.

At the new facility, Aclara will use its proprietary technology to produce heavy rare earth elements. These metals are necessary for electric vehicles, wind turbines, drones and robots that rely on advanced permanent magnets. The operation in Louisiana will process material from Aclara's mineral deposits in Brazil and Chile to provide a reliable, sustainable U.S. supply of these materials.

Aclara's Vinton facility will create roughly 140 new jobs, according to LED. The site at the port has been prequalified for industrial development through both environmental and engineering reviews.

Aclara chose the location after evaluating dozens of potential sites across the U.S. because of its proximity to key chemical suppliers, access to the Gulf Coast and its industrial workforce.

To secure the project, the state of Louisiana offered Aclara Resources an incentives package that includes LED's FastStart workforce development software and a $3 million performance-based grant for utility and infrastructure improvements.

""I actually spent the summer before my freshman year in college interning in a physics lab at Rice University,"" Han, now 50, told Houston Public Media. ""And then I went to college and realized that, actually, while I still find physics extremely interesting, that the kind of social-political world was so interesting to me that I wanted to figure out how to make sense of it in a different way.""

Now, Han is a Harvard and Stanford-educated professor of political science at Johns Hopkins University. She's also the recent recipient of the MacArthur Fellows Program, commonly referred to as the genius grant — an $800,000, no-strings-attached grant for researchers, educators, and artists.

The grant isn't limited to any single type of research or art. Previous recipients include author Matthew Desmond, Henry Louis Gates Jr., and Lin-Manuel Miranda.

Han’s recognition as a genius grant recipient is unique, as she’s the first political scientist to receive the grant since 2001.

""In the immediate moment, I was like, ‘Is this a prank?'"" Han said. ""And then, I think after it sort of sunk in for a little bit, I honestly was just really flabbergasted. It's such an incredible honor to be part of this cohort of other people who received the award.""

Much of Han's work focuses on activism and what drives it, which Han calls pulling people off the sidelines into public life. Her most recent book, ""Undivided: The Quest for Racial Solidarity in an American Church,"" discusses a Cincinnati megachurch focused on anti-racist work, was published in 2024.

""Even if it is a little bit cliche, it is true that one of the great things about places like Houston and Texas is that there’s a spirit of entrepreneurialism and independence, in which people just go out and seize good ideas and act on them,"" Han said. ""And I think that’s one thing that I’ve always carried with me, is the kind of courage to try different things, even if they don’t necessarily seem like they’re the most probable, or expected, thing to have done. And so that sort of independence of spirit is something that I think probably does come from growing up in a place like Houston.""

The company reported net income of $1.9 billion, down from $3.1 billion in the same period last year, amid rising costs and the expiration of key federal tax credits that had previously bolstered sales. This downturn underscores the challenges Tesla faces in a maturing EV market, where competition is intensifying and external incentives are waning.

Investors reacted swiftly, with Tesla’s stock dropping about 4% in after-hours trading following the announcement. Elon Musk, the company’s CEO, attempted to pivot attention during the earnings call toward future growth drivers like autonomous driving technology and robotics, but the immediate financials painted a picture of vulnerability. Revenue climbed to $25.2 billion, driven by a surge in vehicle deliveries—approximately 462,000 units—fueled by buyers rushing to capitalize on expiring $7,500 federal EV tax credits before year-end.

Navigating Post-Tax Credit Realities

Analysts noted that without these credits, Tesla’s core automotive margins would have been even slimmer. According to a report from Mashable, the company was “buoyed by tax credits and regulatory carbon credits—it can’t rely on either going forward.” This reliance highlights a broader issue: Tesla’s profitability has been propped up by one-time boosts, including $890 million in regulatory credits from selling emissions allowances to other automakers.

Higher operating expenses also weighed heavily, with costs jumping 17% due to investments in artificial intelligence infrastructure and research for next-generation vehicles. Musk emphasized during the call that these expenditures are essential for long-term dominance, pointing to advancements in Full Self-Driving software and the Optimus humanoid robot as potential revenue streams. Yet, skeptics argue that such bets remain speculative, with regulatory hurdles for robotaxis still unresolved.

Revenue Growth Amid Profit Squeeze

Despite the profit miss—earnings per share came in at $0.72, below Wall Street’s $0.78 estimate—Tesla achieved its highest quarterly revenue ever, as detailed in coverage from CNBC. This was partly attributed to strong sales in the U.S., where the tax credit deadline spurred demand for models like the Model Y and Model 3. Internationally, however, growth was uneven, with softening demand in Europe and China amid economic headwinds and rising competition from local players like BYD.

The energy storage segment provided a bright spot, with deployments reaching a record 6.9 gigawatt-hours, contributing $2.4 billion in revenue. This diversification is crucial as Tesla shifts focus beyond pure EV sales, but it wasn’t enough to offset the automotive segment’s margin compression, which fell to 17.3% from 18.1% a year ago.

Future Bets and Investor Sentiment

Looking ahead, Musk outlined ambitious plans, including expanding robotaxi services by year’s end and launching more affordable models in 2026. As reported by Electrek, despite the earnings decline, Tesla’s leadership remains optimistic about scaling production and AI integration. However, with tariffs on imported components adding pressure—evident in a $200 million hit this quarter—the path forward demands operational efficiency.

Industry insiders view this quarter as a pivot point. Tesla’s valuation, still lofty at over 60 times forward earnings, hinges on executing these moonshot initiatives. Business Insider highlighted Musk’s comments on future products during the call, noting stock volatility as investors weigh immediate profits against visionary promises. For now, the profit plunge serves as a reminder that even Tesla isn’t immune to market cycles, pushing the company to innovate faster or risk losing its edge in an increasingly crowded field.

Strategic Implications for the EV Sector

Broader implications ripple through the auto industry. Rivals like Ford and General Motors are ramping up their EV offerings, often with more accessible pricing, while Tesla grapples with price cuts that have eroded margins. The expiration of tax credits could level the playing field, forcing Tesla to compete on merits like technology and brand loyalty alone.",https://www.webpronews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/xai-tmp-imgen-77bcdfaa-d8f2-4725-a64b-6f77a747eac3.jpeg,N,,2025-10-24 15:18:46.764779

Sign up to get it every Friday.

Energy affordability has become a flash point over the past few months. It’s a key issue in this year’s gubernatorial races. It’s something President Donald Trump has promised to fix by boosting fossil-fuel production. And of course, it’s showing up in the bills that arrive in mailboxes every month.

Three-quarters of Americans count electricity costs as a source of stress in their lives, according to a new Associated Press-NORC survey. But a recent study from the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory provides more nuance to the conversation. When adjusted for inflation, 31 continental states actually saw their power prices decline from 2019 to 2024, while the other 17 states experienced increases.

One reason why some states saw prices jump? Utility spending on disaster recovery and preparedness. Take California, where utilities have added billions of dollars in wildfire-recovery costs and mitigation programs to retail electricity prices in recent years, the national lab found. It’s a bracing fact as the planet warms and disasters become more frequent and destructive.

But the report also tempered fears that the growth of data centers and other power-hungry industries will jack up electricity prices. Grid maintenance has been a top driver of increased electricity costs over the last few years, but spreading these expenses among more customers — like data centers and manufacturers — has helped lower retail electricity prices, researchers found. One caveat: That dynamic tends to benefit large, commercial consumers more than residential ones.

The Trump administration has elevated fossil fuels as a solution to rising electricity bills, positing that more coal and gas power can cut prices. But building a new gas-fired plant is increasingly expensive and takes years, and the U.S. is preparing to ship more liquefied natural gas out of the country anyway.

If you look at two rare examples of power utilities reducing their rates, it’s clear that falling back on coal isn’t the answer either. In Oregon, Idaho Power Co. has asked regulators to lower electricity prices by nearly 1%, saying the closure of a coal-fired power unit and demolition of another coal plant have brought down costs. And in Virginia, where a state law is pushing the electricity sector to lower emissions, Appalachian Power cited the addition of renewable power in its request to lower rates. West Virginia is meanwhile pushing to keep its coal plants running — a move that Appalachian Power said would raise prices for its electricity customers in that state.

But putting the national lab’s inflation-adjusted numbers aside, it’s clear that rising utility bills are reaching a fever pitch across the country — and it’s going to take both more clean energy and smarter utility regulation to rein them in.

Trump sinks a global shipping-decarbonization plan

Until a few weeks ago, the International Maritime Organization was on track to approve a global shipping-decarbonization strategy. That is, until the Trump administration launched a last-minute offensive and got the United Nations body to delay adoption of the plan, Maria Gallucci and Dan McCarthy reported late last week.

The tens of thousands of shipping vessels that travel the oceans are responsible for about 3% of the world’s annual greenhouse gas emissions. But as Maria points out in her follow-up dive into shipping decarbonization, the industry doesn’t currently have much incentive to replace dirty diesel-powered vessels with lower-carbon alternatives.

Some good news, some bad news for U.S. battery startups

The U.S. Department of Energy slashed another wave of federal funding this week, targeting $700 million in grants for battery and other clean manufacturing projects. Nearly half of that funding had been awarded to Ascend Elements, which had already canceled a portion of its planned battery-recycling facility in Kentucky earlier this year. A smaller portion was going to American Battery Technology Co., which said it will carry on with its lithium mine and refinery project in Nevada.

But it wasn’t a bad week for every battery company. Redwood Materials raised $350 million, which it’ll use to expand its unique energy-storage business that packages together used EV batteries into grid-scale resources that can power data centers and other industrial users. And Pila Energy raised $4 million to keep building batteries that provide backup power to large appliances, but are more affordable and portable than whole-home systems like the Tesla Powerwall.

The United States’ position as a dominant energy exporter was made possible by the fracking boom that transformed its production landscape.
Expanding fossil fuel infrastructure contradicts international commitments to reduce emissions and could delay the global transition toward renewable energy sources.
Long-term LNG contracts could also limit the flexibility of importing nations to adapt to technological and policy shifts aimed at decarbonization.
As the global energy landscape evolves, the US approach represents both a test of traditional alliances and a potential obstacle to the clean energy transition that many economies are now pursuing.","The United States is leveraging trade and defense relationships to expand long-term fossil fuel exports, reshaping global energy partnerships and signaling a new phase of energy diplomacy that prioritizes liquefied natural gas (LNG) over renewable cooperation. The strategy, driven by the Trump administration, seeks to secure decades-long contracts with allies in Europe and Asia, locking in demand for US fossil fuels and reinforcing Washington’s influence in global energy markets.

Under the new policy framework, the European Union has committed to importing up to US$1.15 trillion in US energy, primarily LNG, by 2028, which would represent more than four times its current import levels. Indonesia has signed deals worth approximately US$24 billion, while Japan is exploring similar agreements. These deals are less about free trade and more about geopolitical leverage, as the United States uses trade access and security assurances to encourage dependence on its energy exports.

The United States’ position as a dominant energy exporter was made possible by the fracking boom that transformed its production landscape. By 2019, the country had become a net exporter of oil and gas, and in 2023, it surpassed Qatar and Australia as the world’s top LNG supplier.

For emerging and industrial economies, this US strategy poses both opportunities and risks. While LNG imports offer a short-term solution to energy security challenges, they also carry financial and environmental costs. The construction of new LNG terminals and gas-fired power plants can tie countries to fossil fuel use for decades, potentially diverting investment from renewable energy and electrification. Analysts warn that this approach could make participating economies less competitive over time, given the rapid decline in renewable energy costs and the increasing affordability of battery storage technologies.

In Latin America, and particularly in Mexico, the implications of US energy diplomacy are significant. Mexico’s current energy policy prioritizes domestic production and energy sovereignty, but US export growth could challenge those ambitions by increasing competition in regional markets. Additionally, higher US tariffs imposed on India for continuing to purchase Russian energy demonstrate Washington’s willingness to use trade pressure to align partners with its energy objectives, a move that could influence future trade and energy decisions in Mexico and other American partners.

Critics of the US strategy argue that it risks undermining global climate objectives. Expanding fossil fuel infrastructure contradicts international commitments to reduce emissions and could delay the global transition toward renewable energy sources. Long-term LNG contracts could also limit the flexibility of importing nations to adapt to technological and policy shifts aimed at decarbonization.

For countries evaluating new energy partnerships, including those in Latin America and Asia, the challenge lies in balancing short-term supply security with long-term sustainability.

The global solar industry is putting up the clean kilowatts at a record pace, the latest example being a supersized 1-gigawatt solar-plus-storage project in the United Arab Emirates, aimed at delivering solar energy on a reliable, baseload-worthy, 24/7 basis. To gild the green lily, the system is designed to be copied all over the world, pushing fossil fuels out of the power generation picture. Meanwhile, US President Donald Trump has been pouring all his energy into…building a ballroom. Yes, a ballroom.

The Global Solar Industry Rocketing Upwards

To be fair, building a ballroom sounds like lots of fun, and President Trump could use a break from a very busy year. He has been working nonstop for months, particularly in regards to the US offshore wind industry. After all, it takes a lot of effort to torpedo an entire domestic industry, and there are still some remaining shreds of activity to stomp on.

So much for the US offshore wind industry. Onshore wind and solar activity have also suffered setbacks under Trump’s “American Energy Dominance” plan. Even so, the facts don’t lie. The International Renewable Energy Agency affirms the verifiable fact that wind and solar are the most affordable, accessible, and economically beneficial energy resources available today.

The global solar industry has been particularly adept at picking up the pace of renewable energy. “Solar generation grew by 306 TWh (+31%) in the first half of 2025, its fastest absolute growth on record,” the energy data platform Ember notes.

“If this pace continues, solar is on track to remain the fastest-growing source of electricity for the 21st consecutive year and to outpace wind growth in absolute terms for the fourth year in a row,” the organization adds.

The UAE Solar Industry Blows A Giant Raspberry At US President Trump

Facts, schmacts. President Trump exercises power by enforcing his own alternate reality, drilled into the collective consciousness of the public with laser-sharp precision across his Cabinet. US Interior Secretary Doug Burgum, for example, has declared that that energy storage does not even exist. Agriculture Secretary Sue Rollins can’t tell the difference between solar panels and buildings. Energy Secretary Chris Wright has also registered his two cents, insisting that “[w]ind and solar energy infrastructure is essentially worthless when it is dark outside, and the wind is not blowing.”

Into this picture steps the United Arab Emirates. A seven-member federation of powerful oil and gas producers, the UAE nevertheless served as host of the 28th United Nations Conference of Parties on climate change. Taking place in UAE member Dubai in 2023, COP28 produced the UAE Consensus, described as “an unprecedented reference to transitioning away from all fossil fuels in energy systems, in a just, orderly and equitable manner in this critical decade to enable the world to reach net zero emissions by 2050, in keeping with the science.”

As if to drag President Trump along with Secretaries Burgum, Rollins, and Wright all in one blow, earlier today the UAE announced that energy storage actually does exist in space and time, and it is coming to drink your fossil fuel milkshake.

“UAE Breaks Ground on World’s First Gigascale Round-the-Clock Renewable Energy Project, Setting a New Global Standard For Clean Energy,” reads the headline of a press statement circulated earlier today by Masdar, the UAE’s sustainable energy showcase company, referring to the 5.2 gigawatt solar power plant integrated with a BESS (battery energy storage system) of 19 gigawatt-hours in the $6 billion project.

In case anyone over in the White House (or, what’s left of it) missed the message, Masdar emphasizes that the the project delivers the exact same baseload reliability championed by Trump’s “American Energy Dominance policy.” The company states that the project will deliver 1 gigawatt of “baseload renewable energy around the clock.”

Global Solar Industry To US: You Ain’t Seen Nothing Yet

In the press statement announcing the new project, the entire UAE did all but point and laugh at US President Donald Trump and his reality-denying appointees.

“Masdar and Emirates Water and Electricity Company (EWEC), reimagines the potential of renewable energy by overcoming the barrier of intermittency,” Masdar explains.

“By producing gigascale baseload energy at a globally competitive tariff for the first time, the project sets a new international benchmark and reaffirms the UAE’s leadership position in renewable energy development,” the firm explains again.

Twisting the knife just a little bit more, Masdar also affirms that the system is designed with the global solar industry in mind, stating that “the project will act as a blueprint that can be replicated internationally to meet the growing demand for clean, secure, round-the-clock power.”

The company’s CEO, Mohamed Jameel Al Ramahi, also chipped in his two cents regarding the baseload-worthiness of solar energy. He described the project as “a blueprint for the world, demonstrating that renewable energy can be dispatched around the clock.”

Ballroom-Builder Casts The US Solar Industry Aside

To gild the green lily with yet another layer of green, Masdar’s new project also demonstrates that the global solar industry can deliver electricity faster, and more economically, than any other energy industry. Masdar expects the facility to be operation by 2027, which is just around the corner.

In terms of government support, Masdar further notes that the project has the enthusiastic endorsement of UAE policy makers at the highest level, including His Highness Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, President of the UAE, and His Highness Sheikh Khaled bin Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, Crown Prince of Abu Dhabi and Chairman of the Abu Dhabi Executive Council.

Their Highnesses! No wonder President Trump is obsessed with the construction of an enormous ballroom on the grounds of the White House. He can’t claim the title of “His Highness,” but he can build a glitzy, gold-drenched ballroom worthy of the finest palaces in the world.

If the ballroom ever gets built, that is. So far, the project has only employed a smattering of demolition experts, who demolished the entire East Wing of the White House in short order.

Meanwhile, Masdar notes that its new 1-gigawatt renewable energy project alone will generate 10,000 new jobs for the UAE, factoring in component manufacturing jobs and service jobs along with the actual construction work, while supporting the UAE goals of economic diversification leadership in the AI sector, too.

The outlook is somewhat gloomier for the US solar industry and related jobs in energy storage, manufacturing, and the like. Still, Trump has a long way to go before he can completely snuff out the demand for electricity. The wind will keep blowing and the sun will keep shining long after Trump leaves office as scheduled on January 20, 2029 — peacefully one hopes, this time.

Solar developers in the US are already gearing up for a fresh burst of activity in the years following. That includes the US branch of Masdar, which has expressed a target of 25 gigawatts in the US over the next 10 years. The company states that it already has a 5.8-gigawatt US renewable energy portfolio under its belt.

Reform are threatening to rip up investment agreements with companies and put thousands of good jobs at risk. The Greens say they support the energy transition, yet seem to oppose every renewable and clean tech project which might help us achieve it.

But the time for posturing is over, we need to deliver, recognising that this window of opportunity is vital, but finite.

That is why, since our election last year, our Labour government has overturned the de facto onshore wind ban in England, kickstarted the solar rooftop revolution, delivered a record-breaking renewables auction, and set up GB Energy, a publicly-owned national energy company.

We have embarked on the most significant programme of clean energy, climate, and nature investment in British history.

We will work in partnership with industry and trade unions to help workers in all parts of the country benefit, supporting our existing workforce find new opportunities, and training up the next generation by setting up five new clean energy Technical Excellence Colleges.

Earlier this year, I was delighted to welcome the Prime Minister to Ipswich as he gave green light to Sizewell C, ending years of dithering and delay, and turbocharging the project with £14.2bn in government investment.

Sizewell C is a crucial piece of national infrastructure, powering six million homes with consistent and reliable energy, and providing our country with greater energy security.

For us here in Ipswich and Suffolk, the project is even more vital than that.

Thousands of skilled, secure, well-paid jobs will be created for local people, and huge levels of new investment will flow into our economy, with local businesses helping to deliver one of the country’s first nuclear stations since Sizewell B was completed three decades ago. It is something to be really proud of.

Last autumn, I negotiated and signed an agreement with Sizewell C which guarantees at least 500 jobs for our town, alongside the thousands being created for people across our county and our region.

It also expands Suffolk New College’s engineering, welding and fabrication courses, helping young people in our town not just access decent employment during the construction of Sizewell C, but to build a career for life, and access the security, dignity and the opportunity that comes with it.

It is not right that so many young people have been forced to leave behind the place they grew up in, and the deep connections that come with it, just to find a decent job.

It is not good enough to simply talk about ambition for young people, without providing them with the opportunities and pathways to meet them.

I am determined to change all of that, and working with the government, we are investing in a new future for our town and county. I want every talented and dedicated young person growing up in our town to access a Our future are skilled, secure, well-paid job.

As of August 27, 2025, Illinois Pollution Control Board expanded its hazardous waste rules to include paint and paint-related waste as universal waste.

Manufacturers selling architectural paint in the state must run stewardship programs to collect leftover products.

The change makes managing oil-based paints easier by placing them under the universal waste framework. This affects paint producers, retailers, and facilities handling paint disposal.

The new system reduces compliance burdens while promoting safer and more consistent paint waste management.

On September 12, 2025, in the Illinois Register, the Pollution Control Board adopted changes to hazardous waste rules to align with two recent state laws.

The Paint Stewardship Act requires manufacturers of architectural paint sold at retail to create and operate post-consumer stewardship programs. Another law allows oil-based paints to be collected and managed as universal waste.

What changed

The Illinois Environmental Protection Agency (IEPA) proposed amendments to add paint and paint-related waste (PPRW) to the existing list of universal wastes. This list already includes batteries, pesticides, mercury equipment, lamps, certain household wastes, and very small generator wastes. By adding PPRW, Illinois makes paint waste subject to the same streamlined requirements that apply to these other universal wastes.

Impact on companies

Paint manufacturers and retailers must participate in stewardship programs, ensuring leftover architectural paints are collected and managed.

Waste facilities and businesses handling paint benefit from simpler compliance rules under the universal waste system.

Instead of full hazardous waste management obligations, they can follow the lighter requirements already applied to other universal wastes.

The change encourages more consistent collection and disposal of leftover paints, reducing risks of improper handling.

Deadlines and enforcement

The law required IEPA to propose rules within 60 days of its effective date, and the Board had 180 days after receiving the proposal to adopt them. These steps have now been completed. The Pollution Control Board enforces the rules, and companies must comply with the new requirements as of September 12, 2025.

Reason for the change

The goal is to make paint disposal safer, easier, and more environmentally sound. Paint stewardship programs shift responsibility to producers, while the universal waste classification reduces administrative burdens for businesses and improves collection efficiency.

Compliance support

Companies can refer to Illinois Pollution Control Board guidance and IEPA resources on universal waste management for detailed instructions on how to set up paint stewardship programs and meet the new requirements.

Cardinal & Pine: Why some politicians might literally be making you sicker

In 2023, the head of the EPA called PFAS “one of the most pressing environmental and public health concerns in the modern world.” PFAS takes a long, long time to break down in nature, or in your body, and they’re linked to cancer, birth defects, thyroid and liver issues, immune system deficiencies and a lot more.

Testing at Seymour Johnson found PFAS concentrations on levels thousands of times beyond EPA’s health advisory level…

Many parts of the federal government are undergoing big budget cuts this year under President Trump. Because of that, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has quietly delayed the cleanup at Seymour Johnson by five years, according to the New York Times.

For years, Whatley, the former head of the North Carolina GOP and the Republican National Committee, was a lobbyist for oil and gas companies, pushing back against government regulations. It doesn’t really track that he’d do that and be a crusader for regulating and cleaning up PFAS, right?

Whatley’s been an enthusiastic supporter of the President’s administration, and earlier this year called Elon Musk and DOGE’s Budget Cuts, quote, “vital”.

You rarely get to say without hyperbole that some candidates are taking a position that would actively poison you. But that’s not farfetched when it comes to PFAS.

This market-driven innovation increased the supply – and subsequently drove down the costs – of natural gas.
As the energy generation mix shifted towards natural gas and other technologies, coal’s downstream consumption and production subsequently declined.
This downstream effect stands in stark contrast to the needs of the energy sector, which needs significantly more capital investment to keep up with our energy infrastructure.
Ultimately addressing the expected growth in electricity demand will require more capital investment in energy production, transportation, and infrastructure.","The U.S. energy grid stands at a crossroads. It is facing an unprecedented rise in electricity demand driven in no small part by the growth of artificial intelligence and high-tech manufacturing. Simultaneously, supply is being curtailed by growing power plant retirements. It doesn’t take an advanced degree in economics to foresee the consequences.

Policy makers are scrambling for answers before the inevitable power shortages and skyrocketing prices kick in. But for every potential solution that would ease the grid’s strain – keeping plants online, expediting permitting reviews and cutting bureaucratic red tape – policy actions are being taken that would damage energy industries’ ability to attract and utilize capital investment.

Last year, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) considered and then held off on changing its long standing blanket authorization policy for investment firms. The current rule requires investment firms to receive FERC approval for purchasing a utility company’s securities only when acquiring more than $10 million worth. The commission was contemplating whether this so-called blanket authorization level is too generous. Of particular concern were investment managers’ passive investment strategies – think index funds – that require these investors to continue allocate a set percentage of their assets into utilities and energy companies.

Increasing the stringency of the blanket authorization would have adversely impacted the U.S. energy industry. At the time, I warned that creating “additional investment barriers” would hurt utilities’ ability “to raise the necessary capital,” hindering their ability to “expand capacity and improve the current energy infrastructure.”

Thankfully the FERC agreed. As then-FERC Chairman Mark Christie wrote, while BlackRock’s environmental advocacy raises concerns, “public utilities face already large and still growing capital needs, including to fund investment in greatly needed utility assets, such as power generation.” Given these capital needs, and BlackRock’s pledge “not to use its holdings to influence utility management,” extending BlackRock’s blanket authorization will help ensure the utility sector has access to the resources it needs to continue expanding the grid’s capacity

Having just dodged that bullet, a new threat to increased energy investment threatens to do the same – a lawsuit led by the Attorney General of Texas. The lawsuit alleges Vanguard, BlackRock, and State Street conspired to artificially depress the coal market through anti-competitive practices.

The lawsuit is a response to these investment manager’s investments in coal companies given their public support and past membership in these same environmental organizations, which are promoting policies that are detrimental to the coal industry. As I have previously argued, the asset manager’s support of these environmental, social, and governance (ESG) policies is troubling and creates significant conflicts of interest between the asset managers fiduciary responsibilities and their ESG commitments.

However, in practice, the AG actions will simply restrict the coal industry’s ability to raise capital – clearly contradicting the AG’s stated purpose. As the FERC decision emphasizes, prioritizing the need for an efficient allocation of capital is essential if the U.S. grid is going to deliver Americans cheap and plentiful electricity.

The lawsuit also fails to account for fundamental market changes created by the fracking revolution. This market-driven innovation increased the supply – and subsequently drove down the costs – of natural gas. Relatively cheaper and lower-emission natural gas radically changed the economics of electricity generation. It is mostly thanks to relatively cheaper natural gas that coal operations have decreased across the country.

In 2005, coal was the largest source for electricity, generating about 50 percent of the nation’s electricity. Natural gas generated roughly 19 percent. Over the latest 12 months, natural gas accounted for 42 percent of total generation while coal accounted for a mere 16 percent; their shares of electricity generation have swapped. This reversal of generation share was fostered by over 100 coal-fired plants that were converted to, or replaced by, natural gas-fired plants between 2011 and 2019. As the energy generation mix shifted towards natural gas and other technologies, coal’s downstream consumption and production subsequently declined.

Although Attorney General Paxton claims to be protecting the coal industry, if the lawsuit is successful these investment firms would likely be forced to divest their holdings in the coal companies listed in the suit. This forced liquidation will deny the coal industry access to a significant source of capital. According to an analysis by the American Council for Capital Formation’s chief economist, the forced divestments would deny the collective coal industry more than $17.5 billion in capital. This downstream effect stands in stark contrast to the needs of the energy sector, which needs significantly more capital investment to keep up with our energy infrastructure.

Ultimately addressing the expected growth in electricity demand will require more capital investment in energy production, transportation, and infrastructure. Cutting off investment sources – whether through FERC rule making or AG lawsuits – increases the likelihood of future blackouts and higher costs for consumers. If the goal is to promote widespread prosperity, such actions are simply the wrong policy path.",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/68fba7d5bae96cef5245b749/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,N,,2025-10-24 14:08:00.328502

High energy costs are choking America’s potential.

They’re not just raising our utility bills — they are raising the price of everything: groceries, gas, housing, and the American Dream itself.

If energy drives prosperity, federal energy policies restrict it.

Americans for Prosperity is working to change federal energy policy to unleash American energy independence through its “Prosperity Is Possible” campaign.

This includes a “Road to Prosperity” tour stop at the Montana Energy Summit, hosted by Gov. Greg Gianforte and the Montana Chamber of Commerce.

High energy costs and rising frustration

Families are tightening budgets.

Businesses are delaying investments.

And it’s not because we lack resources. It’s because we’re not allowed to use them.

The United States sits on vast reserves of energy, yet prices stay high because bureaucracy blocks production.

In fact, permitting delays due to restrictive federal energy policies place $4.5 billion in customer savings and 150,000 American jobs at risk.

Every new layer of regulation adds costs, slows innovation, and puts American workers on the sidelines.

A maze of red tape

For decades, Washington has piled layers of rules that stall prosperity.

Because of these federal policies and subsequent lawsuits, challenging approvals have resulted in:

Energy projects that take five to 10 years just for approval, due to unclear and inconsistent permitting requirements

Efficient plants like Montana’s Colstrip power plant facing shutdowns because of arbitrary EPA rules

American energy lagging behind countries which are modernizing their review processes to shorten timelines and attract investment American energy lagging behind countries that are modernizing their review processes to shorten timelines and attract investment

Americans for Prosperity in Montana shows what’s possible

“Montana fuels America — and America needs Montana,” said AFP–Montana State Director Jesse Ramos. “Here’s the truth: If we get energy, work, and innovation policy right, Montana can lead the next American energy renaissance.”

Voices in Montana made it clear: Independence is possible if government gets out of the way.

Ramos told a story that cut straight to the heart:

Libby, Montana, a once-proud timber town, was silenced, not by exhaustion of resources but by D.C. regulations.

“The mill didn’t close because we ran out of trees,” Ramos said. “It closed because Washington decided it knew better.”

“The day the mill closed, men sat in their trucks, staring at the ground. They weren’t losing their paycheck, they were losing their purpose.”

The Montana Energy Summit brought together industry leaders, legislators, and innovators who were determined to make sure towns like Libby have strong futures.

The panels and speakers explored what real reform could look like, including:

Permitting reform that turns decade-long reviews into decisions made in months, so projects like the Montanore Mine, first proposed in the 1980s, can finally move forward.

Modernizing the grid to prevent rolling blackouts, especially in winters when negative-30-degree temperatures can make blackouts deadly. Modernizing the grid to prevent rolling blackouts, especially in winters when minus-30 temperatures can make blackouts deadly.

Balancing stewardship and strength, letting Montanans manage their forests and resources responsibly instead of letting them burn.

Diversifying energy innovation, from advanced nuclear to clean coal and projects that harness local ingenuity, not federal mandates.

Reclaiming dignity in work by ensuring Montana’s loggers, miners, and engineers can once again earn respect by building the backbone of American energy.

Across every panel, one truth echoed:

Fewer federal energy restrictions result in American abundance.

Clear the path and let Americans embrace energy independence

It isn’t just in Montana.

You see it.

All over the country, Americans must make tough decisions when energy costs go up.

Luckily, the solution is remarkably simple.

Washington must let innovators and builders … innovate and build, instead of burying them in paperwork. This will allow everyday people to embrace the American Dream and thrive.

This is possible if Congress:

Passes permitting reform and streamlines decisions in the permitting process

Modernizes infrastructure and expands the grid to keep up with the demands of electric energy and AI expansions

Trusts workers on the ground to protect the land and build a sustainable future

Allows for an all-of-the-above energy strategy, allowing states and localities to embrace energy that makes sense for them

Take action: Tell Congress to work on energy independence and reduce federal energy policies

Our Prosperity Is Possible campaign is rallying citizens all over the country to tell Congress: enough with delays and red tape.Our Prosperity Is Possible campaign is rallying citizens all over the country to tell Congress: Enough with delays and red tape.

In addition to restoring dignity and keeping energy prices low, this is about ensuring America remains a leader in the global energy race and keeps prosperity within reach for every American family.

PowerTransitions has been talking with local officials and has an agreement in place with the owner of the Vernon property, NorthStar Group Services, to potentially lease the site.

Vermont Public Service Commissioner Kerrick Johnson has requested a meeting with the company to get more details on its proposal to develop the approximately 140 acres along the Connecticut River in Windham County.

“Once I became aware that there is a relationship between PowerTransitions and NorthStar, in our role to advocate on behalf of all Vermont ratepayers, this is a part of our departmental due diligence,” Johnson said.

Johnson said any consideration of siting a project in Vernon would have to take into account the high-level nuclear waste that is being stored near the former nuclear power plant.

“The site in Vernon has strengths and weaknesses,” Johnson said. “The high-level radioactive waste has to be viewed as something that has to be respected and avoided at all costs.”

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, on its website, says battery storage systems “have raised legitimate safety concerns,” because they can catch fire and release harmful gases that pose health risks to nearby residents and first responders.

A representative from the company has been meeting with the Vernon Planning Commission about the plan.

“It’s got our interest,” said Vernon Planning Commission Chair Jim Pinkerton. “At this point this is kind of back-of-the-envelope sort of thing, but the demand for power is increasing all over the place, and there’s no telling where those industries are going to go.”

PowerTransitions first contacted NorthStar about two years ago, according to NorthStar CEO Scott State.

PowerTransitions acquires operating and retired power generation and industrial facilities, according to the company’s website, to “transform them into modern, resilient energy infrastructure campuses.”

State said he introduced the PowerTransitions officials to the town of Vernon, adding that it is still NorthStar’s intention to, “allow redevelopment of the site for a use preferred by the town of Vernon.”

NorthStar acquired the closed Vermont Yankee nuclear power plant in 2019, becoming the first company in the United States to own a nuclear facility with the intention of dismantling and decommissioning the property.

Since then, NorthStar has removed more than 76,000 tons of material, much of which is low-level radioactive waste, that has been shipped to a storage facility in Texas.

What losing the credits means for Vermonters Everyone receiving credits will pay more for healthcare if the enhanced credits expire.
Conclusion While the enhanced credits do not expire until the end of the year, the enrollment period for 2026 begins on Nov. 1.","Public Assets Institute(link is external) One of the main issues at stake in the federal government shutdown is the expiration of enhanced healthcare premium tax credits, which help people buy insurance through the state marketplace. If Congress does nothing, the credits will expire at the end of 2025, and millions of Americans will see large increases in the cost of their healthcare.

Among these are as many as 30,000 Vermonters. And because Vermont’s exchange has the highest premiums in the country, Vermonters will see the biggest increases. Middle-income participants are looking at an additional $10,000 a year for an individual and $32,000 for a family of four.

How the credits work

Vermont’s health insurance marketplace launched in 2014 as part of the Affordable Care Act of 2010 (ACA). The goal was to provide access to affordable health insurance to consumers who can’t get it through work or public programs. The ACA requires every state to operate an exchange with multiple qualified health plans(link is external) and helps cover the cost of the premiums.

Taxpayers using the exchange receive federal premium tax credits (PTCs), which are based on the cost of the benchmark silver plan and are often paid directly to the insurer.1(link is external) Recipients pay a percentage of their income toward the premium, on a sliding income scale, and the PTC covers the rest.

The 2021 American Rescue Plan Act—enacted to help people weather the financial insecurity of the pandemic—enhanced the PTCs for 2021 and 2022(link is external) by providing larger subsidies to eligible households and expanding the number of households eligible. The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 then extended the enhanced benefits through 2025.

The enhanced credits cover the full cost of the silver benchmark premium for those earning less than 150 percent of the federal poverty level. They decrease the cost for those between 150 and 400 percent of poverty and expand assistance to people with incomes over 400 percent of poverty.

Vermont is one of a handful of states that provide additional assistance(link is external) with the cost of premiums, targeted at those under 300 percent of the federal poverty level. It also provides assistance(link is external) to lower out-of-pocket costs for services.

Who gets them, and how much

In 2025, over 30,000 Vermonters on the exchange received an estimated total of $350 million to help cover the cost of care. Most of these funds come from federal tax credits, including at least $65 million(link is external) from the enhanced credits. Vermont provides just under 2 percent of the assistance ($6.2 million). Participants range across income and age; a third are between 55 to 64 years old.

Over 90 percent of exchange participants qualify for federal subsidies, and about a third receive the additional state support. The average federal credit for Vermonters is $11,400. That’s a big increase over 2015, before the enhanced credits took effect. Then, 22,500 Vermont recipients received an average credit of $3,300. Much of the increase occurred in 2024 and 2025, after the temporary pandemic expansion of Medicaid ended.

What losing the credits means for Vermonters

Everyone receiving credits will pay more for healthcare if the enhanced credits expire. Those with incomes under 400 percent of poverty would pay between 0.5 percent and 4.6 percent more of their income for the benchmark plan, after accounting for state assistance. Middle-income Vermonters, earning more than 400 percent of poverty, would no longer receive assistance. They would pay the full cost of their premiums if they continue to buy healthcare on the exchange.

Because Vermont has the highest premiums in the country and some of the fastest growth in costs in recent years, Vermonters will be hit particularly hard. An individual making $63,000 would pay $15,000 a year for the benchmark plan—nearly a quarter of their income. A family of four at the same poverty level could see an increase of over $30,000 a year.

Conclusion

While the enhanced credits do not expire until the end of the year, the enrollment period for 2026 begins on Nov. 1. Vermonters looking to enroll will be facing serious sticker shock. In the absence of federal action, many states are considering how to fill the gap and ensure healthcare access for their residents. With the highest hikes in the country, Vermont must take action to ensure access to care and to bring down its cost.

Without action, many Vermonters will be priced out of healthcare on January 1, 2026.

Both the base and enhanced federal premium tax credits are calculated to cover only as much as the cost of the benchmark silver plan.

Texas Insider Report WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today marks Day 24 of the federal government shutdown. I was in Washington this week, working to get the government reopened. The House has already passed a Continuing Resolution (CR) to fund the government at previously approved levels while negotiations on long-term appropriations continue. Unfortunately, Senate Democrats have refused to act, choosing instead to hold up government funding in exchange for extending costly COVID-era Obamacare subsidies, a policy that should be debated separately, not tied to basic government operations. These subsidies, known as the Affordable Care Act’s enhanced premium tax credits, were originally enacted as temporary pandemic relief under the American Rescue Plan Act and later extended by the Inflation Reduction Act.

The Congressional Budget Office recently estimated that permanently extending them would add $350 billion to the deficit over ten years, plus another $60 billion in interest costs, a total of nearly $500 billion in new spending. Much of that money benefits wealthy households and insurance companies, not working Americans in need. Instead of focusing on fiscal responsibility and reining in inflationary spending, Democrats are holding the government hostage over a pandemic-era subsidy that allows individuals earning nearly $600,000 a year to qualify for government assistance. This is unacceptable.

There are real-world consequences of this shutdown. For example, roughly 13,000 air traffic controllers are currently working without pay, operating under staffing shortages. These men and women are essential to our nation’s safety, and they deserve better. Every week this shutdown continues, our economy loses an estimated $15 billion in GDP. It’s time to put the American people ahead of politics. I continue to call on Senate Democrats to join House Republicans at the negotiating table and vote for the CR so we can reopen the government and get back to work.

I am in Washington to fix, not fight. I stand ready to work across the aisle to find responsible, commonsense solutions that serve the American people.

The new rules would apply only to new loads greater than 20MW and to hybrid facilities with a load greater than 20MW. In addition, the proposal states that “to the extent practicable, load and hybrid facilities should be studied together with generating facilities. Such an approach will allow for efficient siting of loads and generating facilities and thereby minimize the need for costly network upgrades.”

The reforms would also include cost responsibility requiring load and hybrid facilities to pay 100 percent of assigned network upgrade costs, with possible cost-crediting over time.

As part of the proposal, Wright made light of the “unprecedented current and expected growth of large loads seeking to interconnect to the transmission system,” contending that “it has become necessary to standardize interconnection procedures and agreements for such loads, including those seeking to share a point of interconnection with new or existing generation facilities.”

The rule change has been supported by data center companies, especially in the aftermath of FERC’s rejection of the proposed behind-the-meter power agreement between AWS and Talen Energy.

1. Oil, gas and the tax code — The New York Times

In 2023, U.S. coal, oil, and gas interests received more than $16 billion in government subsidies, according to the Fossil Fuel Subsidy Tracker. Another group, Oil Change International, estimates it’s actually $34 billion. Much of that support comes from tax code provisions that have existed for more than a century.

Some economists argue that fossil fuel companies should be taxed more to account for pollution and climate damage, costs estimated at more than $820 billion per year.

2. Why Nucor and Meta are supporting a new low-carbon iron factory — Trellis

Backed by a $50 million grant from Breakthrough Energy Catalyst and corporate contracts with Meta, Nucor and others, startup Electra is building a 130,000-square-foot demonstration facility in Colorado. The plant will produce 500 tons of low-carbon iron annually using a low-temperature, electrochemical process powered by renewable electricity, avoiding the coal-fired blast furnace method responsible for steel’s 8% contribution to global pollution.

Nucor, the largest steel producer in the U.S., will buy some of that iron, while Meta will buy environmental attribute certificates related to its production. The plant will also benefit from an $8 million state tax credit.

3. DOE cancels more than $700M in battery, manufacturing projects — E&E News

The Department of Energy has canceled five grants totaling more than $700 million for battery and manufacturing projects, the first confirmed cancellations from a larger list of potential cuts circulating within the agency. These cancellations are among the largest so far in advanced battery manufacturing, affecting planned facilities in red states such as Kentucky and Missouri. It also affects projects backed by the 2021 bipartisan infrastructure law.

The biggest canceled grant, $316 million for Ascend Elements, was meant to support a $1 billion Kentucky plant that would make battery components from recycled EV materials. The company said the battery components would compete with supply that now comes primarily from China.

4. New England Says Goodbye to Coal as Merrimack Station Powers Down — Inside Climate News

Merrimack Station in New Hampshire officially shut down in September, years before its scheduled closure. The coal plant had supplied electricity to the region since the 60’s, but with coal’s economics deteriorating and environmental pressure rising, its closure marks what could be the end of coal-fired electricity in the region.

Back in the early 2000s, Merrimack ran at about 70-80% of the time. But over the past six years, it’s barely exceeded 8%, firing up only when demand spikes.

5. Why Democrats aren’t talking about climate change much anymore — Grist

Democrats are downplaying the term “climate change” after the 2024 election, following polling that shows voters prioritize affordability and health care over environmental issues. Think tanks like the Searchlight Institute argue that focusing on “cheap energy” could make Democrats seem more in touch with voters’ concerns.

Meanwhile, media coverage and public discussion of climate change have declined sharply, even though most Americans remain worried about it. Some Democrats believe reframing the issue around cost and energy security is strategic, while others warn that avoiding climate talk risks undermining momentum for real action.",https://www.renewableenergyworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/sddefault-1.jpg,N,,2025-10-24 15:18:50.390266

Different fuel recycling processes, such as aqueous and non-aqueous, and new nuclear recycling technologies will also be evaluated, according to the bill.

Cruz and Heinrich introduced similar legislation last year.

The study would be overseen by the assistant secretary for the Office of Nuclear Energy. The written report would be submitted to Congress within a year after the act passes.

The mandated study would compare the practicality of fuel recycling and the once-through fuel cycle, which includes temporary and permanent storage requirements.

The legislation also instructs DOE to identify any regulatory gaps surrounding waste management and fuel recycling

“Spent nuclear fuel has the potential to dramatically increase America’s energy, economic, and national security,” Cruz said in his Oct. 17 press release. “Domestic recycling can reduce the space we need for spent nuclear fuel, enhance energy independence, reduce our dependence on imports, and broaden the supply of rare elements and isotopes used in medicine and advanced technologies.”

“Recycling solutions will also reduce the burden on individual states from nuclear waste accumulation, and accelerate progress on nuclear energy, which is our nation’s cleanest baseload energy source,” Cruz added.

Nuclear industry executives of Curio and Oklo praised fuel recycling-oriented legislation. Both companies have recently taken steps to pursue domestic fuel recycling as Oklo announced plans for a $1.7 billion recycling facility in Oak Ridge, Tenn. Curio has completed a lab scale demonstration for its recycling technology, NuCycle.

“We appreciate Senators Cruz and Heinrich for their bipartisan leadership in keeping nuclear waste recycling on the national agenda,” Curio CEO Ed McGinnis said. “What we call ‘waste’ is, in fact, a valuable energy resource that can help strengthen America’s energy security, reduce long-term environmental burdens, and support advanced nuclear technologies.”

“Oklo greatly appreciates Congress’s leadership in advancing commercial recycling of used nuclear fuel,” Oklo Co-Founder and CEO Jacob DeWitte said. “The proposed legislation reflects growing recognition of fuel recycling as a strategic pathway to strengthen U.S. energy security and enhance domestic supply chains.”",https://www.exchangemonitor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/exm-yoast-fallback.png,N,,2025-10-24 13:07:05.543437

While Richmond-area Democrats have, for the most part, supported community members in opposing the peaker plant, Del.
“Dominion Energy does not ask the recipients of our campaign contributions for favors,” Slayton said.","CHESTER, Va.—A crowd packed a meeting room at the SpringHill Suites here in September for a public hearing on an air permit for a controversial “peaker” plant that Dominion Energy has long been lobbying to build to enhance grid reliability.

Brent Archer, former president of Columbia Gas of Virginia, stood at the podium and told officials of the state’s Department of Environmental Quality that he strongly supported the project.

“The dispatchable energy represented by this plant is essential for balancing demand with available supply on the electric grid in partnership with renewable energy,” Archer said, with dozens of other supporters at his back.

He went on: “I am here today representing the Virginia Energy Reliability Alliance, or VERA. VERA is an organization that was formed to support programmatic, balanced policy that supports all forms of energy generation to meet Virginia’s growing energy needs. And I think we have a lot of supporters this evening if you could stand for a minute so we can see. Thank you.”

About a dozen people stood up around the room, most of them wearing stickers that said “I support reliable energy” and “Energy you can count on.”

What Archer didn’t say was that the Virginia Energy Reliability Alliance is funded by Dominion.

In an interview later, Archer said he was speaking as a volunteer and saw no need “to disclose anything that had to do with whatever Dominion’s relationship with VERA may be.” He said he assumed everyone else supporting him was there as a volunteer as well.

Several weeks later, one of Archer’s supporters wearing the stickers turned up in downtown Richmond in the lobby at 1021 E. Cary Street, an office tower populated by lobbyists and consulting firms within walking distance of the Virginia Capitol.

He declined to say who he was or whom he worked for, but he told Inside Climate News: “I’m not at liberty to talk to the media. I work for a consulting company that works with Dominion.”

Jeremy Slayton, a Dominion spokesperson, said in an email prior to the exchange that the utility’s involvement with the Virginia Energy Reliability Alliance “is transparently explained on the VERA website.”

Through the first half of 2025, he said, Dominion contributed $290,208 to another nonprofit called Power for Tomorrow, an advocacy group that works in favor of monopoly utility control as a means of power efficiency and reliability, which in turn supports the Virginia Energy Reliability Alliance. Power for Tomorrow has ties with Dominion dating back to May 2021, according to the Energy and Policy Institute, a utility watchdog group.

Aaron Ruby, another Dominion spokesperson, told Inside Climate News that those people at the hearing supporting Archer and wearing the stickers were not there at Dominion’s behest. “They are not paid, and their support is real,” Ruby said. “We have been transparent about VERA and their efforts to mobilize public support, including handing out stickers. … Thousands of everyday Virginians and more than 100 Virginia businesses and organizations have spoken out in support” of the proposed plant.

Dominion’s financial sponsorship of nonprofits that publicly support its projects is a practice used by utilities across the country. In Alabama, Alabama Power’s corporate offices gave space and paid millions in fees to the Hawthorn Group, a firm based in Alexandria, Virginia. Hawthorn, which describes itself as an international public affairs company, has admitted to hiring a subcontractor, Crowds on Demand, that paid actors to speak at New Orleans City Council meetings in 2017 on behalf of a natural gas plant proposed by another utility, Entergy.

The proposed peaker plant in Chesterfield County, called the Chesterfield Energy Reliability Center, would run when electricity demand is high, rather than round-the-clock. A U.S. Government Accountability Office report in 2024 found that such peaker plants produce more pollution per energy generated than the baseload plants that run regularly, and they’re more likely to be located in communities of color.

The Chesterfield plant has generated significant opposition in the majority Black community whose residents live in close proximity to the site of an old coal plant where the new natural gas facility would be built.

While Richmond-area Democrats have, for the most part, supported community members in opposing the peaker plant, Del. Destiny LeVere Bolling, a Richmond Democrat, recently came out in support of the facility.

Bolling said at a second DEQ public hearing on the air quality permit earlier this month that the project is needed, even though it could make achieving emissions reductions more difficult under the Virginia Clean Economy Act.

“I wholeheartedly support the Virginia Clean Economy Act and its stated policy goals, but as elected and appointed we also have an obligation to ensure Virginians have the energy they need in both the near term and the long term,” said Bolling, who is running an uncontested House of Delegates reelection campaign in Henrico County, a heavily Democratic suburb of the state’s capital city.

“We cannot ignore facts,” Bolling continued. “The data is clear: Without additional peaking capacity Virginia runs a real risk of not meeting demand when it matters the most.”

Prior to her testimony, Bolling’s top donor had been Dominion, which contributed $110,000 between 2023 and August 2025. The day after she spoke, Dominion gave her another $50,000.

Bolling said her testimony and Dominion donations were unrelated. “I’ve actually voted on several bills that they don’t quite like, but that’s the beauty of being on [the Labor and Commerce Committee] and hearing all the energy conversation behind the scenes.”

Dominion, too, said the two were unrelated. “Dominion Energy does not ask the recipients of our campaign contributions for favors,” Slayton said. “That would be unethical, if not illegal.”

Shortly after the VERA supporter at 1021 E. Cary Street declined to give his name, Del. Jason Ballard, a Pearisburg Republican, appeared in the building’s lobby with two men, one of whom had also stood with the VERA supporters back at the air permit hearing in September. They went out on the street and appeared to be recording an audio interview.

Ballard is also a recipient of a Dominion campaign contribution, receiving a $25,000 donation from the utility on the same day as the second air permit hearing earlier this month, according to the Virginia Public Access Project. The utility is Ballard’s fourth-biggest donor at $122,500, records compiled by the access project show.

Asked about the men he had been talking with and whether their interaction had anything to do with the peaker plant in Chesterfield County, Ballard said: “Dominion’s not in my territory, you know that.”

Slayton, the Dominion spokesman, said the utility’s contributions to lawmakers had been made without any expected action in return. “We don’t exchange campaign contributions for political favors,” Slayton said. “Like most companies, we contribute to candidates from both parties who support commonsense public policy.”",https://insideclimatenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/IMG_9957-1024x683.jpg,N,,2025-10-24 12:04:01.491505

EXPERT SAYS ENERGY ABUNDANCE WILL ‘REBALANCE’ AMERICA AS DEMAND HITS RECORD HIGHS NATIONWIDE

On Tuesday, the U.S. Department of Energy announced it would buy 1 million barrels of crude oil to replenish the Strategic Petroleum Reserve — America’s emergency oil stockpile.

The Biden administration sold record amounts of oil from the SPR, Reuters reported — including a 180-million-barrel sale after Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022. The reserve’s capacity is 700 million barrels and currently sits at about 409 million.

""We started off with the Biden administration, the first thing he said was he's going to stop oil and gas production. And he's gonna kill the industry. And that's what he intended to do. And it was a terrible policy, and it certainly didn't work out well for him at all. And so with this administration, it's entirely different,"" Hamm said.

""I think we've seen in many places in the world, especially recently, whether you're talking gas in Europe or critical minerals with China, energy security and national security are linked,"" he continued.

""The U.S. is blessed with an abundance of natural resources, and we now have an administration that wants to see the energy industry invest in those resources to make sure that America's energy strength translates into economic strength and competitiveness and, importantly, security.""

Looking ahead, Hamm cautioned that oil demand could soon outweigh affordable supply.

""With about 18 months, that oversupply's going to be gone. And then we need to watch out for some price shocks after that point. Once you exceed demand with supply, that's when those things start happening,"" the business leader warned. ""So we have to have an energy industry in this country.

Rivian has agreed to pay $250 million to settle a class-action shareholder lawsuit filed after the company abruptly raised prices on its R1 pickup truck and SUV in 2022. The settlement requires approval from a judge in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California before the payment can proceed.

The lawsuit centered on allegations that Rivian included misleading statements and figures in regulatory filings before its 2021 initial public offering. Shareholders claimed the company misrepresented the actual costs required to manufacture its electric vehicles, which ultimately led to the controversial price increase.

Despite agreeing to the substantial payment, Rivian maintains its position that the settlement does not constitute an admission of fault or wrongdoing. The company released a statement denying the allegations while acknowledging the agreement to resolve the legal dispute.

Breaking down the payment structure

Rivian plans to fund the settlement through two sources if the court grants approval. The company will pay $67 million through its directors’ and officers’ liability insurance coverage, while drawing the remaining $183 million from its cash reserves.

Insurance payment: The $67 million portion will come from liability insurance designed to protect company leadership from personal financial exposure in legal matters.

Cash reserves: Rivian will use $183 million from its available funds, which totaled $4.8 billion in cash and equivalents as of June 30.

The timing of this settlement comes during a particularly challenging period for the electric vehicle manufacturer as it prepares for significant changes to its business operations and product lineup.

Company faces pivotal moment

The settlement arrives as Rivian undergoes major transitions in its business strategy and operations. The company is deeply involved in preparations to launch its second-generation electric vehicle, the R2 SUV, scheduled for release in 2026. This new model will carry a significantly lower price point than the existing R1 lineup.

Rivian expects to produce substantially higher volumes of the R2 compared to current models. The company states its Illinois factory can manufacture up to 150,000 R2 vehicles annually. Additionally, construction continues on a new Georgia facility that will produce the R2 and future vehicle models.

Meanwhile, sales of the R1 lineup have struggled to maintain momentum. The company anticipates finishing 2025 having shipped far fewer electric vehicles than it delivered in either 2024 or 2023. Multiple factors have contributed to these declining numbers, including tariff policies and the elimination of federal electric vehicle tax credits.

This week Rivian announced layoffs affecting more than 600 employees as part of a broader restructuring effort. The organizational changes also saw CEO RJ Scaringe assume the role of interim chief marketing officer, taking on additional responsibilities during this turbulent period.

The price hike that sparked outrage

The controversy began when Rivian delivered its first R1 pickup trucks in late 2021. By March 2022, the company announced plans to increase prices on both the truck and SUV by nearly 20 percent. Rivian cited supply chain shortages, inflation pressures and plans to introduce more affordable models as justification for the dramatic price adjustment.

The company initially applied the price increase to both new orders and existing customers who had placed pre-orders and remained on a waitlist. This decision to raise prices on customers who had already committed to purchases sparked immediate backlash from buyers and company supporters.

The intense negative reaction prompted Rivian to quickly reverse course for customers with existing pre-orders. However, the damage had already been done to investor confidence. The announcement caused Rivian’s stock price to plummet, resulting in substantial financial losses for shareholders.

Scaringe acknowledged the mistake in a letter to customers at the time, describing the decision as wrong and admitting it broke customer trust in the company. He characterized it as the most painful error in his more than 12 years leading Rivian.

Legal action follows market fallout

Shareholder Charles Larry Crews filed the lawsuit just days after the price hike announcement and subsequent reversal. The complaint argued that Rivian had misrepresented the true costs of building the R1 vehicles in documentation provided during its initial public offering.

These alleged misrepresentations, according to the lawsuit, directly contributed to the negative stock price impact when the company announced the price increase. The case received class-action status in July 2024, allowing it to proceed on behalf of multiple affected shareholders.

The settlement now awaits final court approval before Rivian can close this chapter of legal and financial challenges.",https://rollingout.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/shutterstock_2155190835-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-10-24 12:03:23.648248

U.S. natural gas extends its retreat as last week’s storage build came in above expectations. “It appears that upside momentum might have run out over the past 24 hours, and today’s bearish storage data is helping to keep downward pressure on pricing,” Andy Huenefeld of Pinebrook Energy Advisors says in a note. Natural gas in underground storage rose by 87 Bcf last week to 3,808 Bcf, extending the surplus over the five-year average to 164 Bcf from 154 Bcf the week before. An 81 Bcf injection was expected, according to a WSJ survey of analysts. “Only two weeks remain in the traditional injection season, but it would not be out of the question for storage to continue to grow through mid-November if weather cooperates,” Huenefeld adds.

NERC president warns of ‘five-alarm fire’ for grid reliability

Utility Dive/Ethan Howland

A recent Federal Energy Regulatory Commission conference addressed the growing challenge of ensuring grid reliability amid the massive growth of data centers, which are estimated to use up to 12% of U.S. electricity by 2028. Though reliability is currently high, experts warn risks are mounting due to extreme weather, resource adequacy issues, and an “escalating toxic soup” of security risks. FERC leaders emphasized the urgent need to accelerate the construction and permitting of new energy infrastructure, including transmission and generation, to meet rising demand, as current reserve margins are deemed “not safe.” While this buildout is costly, solutions like integrated system planning, improved data analysis tools, and long-term contracts for large data center loads were proposed to improve efficiency and help mitigate cost burdens on ratepayers. [MDN: Jim Robb, president and CEO of the North American Electric Reliability Corp. (NERC) said at the meeting: “We’re seeing … an increasing number of small scale events and near misses that continue to reinforce what we can’t call anything but a five-alarm fire when it comes to reliability.” In other words, more powergen is urgently needed, and the only thing that can provide it is natural gas.]

Surprised by leftwing radical rhetoric? Look closer at the climate movement

Committee For A Constructive Tomorrow (CFACT)/Chris Johnson

The article argues that the celebration of Charlie Kirk’s murder stems from a dangerous, long-standing anti-human streak within the left, especially its radical environmental wing. This ideology views human beings as the problem, believing that fewer people and less activity would improve the world—a perspective seen in the support of demographic decline and the casual dismissal of human life. The author highlights University of Pennsylvania Professor Michael Mann’s callous remarks mocking Kirk’s death as a prime example of this radicalism. The piece concludes by urging conservatives to stop ignoring the climate debate and to actively challenge the left’s “anti-human” narratives with free-market solutions and a more hopeful worldview, asserting that people are not the problem. [MDN: Excellent insights. These kinds of insights have been made for years. It reminds us of the Michael Crichton book titled “State of Fear,” published in 2004.

Climate out, affordability in

Master Resource/Robert Bradley Jr.

The article argues that affordability has replaced climate as the primary focus in Democratic energy and climate discussions following their 2024 defeat, according to a Politico column. Author Robert Bradley Jr. highlights that the public is more concerned with reliability and cost than climate change, leading to “severe pushback” against climate advocates. The original messaging, which implied that embracing clean power would be expensive but necessary, has failed to gain traction now that promises of cheaper renewables are met with public skepticism. Bradley suggests that the “climate complex is in a messaging crisis” and advocates for free-market energy policies to replace what he calls “crony capitalism.” [MDN: We agree 100%. No more public money for unreliable renewables. Equally, no more public money for fossil fuel companies. We must end ALL crony capitalism, period.]

AI’s insatiable need for power is driving an unexpected boom in oil-fracking company stocks

Fortune/Jordan Blum

Despite weak oil prices, falling revenues, and shrinking profits in the traditional oil sector, major oilfield service companies are pivoting to power generation for data centers, capitalizing on the massive demand driven by the AI boom. Liberty Energy, for instance, saw its stock jump 30% after announcing plans to increase its data center power capacity to over 1 gigawatt by 2027. Similarly, Halliburton’s stock rose 15% following its partnership with VoltaGrid for global power delivery. Other players like Baker Hughes and SLB are also investing in this new market, primarily using on-site natural gas generator sets. This emerging power opportunity is considered a “bright spot” in a currently sluggish industry, which saw Liberty’s net income fall 42% year-on-year, though long-term success depends on providing 24/7 power reliability. [MDN: AI data centers are the new “it” thing in the O&G space. Company stock prices are rising when they enter the AI market.]

Why Big Oil is asking EPA not to cut its polluter reporting program

EnergyNow.com

The EPA proposes to halt the decade-old Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program, claiming it will save oil and gas companies up to $256 million annually and let them fund more tangible environmental efforts. However, many in the industry, including the American Petroleum Institute (API), warn that axing the program would immediately jeopardize their ability to claim highly valuable tax credits for carbon capture and clean hydrogen. The reporting data is the nation’s main record of industrial emissions, relied upon by states, investors, and advocates. Losing it could also harm future LNG exports to Europe and Asia, which increasingly demand verified low-carbon energy. Critics emphasize that eliminating the federal program would create regulatory uncertainty and costly, fragmented state-level reporting. [MDN: This is why we so often detest the API. They want taxpayer money to support their cockamamie carbon capture and hydrogen programs. NO! Stick to your knitting and make oil and gas, and forget about government-funded unreliable renewables and these other hairbrained programs. Jeesh.]

Oil futures take flight on Russia sanctions

Bloomberg/J. Wittels, R.W. Neo, M. Gindis

New US sanctions targeting Russia’s largest oil producers, Rosneft and Lukoil, caused oil prices to surge, with West Texas Intermediate jumping 5.6% to settle near $62 a barrel. The radical new policy aims to cut off Russia’s war revenue, departing from the previous G7 price cap strategy. The sanctions immediately threatened global supply, as key buyer India indicated it would likely cease purchasing Russian crude. Analysts called the move an unprecedented escalation that risks major disruptions to Russian exports. While global supply is currently plentiful, the prospect of India sourcing oil elsewhere is expected to increase demand for non-Russian crude, reduce the market surplus, and lead to higher oil prices, despite the possibility of China absorbing more Russian volume. The pressure on Moscow has significantly increased. [MDN: Uh huh. And what did we say earlier this week? Just wait for the turnaround back into the $60s for WTI. It didn’t even take a full week! WTI for December delivery surged 5.6% to settle at $61.79 a barrel in New York. Brent for December jumped 5.4% to settle at $65.99 a barrel. Back in the $60s.]

Next month in Brazil expect the climate cops to party, plot

Committee For A Constructive Tomorrow (CFACT)/Craig Rucker

COP30 will run from November 10-21 in Belem, Brazil, gathering 70,000 attendees to accelerate climate action, limit global warming to 1.5°C, and advance a “just transition” involving massive finance transfers—demanded to be up to $1.3 trillion annually—from wealthy nations to poor countries. The article frames the UN conference as a self-serving ritual, highlighting the hypocrisy that host Brazil is simultaneously expanding offshore oil and gas exploration and cleared thousands of acres of Amazon rainforest to construct a highway and accommodations for the event, using fossil-fuel equipment. It contrasts the economic self-harm of climate-focused nations like Britain with the pro-growth policies and cheap energy in US states, arguing that the push for “net zero” results in industrial destruction and financial strain. [MDN: These meetings are attended by arrogant hypocrites that seek to grab U.S. taxpayer money. That’s the sum total of what happens. Take a hike!]

China threat calls for ideologically free energy policy

CO2 Coalition/Vijay Jayaraj

The article argues that climate-centric energy policies have created a dangerous fragility in supply chains, most evident after the 2022 energy crisis. Aggressive fossil fuel phaseouts in Europe led to costly reliance on imports, undermining the “net zero” agenda and causing energy-intensive industries to relocate. The author argues this subordinates real-world utility to ideology and wishful thinking. In contrast, countries like India and Indonesia, which maintained diversified, fossil-based power grids and prioritized pragmatism, fared significantly better. The article concludes that energy independence is foundational to national sovereignty, urging governments to repeal regulations stifling domestic fossil fuel and nuclear production, and allow energy sources to compete on cost and reliability. [MDN: To rely on China for rare earths to make windmills and solar panels is about as stupid as it gets. Why would we, or any country, cede its national security and even its sovereignty to a thug dictatorship like China? It makes no sense. Wake up!]",,N,,2025-10-24 15:00:22.383479

The data shows that the company’s total net sales for the quarter reached $200 to $210 million, with module shipments of approximately 725 MW. T1 Energy maintained its full-year EBITDA guidance range of $25 to $50 million and plans to commence construction of its Austin G2 module factory in the fourth quarter.

As of September 30, T1 Energy held $87 million in cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash, including $34 million in unrestricted cash. Additionally, the company has accrued $92 million in Section 45X tax credits this year. These credits, a key manufacturing support policy under the U.S. Inflation Reduction Act, are expected to be monetized. The company forecasts a significant sales increase in the fourth quarter, driven by production ramp-up at its Dallas G1 factory and policy-driven inventory sales from the third quarter.

Regarding its business strategy, T1 Energy clarified that the Austin G2 cell and module factory will be developed in phases. The first phase is expected to have an annual capacity of 2.1 GW, with capital expenditures estimated between $400 and $425 million, and is scheduled to begin production in the fourth quarter of 2026. If this factory, along with the Dallas G1 factory (5 GW capacity), operates at full capacity, the company’s annualized EBITDA could reach $375 to $450 million. T1 Energy has now drawn the final $50 million from its $100 million preferred equity commitment with Encompass Capital Advisors, securing the funding foundation for the G2 factory construction.

On the policy front, T1 Energy supports the Department of Commerce’s Section 232 investigation into polysilicon imports. Should subsequent tariffs or import restrictions be imposed, the company expects to gain a competitive advantage in sourcing ultra-pure polysilicon. Concurrently, T1 Energy is fully advancing its compliance efforts for the Section 45X tax credits and expects to meet the eligibility requirements for 2026 and beyond by year-end. However, the full-year EBITDA forecast remains toward the lower end of the guidance range, primarily influenced by shifts in sales mix, uncertainty around trade tariffs, and ongoing supply chain challenges.",https://www.solarbeglobal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/8-2.png,N,,2025-10-24 13:06:55.477005

They have been big backers of wind and solar power, but are increasingly looking at other technologies including nuclear and carbon capture.
And the emissions from 8 Rivers’ coal plant would be much lower.
But giving some ageing coal plants a few more years of life is very different from supporting investment in brand-new generation capacity.","Upton Sinclair’s novel ‘King Coal’, depicting the grim realities of the American mining industry in the 1910s, talks about “a vision of a future, great and wonderful” when miners would no longer be needed.

As it turned out, the decline of the US coal industry was less than wonderful for the communities that depended on it. President Donald Trump, in both his administrations, has attempted to reverse that decline, but with little success so far. There were 41,300 people working in coal mining in the US in August, down from 51,000 at the beginning of President Trump’s first term in January 2017.

Now the surge in US electricity demand, driven principally by new data centres for AI, is reviving hopes of at least a slightly brighter future for coal. Several planned retirements of coal-fired power plants have been delayed, as utilities look to secure whatever generation capacity might be available. Building new coal plants looks like a much tougher challenge. But one company is making progress on a commercial project that would be the first new large coal-fired plant in the US for more than 20 years.

8 Rivers, a developer working on carbon capture and storage (CCS) and low-carbon hydrogen, has this year announced two deals to assess the potential for a new coal-fired plant with CCS: one in Wyoming and one in New Mexico. It is close to announcing another such agreement with a partner in North Dakota. It plans to select one of those three possible projects to be its first commercial development.

The plan has been made possible by the alignment of circumstances created by the data centre boom. Big tech companies want to secure new power supplies, and they have also set demanding targets for cutting greenhouse gas emissions. They have been big backers of wind and solar power, but are increasingly looking at other technologies including nuclear and carbon capture.

Microsoft has described CCS as “among the most promising technologies that paves the way towards CO2 neutrality”. It has announced a series of deals with companies working on carbon capture, and is a partner in the Northern Lights CCS project in Norway, which is also backed by the country’s government, Equinor, Shell and TotalEnergies.

This week, Google announced its first carbon capture deal, supporting the construction of a new 400-MW gas-fired plant in Illinois that will capture roughly 90% of its carbon dioxide emissions and sequester them in a nearby storage facility. The project is the first to come out of Google’s partnership with developer Low Carbon Infrastructure, which is working on deploying commercial-scale CCS for power generation.

Google says its aim is to help accelerate technical and operational improvements in CCS, including raising carbon dioxide capture rates and improving system performance and economics.

8 Rivers’ proposed plant would use conventional gasification technology to produce syngas from coal. The gas is then burned in pure oxygen to create two by-products: water, and a high-concentration stream of carbon dioxide, which together turn a turbine to generate power.

One of the great advantages of the process, known as the Allam-Fetvedt Cycle, is that the exhaust gas is nearly pure carbon dioxide, making processing for storage easier. The exhaust gas from a conventional coal plant might be only 12% to 15% carbon dioxide.

Turning coal into gas to enable carbon capture has an image problem in the US, as a result of the failure of Southern Company’s Integrated Gasification Combined Cycle (IGCC) project in Mississippi’s Kemper County, launched in 2006. The technology never properly worked as intended, and in 2017 the decision was taken to run the plant solely on natural gas.

8 Rivers is using different technology, and should not face the same issues that dogged the Kemper plant. But to help avoid the pitfalls that faced that project, the 8 Rivers team has been working with some of the engineers and commercial leaders who worked on Kemper, to learn lessons from the problems that were encountered there.

Government support will still clearly be very important for this first-of-a-kind project. The 45Q tax credit for carbon capture is critical, and there may also be additional grants and other backing from the Trump administration, following the US$625 million for the US coal industry announced by the Department of Energy last month.

With the benefit of that support, 8 Rivers is aiming to deliver power at a price of about US$100 to US$120 per megawatt hour. That would be highly competitive against even unabated natural gas generation at today’s prices, following significant cost inflation in that sector. And the emissions from 8 Rivers’ coal plant would be much lower.

It is estimated that the carbon intensity of the power from 8 Rivers’ plants could be about 9 kilogrammes per MWh. For comparison, the average carbon intensity of gas-fired generation in the US is about 450 kg/MWh.

No big tech companies have yet announced a deal to buy power from one of 8 Rivers’ plants. But as they explore every possibility for adding new electricity supply while cutting emissions, coal with carbon capture certainly looks like an option worth them considering.

The Wood Mackenzie view

There is no doubt that the boom in data centre investment is helping to slow the decline of coal in the US, by prolonging the operational lives of some coal-fired power plants. Two years ago, Wood Mackenzie’s base case expectation was that US coal-fired generation would drop about 60% between 2025 and 2032. Now we expect it to drop about 39%.

But giving some ageing coal plants a few more years of life is very different from supporting investment in brand-new generation capacity. Peter Findlay, Wood Mackenzie’s director of CCUS economics, says that while 8 Rivers’ plans are promising, the company still has significant challenges to overcome to make its first coal project a success.

The coal gasification unit is well-established, proven and commercially available technology, and so should not present too many difficulties, he says. The bigger potential issues are with the turbine used to generate the power.

Turbines typically use natural gas, for power generation, or jet fuel, for aircraft. Converting a design to handle water and carbon dioxide is not a trivial exercise. 8 Rivers has been working with Siemens Energy since 2023 to develop the new zero emissions turbines it needs.

The full life-cycle emissions of the plants will also be affected by methane leakage from the mines where the coal is produced.

But if those technical challenges can be solved at an acceptable cost, there is a huge potential market for greenfield coal plants with carbon capture, not only in North America but in Asia and Europe, too.

“If 8 Rivers can find a turbine manufacturer to develop an affordable turbine to perform reliably, over the lifecycle of the plant with affordable maintenance and overhaul cycles, then the proposed technology could be game-changing,” Findlay says.

New emissions rules for shipping deferred for at least a year

The International Maritime Organisation (IMO) has voted to postpone for a year a decision on whether to adopt its Net Zero Framework, which includes a global emissions pricing system. The proposed plan was strongly opposed by the US administration, which said it would “not tolerate any action that increases costs for our citizens, energy providers, shipping companies and their customers, or tourists.”

The US said any nation that voted to support the framework faced actions including having its vessels blocked from US ports, additional port fees, new visa restrictions, commercial penalties under US government contracts, and sanctions on government officials. Administration officials described the plan as a “European-led neocolonial export of global climate regulations”.

At a meeting in London last week, IMO member countries voted 57-49 to postpone a vote on adopting the framework. Countries supporting the US call for a delay included China and India, as well as big oil and gas producers such as Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Qatar and Russia. Countries voting against included most members of the EU, the UK, Singapore and South Africa. Among the abstentions were Japan, South Korea, Indonesia and Greece.

What happens next is unclear. Some observers have suggested that the Net Zero Framework could now be abandoned. But Arsenio Dominguez, secretary-general of the IMO, said this week that while the outcome of last week’s vote was “not the ideal scenario”, work on the plan would continue. He aims to provide more clarity on issues including governance, certification and distribution of revenues.

“This extra year gives us the chance to connect with all the stakeholders and parties in order to address the questions that were raised,” he added. “Shipping continues to be a global industry, and as such needs global regulations.”

The delay in the adoption of the framework casts a cloud of uncertainty over plans to reduce emissions from shipping through, for example, the production of low-carbon fuels.

In brief

The US has announced new sanctions on Russia’s two largest oil companies, as it attempts to increase the pressure to end the war in Ukraine. Rosneft and Lukoil have been designated as sanctioned, meaning that all their property and interests that are in the US or controlled by Americans are blocked and must be reported to the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Asset Control. Foreign financial institutions that do business with Rosneft and Lukoil could themselves face secondary sanctions.

Wood Mackenzie analysts said the new measures meant that companies buying Russian oil would risk losing access to the dollar-based financial system. The main consumers of Russian crude oil, led by China and India, are expected to continue purchases from other non-sanctioned Russian suppliers. But there is likely to be a scramble for workarounds in response to the more stringent sanctions regime. Oil prices strengthened after the US announcement, with Brent crude trading at over US$66 a barrel on Friday morning.

The energy secretary of the US and the energy minister of Qatar sent a joint letter to the EU, warning about the potential impact of the new European Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive (CSDDD) on the LNG industry. The directive creates new responsibilities for companies operating in Europe to address their impacts on human rights and the environment, including the climate. The US and Qatar said the proposals could jeopardise the affordability and reliability of energy in the EU, and posed “an existential threat” to European industry. The European Parliament on Wednesday agreed to consider further changes to the proposed directive, with the aim of approving a final version by the end of the year.

The Greenhouse Gas Protocol, which sets global standards for measuring and managing carbon emissions, has opened public consultations on two proposed changes in its guidance. One change covers standards for Scope 2 emissions, which come from purchased energy, and the other covers estimates of avoided emissions from deploying lower-carbon electricity. The Clean Energy Buyers’ Association, which represents companies including Amazon, Google, Meta, General Motors and Walmart, said it had “deep concerns” about some of the requirements in the new proposed Scope 2 guidance, and said it could unintentionally chill voluntary clean energy procurement.

GE Vernova is spending US$5.275 billion to build up its presence in the transformer market. It is buying out the 50% share it does not already own in Prolec GE, a transformer manufacturer with plants in the US, Mexico and Brazil. The company, a joint venture between GE Vernova and Xignux of Mexico, recently invested US$300 million in the US and Mexico to increase capacity and add new technology.

“Families across Missouri are struggling to pay their bills. But I am concerned Ameren is seeking dramatic rate increases in order to supply massive data centers and industrial users. Recent reporting indicates that Ameren cut electricity to thousands of Missouri households in September while simultaneously pursuing lucrative arrangements with corporate users. ​Missourians deserve affordable and reliable electricity. They should not be forced to subsidize corporate projects while struggling to keep their lights on.”

Senator Josh Hawley of Missouri became the latest Republican politician to sound the alarm about the potential impact of data centre development on residential customers’ electricity bills, in a letter to the CEO of Ameren. The senator asked whether Ameren had analysed the impact of agreements to supply new large load customers, and whether it had acted to ensure that the cost of new infrastructure for serving those large users would not be passed on to residential ratepayers.

After Texas sophomore quarterback Arch Manning only completed 44.4% of his passes against Kentucky, he will have to be extra safe with the ball as Lanier lurks in the secondary.

“It’s what (defensive coordinator Coleman) Hutzler preaches: Everyday ball out,” Lanier said about forcing turnovers in a Monday press conference. “We do a lot of strip (the ball) attempt circuits, a lot of interception circuits and we just preach that every day. Get the ball out, an interception, a fumble recovery … it’s happening in the game because it’s how we practice and how we work.”

The 6-foot-1 safety spent part of his collegiate career at East Mississippi Community College. Eventually, Lanier became a three-star prospect and the 31st best player among the class of 2024 JUCO products.

Lanier is currently tied first for overall interceptions in the Southeastern Conference, counting non-conference games.

Senior wide receiver Brenen Thompson

On the other side of the field, Mississippi State will have its eyes on Thompson to make plays against a Texas defense that is currently second in the conference for interceptions.

After catching the ball only five times across the Bulldogs’ opening two conference games, Thompson exploded last week with seven receptions for 155 yards in a close loss to Florida. Thompson’s performance at “The Swamp” is the fourth-most receiving yards a player has recorded in a SEC game this season.

In Mississippi State’s upset victory over then No. 12 Arizona State on Sept. 6, Thompson caught the ball six times for 133 yards. The receiver scored two touchdowns, one of which was the winning score late in the fourth quarter.

“It’s a surreal moment for me,” Thompson said after the game. “Just being in that position to go make that play, it was surreal. I’m happy for my teammates, I’m happy for my coaches and I’m happy for this fanbase.”

Redshirt sophomore punter Ethan Pulliam

Mississippi State’s punting unit will have to be extra cautious with Texas sophomore wide receiver Ryan Niblett on punt return duty. Last week against Kentucky, Niblett returned two punts for 88 yards and returned a punt for a touchdown against Oklahoma the week prior.

However, the Bulldogs have one of the best punters in the SEC, Pulliam, who was also once on the baseball team.

“Looking back at it, I think it’s been a great decision with this opportunity that has been given to me, to be able to go out there and punt, and flip the field,” Pulliam said about committing full-time to football in a Monday press conference.

Pulliam now has the fifth-most yards punted in a SEC game with 319 while also having the second-longest punt in the conference with 67.

Rivian has struggled to achieve consistent profitability due to costs related to ramping up of production, tariffs and intense competition from Tesla and traditional automakers.

High tariffs on imported auto parts have driven up manufacturing costs and squeezed margins for EV makers, forcing them to revamp supply chains, curb reliance on foreign components and boost US investment in line with the Trump administration policy.

Analysts expect Rivian's quarterly revenue to surge 71.5per cent and loss to narrow, when it reports third-quarter results after markets close on November 4.

The company lowered the midpoint of its annual deliveries forecast earlier this month, despite reporting a nearly 32per cent jump in the third quarter, largely driven by a last-minute rush to grab the now-expired federal incentive.

Rivian is focusing on improving manufacturing efficiency and streamlining operations at its Normal, Illinois plant to align costs with the weaker near-term demand outlook, while preparing for its next-generation R2 models, which are expected to broaden its reach beyond the luxury segment.

The company expects the R2 model to open up a lower-price segment, competing with Tesla's bestseller Model Y crossover, and counterbalance soft demand for its pricier R1 vehicles.

Efficiency and broader demand-side management, or DSM, strategies including demand response and other distributed energy resource programs are powerful tools for grid planning that offer flexibility, speed and cost control.

Rather than defaulting to expensive infrastructure upgrades, utilities can use efficiency and demand response to manage localized load growth at the source and circumvent the need for a $10 million substation. As distributed energy resources like rooftop solar and battery storage introduce bidirectional power flows the grid wasn’t designed for, reducing overall system load through efficiency can ease congestion, improving both stability and reliability across the transmission and distribution network.

These load-smoothing benefits also support better system operations. DSM programs that flatten unpredictable peaks and improve system forecasting can reduce the risk of last-minute capacity shortfalls. At a time when many utilities are facing long interconnection queues and permitting delays for new renewable assets, energy efficiency offers a practical stopgap that stretches existing generation capacity to meet customer needs while longer-term solutions are brought online.

Beyond system-level benefits, energy efficiency programs deliver real, measurable value to customers. Last winter, one utility’s residential customers enrolled in efficiency programs saw bill increases that were 30% lower than those of non-participants during peak heating demand.

Build customer trust through personalization and education

In many regions, customers are seeing policy rollbacks and changes to federal tax credits for rooftop solar, EVs, and home energy upgrades. Customers don’t fully understand who’s responsible in many cases, but they do expect their utility to help them adapt, which presents a strategic opportunity to earn lasting trust by acting as energy advisors. Recent technology advancements can help:

AI-powered analytics allow for tailored engagement based on customer usage, income, housing type and behavior, enabling utilities to deliver targeted messaging and offer programs that are more relevant and likely to drive adoption.

Digital twins and smart targeting tools powered by machine learning can match the right program or incentive to the right customer. These tools optimize incentive levels to avoid unnecessary spending so that programs remain effective and cost-efficient.

Proactive communication around policy shifts such as tax credit expiration or changes to electrification incentives can help manage expectations and reinforce the utility’s role as a trusted advisor.

Interactive dashboards and real-time monitoring tools increase transparency and allow customers to track and adjust their consumption, encouraging long-term behavior change that supports grid goals.

Federal rollbacks and funding shifts are already creating uncertainty, which can impact utility DSM program design, adoption and outcomes. This presents an opportunity for utilities to offer creative strategies that meet modern customer needs.

Deeper collaboration with state energy offices, local governments, green banks and community-based financing programs can help bridge the funding gaps created by changing or reduced federal incentives while also extending the reach of utility programs to align efforts across public and private sectors. Equally as important is investment in the trade ally ecosystem by educating and equipping contractors, installers and local vendors, which can reduce project delays and fallouts, and support the delivery of energy projects at scale.

This foundation is essential for expanding access to energy efficiency for low-income households and residents of aging buildings who face the highest energy burdens and lack access to efficiency upgrades, yet represent the greatest opportunities for savings. Prioritizing these groups amplifies program impact and helps utilities meet equity and affordability goals.

With the right partnerships, workforce and focus areas in place, utilities are better positioned to scale the most impactful strategies. Bundling energy efficiency with demand response and flexible load solutions form a ratepayer-funded, grid-integrated asset that delivers both short-term demand flexibility and long-term load reduction, helping utilities avoid or defer expensive new generation and infrastructure investments.

Energy efficiency also fuels the local economy. In Maryland, for example, over 70 contractors are actively involved in efficiency programs, driving economic activity that goes beyond kilowatt-hours saved and generates ripple effects that benefit entire communities.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/LRTFd824mo6o_8oNy3GkDUiM6b2oAEzCyfuPIL6O9Q4/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9uZXN0X2hvbWVfZGVwb3QuanBn.webp,N,,2025-10-24 15:18:54.444748

PowerTransitions has been talking with local officials and has an agreement in place with the owner of the Vernon property, NorthStar Group Services, to potentially lease the site.

Vermont Public Service Commissioner Kerrick Johnson has requested a meeting with the company to get more details on its proposal to develop the approximately 140 acres along the Connecticut River in Windham County.

“Once I became aware that there is a relationship between PowerTransitions and NorthStar, in our role to advocate on behalf of all Vermont ratepayers, this is a part of our departmental due diligence,” Johnson said.

Johnson said any consideration of siting a project in Vernon would have to take into account the high-level nuclear waste that is being stored near the former nuclear power plant.

“The site in Vernon has strengths and weaknesses,” Johnson said. “The high-level radioactive waste has to be viewed as something that has to be respected and avoided at all costs.”

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, on its website, says battery storage systems “have raised legitimate safety concerns,” because they can catch fire and release harmful gases that pose health risks to nearby residents and first responders.

A representative from the company has been meeting with the Vernon Planning Commission about the plan.

“It’s got our interest,” said Vernon Planning Commission Chair Jim Pinkerton. “At this point this is kind of back-of-the-envelope sort of thing, but the demand for power is increasing all over the place, and there’s no telling where those industries are going to go.”

PowerTransitions first contacted NorthStar about two years ago, according to NorthStar CEO Scott State.

PowerTransitions acquires operating and retired power generation and industrial facilities, according to the company’s website, to “transform them into modern, resilient energy infrastructure campuses.”

State said he introduced the PowerTransitions officials to the town of Vernon, adding that it is still NorthStar’s intention to, “allow redevelopment of the site for a use preferred by the town of Vernon.”

NorthStar acquired the closed Vermont Yankee nuclear power plant in 2019, becoming the first company in the United States to own a nuclear facility with the intention of dismantling and decommissioning the property.

Since then, NorthStar has removed more than 76,000 tons of material, much of which is low-level radioactive waste, that has been shipped to a storage facility in Texas.

Jupiter Power also has multiple projects in Ward and Pecos County, which are approximately 100 miles further from the city.","Asset Vault is the company’s fully consolidated subsidiary focused on “developing, building, owning and operating energy storage assets globally.”

Acquisition of this BESS project was directly supported by the investment from OIC, as well as the monetisation of investment tax credit (ITC) related funds.

The SOSA BESS is positioned within the Electric Reliability of Texas (ERCOT) North market, and is expected to receive notice to proceed (NTP) in Q4 2025, with commercial operation expected in Q1 2027.

Energy Vault will safe harbour the BESS, with construction beginning on-site in Q4 2025. Upon completion, the company says SOSA will deliver critical grid support and renewable integration capacity.

The company says it is in advanced negotiations with a counterparty for an 8-year offtake agreement. The offtake structure is expected to be underwritten by an investment-grade counterparty, and “is expected to deliver bankable, frontloaded revenue streams, enhancing returns and de-risking project cash flows.”

SOSA will use the third generation of Energy Vault’s B-Vault AC storage solution.

Alongside the SOSA BESS, existing US projects under the Asset Vault platform include the 57MW/114MWh Cross Trails BESS and the 8.5MW/293MWh Calistoga Resiliency Centre, a hybrid energy storage system that merges green hydrogen with battery cells.

Additionally, the recently acquired 125MW/1GWh Stoney Creek BESS in New South Wales, Australia, is managed under the Asset Vault platform.

Jupiter Power enters US$288 million agreement with Austin Energy

Also in ERCOT territory, Jupiter Power has agreed to a large-scale battery storage contract with utility Austin Energy to provide up to 100MW of electricity from a utility-scale BESS facility.

Austin Energy says this agreement will support the utility’s goal of achieving 125MW of battery storage by the end of 2027.

The agreement is valued at an estimated US$14.4 million per year, with a term of up to 20 years, for a total estimated amount of US$288 million, representing Austin Energy’s largest energy storage initiative to date.

ESN reached out to Jupiter Power for more information regarding the project that would provide the 100MW for Austin Energy, but did not hear back before publication.

The company entered into a similar power purchase agreement (PPA) with Denton Municipal Electric (DME) in Denton, Texas, for the Tidwell Prairie II project, which was announced the day before the agreement with Austin Energy.

ESN Premium reported on this PPA when the agreement was discussed and unanimously approved during the City of Denton’s regular council meeting on 30 September.

Jupiter Power’s website does not list a BESS project in Travis County, where Austin is located.

Climate-focused community bank funds Virginia BESS projects

In other US battery storage financing news, two projects in Virginia totalling 20MW/80MWh have been financed by Climate First Bank, which claims to be a world-first “values-based, digital-forward community bank founded to combat the climate crisis.”

Insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), Climate First Bank launched in 2021 to offer personal and commercial banking services alongside mission-aligned technologies, including rooftop solar PV and other renewable energy sources, building retrofits, electric vehicle (EV) charging, and carbon offset credits.

The bank has financed two projects in the rural towns of Exmore and Tasley, located approximately 24 kilometres apart on the eastern coast of the state.

The project developer is Patterson Enterprises, and the battery storage supplier will be the Chinese provider Great Power. Terms of the financial close were not disclosed in a Climate First Bank release.

The projects will be built near the A&N Electric Cooperative Substations in each town, using lithium iron phosphate (LFP) battery technology.

Culley Generating Station, backtracking on their commitment to be entirely coal-free by 2027. In previous CenterPoint plans, the utility wrote that “Coal plants have not been able to consistently compete on short term marginal price with renewable and gas energy” and that the plants, being old and outdated, were not designed to frequently cycle on and off, resulting in “increased maintenance costs and more frequent outages.”

Unit 3 of the Culley power plant has continued to have reliability issues and power outages, requiring costly upkeep and maintenance for CenterPoint that was then passed onto customers. Extending the life of the Culley plant poses more threats to reliability and affordability for customers.

In response, Nicole Chandler, Southwest Indiana Beyond Coal Campaign Organizer, released the following statement:

“The Culley coal plant is outdated, expensive, and unreliable. There’s no reason for CenterPoint to try to extend the life of a 50-year-old coal plant that continues to have power outages and costs even more to upkeep and maintain, while CenterPoint customers have been saddled with some of the highest utility bills in Indiana for years now.

“Instead of prioritizing solar and wind that’s more affordable and reliable for customers, the Trump Administration and Indiana legislators have continued to double down on expensive, polluting, and unreliable coal that costs more for all of us to keep our lights on and heat our homes. We can’t afford to keep throwing lifelines to coal.

(KLFY) — A multinational company has announced it will invest $277 million to build a rare-earth separation facility in Vinton, the first of its kind in the U.S., according to a news release from Louisiana Economic Development.

Aclara Resources Inc. said in the release it will construct the first U.S. heavy rare-earth separation facility at the Port of Vinton in Calcasieu Parish.

The company is expected to create 140 direct new jobs at its first U.S. location. Louisiana Economic Development estimates the project will result in an additional 456 indirect jobs, for a total of 596 potential new job opportunities in the Southwest Region.

Rare Earth Elements are a group of 17 metals known for their unique magnetic, optical and conductive properties. These elements are used in modern technologies, from electric vehicles and wind turbines to smartphones and advanced defense systems.

“By choosing Louisiana for its first U.S. facility, Aclara is recognizing what we already know, our state is leading the next generation of energy and technology innovation,” said Gov. Jeff Landry. “We’re excited to welcome the Aclara team to Louisiana, and we look forward to the jobs, growth and opportunity this project will deliver for our people, our communities — and for a Louisiana economy that’s ready to power and lead our nation’s future.”

The new facility will produce the heavy rare earth elements essential for applications which rely on advanced permanent magnets. By processing material from Aclara’s mineral deposits in Brazil and Chile, the Louisiana operation will create a reliable and sustainable U.S. supply of these materials, according to Aclara Resources CEO Ramón Barúa.

“We are pleased to announce that we have secured a premium site in Louisiana for our U.S. heavy rare earth separation facility,” Barúa said. “From the beginning, our priority was to identify a location that could support rapid development, given the urgent need to establish a reliable supply of these critical minerals.”

Aclara Resources is controlled my majority stockholder Hochschild Mining, which is based in Lima, Peru, and has operations throughout South America.

The company selected the location after evaluating more than 100 potential U.S. sites for its proximity to key chemical suppliers, access to Gulf Coast logistics and availability of a skilled industrial workforce, LED said.

Construction is expected to begin in 2026 and be completed in 2027. The facility will be built in phases, beginning with the rare earth separation plant, followed by potential future expansions to support downstream processing and alloy production as part of Aclara’s long-term growth strategy.

Ramaphosa calls for new ventures with Vietnam, as he points to low investment

President Cyril Ramaphosa today urged the Vietnamese to explore new ventures to diversify into untapped sectors and to build partnerships, to generate jobs, transfer skills and stimulate inclusive growth, as he noted low investment between South Africa and Vietnam.

Ramaphosa was speaking during a State visit to Vietnam, where he stated that there was no record of Vietnamese investments in South Africa.

He said there were several financial and non-financial support measures available for Vietnamese companies keen to invest in South Africa to diversify their supply chains.

He said both countries’ cooperation must extend into strategic sectors that define the economies of tomorrow.

These sectors include electric vehicles, battery manufacturing, renewable energy, agro-processing and digital innovation, he said.

However, Ramaphosa noted that in recent years, trade between South Africa and Vietnam expanded significantly.

South Africa ran a sizable trade deficit with Vietnam, importing significantly more than it exported, he pointed out.

He said the imbalance between the countries called for a move beyond the traditional trade in raw materials.

He said South Africa had much to offer Vietnam, in terms of mining, agriculture and manufacturing, while Vietnam, in turn, brought strengths in electronics, textiles, machinery and renewable-energy technologies.

South Africa boosts deportations amid jobs crisis, Schreiber says

South Africa is pushing to deport more undocumented migrants who compete with citizens for jobs in an economy with one of the highest unemployment rates globally, the minister overseeing the programme said.

The nation “is a neglected part of the global migration story,” with the contestation between foreigners and locals for positions becoming “a real tinderbox,” Home Affairs Minister Leon Schreiber said today.

The department has deported 51 000 people in the last year — that’s more than France and Germany combined.

South Africa has the continent’s most industrialised economy and sees a constant influx of job seekers from neighbouring countries, including Zimbabwe and Mozambique. But with the unemployment rate running at 33.2%, tensions between locals and foreigners run high. About 8.4-million people are eligible to work yet don’t have jobs.

And, Lower CPI goal may save S Africa R900-billion in debt costs

Reserve Bank Governor Lesetja Kganyago emphasised the benefits of a lower inflation goal, saying it could save the government as much as R900-billion over a decade in debt-service costs.

South Africa currently spends 22 cents of every rand on debt-service costs, crowding out investment in health and education.

Kganyago noted the debt-savings would dwarf the R60-billion the National Treasury expected to raise in the current fiscal year from a two-percentage-point value-added tax hike that was later scrapped after opposition from members of a coalition government, including the Democratic Alliance.

The governor announced in July that the central bank’s monetary policy decisions will now be guided by aiming at the floor of its 3%-to-6% inflation target instead of its previous objective of the midpoint of that range.

The South African Reserve Bank has argued that the current inflation target, which has not been reviewed since it was first adopted in 2000, is too high and wide, and that striving for 3% would help lower borrowing costs and make the nation more competitive among its trading partners.

The One Big Beautiful Bill Act restores key provisions from the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, including small business deductions and lower tax rates.

Long Island accountants say the reinstated 100% bonus depreciation offers major tax savings for real estate, construction, and manufacturing firms.

Termination of green energy credits may impact solar, auto, and energy-efficiency sectors across Long Island.

Experts urge businesses to plan strategically and consult tax professionals to maximize benefits under the new law.

The tax code changes brought about by the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA), cheered by many business leaders for restoring parts of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, creates or returns several opportunities for businesses to reduce their tax exposure. Nevertheless, the implications of changing tax rules vary for every business, and experts from Long Island accounting firms remind owners that taking full advantage of the changes requires careful guidance.

Tax legislation can influence different aspects of businesses, explains Felicia Tucker, managing partner at the KPMG Long Island office in Melville. “In some instances, changes are designed to incentivize more business in the U.S., or drive economic growth and create jobs. Time will tell how that affects our clients. In other areas, the changes could result in further complexity (i.e. from clean energy tax credits).”

Provisions of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 that were scheduled to sunset at the end of 2025 have been extended by the federal government. “OBBBA permanently extended provisions regarding tax rates, standard deductions, the section 199a Small Business Tax deduction, and itemized deductions,” says Anthony Basile of Anthony Basile CPA in Woodbury.

However, the end of green energy tax programs may significantly impact several other business sectors locally. “Many energy credits have been terminated, so industries that are tied to alternative energy sources may be affected,” warns Basile, who lists solar panel companies, car dealerships and companies that install any energy-saving products and building materials among those facing more exposure.

In addition, businesses with employees that receive gratuities will need to adhere to new rule changes going into effect. “There are now limits on the taxation of tips and overtime [up to $25,000 for tips and up to $12,500 for overtime], which will require additional reporting by employers,” Basile says.

A major change for businesses comes from this year’s return of 100% bonus depreciation for qualified property placed in service after Jan. 19, 2025. “This allows businesses to fully expense equipment, technology, and certain improvements again, giving significant flexibility for timing deductions,” notes Edward Kotlyanskiy, a partner at DDK in Jericho. “For taxpayers with irregular income or multi-year projects, there is even a transitional election to take 40% (of the deduction), which can help smooth taxable income rather than take the entire deduction at once.”

According to Kotlyanskiy, the return of full bonus depreciation carries significant implications for many prominent Long Island businesses. “Real estate developers, manufacturers and construction companies stand to benefit the most, since they often acquire significant property, equipment, or leasehold improvements that now qualify for immediate expense,” he says. “For real estate operators, this brings cost-segregation studies back to the forefront, as separating shorter-life components can yield substantial first-year deductions.

The change could even benefit healthcare businesses. “Even professional and medical practices investing in new equipment can use the reinstated 100% deduction to accelerate write-offs and reduce taxable income in 2025,” Kotlyanskiy says. He recommends businesses revisit depreciation schedules and capitalization policies, since many assets that would have been depreciated over several years can now be fully deducted in the year of acquisition.

Instead of seizing on the opportunity to maximize bonus depreciation of assets under the updated rule, Kotlyanskiy encourages businesses to plan the timing and amounts of their expenses to fit a long-term strategy. “Clients who want to reduce their tax exposure should be asking questions that go beyond: ‘What can I deduct?’” he says. “For instance, many of our business clients are asking whether accelerating equipment purchases before year-end makes sense under the reinstated bonus depreciation rules, or whether spreading them across years provides a smoother income profile.”

Automobile purchases should receive additional attention this year, especially considering recent changes to the way electric vehicle tax credits are administered. “The federal tax credits for new and used electric vehicles (EVs) ended on Sept. 30, 2025,” explains Basile. “To be eligible for a tax credit, you must have purchased the vehicle on or before that date.” Earlier this year, Basile was able to advise a client who had initially believed the credit was expiring at the end of the year to purchase an electric/gas hybrid vehicle earlier to qualify for the credit. “He got his new car in July and we will be calculating the credit for him when we do his 2025 taxes,” Basile says.

Generally, accounting firms will provide clients with correspondence that keeps them current on legislation that could impact the way they file taxes. Often, these include specific questions which will target areas of the tax law that can be beneficial to the client. “Most CPA firms send a comprehensive tax organizer to clients annually, and it’s particularly important to review that this year,” says Basile.

KPMG is betting on technology solutions to keep its clients informed about changing tax codes. “We’ve been deploying ‘KPMG Digital Gateway’… to assist clients as they understand their tax impact,” says Tucker.

Kotlyanskiy prefers an approach centered on proactive analysis, forecasting, and restructuring before the end of the year in order to plan ahead of legislative and regulatory changes. “Our philosophy has always been to anticipate changes and align tax strategy with the client’s business objectives, not wait for the law to dictate the outcome,” he says.",https://libn.com/files/2025/10/focus1024.png,N,,2025-10-24 11:25:17.867311

Meta, the parent company of Facebook, announced a 20-year deal to buy power from Constellation Energy’s nuclear power plant in Clinton.
The explosive growth of data center construction that has followed the boom in artificial intelligence has only added to that need.
At 400 megawatts, Broadwing would be only the second large-scale power generation project paired with carbon capture in the United States.
“There’s technology risk, performance risk, regulatory risk and overall economic risk.”","Google’s announcement of a power purchase agreement with Broadwing will allow Low Carbon Infrastructure to break ground in the first quarter, says CEO Jonathan Wiens.

“By agreeing to buy most of the power it generates, Google is helping get this new, baseload power source built and connected to the regional grid that supports our data centers,” Google said in its announcement, though it declined to say how much it plans to spend.

Google has two data centers on the Midcontinent Independent System Operator grid, or MISO, which serves downstate Illinois.

Google is the second major tech company to announce a power purchase agreement with a supplier connected to MISO. Meta, the parent company of Facebook, announced a 20-year deal to buy power from Constellation Energy’s nuclear power plant in Clinton.

Google, Meta and other “hyperscalers” that operate massive data centers are under scrutiny for the power they consume and the pollution that results, leading them to search for sources of “clean” energy. The explosive growth of data center construction that has followed the boom in artificial intelligence has only added to that need.

Unlike Clinton, however, Broadwing isn’t yet producing energy. It’s an ambitious project that also involves ADM, which will use steam generated from the power plant for its food-processing facilities, as well as some of the electricity. ADM will take the compressed CO2 captured by Broadwing and store it in the company’s nearby carbon-capture wells.

Adding Google alongside ADM gives the project momentum. “I couldn’t ask for a better situation,” Wiens says.

The Google partnership is the result of three years of discussions. “Having them involved — one of the five largest companies in the world, putting their weight behind carbon capture, it’s a huge benefit,” Wiens says.

The idea of pairing carbon capture with natural gas-powered turbines has drawn interest as data center operators and other large users of electricity look for ways to generate power reliably while reducing pollution. One drawback of renewable sources, such as wind and solar, is their power output isn’t constant.

“If you can be low emission and meet peak demand requirements of a data center, that’s a material improvement over renewables,” says Mark Pruitt, former head of the Illinois Power Authority who now runs the Power Bureau, an energy consulting firm in Chesterton, Indiana.

At 400 megawatts, Broadwing would be only the second large-scale power generation project paired with carbon capture in the United States.

“Even if it gets built; even if it does work; I don’t know if it works long-term financially,” Pruitt says. “There’s technology risk, performance risk, regulatory risk and overall economic risk.”",https://s3-rd-prod.chicagobusiness.com/s3fs-public/styles/1200x630/public/google.jpg,N,,2025-10-24 12:04:51.477649

Licensing: Wald emphasized that U.S. energy policies regarding nuclear reactors must change, as the demand for electricity soars because of the energy requirements of AI data centers and other expected power needs. Among the policies that must be revised are the licensing actions of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, because the procedures that needed for 30- to 300-megawatt advanced reactors are different from those required for 1,000-megawatt pressurized water reactors and boiling water reactors.

He stressed that the licensing process for new nuclear needs to be speeded up, as also is noted in an executive order from President Trump. “Regulators must supply human intelligence to each license application, but their process must run many times faster than it does now, especially for licensing reactors that produce just 300 megawatts or 30 megawatts or 10 megawatts or 1 megawatt,” Wald said. “These are just one-by-one individual licenses. If we’re going to think big, we’ve got to rethink regulation.”

Wald opined that “what the NRC does is not very productive. It has a bureaucracy that is resistant to change and that’s now dealing with new technologies. . . . I am open to the idea that they’ll make errors [in an accelerated regulatory process], they’ll approve things they shouldn’t, and we’re going to learn from experience. [But] the NRC has this habit of approving things they’ve approved before and of not approving anything nobody’s ever done before. That’s not a recipe for successful innovation and industrial progress.”

Collective solutions: Wald pointed out that artisanal energy policies do not work well within the overall energy system. “Solar and wind tribalists say their costs are going down. But we’d be much better off if we put our money into collective solutions. We should invest in the electric grid. If all the money used to purchase 11-kilowatt emergency generators [solar panels], like I and others have in my neighborhood, had went into the grid instead, we’d all be better off.

“I think that solar and wind farms have their place, but only to the extent that they benefit the system,” he said. “Adding solar panels in a place where noontime electricity prices on the grid are negative is not a good idea, although federal and state incentives may make that happen.”

Wald added that the “amount of electricity transmission you need to support a new reactor is lower than what you need for wind or solar or hydro energy sources. Nuclear plants have reasonably flexible siting requirements.”",https://cdn.ans.org/i/favicon-128.png,N,,2025-10-24 12:04:15.183103

(KLFY) — A multinational company has announced it will invest $277 million to build a rare-earth separation facility in Vinton, the first of its kind in the U.S., according to a news release from Louisiana Economic Development.

Aclara Resources Inc. said in the release it will construct the first U.S. heavy rare-earth separation facility at the Port of Vinton in Calcasieu Parish.

The company is expected to create 140 direct new jobs at its first U.S. location. Louisiana Economic Development estimates the project will result in an additional 456 indirect jobs, for a total of 596 potential new job opportunities in the Southwest Region.

Rare Earth Elements are a group of 17 metals known for their unique magnetic, optical and conductive properties. These elements are used in modern technologies, from electric vehicles and wind turbines to smartphones and advanced defense systems.

“By choosing Louisiana for its first U.S. facility, Aclara is recognizing what we already know, our state is leading the next generation of energy and technology innovation,” said Gov. Jeff Landry. “We’re excited to welcome the Aclara team to Louisiana, and we look forward to the jobs, growth and opportunity this project will deliver for our people, our communities — and for a Louisiana economy that’s ready to power and lead our nation’s future.”

The new facility will produce the heavy rare earth elements essential for applications which rely on advanced permanent magnets. By processing material from Aclara’s mineral deposits in Brazil and Chile, the Louisiana operation will create a reliable and sustainable U.S. supply of these materials, according to Aclara Resources CEO Ramón Barúa.

“We are pleased to announce that we have secured a premium site in Louisiana for our U.S. heavy rare earth separation facility,” Barúa said. “From the beginning, our priority was to identify a location that could support rapid development, given the urgent need to establish a reliable supply of these critical minerals.”

Aclara Resources is controlled my majority stockholder Hochschild Mining, which is based in Lima, Peru, and has operations throughout South America.

The company selected the location after evaluating more than 100 potential U.S. sites for its proximity to key chemical suppliers, access to Gulf Coast logistics and availability of a skilled industrial workforce, LED said.

Construction is expected to begin in 2026 and be completed in 2027. The facility will be built in phases, beginning with the rare earth separation plant, followed by potential future expansions to support downstream processing and alloy production as part of Aclara’s long-term growth strategy.

The state of Louisiana offered Aclara Resources an incentive package that includes the workforce development by LED FastStart and a $3 million performance-based grant for utility and infrastructure improvements. The company is also expected to participate in the state’s High Impact Jobs and Industrial Tax Exemption program.

WASHINGTON, DC – Congresswoman Zoe Lofgren (CA-18), Senators Adam Schiff and Alex Padilla (both D-CA), and 27 members of the California congressional delegation are urging(link is external) the Department of Energy’s (DOE) Inspector General to launch an independent investigation into the unlawful termination of $7.6 billion in grants to California and other states targeted for their perceived lack of support for President Trump.

The cancelling of these funds threatens thousands of jobs across energy, construction, and manufacturing sectors and could pass higher energy costs along to California residents.

“DOE does not have the authority to ignore the law, and Congress did not provide DOE with the discretion to terminate awards based on nebulous new criteria created by the Secretary years after enactment of the statute that funded and provided direction for these projects,” wrote the lawmakers.

In a letter to DOE’s Acting Inspector General Sarah Nelson, the lawmakers note that no state was hit harder than California. Out of the 321 terminated awards, DOE cancelled 79 awards in California, totaling more than $2 billion of federally funded projects. Among the projects was a backup battery power for a children’s hospital in Madera and an award worth $1.2 billion for the ARCHES hydrogen hub which had garnered bipartisan public support.

“These 321 grant project terminations will have real effects on affordability for our constituents and on the nation’s competitiveness. In the last year, electricity prices have increased twice as fast as the overall cost of living. Secretary Wright and the Trump administration’s decision to take $7.56 billion in energy projects offline is going to further constrain supply and send Americans’ electric bills through the roof,” the lawmakers continued.

In addition to Lofgren, Schiff, and Padilla, the letter was also signed by Speaker Emerita Nancy Pelosi (CA-11) and U.S. Representatives Nanette Barragán (CA-44), Ami Bera (CA-06), Julia Brownley (CA-26), Judy Chu (CA-28), Gil Cisneros (CA-31), Laura Friedman (CA-30), John Garamendi (CA-08), Robert Garcia (CA-42), Jared Huffman (CA-02), Sara Jacobs (CA-51), Sydney Kamlager-Dove (CA-37), Mike Levin (CA-49), Sam Liccardo (CA-16), Ted Lieu (CA-36), Doris Matsui (CA-07), Dave Min (CA-47), Kevin Mullin (CA-15), Jimmy Panetta (CA-19), Scott Peters (CA-50), Luz Rivas (CA-29), Raul Ruiz (CA-25), Lateefah Simon (CA-12), Norma Torres (CA-35), Derek Tran (CA-45), Juan Vargas (CA-52), and George Whitesides (CA-27).

Dear Acting Inspector General Nelson:

We write to request that your office immediately launch a formal investigation of the U.S. Department of Energy’s (DOE) recent termination of $7.56 billion in grant awards in states that did not vote for the President. These unjustified terminations call into question whether DOE followed appropriations law and raise serious doubts about the Department’s ability to meet its contractual and grant obligations. Terminating grants based on partisan criteria suggests significant unlawful bias at the highest levels of the Department. Therefore, a full investigation is warranted.

On October 1, 2025, Office of Management and Budget Director Russell Vought posted on X: “Nearly $8 billion in Green New Scam funding to fuel the Left’s climate agenda is being cancelled. More info to come from @ENERGY. The projects are in the following states: CA, CO, CT, DE, HI, IL, MD, MA, MN, NH, NJ, NM, NY, OR, VT, WA”. Every one of these states gave their electoral votes to Kamala Harris in the 2024 presidential election. Out of the 321 awards deemed unworthy by DOE, it strains credulity to believe that all but seven of them happened to be in blue states.

No state was hit harder by these terminations than California. Out of the 321 terminated awards, DOE chose to cancel 79 awards in California, alone. In total, more than $2 billion of federally funded projects for California were included in this barrage of terminations. The recipients included state government, local governments, electric utilities, and innovative American energy companies. One of the projects would have provided backup battery power for a children’s hospital in Madera. One award for $1.2 billion was for the ARCHES hydrogen hub, a significant project that garnered public support from both Democrats and Republicans. Scores of projects were focused on boosting grid reliability and American domestic manufacturing. Overall, DOE’s terminations threaten the existence of thousands of jobs in the energy, construction, and manufacturing sectors.

It is not clear to us how DOE could have considered these projects unworthy of continuance, save for the obvious partisan reasons outlined above. Secretary Wright even specifically called out our state during interviews on CNN and Fox News: “California can do what it wants, but the 49 other states’ taxpayers shouldn’t be subsidizing that.” In the past several years, California has annually contributed around $600 billion in revenue to the federal government, making it a top donor state to the federal Treasury.3

The process by which these terminations were approved also warrants intense scrutiny. During his interview with CNN on October 2, 2025, Secretary Wright explained that these terminations were a result of a months- long review of more than 2,400 projects. It remains unclear why such a review was necessary, and the Department has failed to produce a shred of evidence purporting waste, fraud, or abuse in any of these thousands of projects approved under the last administration. Indeed, the only criteria that condemned these projects to termination seem to be: 1) they were approved under the Biden Administration and 2) they were awarded to recipients located in states that did not vote for the President. Secretary Wright also mentioned that this review was conducted by “a team of seven or eight people”. The positions and qualifications of these individuals deserve scrutiny; it is unknown, for instance, if this team of people was comprised of any career officials, agency lawyers, or technical experts, or whether the team was comprised of DOGE personnel.

The Department’s press release states: “Using this review process, DOE evaluated each of these awards and determined that they did not meet the economic, national security or energy security standards necessary to justify continued investment.” There are serious problems with this statement. First, DOE has provided no evidence or quantifiable data to Congress to justify any assertion that these projects did not meet economic, national security, or energy security standards. In fact, DOE has demonstrated a stunning lack of responsiveness to congressional correspondence on previous grant terminations.

Second, no order, whether presidential or secretarial, can override a statute enacted by Congress. Much of the funding for these projects came from the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, a law that Congress passed with the support of both Democrats and Republicans. Congress directed DOE to establish these programs and use this funding to provide grant awards to further the intent of the statute. DOE does not have the authority to ignore the law, and Congress did not provide DOE with the discretion to terminate awards based on nebulous new criteria created by the Secretary years after enactment of the statute that funded and provided direction for these projects.

It is also unclear whether the Department conducted the appropriate internal reviews and analyses prior to approving these terminations, which raises important legal questions. Additionally, grant recipients were largely excluded from these deliberations and kept in the dark. Days after DOE’s termination announcement, many recipients reported that they had not even received a termination notice from the Department. At the very least, recipients deserve communication from the agency and an opportunity to appeal in accordance with DOE grant regulations. DOE’s actions cast doubt on the Department’s ability to be a reliable and trustworthy partner for the private sector.

It is imperative that these terminations be thoroughly investigated and the results shared with the Congress, especially in light of Secretary Wright’s assertion that he does not intend to stop wantonly terminating grant awards: “We released some announcements a few months ago. We’ll have many more coming this fall.” These 321 grant project terminations will have real effects on affordability for our constituents and on the nation’s competitiveness. In the last year, electricity prices have increased twice as fast as the overall cost of living. Secretary Wright and the Trump administration’s decision to take $7.56 billion in energy projects offline is going to further constrain supply and send Americans’ electric bills through the roof.

Secretary Wright’s termination decisions are both unlawful and will cause harm to Americans. We respectfully request that your office investigate these terminations thoroughly.

Thank you for your consideration.",http://lofgren.house.gov/sites/evo-subsites/lofgren.house.gov/files/slider_images/iStock_000022100234Small_0.jpg,N,,2025-10-24 11:03:53.539201

The world has been consumed by the need to decarbonize the energy sector, as it is the main contributor to greenhouse gas emissions. The solution for most nations is to turn to one of the three main components of the renewable energy sector: wind, solar, and nuclear.

Poland is the last remaining stronghold of the coal energy sector in Europe

The international embrace of the renewable energy sector has reached nearly every corner of the world, nearly. Some nations have stagnated in the adoption of the sector in favor of the more reliable energy generation that the fossil fuel sector presents.

Nations like Australia have no sign of the renewable energy sector emerging as a contender for the crown of energy king. Australia is among the nations of the world that still place an exceedingly high importance on the coal sector.

Poland has the unwelcome reputation as the last stronghold of coal in Europe. It is the only EU member state that still produces the “black gold”. As such, many leaders in Poland have called for more work to be done to phase out the coal and gas sectors in their nation. In stepped Vestas with a plan to construct a massive wind turbine manufacturing facility.

In 2012, approximately 90% of Poland’s energy came from coal, which has since been dramatically reduced. At the moment, the number sits closer to 50%, which is still significantly higher than any other EU member state.

“We entered the period of transition with our energy balance dependent on practically one resource: coal. In spite of such difficult beginnings, Poland has maintained emission reductions at the level present in other EU member states: its use of coal in electric energy production has fallen by 19 per cent over the last 30 years.” – Michał Kurtyka, Polish Minister of the Environment

A lack of demand in Poland has led Vestas to shelve its largest project to date

The Danish wind turbine manufacturer has stated that it plans to halt construction of its largest factory in Poland due to a lack of demand in its main European market. The company announced its plans to build an offshore wind project in Poland last year. The facility was set to deliver its first wind blades by 2026 and could have employed over 1,000 people.

The company informed several news organizations of its plans to shelve the project in Poland “due to a lower-than-expected demand for offshore wind in Europe”.

In August, Poland’s President Karol Nwrocki vetoed a bill aimed at relaxing rules for the construction of onshore wind farms. However, the lack of demand has led Vestas to pull out of its plans to manufacture wind turbines in Poland. While Poland sees an exodus of wind, Germany has opened an 11.4 MW wind farm in Herbsleben-Dachwig.

The bill requires the county Department of Environmental Protection to create a plan for creating a Community Choice Aggregator, through which the county could determine its preferred mix of energy sources.

The aggregator must have the capacity to serve as an electricity supplier for “all residential and small commercial electric customers” in the county, though individual residents and businesses could opt out.

At a media briefing prior to the council’s vote on the bill, council President Kate Stewart (D-Dist. 4), the legislation’s lead sponsor, said the concept “harnesses the purchasing power of residents and small commercial operations so the county will be able to create large contracts with energy generators.”

Stewart noted the county bill was made possible in part by state Del. Lorig Charkoudian (D-Dist. 20), who in 2021 sponsored legislation passed by the Maryland General Assembly that authorized the county to create a Community Choice Aggregator pilot program.

Under the bill passed Tuesday, the county would have to consider factors such as sustainability, availability and affordability in deciding its preferred mix of energy sources.

“Due to shifting federal climate policies, volatile energy prices from our regional transmission operator and rising demand, it is critical for the county to pursue local strategies that stabilize energy costs and advance climate initiatives,” Stewart said during the briefing Tuesday.

The Potomac Electric Power Co. [Pepco] recently asked a state agency for permission to raise rates for customers in Montgomery and Prince George’s counties.

If approved, the proposal filed Oct. 14 with the Maryland Public Service Commission would result in an increase of $11.73 a month on the average customer bill.

The commission expects to rule on the rate case next summer, but existing rates will be frozen pending that decision, according to a press release from the agency.

The county’s aggregator plan will also require approval by the commission before it can be implemented.

In an emailed statement to Bethesda Today on Thursday, Pepco spokesperson Rodney Wilson said the company is aware of the county’s plan to create a Community Choice Aggregator.

“Pepco has been an active participant in the Maryland Public Service Commission (PSC) Working Group around Community Choice Aggregation (CCA) in Montgomery County and will continue to collaborate with legislators, the PSC and other stakeholders to comply with the legislation while ensuring the continued delivery of safe, reliable energy service to our customers and communities in Montgomery County,” the statement read.",https://assets.bethesdamagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/DSC_1908-scaled-1-e1761256461811.jpg,N,,2025-10-24 14:08:17.778146

,American Energy,2025-10-24 14:00:44+00:00,The North State Journal | Elevate the conversation.,CURTIS: Winning against China means winning on energy | The North State Journal,"Trisha Curtis, www.facebook.com",,,,,https://nsjonline.com/article/2025/10/curtis-winning-against-china-means-winning-on-energy/,"China now boasts one-third of the world’s power generation, more than 10,000 TWh.
In 2024, China added more than 500 TWh of coal-fired power generation, equivalent to half of Japan’s entire grid.
China has more coal-fired power generation than any nation on Earth has total power generation.
The EPA is moving to rescind the Endangerment Finding, which weakened America’s energy security by shuttering coal power plants.
China’s cheap and reliable coal power underpins its industrial manufacturing power.","China spent the past 40 years building an industrial powerhouse fueled by coal, while American politicians, Europe and California focused on decarbonizing and greenwashing. Such efforts enabled the purchase of Chinese wind turbines, solar panels and batteries, made from cheap coal, further subsidized power and forced labor. These products have been forced into the grid at the expense of the consumer, the economy and the nation, driving electricity prices higher and reliability lower.

As the Western world buys cheap Chinese green tech, China continues to build out its manufacturing base. China now boasts one-third of the world’s power generation, more than 10,000 TWh. In 2024, China added more than 500 TWh of coal-fired power generation, equivalent to half of Japan’s entire grid. More than 5,800 TWh of China’s power generation comes from coal alone. China has more coal-fired power generation than any nation on Earth has total power generation. China consumes more coal now than at any time in history and constitutes more than half of global coal consumption.

Coal is reliable, energy-secure, cheap and easily transportable. It produces direct process heat for industrial use and stable, dispatchable baseload power generation. The Chinese green tech that European countries and U.S. states prize is only cheap because it is subsidized, made with inexpensive coal, forced labor and in a country with no rule of law, let alone environmental standards.

The reason China controls the rare earth market is it processes and refines the rare earths and metals, a dirty and energy-intensive business that requires removing thorium and uranium. China’s access to ample, redundant power from coal allows them to dominate the processing of rare earths, but it also enables them to make everything from smartphones and weapons to robotics.

U.S. utility companies with executive pay tied to ESG metrics and states with unfair power purchase agreements (including Texas) have favored adding wind and solar into the grid at the expense of reliable baseload power, including coal and natural gas. These states flood the grid with intermittent wind and solar, leading directly to rising electricity prices. These states are also removing reliable baseload power in the form of inexpensive coal.

This is taking place in Colorado. In California, the result is rolling blackouts, imported electricity and some of the highest power prices in the nation. It is worse in Europe; a war is being waged, and European nations lack the power generation to build the ammunition and weapons to support Ukraine.

Germany has some of the highest electricity prices in the world. Drones, AI and air defense all require power generation. China, Russia, North Korea and Iran are not making weapons with wind and solar power, nor is Ukraine defending their country and making drones with it.

When it comes to energy, the U.S. should be winning the competition with China. The U.S. is producing 13.6 million barrels per day (mbd) of oil, more than any nation on Earth, ever. That is almost 4 mbd more than the next two largest producers, Russia and Saudi Arabia, who produce roughly 10 mbd. The U.S. produces 130 billion cubic feet per day of natural gas, more than double Russia, the second-largest producer in the world.

Natural gas makes up a substantial portion of the U.S. grid, but the grid has weakened as politicians forced the green agenda, pushing wind and solar at the expense of low-cost coal. The U.S. now has more wind and solar power generation than coal.

The Trump administration’s policy shifts and energy agenda are critical in head-to-head competition with China. Energy is the lifeblood of a nation. The Trump administration understands that without abundant and reliable power, America cannot manufacture.

In his U.N. address, Trump called out Europe’s energy failures and high electricity prices. His Interior Department just opened 13.1 million acres for coal leasing, ending an Obama-era de facto moratorium. The EPA is moving to rescind the Endangerment Finding, which weakened America’s energy security by shuttering coal power plants. China’s cheap and reliable coal power underpins its industrial manufacturing power. If America wants to remain free, strong and prosperous, we must unleash our energy resources, including natural gas and coal, rebuild our industrial base, and embrace affordable and reliable power.

“It has been an incredible opportunity to work with the Scout Motors team on the new plant,” said Paul C. Dougherty, President of PRP Real Assets.
Scout Motors was formed to craft the next era of trucks and rugged SUVs rooted in the same tradition that made the original Scout vehicle an American icon.
Scout Motors is revitalizing a legend and returning manufacturing to American shores.
Initial production is targeted to begin at the Scout Motors Production Center near Columbia, South Carolina, in 2027.","Initiative projected to support 1,000 supplier jobs and spur $368 million of additional local investment for a cumulative investment impact of nearly $700 million

COLUMBIA, S.C. – Scout Motors is making an additional investment of $300 million in South Carolina to build a Supplier Park on the site of its Production Center in Blythewood. This initiative, which does not come with any new government incentives, is expected to support approximately 1,000 additional supplier jobs and represents a critical expansion of the company’s existing investment of more than $2 billion in the state.

“This expansion reinforces our long-term commitment to American manufacturing and reflects our continued belief in South Carolina as a hub for automotive innovation and economic growth,” said Scott Keogh, President and Chief Executive Officer of Scout Motors. “Our on-site Supplier Park will strengthen our production capabilities and help establish a vibrant, resilient supply chain ecosystem that will benefit the region for decades to come.”

Located adjacent to the main Production Center buildings, the Supplier Park spans nearly 200 acres and will feature more than 2.3 million square feet of specialized manufacturing and logistics space across three key centers: • Just in Time (JIT) Facility dedicated to sequencing parts for final vehicle assembly. • Battery Assembly Building designed for high-volume battery assembly. • Accessories Building to support upfitting and installation of vehicle accessories.

In addition to building the physical footprint, Scout Motors is in the process of finalizing supplier contracts that are expected to drive a multiplier effect across the local economy. Early estimates suggest that supplier agreements already awarded represent $368 million in investments and are expected to support more than 1,000 new jobs in South Carolina.

The Supplier Park will serve as a central logistics and production hub, supporting seamless delivery of parts, batteries, and accessories to Scout Motors’ main assembly operations. The size and scope of the park reflect Scout Motors’ strategy to build a fully integrated, domestic supply chain for its trucks and SUVs.

""When Scout Motors announced they were coming to South Carolina, we knew it would set off a chain reaction of investment and job creation across our state,"" said Governor Henry McMaster. ""This announcement further highlights Scout Motors’ commitment to our continued prosperity and the seemingly limitless economic opportunities they're creating for our people.""

“The latest investment from Scout Motors demonstrates their strong commitment to our state and reinforces our position as a leader in manufacturing,” said U.S. Senator Tim Scott. “This expansion will not only create jobs but support continued growth and opportunity in South Carolina.”

""I am grateful that Scout Motors is investing additional funds in the Second Congressional District, creating hundreds of new, good-paying jobs, benefiting businesses throughout the state,” said U.S. Rep. Joe Wilson. “As an indication of my support, I have personally provided payment to reserve a Scout hybrid pickup truck.”

“This $300 million Supplier Park and the 1,000 new jobs it brings to South Carolina reflect the impact of Scout’s decision to call our state home,"" said SC Senate President Thomas Alexander. “This investment is a powerful reminder that our state can compete with anyone in attracting investment and jobs, while ensuring that families and communities here at home share in the benefits of today’s announcement for generations to come.”

“Scout Motors’ decision to expand their investment in South Carolina confirms what we have long known — our state is a premier destination for innovation and growth,” said SC House Speaker Murrell Smith. “This new Supplier Park will not only bring good jobs and economic opportunity to Richland County but will also strengthen the foundation of prosperity for generations of South Carolinians to come.”

“This supplier park is a major milestone in the Scout Motors project and for Richland County, signifying a new era of growth in innovative manufacturing and opportunity,” said Jesica Mackey, Co-Chair, Columbia Area Development Partnership and Chair, Richland County Council. “Not only does it infuse an immediate investment of capital that further strengthens our community, it sets the stage for other businesses to enter the market that will bring in career opportunities and partnerships.”

The construction contract has been awarded to Evans General Contractors, a nationally respected firm with strong local ties. PRP Real Assets is serving as the Project Advisor.

“It has been an incredible opportunity to work with the Scout Motors team on the new plant,” said Paul C. Dougherty, President of PRP Real Assets. “PRP is honored to be a small part of what will be the most thrilling new trucks and SUVs ever produced. We look forward to seeing the new vehicles roll off the assembly line in Blythewood, SC.”

About Scout Motors The Scout, originally produced by International Harvester from 1961-80, was the world’s first utility vehicle capable of both off-road adventure and family duty. It was the 8-day-a-week truck. The Scout brand is now an American icon whose heritage is kept alive by a dedicated community of doers who continue to push their vehicles on the farm, in the wilderness, and on family outings. Scout Motors was formed to craft the next era of trucks and rugged SUVs rooted in the same tradition that made the original Scout vehicle an American icon. Scout Motors is revitalizing a legend and returning manufacturing to American shores.

Initial production is targeted to begin at the Scout Motors Production Center near Columbia, South Carolina, in 2027.",,N,,2025-10-24 11:25:28.788767

Michigan’s Solar Expansion Faces Its First State-Level Test

Michigan has officially entered a new era of renewable energy oversight. For the first time, a solar developer has filed plans directly with the Michigan Public Service Commission (MPSC) for approval, bypassing local zoning boards under the state’s new Clean Energy and Jobs Act of 2024.

The proposed project, covering 873 acres in Ingham County, represents a major shift in how large-scale solar farms will be reviewed and approved across Michigan. The legislation, which took effect in 2025, allows developers to seek state approval for utility-scale renewable projects if local governments do not have compliant permitting ordinances in place.

This is a test case for a policy that could accelerate Michigan’s clean energy transition while also reigniting debates about local control, farmland preservation, and community involvement.

What the New Law Changes for Solar Developers

Before 2025, large solar farms were primarily subject to local zoning approval, which often created friction between developers and township governments. Some local boards imposed temporary bans or restrictive ordinances that slowed renewable progress.

Under the new system, the MPSC now has authority to review projects larger than 50 megawatts (MW) when local ordinances fail to meet minimum renewable energy siting standards.

According to the MPSC, this new framework will:

Provide predictable timelines for clean energy developers

Ensure consistent environmental and land-use standards statewide

Maintain public participation requirements, including hearings and community comment periods

However, township officials argue that the rule undermines local decision-making. As one Ingham County resident told reporters, “We’re the guinea pigs for what happens when Lansing takes over.”

This marks the first real-world test of how the state’s policy will balance speed, scale, and community input.

Balancing Local Control and Statewide Goals

The debate over who should control renewable energy development is not new in Michigan. Similar tensions surfaced when battery storage projects in Coldwater and Blendon Township raised questions about zoning authority and public safety.

The new MPSC-led process is designed to address that friction by setting statewide minimum standards for noise, setbacks, decommissioning, and farmland protection. Some local leaders still fear it removes too much autonomy from rural governments.

Learn how past projects shaped this policy shift in https://michigansolarpartners.com/coldwater-takes-the-lead-in-energy-storage.

Clean energy advocates argue that the policy will help Michigan meet its target of 100 percent clean electricity by 2040, a goal established in Governor Whitmer’s climate plan.

Economic and Environmental Stakes

The Ingham County project would generate roughly 150 MW of solar power, enough to power about 30,000 homes. Beyond electricity generation, it could deliver new construction and maintenance jobs to mid-Michigan and expand the local tax base.

The developer, whose name has not yet been disclosed, plans to use low-impact construction methods to preserve soil health and restore pollinator habitats, practices increasingly common among Michigan solar sites.

This mirrors trends seen in https://michigansolarpartners.com/from-brownfields-to-brightfields-michigans-hidden-solar-opportunity-on-industrial-land, where previously underused areas are repurposed for clean energy without displacing farmland.

What Happens Next

The MPSC will now begin its formal review process, including a public hearing phase expected later this year. If approved, the project could break ground in 2026.

Observers say the outcome will set a strong precedent for how Michigan balances rapid renewable expansion, local engagement, and environmental responsibility.

If the process succeeds, dozens of pending solar projects may follow suit and apply directly through the MPSC, transforming Michigan’s renewable energy permitting landscape.

Looking Ahead: Michigan’s Renewable Rules Get Real

This first MPSC filing is more than a bureaucratic milestone. It is the stress test for Michigan’s new clean energy policy framework.

If it streamlines the path for responsible development while preserving transparency and local voice, Michigan could become a national model for smart renewable growth.

If not, the policy could face legal challenges or community backlash that slow the state’s solar progress.

Either way, all eyes are on Ingham County. The results of this case will shape how Michigan’s solar future unfolds for years to come.",https://i0.wp.com/michigansolarpartners.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/pexels-photo-4320449.jpeg?fit=1200%2C674&ssl=1,N,,2025-10-24 14:59:55.227202

Atlanta-based Georgia Power yesterday announced the start of construction at its 200 MW/800 MWh BESS in Twiggs County, southeast of Macon, Georgia.

The utility will own the BESS, which is being built next to the Twiggs County Solar project by North Carolina-based construction company Crowder Industrial Construction, LLP.

Georgia Power said the BESS was selected via a tender as a result of its Integrated Resource Plan Update in 2023 and was approved by the Georgia Public Service Commission (PSC) last month.

The utility said it is already constructing the 49.5 MW Moody BESS in Lowndes County, near the Moody Air Force Base solar site, which is due in May; the 128 MW Robbins BESS, near the Robbins Air Force Base solar site in Bibb County, due June; the 530 MW phases I and II of its McGrau Ford BESS in Cherokee County, due October 2026 and September, respectively; and the 57.5 MW Hammond BESS on the retired Plant Hammond coal-fired power station site in Floyd County, due November next year.

The electric company is seeking Georgia PSC approval for more than 3.02 GW of energy storage capacity across 10 BESS and a further 350 MW of BESS project capacity at two solar-plus-storage sites and says it will tender for a further 500 MW of BESS with at least two hours of storage capacity. Bids will be due in that tender in “early 2026” with the projects to be delivered before 2032, the utility said.

Arizona

Out west, the Recurrent Energy business owned by Canadian Solar on Tuesday announced an $825 million finance package for energy storage and solar projects in Maricopa County, Arizona.

The construction finance loans and tax equity commitment will fund the under-construction, 600 MWh Desert Bloom Storage site and the 150 MW (AC) Papago Solar project. Recurrent did not separate out funding details for the separate facilities.

Both sites are due online before July and are being developed as part of a multi-project deal signed by Recurrent and utility Arizona Public Service (APS). They follow construction of the 1.2 GWh Papago Storage site which began operating in Maricopa County in July, under a 20-year “tolling agreement” with APS, by which the utility operates the site for the contract term.

Recurrent said German public lender Norddeutsche Landesbank Girozentrale; Japan’s Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group, Inc.; US rural banking network CoBank; and Germany’s Siemens Financial Services provided the construction finance element of the funding package. US banking giant Wells Fargo provided the tax equity commitment.

Dallas-based Primoris Services Corp. is providing engineering, procurement, and construction services for the Desert Bloom Storage site, Recurrent said.

More BESS?

And there could be more BESS on the way courtesy of Redwood’s latest funding round.

The Nevada-based company develops BESS, makes battery components, and produces critical raw materials cobalt, nickel, copper, lithium and cathode active material. Announcing the results of the Series E funding round yesterday, Redwood said the $350 million would be injected across its operations.

Stating its BESS can also be used to optimize electricity supply from natural gas turbines and nuclear, a press release issued by Redwood about the funding round said, “By combining deep materials and manufacturing expertise with advanced power electronics and software, Redwood is creating a new generation of US-made energy storage systems … reducing reliance on imported LFP [lithium iron phosphate] batteries.”

The biggest challenge remains accommodating AI data centers’ massive appetite for electricity.","The explosive growth in artificial intelligence (AI) has put Big Tech companies on a collision course with many rural communities that do not want massive data centers in their backyard. But while the speeding train of AI likely can’t be stopped, policymakers and AI executives have a responsibility to balance the interests of AI companies and everyday Americans – particularly when it comes to ensuring both have affordable, reliable energy.

Throughout the country, Big Tech companies are building or planning to construct more than 1,000 data centers to house all the servers needed to power the massive growth in AI. One researcher told The Epoch Times that “there are 1,827 active data centers in the United States, with another 1,726 announced and 419 currently under construction.”

Each of these centers needs land, water, and electricity to operate. Electricity prices have already risen faster than inflation since 2021, and are projected to increase more in the years ahead. Some of this increase is due to higher demand on utility companies from AI centers, according to BlockClub Chicago.

It should come as no surprise, then, that plans to build more data centers have run headlong into some opposition. In many cases, local citizens are speaking out against what they view as an encroachment in their communities, partially based on concerns about electric bills, competition for scarce water resources, and changes to the character of a community when massive warehouses are built where farmland or forests once stood.

These battles have serious political consequences as well. For example, voters kicked out officials in Warrenton, Virginia, who supported a new Amazon data center in 2024, according to Data Center Watch. That website also reported that “In Cascade Locks, Oregon, voters recalled two Port Authority officials in June 2023 for supporting a $100 million data center project from Roadhouse Digital… Following the recall election, the new board canceled the data center project in July 2023.” This spring, residents of Valparaiso, Indiana, also opposed even the possibility of a data center moving into their city, leading the developer to pull the idea.

But despite these victories for a few communities, the AI genie likely can’t be put back in the bottle – the industry is projected to quintuple in value in the next five years alone, according to one estimate. AI is now being used not just in sophisticated financial modeling and healthcare systems, but also by millions of Americans who use ChatGPT, Grok, or other platforms to look up recipes, help with homework, or organize their daily lives. AI is already an integral part of the U.S. economy.

But despite some tension, there is still hope that AI companies can coexist with the communities they build in – if they take some steps to listen to community members and invest in them.

The biggest challenge remains accommodating AI data centers’ massive appetite for electricity. According to NPR, “a typical AI data center uses as much electricity as 100,000 households, and the largest under development will consume 20 times more.” Multiplied out over thousands of data centers, that’s the equivalent of adding tens of millions of homes to the grid in just a few years.

While politicians continue to argue about the best way to meet this demand, what’s not up for debate is the looming energy crisis facing the country if no action is taken.

President Donald Trump has embraced this challenge head-on, promising on the campaign trail last year to “make America the dominant energy producer in the world by far.” Trump has advocated for an “all of the above” approach to energy that includes renewable projects as well as increasing production of oil and gas, restarting coal power plants, and reinvesting in nuclear. Recent advancements in small modular reactor technology and fusion breakthroughs have made nuclear energy particularly promising. This approach has the dual benefit of improving the reliability of the grid while also creating high-paying jobs.

In Indiana, the projected growth in AI energy use is expected to be larger than the output from coal plants which are slated to close. But this creates an opportunity, according to a white paper by Shashank Chandrakumara.

“Indiana can address this challenge by requiring data center companies to directly fund the redevelopment of coal plants that are nearing retirement or closure,” Chandrakumara wrote for the Indiana Policy Review. “By doing so, these companies can upgrade existing facilities to generate additional power and build new data centers near these sites.”

There is a public relations benefit to this as well, Chandrakumara predicts – the investments will “minimize community backlash.” And of course, investing in coal plants and keeping them open will create, or at least sustain, jobs in the local community. Residents may also be more inclined to live with a data center nearby if it means more job opportunities at a new nearby power plant.

He argues that this strategy, called “colocation,” can also address other concerns residents have about noise, pollution, and water usage by data centers. Since the companies are working at sites that have historically operated as industrial facilities, residents are familiar with how to handle some of these challenges – much like how one factory taking over another factory does not materially change the living situation for anyone in that community.

Nuclear energy advocates also believe that nuclear can meet the country’s increasing electricity demand. A blog post from Georgia Tech earlier this year argues that “nuclear power, with its high energy density and continuous operation, is well-suited to provide the steady base load of electricity required” for data centers.

Furthermore, AI can actually help mitigate some of the risks normally associated with nuclear power by making detection of potential problems easier, according to Erickson.

This is the model being used by Microsoft, which is working with a local energy company in Pennsylvania to reopen Three Mile Island, a nuclear facility in the Keystone State. The reopening of the plant, which closed in 2019 because of financial problems, is intended “to power the tech giant’s AI data centers” while creating jobs and billions of dollars in economic value, according to the Pennsylvania Capital-Star.

The situation is a win-win – Microsoft gets a steady supply of energy and hundreds of local residents will get jobs, along with potentially cheaper electricity, from the new deal.

The path forward for Big Tech companies and Americans who share a community with a data center does not have to be contentious. Instead of trampling over small towns and everyday people, Big Tech companies can win over residents by creating jobs and making investments themselves in the energy infrastructure. It is not a question of if new data centers will open up – but how they will do so in a way that promotes prosperity for all.",https://static-asset.amac.us/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/24092049/AI-Data-Center.jpg,N,,2025-10-24 12:04:59.555850

If you want to step out of the crowds, there are a few hidden gems inside the fairgrounds.

Old Grist Mill

For people going through Gate 8 of the North Carolina State Fairgrounds, there's a small gray mill that typically has a long line of people. This is the Old Grist Mill.

Daryl Spencer, the North Carolina Cornmillers president and owner and CEO of Buffaloe Milling, has been running the Old Grist Mill since the early 80s.

“I was one of the two people that put all the equipment in the middle here originally and got it running,” Spencer said.

He said that when he first saw the mill, despite the wheel spinning, it was not functional in producing cornmeal. After Spencer gave it a facelift, however, visitors can see how the mill actually works.

“We have a demonstration of actual stone-ground cornmeal with plexiglass around it where you can actually see the corn going into the middle of the stone coming out the edge,” Spencer said. “We take it back to sift and sift the brand. The brands, the outside part of the grain. It looks like a little fingernail. Get that out to make a better appearance when you cook product.”

No product is made at the mill, but the experience of exploring the mill and collecting a bag of grists, or hushpuppy mix, on the way out is a traditional N.C. State Fair experience.

“When people who walk through and eat a hushpuppy, maybe they’ll go home and they cook some,” Spencer said.

Either way you try these iconic hushpuppies, he is excited for people to try his product.

“I like to make people happy when they eat what I’ve cooked,” Spencer.

Flower & Garden Show

After you have your hushpuppies, head over to the Flower & Garden Show.

“I like to think of it as Disneyworld or Disneyland, but in Raleigh. For 11 days, you got 11 days of Disneyland out here,” said Daniel Danford, the Flower & Garden Show director.

Danford has been working at the Flower & Garden Show at the North Carolina State Fair for years. Carefully placing thousands of flowers across roughly five acres.

“It’s over 2,000 little plants I’ve planted this year. All in the beds throughout the gardens,” Danford said.

Not only has he been planting thousands of flowers, he has placed around 1,500 locally grown mums. Each year he makes a new arrangement with the potted flowers.

“I was looking at it and I was like, ‘You know what? They’d be really cool to do a quilt of mums,’” Danford said.

The centerpiece of it all is the mum tree, an iconic photo destination at the fair.

“Believe it or not, this was once the first mum tree in the country. When the guys developed it at N.C. State, there was no other thing like that,” Danford said.

There are also 26 gardens in competition in this area, which include student groups and professional categories. Each competing under a themed category.

“The beauty of it too is that the schools are separate from the adults. Everybody is a winner. All 26 gardens walk home with a ribbon and some kind of money prize,” Danford said.

Gourds, Bonsai, carved pumpkins, a Butterfly Barn, scarecrows and a very well-known big red chair for photos are just some of the other attractions at the Flower & Garden Show.

“This is the one place you can actually feel free to let your child’s hand go. Kids love it. They run around in the grass, and they roll around in the grass, and the parents will sit at the picnic tables keeping an eye on them, of course,” Danford said.

Inside the large tent near the mums are thousands of cut flowers in competition for the coveted blue ribbon, ranging from small arrangements to large Elephant ears.

Danford has also planted a sensory garden full of plants and herbs that are full of smells and different textures to touch, making sure everyone can experience the Flower & Garden Show.

“This partnership with Casey’s is key to expanding our presence in America’s heartland — a region that embodies the spirit and tenor of IONNA’s brand,” said Seth Cutler, CEO of Ionna. “With a shared respect and commitment to delivering quality customer experience, we are pleased to add Casey’s to our growing network of partners.”

Despite being the third-largest c-store retailer in the U.S., Casey’s has taken its EV expansion fairly slowly. The retailer has only brought chargers to about 42 sites since getting into alternative energy in 2018 through a partnership with Electric America. At the time, Casey’s was part of the charging company’s $500 million EV investment, which also brought chargers to Sheetz and Global Partners, among other retailers.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/jhitQZZq908m5VApszMLA1JAn8j0iShu5nONNMh0wa4/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9jYXNleXNfaW9ubmEuanBn.webp,N,,2025-10-24 11:25:36.351684

As of October 16, Democratic attorneys general from more than 20 states and Washington, D.C, have filed two lawsuits in response to the program closure.
""The Trump administration is trying to hold us in the past, tethered to fossil fuel companies,"" Bonta said in a call cited by Reuters.
""This decision will raise energy prices and slow the growth of the solar energy we need to fill demand, which is at an all-time high,"" said executive director Jason Walsh.
The plaintiffs are challenging that the administration violated federal law by rescinding ""congressionally obligated funds"" — funds already approved by Congress.","The Solar for All program, launched on Earth Day in 2024, was set to bring cleaner, more affordable energy to nearly a million low-income and disadvantaged households. But its promise was cut short when the $7 billion grant initiative was canceled following the passage of the Big Beautiful Bill. Now, close to two dozen states are suing the Trump administration, according to Reuters.

As of October 16, Democratic attorneys general from more than 20 states and Washington, D.C, have filed two lawsuits in response to the program closure. This comes after Lee Zeldin, administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, announced the termination of Solar for All in August, shortly after the funds were briefly unfrozen.

The initiative had been funded through the Inflation Reduction Act, passed under the previous administration, and it was intended to enable the installation of solar panels in communities across the country. But the project was designed to support more than just the clean energy transition away from polluting energy sources — its aims also included more resilient power grids, increased U.S. energy independence, a boost for local economies, and lower household electricity costs.

California Attorney General Rob Bonta said his state will lose about $250 million in federal funds, according to Reuters, while Arizona Attorney General Kris Mayes said her state's loss of $156 million would cause energy bills for more than 11,000 Arizona families to go up by 20 percent. Mayes also noted that marginalized communities in Northern Arizona, such as the Hopi Tribe, have lost a $25 million award to bring electricity and battery storage to hundreds of homes — some of which have never been connected to the grid.

""The Trump administration is trying to hold us in the past, tethered to fossil fuel companies,"" Bonta said in a call cited by Reuters. ""In doing so, Trump is making America more expensive and more polluted.""

According to a 2024 news release issued under the previous administration, the Solar for All grants were designed to improve equitable access to solar energy in order to advance environmental justice and save more than 900,000 American households $350 million annually. In fact, with tens of thousands of U.S. residents lacking safe and consistent access to electricity at home, the program was set to improve equitable access in general.

Job creation was envisioned as another benefit of Solar for All. Following its termination, the BlueGreen Alliance, a coalition of labor unions advocating for green jobs, released a statement saying the move is an attack on working families. ""This decision will raise energy prices and slow the growth of the solar energy we need to fill demand, which is at an all-time high,"" said executive director Jason Walsh.

The AGs' lawsuits are seeking both monetary damages and reinstatement of the program. The plaintiffs are challenging that the administration violated federal law by rescinding ""congressionally obligated funds"" — funds already approved by Congress. A group of unions, nonprofits, and homeowners has also separately sued the administration for the program termination.

While a legal battle over vast sums may ensue, some states, cities, and homeowners have already been taking matters into their own hands. Some residents have been able to leverage more local funding and make at-home panel installation happen. Others are signing up for community solar programs to save money and reduce their environmental footprints.

Communities are coming together in other ways too. For example, in Maine — which happens to be one of the states involved in the lawsuits — the Center for an Ecology-Based Economy has been hosting monthly ""energy cafés"" so locals can get together to learn about home solar and other cleaner, more affordable energy options.",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/zqc2Sc9iBeGKIAm6N8Qt9Q--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD02NzU7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_cool_down_737/3df31305152b7de4a5f1f641ebdd26e0,N,,2025-10-24 13:07:27.114598

Riverside County Sheriff Chad Bianco, a Republican, stood apart from the three other candidates — all Democrats — at the California Economic Summit by challenging whether the spate of devastating wildfires in California is linked to climate change, and labeling some environmental activists “terrorists.”

After a few audience members shouted at Bianco over his “terrorists” comment, the Democratic candidates seized on the moment to reaffirm their own beliefs about the warming planet.

“The impacts of climate change are proven and undeniable,” said Tony Thurmond, a Democrat and California superintendent of public instruction. “You can call them what you want. That’s our new normal.”

The fires “do have a relationship with climate change,” said former Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa.

Besides environmental issues, the hour-and-a-half forum at the business-centric California Forward’s Economic Summit focused primarily on “checkbook” topics as the candidates, which also included former state Controller Betty Yee, offered gloomy statistics about poverty and homelessness in California.

Given the forum’s location in the Central Valley, the agricultural industry and rural issues were front and center.

Bianco harped on the state and the Democratic leaders for California’s handling of water management and gasoline prices. At one point, he told the audience that he felt like he was in the “Twilight Zone” after the Democrats on stage pitched ways to raise revenue.

Other candidates in California‘s 2026 governor’s race, including former Secretary of Health and Human Services Xavier Becerra and former Rep. Katie Porter, were not present at Thursday’s debate. Former Assembly Majority Leader Ian Calderon planned to come, but his flight from Los Angeles was delayed, audience members were told.

All are vying to lead a state facing ongoing budget deficits caused by overspending. A state Legislative Analyst’s Office report released this month cited projected annual operating deficits ranging from roughly $15 billion to $25 billion through 2029. At the same time, federal cutbacks by the Trump administration to programs for needy Californians, including the state’s Medi-Cal healthcare program, will put more pressure on the state’s resources.

All of the candidates had different pitches during the afternoon event. Asked by moderator Jeanne Kuang, a CalMatters reporter, about ways to help rural communities, Thurmond cited his plan to build housing on surplus property owned by schools. He also repeatedly talked about extending tax credits or other subsidies to groups, including day-care providers.

Yee, discussing the wildfires, spoke on hardening homes and creating an industry around fire-proofing the state. Yee received applause when she questioned why there wasn’t more discussion about education in the governor’s race.

Villaraigosa cited his work finding federal funds to build rail and subway lines across Los Angeles and suggested that he would focus on growing the state’s power grid and transportation infrastructure.

Both the former mayor and Yee at points sided with Bianco when they complained about the “over-regulation” by the state, including restrictions on developers, builders and small businesses.

Few voters are probably paying much attention to the contest, with the battle over Proposition 50 dominating headlines and campaign spending.

Voters on Nov. 4 will decide whether to support the proposition, which is a Democratic-led effort to gerrymander California’s congressional districts to try and blunt President Trump’s attempt to rig districts in GOP-led states to retain control of the House of Representatives.

“Frankly, nobody’s focused on the governor’s race right now,” Yee said at an event last week.",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/793d9d9/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1600x840+0+380/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F45%2F64%2F496112ca46c49b9629288d285b0d%2Fbianco-thurmond-villaraigosa-yee.jpg,N,,2025-10-24 10:03:12.702171

The investment is the largest in Stellantis's American history and appears to be a strategic response, given challenging market conditions, including tariffs that have impacted competitors.

The financial commitment is to be spread across the next four years, with a focus on expanding Stellantis's manufacturing footprint and launching new vehicles.

Stellantis is targeting a 50% increase in yearly vehicle production and the creation of over 5,000 jobs across Illinois, Ohio, Michigan and Indiana.

Antonio Filosa, Chief Executive Officer at Stellantis, says the investment supports a customer-first approach and ensures Stellantis strengthens its position in a key global market.

""This investment in the US – the single largest in Stellantis's history – will boost our growth, strengthen our manufacturing footprint and bring more American jobs to the states we call home,"" Antonio explains.

""Accelerating growth in the US has been a top priority since my first day. Success in America is not just good for Stellantis in the US – it makes us stronger everywhere.""

The multi-billion-dollar injection is set to fund five new vehicle launches, the development of a new four-cylinder engine and ongoing powertrain updates.

According to Stellantis, 19 refreshed vehicle models are on track for introduction across its US assembly network through to 2029.

Michigan's role in EV and ICE production

Stellantis has outlined two commitments in Michigan. The Warren Truck Assembly Plant is set to be retooled to produce a new range-extended EV alongside an internal combustion engine (ICE) large SUV. This dual drivetrain approach aligns with Stellantis's stated strategy to provide customers with a choice of products during the transition to electrification.

This programme is scheduled to begin in 2028 and will receive a US$100m investment, creating more than 900 new jobs at the plant that currently builds the Jeep Wagoneer and Grand Wagoneer.

Additionally, Stellantis has confirmed a US$130m investment to prepare the Detroit Assembly Complex – Jefferson for the production of the next-generation Dodge Durango.

This vehicle is planned for a 2029 launch and continues Stellantis's stated goal from 1 January 2025 to keep investing in legacy models while introducing newer alternatives.

Powertrain and legacy model investment

In Indiana, Stellantis' focus is on powertrain technology. Stellantis plans to produce the GMET4 EVO, a new four-cylinder engine, across several Kokomo facilities.

These upgrades total more than US$100m and will add over 100 manufacturing jobs.

This move could ensure the US becomes the main production hub for a core power unit central to the engine roadmap for Stellantis, which could be important for future hybrid models.

In Illinois, Stellantis plans to invest more than US$400m to support the production of an all-new midsize truck in Ohio.

The model will be built at the Toledo Assembly Complex alongside the Jeep Wrangler and Jeep Gladiator. Production is expected to start in 2028 and could create over 900 new jobs.

In Illinois, Stellantis plans to invest more than US$600m to reopen the Belvidere Assembly Plant, which closed in 2023.

The facility is set to restart operations in 2027 to produce the Jeep Cherokee and Jeep Compass, which is forecast to create about 3,300 jobs in the region.",https://assets.bizclikmedia.net/1200/e5dd6c2b1878f81371cd7ef570e793d8:6f5243ae9d2c7e2f499f86d24da4f666/gettyimages-2177457677.jpg.jpg,N,,2025-10-24 10:03:20.648006

In the same week that graced us with the news that about five million Brits would enjoy dynamic electricity prices depending on sunshine and wind, Centrica, the owner of British Gas, added one more cause for celebration in the hothouse for insanity that the British Isles have become, by saying it was launching a net-zero academy to train thousands and thousands of engineers for the transition because there was such hunger for clean energy jobs.

All this sounds like it would be a good idea to declare a one-week national holiday for the populace to rejoice in the progress towards a greener, cleaner future. Alas, some silly House of Commons committee went and ruined it with a report warning that clean energy jobs were failing to offset job losses in the Scottish oil and gas industry so maybe, just maybe, the powers that be could slow down the murder of said industry. Side note, assume there are quote marks around clean energy. I just can’t be bothered to click on the quote marks button so often.

We’ve discussed the topic of a real-life case study in energy transition more than once here and I believe we all agree that the UK is an excellent candidate. Germany is one, too, but there is a language barrier there, alas, so I’m focusing my research interests on the UK.

So, first things first. E.on has announced it would now track its customers’ smart meters every 30 minutes and adjust their rates based on the balance between demand and supply of electricity, which in turn would depend on the output of wind and solar installations. I don’t know about you, but my heart rate surged at the mere thought of having my electricity rate spike like the ECG of a chronic arrhythmiac every time a cloud passes over while I’m trying to bake bread or do the laundry. That’s the sort of excitement I don’t think many of us need in their lives yet five million will be getting just that. Whatever doesn’t kill you makes you stronger and all that.

The brains behind that idea are promoting it as “giving people more control over the way they manage their bills and providing opportunities for them to save money” so “we can enable the UK to make the best use of the vast amounts of electricity we’re generating.” This comes from a wind lobbyist and it would’ve been adorable if it wasn’t so utterly disgusting.

While people learn to do laundry at night, Centrica is hard at work securing the professionals who would be fitting their new smart meters, solar panels, and heat pumps. They’re calling them engineers and while I’m the last one to argue that engineering is a mentality rather than a job, I would like to point out that mentality still needs a few years at a higher education institution to fully blossom so, no, these would not be engineers.

The people who Centrica wants to be training at its academy, would be technicians. I see nothing wrong with the word. A technician is a respectable thing to be — unless what we have is a roundabout way of saying the future workforce of the UK energy system does not need higher education in engineering. It’s enough to learn how to install a heat pump. But also, “The academy will have a full size “eco house” to demonstrate how all of the skills and capabilities of Centrica’s workforce come together to deliver the home of the future.” With the help of half a dozen labs because labs make the whole thing sound so much more serious.

So, about those clean jobs that Centrica would be adding — they are likely to create a surplus of engineers, meaning technicians, because demand is falling short of expectations, at least according to the Scottish Affairs Committee at the common, as it were, chamber of the UK parliament.

Here’s what the committee had to say about it: “We are concerned that the scale-up of clean energy projects is taking longer than expected and is progressing slower than the decline of the oil and gas industry. We found that clean energy jobs are not being created at the pace or the scale required to match the job losses arising from the decline of the North Sea oil and gas industry.”

Funny, that. Brits were promised many millions of clean jobs or, if not millions, then at least 400,000 by 2030. From their very own mouths: “Clean energy will bring 400,000 extra jobs by 2030, with high demand for roles including plumbers, electricians and welders.” Oh, you’re laughing at the classification of welders and plumbers as clean job professionals, are you? If plumbers are not in the clean job business, I dare you to tell me who is.

It gets even better: “Our plans will help create an economy in which there is no need to leave your hometown just to find a decent job. Thanks to this government’s commitment to clean energy, a generation of young people in our industrial heartlands can have well-paid secure jobs, from plumbers to electricians and welders,” per the assortment of cells that the UK has for an energy secretary. It seems there’s a major shortage of plumbers and welders in the UK.

I really don’t know what the Scottish Affairs Committee is so worried about. I mean, jobs are being created at breakneck speed and they’re fetching much higher salaries as well — up to 23% higher for an entry-level position compared with other sectors. That must be because clean energy is so much cheaper than dirty energy.

Just as I was enjoying the vision of a green, clean, cheap UK, along came the BBC and wrote this, “In a new report, the Tony Blair Institute says if the transition to renewable energy “continues in a way that raises costs, weakens reliability and weakens growth, it will fail both practically and politically”.” Oh.

This section of highway can now charge electric cars as they drive.","A new type of highway in the United States is changing the way in which people see electric cars. In the state of Michigan, a part of the highway has been created that can charge electric vehicles while they are on the road — without stopping at a charging station.

For years, one of the main issues about electric cars has been the lack of charging stations and the fear of drivers running out of battery on the road. However, with this new highway this issue could disappear in the future. So, let’s see how this highway works.

Challenges of electric cars

Electric cars are a great alternative to gasoline or diesel cars because they emit way less CO₂ and are better for the environment. But they are not as popular as traditional cars yet. The main reasons for this are:

The cost of buying an electric car is still higher than a regular car.

Charging stations are not available everywhere, especially outside big cities.

Range anxiety, or the fear of running out of battery before reaching a charger, keeps many people from switching to electric.

For people who don’t have a charger at home, finding a charging station can become a complicated task and when they do they tend to be full of cars. So, all of this makes electric cars seem less practical than gasoline ones. However, a new smart highway could change everything.

The company behind this highway

The company Electreon is responsible for this huge advance. While other known brands like Tesla focus on manufacturing electric cars, Electron is working on improving the infrastructure those cars need to work better.

Electron is expert at wireless charging for electric vehicles, so cars equipped with Electreon’s system can charge automatically when they’re on a special road. The company offers 3 types of charging:

Dynamic charging, which happens while the vehicle is moving.

Semi-dynamic charging, which occurs when a car is stopped temporarily, for example at a red light.

Stationary charging, when a vehicle is parked.

Charging while driving

Electreon has already installed wireless charging coils under a section of road on 14th Street in Detroit, Michigan. This section of highway can now charge electric cars as they drive. It works with induction technology, where energy is transferred wirelessly from coils under the pavement to receivers installed in the cars. Drivers don’t have to plug in or stop to recharge — the car gets power simply by moving along the road.

New collaborations

After the success of this first charging highway, Electron has partnered with the company Xos, Inc., which manufactures commercial electric vehicles. Together, both companies are including wireless charging technology in these vehicles, which means a great change for transport companies that could:

Lower the total cost of ownership for companies.

Reduce the number of vehicles needed in each fleet.

Improve efficiency with underground charging systems that save time and space.

Michigan

The Project is scheduled for completion in 2027, contingent upon the timely completion of funding and offtake agreements. Upon the Company achieving a secured feed from its sources in Brazil and Chile, the Project will become the first HREE separation plant in the U.S. with an integrated HREE feed from two ionic clay deposits in friendly jurisdictions, which deposits are expected to be in operation by in mid-2028. Designed as a comprehensive solution for rare earths, the Project is expected to produce high-purity Dysprosium, Terbium, and other restricted HREEs and light rare earths, essential for advanced technologies such as electric vehicles, wind turbines, drones, and robotics. Provided the achievement of full production, Aclara anticipates being able to supply more than 75% of the U.S. requirements of DyTb for electric vehicles by 2028. Annual production upon the successful development of the Company’s ionic clay deposits in Brazil and Chile is anticipated to be 200 tpy, 30 tpy and 1,400 tpy of separated high-purity oxides, representing approximately 14% of China’s official DyTb production. The State of Louisiana is supporting the Project with an estimated $46.4M in tax incentives and grants. Aclara will invest approximately $277M to develop the Project on an 82-acre Louisiana Economic Development certified site at the Port of Vinton. The site offers direct road and waterway access via the Gulf Intracoastal Waterway and proximity to chlor-alkali facilities, with the LED Certified designation allowing for immediate industrial development and fast-track construction. The Company is also planning an additional investment to construct a metals and alloys plant on the property, to support the high-performance permanent magnet industry. The separation technology being developed by Aclara is designed with scalability in mind, allowing potential capacity expansion to process material from other ionic clay deposits or compatible feedstocks in the future. Hatch has been retained to develop the engineering of the Project in addition to its work relating to the Company’s Carina project located in the State of Goias, Brazil, ensuring strong coordination across projects, driving cost efficiencies, and optimizing schedules, with an aim to reduce execution risk. Aclara is collaborating with Virginia Tech to validate its proprietary separation process through a pilot plant whose construction is currently underway and expected to be fully operational by Q1 2026. By the time production is expected to start at the Louisiana plant, Aclara expects to have accumulated approximately 1.5 years of feed-specific operational data that will serve to accelerate the ramp-up, optimize efficiency and maintain steady-state operations. Once secured feed is achieved, the Project will become the only HREE separation facility in the United States that is integrated with ionic-clay deposits from friendly jurisdictions, ensuring the reliable production of significant quantities of HREEs. Aclara’s simultaneous optimization of mining and separation processes provides a competitive advantage among ionic clay developers and accelerates project execution. Significant progress has been achieved at the Company’s Goiania pilot plant to enhance the purity of the mixed rare earth carbonate that will supply the Louisiana separation facility upon successful production from the Carina Project. The Carina Pre-Feasibility Study, prepared by Hatch, is scheduled for publication in early November 2025, with the Feasibility Study expected in Q2 2026.

Holding a PhD in geography and geoinformatics, Marcel has made significant contributions to solar energy through science and peer-reviewed research.","However, as the solar sector evolves in response to real-time market demands, volatile pricing and increasingly complex grid requirements, this once-reliable metric is no longer sufficient on its own. A new paradigm is emerging – one that prioritises quality over theoretical maximum output, and focuses on the optimal performance of the PV power plant, the timely delivery of energy and long-term operational resilience.

PV performance becomes the new standard – encompassing not just how much energy a plant can produce, but when, how reliably and how profitably it can do so.

The limitations of energy yield as a standalone metric

While annual energy yield remains a technically meaningful parameter, its relevance in business modelling and real-world operations is limited. Historically, developers could assume that all energy generated would be sold at a predictable price, regardless of when it was delivered. Under those conditions, maximising total annual production was a logical goal. This is no longer the case.

In today’s competitive energy market, the value of electricity is highly volatile. Energy generated during periods of low demand or high offer may reach negligible prices – or may not be accepted at all. Worse, energy delivered outside of contractual delivery windows in power purchase agreements (PPAs) can lead to financial penalties. In short, a high theoretical yield does not guarantee commercial success.

Modern PPAs and grid codes increasingly require alignment between forecasted and actual production, often down to hourly or sub-hourly intervals. PV asset owners and operators are now directly responsible for forecasting accuracy and delivery performance, particularly during peak demand windows or critical grid events. Deviations from forecast can lead to financial penalties, dispatch curtailment or additional balancing charges.

As a result, performance – defined as the ability of a PV power plant to consistently deliver energy at the right time, under real-world conditions and in line with market or contractual expectations – has emerged as a more actionable and financially relevant metric. This shift has significant implications for PV system design, monitoring and forecasting.

Accurate forecasting is central to succeeding in performance-based markets. In many regions, deviations from intraday and day-ahead forecasts can lead to financial penalties or curtailment. For that reason, developers and investors face greater pressure to design projects that are predictable, resilient and where performance simulations and financial models match the new reality.

Designing for optimal PV performance

To optimise for real-time performance, PV systems must be designed not just for maximum annual output, but for temporal alignment, weather resilience and long-term system health.

Temporal alignment

Optimal PV performance begins with aligning the system’s output with realtime demand. Rather than peaking at noon, when wholesale electricity prices are typically the lowest, a well-designed plant maximises production during periods when demand and prices spike. This shift is increasingly important in markets with time-of-use tariffs, dynamic pricing or capacity-based incentives.

One of the most effective ways to meet the temporal demand is by integrating battery energy storage systems (BESS). While PV generation is inherently tied to solar availability during the day, BESS enables time-shifting of energy delivery to match it with higher-value periods, such as early evening hours. This flexibility not only enhances profitability in markets with variable pricing but also supports grid stability and improves the overall dispatchability of solar energy.

When properly sized and integrated into the system design, BESS can transform a PV power plant from a passive generator into a responsive energy asset.

BESS integration also requires adjustments in the system design and modelling, including dispatch strategies and energy forecasts. Accurate simulation of charge/discharge cycles is essential for optimal sizing of inverters and system availability. Degradation modelling becomes more complex as cycling patterns impact both battery life and long-term system output.

Additionally, revenue stacking – combining energy arbitrage with services, such as frequency regulation, capacity payments or grid balancing – further underscores the need for high-resolution data. Without it, the economic modelling of hybrid PV+BESS systems remains incomplete and potentially misleading.

Resilience to critical events

Many PV system designs still rely on the use of TMY (Typical Meteorological Year) datasets, which only provide ‘typical’ or ‘average’ weather conditions, obscuring the risk of extreme weather events, such as sudden temperature changes or strong winds. Figure 1 shows the difference in actual wind speed versus wind speed as recorded as TMY.

This may lead to inverter overloads, overvoltage, shutdowns or even damage. For example, if events of very low air temperature are not accounted for in the design, overvoltage can occur – causing system faults or hardware damage. Such technical failures can undermine a project’s performance and jeopardise the PV power plant’s financial viability.

Designing for resilience also means anticipating non-meteorological stress factors that are amplified during critical events, such as grid-induced voltage spikes, mechanical strain from thermal cycling or increased soiling after sandstorms or wildfires. These risks can be mitigated through better inverter protection settings, thermally tolerant cable routing, reinforced mounting systems and adaptive cleaning schedules.

Just as engineers design bridges for 100-year floods, PV systems must be specified for rare but plausible operational extremes – not just average conditions. In the context of long-term performance guarantees and insurance coverage, the return on resilience-focused design is substantial.

System health and longevity

Integral to PV performance is long-term asset health. There are a large number of solar power plants that under-deliver against expectations. Poor design choices can cause thermal or electrical stress, accelerating the degradation of modules and inverters. When solar power plants underperform due to preventable wear and tear, it signals a misalignment between design assumptions and realworld conditions.

Investors are increasingly focused on this alignment. A project with a strong theoretical yield is no longer enough – financial stakeholders now demand more robust modelling of PV performance. That means more than just P50 and P90 yearly energy production estimates. Figure 2 demonstrates some of the factors affecting energy loss that can be reported on at PV projects.

In today’s high-stakes environment, where electricity markets are volatile, and operational risks are more visible, the emphasis has shifted from theoretical output to real-world resilience. Lenders and insurers want to see simulations that take into account variability, extremes and uncertainty. Investors expect to see credible simulations based on realistic meteorological data and risk mitigation strategies.

This trend also reflects the growing importance of performance stability over time. Investors understand that a solar project with a high theoretical yield may still underperform financially if its output is misaligned with market pricing, or if it is vulnerable to curtailments, voltage issues or environmental stressors.

What can PV developers do to ensure optimal PV design?

PV developers must move beyond outdated, empirical models and low-resolution datasets. This includes using advanced PV simulation software that works with highresolution time series data instead of the hourly TMY datasets.

High-resolution 15-minute time series data capture temporal variability and enable more accurate modelling of real-world operating conditions. It can better capture site-specific conditions and model the system behaviour more accurately, resulting in PV designs that reflect actual operating conditions and support modern business models. Figure 3 includes a graph showing soiling losses at a project site.

Another critical layer is software built on advanced physical modelling. Technologies, such as ray tracing and the Perez all-weather model, enable more accurate calculation of shading in complex terrain or densely packed layouts. Unlike the simplified view factor model, ray tracing simulates the exact path of sunlight through a 3D environment, making it possible to accurately model PV output for bifacial PV systems and uneven surfaces.

Factors such as soiling and snow losses also have a significant impact on PV performance, particularly in dry, dusty, or high-latitude environments.

Software solutions must be capable of simulating soiling losses dynamically, based on site-specific, high resolution time series data, PV model configuration and local weather conditions such as wind and precipitation. Realistic modelling of soiling losses helps developers schedule cleaning and maintenance more effectively.

Ultimately, these improvements result in a more accurate PV output estimation, reducing the gap between projected and actual performance. For bankability assessments, that accuracy is essential.

Performance as a strategic advantage

The goal is to build PV systems that are healthy, reliable and profitable. In today’s market, a high performing solar asset is one that delivers energy when it’s most valuable, withstands operational stress and is long-term efficient. Designing for that reality is no longer optional; it’s the new standard.

As energy markets grow more dynamic and expectations rise, stakeholders across the value chain, from developers to financiers to grid operators, will increasingly demand performance-oriented metrics. Those who embrace this shift early will be best positioned to thrive in the next generation of solar energy projects.

Being able to predict and consistently deliver energy, not just in quantity, but at the right time and under the right conditions, is becoming a core differentiator for PV projects. Advanced forecasting and PV evaluation lead to better decisions and healthy PV assets that are ready for active collaboration with electricity markets.

The total cost of the projects cancelled in the private sector in 2025 amounted to $24 billion, as per the report.
In total, about 3,000 workers lost their jobs due to cancellations and scale-backs in September, bringing the total number of job losses tied to abandoned clean energy projects this year to 21,000.
Speaking about the scenario, E2 Communications Director Michael Timberlake said, “The loss of these projects isn’t just a setback for clean energy - it’s a setback for America’s workers and competitiveness.
Overall, E2 has tracked 415 major clean energy projects launched since the tax credits took effect, spanning 42 states and Puerto Rico.","According to the latest analysis from E2 (Environmental Entrepreneurs) and the Clean Economy Tracker, the US clean energy sector saw another blow this September, with companies calling off or downsizing large-scale projects worth nearly $1.6 billion. The total cost of the projects cancelled in the private sector in 2025 amounted to $24 billion, as per the report.

The private-sector cancellations have impacted battery, storage, and electric vehicle (EV) manufacturing in Kansas, Michigan, North Carolina, and Tennessee. These losses are in addition to the US Department of Energy's recent withdrawal of $8 billion in funding for over 200 public-sector projects nationwide.

In total, about 3,000 workers lost their jobs due to cancellations and scale-backs in September, bringing the total number of job losses tied to abandoned clean energy projects this year to 21,000.

Many of the cancellations came from automakers adjusting their EV production plans. For instance, General Motors scaled back 2 EV production lines in Tennessee and Kansas, impacting roughly 1,600 workers. Meanwhile, sodium-ion battery startup Natron Energy announced that it would cease operations altogether – closing a $40 million plant in Michigan that had 150 workers, and shelving plans for a $1.4 billion facility in North Carolina that would have employed around 1,000 people.

Speaking about the scenario, E2 Communications Director Michael Timberlake said, “The loss of these projects isn’t just a setback for clean energy - it’s a setback for America’s workers and competitiveness. For every cancelled factory or downsized plant, behind the scenes many more projects are not being announced at all as more capital flees and businesses look overseas to invest instead. That means fewer paychecks, less local investment, and fewer opportunities for US workers to lead in the industries of the future. While other nations are racing ahead to capture the clean energy economy, these cancellations leave American communities falling further behind.”

However, amid the pullback, new investments worth $542 million were announced in September. These include EV and solar parts manufacturing facilities, and grid infrastructure projects designed to support the energy demands of expanding AI data centers. Collectively, these ventures are expected to create about 985 new permanent jobs.

Overall, E2 has tracked 415 major clean energy projects launched since the tax credits took effect, spanning 42 states and Puerto Rico. Together, companies have pledged roughly $135 billion in new investments and committed to hiring 125,000 permanent workers.",https://media.assettype.com/taiyangnews%2F2025-10-24%2F180ylphs%2FUS-clean-energy-suffers-setback.jpg?w=1200&ar=40%3A21&auto=format%2Ccompress&ogImage=true&mode=crop&enlarge=true&overlay=false&overlay_position=bottom&overlay_width=100,N,,2025-10-24 13:07:19.415219

Panelists said they must move forward on their goals even if the federal government won't.

""At this moment in Boston, we don't have the luxury to ignore the science, to ignore the reality on the ground,"" Boston Chief Climate Officer Brian Swett said at The Westin Boston Seaport District hotel Tuesday morning.

Earlier this month, the Trump administration canceled more than $7.5B in Biden-era grants to support hundreds of clean energy projects, according to the U.S. Department of Energy. Massachusetts had been slated for approximately $466M in grants for more than two dozen projects across the state.

The climate goals in Greater Boston are among the most ambitious across the country. Boston is requiring all buildings to hit net-zero emissions by 2050. Cambridge requires nonresidential buildings of 100K SF or more to reduce emissions by 2026 and be net-zero by 2035.

Swett said that climate action has been led, historically, at the city and state levels. That changed when the Biden administration began funding thousands of climate-related projects across the country, he said.

The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 included many tax incentives for sustainable development of green buildings. In 2023, the Biden administration also awarded up to $7B to several communities in an attempt to jump-start hydrogen power usage.

""The Biden administration obviously flipped the switch,"" Swett said. ""It was almost overwhelming at times.""

Swett said the city’s climate agenda needs to move forward amid the political headwinds. Even as these federal grants are being pulled, Swett said he is determined to keep projects on track and prepare for when national priorities swing back in their favor.

""We will continue to operate locally with state partners,"" Swett said. ""When the pendulum flips back eventually, we'll be ready to take advantage of federal resources.""

Julie Wormser, chief climate officer for the city of Cambridge, said policy windows open and close all the time. It is on state and city officials to be proactive and work through an unfavorable administration's policies to get the work done, she said.

City governments have several avenues to pursue to streamline climate change projects. These include creating regulatory markets and government procurement for climate technologies and streamlining the siting process for energy projects, Wormser said.

""Whether we can fully move forward on them or not, we can be just as busy now,"" Wormser said. ""What will stop us more than the federal government is a loss of hope and momentum, because there's still plenty to do.""

As cities push forward, developers are hoping future planning and action can be more streamlined across the board.

Massachusetts cities have various goals for sustainability initiatives, making it confusing for owners that operate in multiple places, Davis Cos. Senior Vice President of Construction Gretchen McGill said.

The Davis Cos. operates in Cambridge, Boston and Watertown. Each city either has or has proposed different sustainability guidelines and goals.

Watertown city officials proposed their own set of regulations to reach net-zero emissions, but the town hit pause on the ordinance after objections from the business community.

""As we go forward, it would be really helpful if we could have a consolidated state consensus on how we're going to do this,"" McGill said. ""There are some big-picture things that we would really like some clarity on.”

The state only requires owners to report energy use data for buildings of 20K SF or more, starting this year. The requirement only covers roughly 30,000 buildings statewide.

Although the state doesn't yet have set guidelines for owners to reduce emissions, that could change. Mandates and potential emission limits could soon be implemented statewide, AHA Consulting Engineers Director of Energy and Sustainability Katie Raymond said.

""When we have our conversations with our owners, who are not necessarily just from Boston and Cambridge but also statewide, we're … thinking about what's coming in the very near future,"" Raymond said.",https://cdn.bisnow.net/fit?height=1200&type=jpeg&url=https%3A%2F%2Fs3.amazonaws.com%2Fcdn.bisnow.net%2Fcontent%2Fimages%2F2025%2F01%2F679a79da978cc-2023-0323-boston_university_center_of_computing_and_data_science.jpeg&width=1200&sign=F5MQBTwtcbWL6YCHViiaJPHJjnV7wQXNdj5ZJXjk0wQ,N,,2025-10-24 11:04:09.718756

The announcement does not confirm whether all of the locations mentioned are planned to have five Hyperchargers and thus ten charging points.
By the end of this year, there should be over 1,000 charging points – meaning there are still 100 charging points to go to reach this goal.","The foundation stone for the Ionna charging parks, known as ‘Rechargery’, has already been laid at eight Casey’s locations in six states. They are scheduled to open in 2025. ‘Starting this year, drivers will be able to charge their electric vehicles at fast, reliable 400 kW charging points while enjoying the comfort, convenience and community that make Casey’s a trusted destination,’ according to Ionna’s announcement. The partnership is then to be expanded further, but no specific number of locations or charging points has been mentioned.

The first eight locations are Little Rock in Arkansas, Vernon Hills and McHenry (both in Illinois), Terre Haute in Indiana, Parkville and Kearney in Missouri, Blackwell in Oklahoma and Waco in Texas. A rendering of one such location shows five covered charging stations, each with two charging points. At least in the rendering, these are Alpitronic’s Hyperchargers, probably the HYC400 with a charging capacity of up to 400 kW. The announcement does not confirm whether all of the locations mentioned are planned to have five Hyperchargers and thus ten charging points.

Instead, Ionna provides an assessment of the current pace of expansion. With the eight locations at Casey’s, the Ionna network comprises more than 900 charging stations in operation or under construction, “representing an increase of over 100 per cent in three months.” The number of locations under contract has also increased by 20 per cent since July – Ionna has entered into further location partnerships with Wawa and the restaurant and convenience store chain Sheetz, for example.

Ionna opened its first location in Apex, North Carolina, in February 2025. By the end of this year, there should be over 1,000 charging points – meaning there are still 100 charging points to go to reach this goal. According to earlier statements, the Ionna fast-charging network is expected to grow to over 30,000 fast-charging points by 2030 – a target that is reiterated in the current announcement. Despite the current changing situation in the US market, Ionna has not yet revised this target.

“This partnership with Casey’s is key to expanding our presence in America’s heartland — a region that embodies the spirit and tenor of IONNA’s brand,” said Ionna CEO Seth Cutler. “With a shared respect and commitment to delivering quality customer experience, we are pleased to add Casey’s to our growing network of partners.”",https://www.electrive.com/media/2025/10/ionna-caseys-ladestationen-hpc-usa-2025.jpg,N,,2025-10-24 08:17:43.006010

The Scottish Affairs Committee has demanded urgent action after warning that the creation of clean energy jobs is being outstripped by the pace of oil and gas job losses.
It highlighted that 5,000 jobs a year are currently being lost across the UK North Sea workforce, and said that without intervention, the decline of the industry will accelerate.
The report also calls for a more pragmatic approach to North Sea licensing, urging the UK Government to clarify how developers can undertake additional drilling activity under existing exploration licences.
It concludes: “Without reform, the current tax regime will accelerate the decline of the North Sea oil and gas industry and its supply chain.","A new approach to North Sea licensing and reforms of the windfall tax on oil and gas profits are needed to tackle mass job losses in the industry, according to a Labour-led Westminster committee.

The Scottish Affairs Committee has demanded urgent action after warning that the creation of clean energy jobs is being outstripped by the pace of oil and gas job losses.

It highlighted that 5,000 jobs a year are currently being lost across the UK North Sea workforce, and said that without intervention, the decline of the industry will accelerate.

MPs on the cross-party committee argued there are “compelling arguments” for maintaining higher levels of domestic production to reduce reliance on imports and keep skilled supply chain jobs in Scotland.

The report also calls for a more pragmatic approach to North Sea licensing, urging the UK Government to clarify how developers can undertake additional drilling activity under existing exploration licences.

Ahead of next month’s Budget, the committee warns that the downturn in the industry will deepen unless there is urgent reform of the Energy Profits Levy, which it says has created uncertainty and risked driving investment overseas.

It concludes: “Without reform, the current tax regime will accelerate the decline of the North Sea oil and gas industry and its supply chain. Reforms to the temporary tax, initially introduced in 2022, should be implemented as soon as possible to create certainty for the industry.”

Committee chair Patricia Ferguson MP said: “Today's report outlines our concerns that jobs from the clean energy industry are simply not being created fast enough, or on the scale needed, to match the mounting job losses from the oil and gas sector.

“It’s vital that the government moves quickly to plug this employment gap, replace jobs being lost and ensure a smooth energy transition for workers and communities. Until this is tackled, the government should avoid making decisions that would further accelerate oil and gas production’s decline.”

The report also cites the closure of the Grangemouth oil refinery as a failure of transition planning, concluding that both the UK and Scottish Governments “should have acted sooner to prepare for resulting job losses.”

Russell Borthwick, Chief Executive of AGCC, who gave evidence to the committee, said: “This report is a much-needed dose of reality and validates what industry and communities in the North-east have been saying for years.

“The UK Government now faces a clear choice - it can manage our substantial remaining North Sea reserves in a way that protects jobs, skills and energy security, or it can let this national asset collapse faster than the industries that are meant to replace it. One is a transition, the other is a cliff edge.

“Cutting domestic production only increases reliance on imported LNG with four times the carbon footprint. The government must therefore act now to remove the Energy Profits Levy and back a managed transition that keeps investment, tax revenue and talent here in the UK.”",https://agcc.fra1.digitaloceanspaces.com/images/_1200x630_crop_center-center_none/shutterstock_2409620571-1.jpg,N,,2025-10-24 10:19:34.867959

The facility will strengthen U.S. supply chain independence by producing heavy rare earth elements essential to a wide range of leading technologies.

Construction is expected to be completed by the end of 2027.

VINTON, La. – Aclara Resources Inc. announced a $277 million investment to construct the first U.S. heavy rare earth separation facility at the Port of Vinton in Calcasieu Parish, establishing Louisiana as a leader in sustainable rare earth production and strengthening the nation’s advanced technology supply chain.

The company is expected to create 140 direct new jobs at its first U.S. location. Louisiana Economic Development estimates the project will result in an additional 456 indirect jobs, for a total of 596 potential new job opportunities in the Southwest Region.

“By choosing Louisiana for its first U.S. facility, Aclara is recognizing what we already know, our state is leading the next generation of energy and technology innovation,” said Governor Jeff Landry. “We’re excited to welcome the Aclara team to Louisiana, and we look forward to the jobs, growth and opportunity this project will deliver for our people, our communities — and for a Louisiana economy that’s ready to power and lead our nation’s future.”

The new facility will use Aclara’s proprietary sustainable extraction technology to produce the heavy rare earth elements essential for electric vehicles, wind turbines, drones and robotics, which rely on advanced permanent magnets. By processing material from Aclara’s mineral deposits in Brazil and Chile, the Louisiana operation will create a reliable and sustainable U.S. supply of these materials.

“We are pleased to announce that we have secured a premium site in Louisiana for our U.S. heavy rare earth separation facility,” Aclara Resources CEO Ramón Barúa said. “From the beginning, our priority was to identify a location that could support rapid development, given the urgent need to establish a reliable supply of these critical minerals. The reception from Governor Landry and his team has been outstanding, and Louisiana’s LED program offers exactly the kind of pro-investment environment this strategic sector requires.

Equally important, Louisiana provides ready access to the key reagents we depend on, helping ensure operational reliability and lower transportation costs. The state’s world-class chemical industry and highly skilled workforce made the decision even more compelling. Simply put, Louisiana has everything we were looking for.

Our project is unique in the Western world: with direct access to our ionic clay deposits, this will be the only fully integrated heavy rare earth separation operation capable of producing material volumes at scale. We are moving at an accelerated pace to bring supply online as quickly as possible, and we currently expect our projects to converge and enter production by mid-2028.”

The Aclara facility will occupy an LED Certified Site at the Port of Vinton, prequalified for industrial development through extensive environmental and engineering reviews. The company selected the location after evaluating more than 100 potential U.S. sites for its proximity to key chemical suppliers, access to Gulf Coast logistics and availability of a skilled industrial workforce.

“Louisiana is proud to welcome Aclara and the innovation it brings to our industrial landscape,” LED Secretary Susan B. Bourgeois said. “Aclara’s investment underscores the importance of development-ready sites and strong local partnerships that give global companies the confidence to choose Louisiana. The project builds on our state’s strengths in advanced manufacturing and workforce excellence, reinforcing Louisiana’s leadership in industries vital to the nation’s energy and defense security.”

Construction is expected to begin in 2026 and be completed in 2027. The facility will be built in phases, beginning with the rare earth separation plant, followed by potential future expansions to support downstream processing and alloy production as part of Aclara’s long-term growth strategy.

“This facility will become a cornerstone of critical minerals reindustrialization in the Western Hemisphere,” Aclara COO Hugh Broadhurst said. “Louisiana was selected for its robust chemical and manufacturing ecosystem, attractive investment policies, experienced industrial workforce, and strategic geographic location. The incentive package offered by the State of Louisiana underscores the State’s commitment to attracting high-technology and sustainable manufacturing investments.”

“Aclara’s investment in Vinton marks a defining moment for Southwest Louisiana. This project not only brings hundreds of high-quality jobs and significant economic growth, but it also positions our region at the forefront of America’s sustainable rare earth production and advanced technology supply chain,” said Judd Bares, Calcasieu Parish Police Jury President. “The Police Jury invested in significant infrastructure improvements to make this area a prime location for this type of major project, so I am happy to see the Parish’s proactive spirit meet industrial ingenuity to further diversify our region’s economy.”

To win the project in Vinton, the state of Louisiana offered Aclara Resources a competitive incentives package that includes the comprehensive workforce development solutions of LED FastStart and a $3 million performance-based grant for utility and infrastructure improvements. The company is also expected to participate in the state’s High Impact Jobs and Industrial Tax Exemption program.

“This project is a tremendous win for Southwest Louisiana and for America,” said Scott Walker, President and CEO of the Southwest Louisiana Economic Development Alliance. “Aclara’s investment marks a milestone that strengthens and diversifies our economy and reflects the forward-thinking spirit of our region. It’s exciting to know the work done here will be providing a component critical to America’s defense, national security and many technologies that drive modern life. The Calcasieu Parish Police Jury and the Port of Vinton did a tremendous job building out the infrastructure to make this project achievable. This project represents the best of what’s possible when state, regional, and local partners work together.”

The total cost of the projects cancelled in the private sector in 2025 amounted to $24 billion, as per the report.
In total, about 3,000 workers lost their jobs due to cancellations and scale-backs in September, bringing the total number of job losses tied to abandoned clean energy projects this year to 21,000.
Speaking about the scenario, E2 Communications Director Michael Timberlake said, “The loss of these projects isn’t just a setback for clean energy - it’s a setback for America’s workers and competitiveness.
Overall, E2 has tracked 415 major clean energy projects launched since the tax credits took effect, spanning 42 states and Puerto Rico.","According to the latest analysis from E2 (Environmental Entrepreneurs) and the Clean Economy Tracker, the US clean energy sector saw another blow this September, with companies calling off or downsizing large-scale projects worth nearly $1.6 billion. The total cost of the projects cancelled in the private sector in 2025 amounted to $24 billion, as per the report.

The private-sector cancellations have impacted battery, storage, and electric vehicle (EV) manufacturing in Kansas, Michigan, North Carolina, and Tennessee. These losses are in addition to the US Department of Energy's recent withdrawal of $8 billion in funding for over 200 public-sector projects nationwide.

In total, about 3,000 workers lost their jobs due to cancellations and scale-backs in September, bringing the total number of job losses tied to abandoned clean energy projects this year to 21,000.

Many of the cancellations came from automakers adjusting their EV production plans. For instance, General Motors scaled back 2 EV production lines in Tennessee and Kansas, impacting roughly 1,600 workers. Meanwhile, sodium-ion battery startup Natron Energy announced that it would cease operations altogether – closing a $40 million plant in Michigan that had 150 workers, and shelving plans for a $1.4 billion facility in North Carolina that would have employed around 1,000 people.

Speaking about the scenario, E2 Communications Director Michael Timberlake said, “The loss of these projects isn’t just a setback for clean energy - it’s a setback for America’s workers and competitiveness. For every cancelled factory or downsized plant, behind the scenes many more projects are not being announced at all as more capital flees and businesses look overseas to invest instead. That means fewer paychecks, less local investment, and fewer opportunities for US workers to lead in the industries of the future. While other nations are racing ahead to capture the clean energy economy, these cancellations leave American communities falling further behind.”

However, amid the pullback, new investments worth $542 million were announced in September. These include EV and solar parts manufacturing facilities, and grid infrastructure projects designed to support the energy demands of expanding AI data centers. Collectively, these ventures are expected to create about 985 new permanent jobs.

Overall, E2 has tracked 415 major clean energy projects launched since the tax credits took effect, spanning 42 states and Puerto Rico. Together, companies have pledged roughly $135 billion in new investments and committed to hiring 125,000 permanent workers.",https://media.assettype.com/taiyangnews%2F2025-10-24%2F180ylphs%2FUS-clean-energy-suffers-setback.jpg?w=1200&ar=40%3A21&auto=format%2Ccompress&ogImage=true&mode=crop&enlarge=true&overlay=false&overlay_position=bottom&overlay_width=100,N,,2025-10-24 10:19:39.853425

Amazon’s initiative to power its data centers with small modular nuclear reactors marks a significant milestone in the intersection of technology and energy.","In a move that underscores the growing importance of sustainable and reliable energy sources, Amazon is embarking on a groundbreaking project to power its data centers with small modular nuclear reactors (SMRs). The initiative, situated near Richland, Washington, is a direct response to a recent service outage that disrupted operations for millions of users. By investing in nuclear technology, Amazon aims to ensure uninterrupted power for its Amazon Web Services (AWS), a cornerstone of its business contributing over $123 billion in annual revenue. This project reflects a broader trend among tech giants to secure bespoke power solutions that meet increasing energy demands while minimizing environmental impact.

Amazon’s Strategic Shift to Nuclear Energy

The decision to adopt nuclear power is not merely about averting outages. It represents a strategic pivot towards sustainable energy solutions. Amazon’s AWS has grown to become a critical infrastructure component for over 1,000 companies worldwide. Thus, the reliability of power supply is paramount. By opting for nuclear energy, Amazon is not only addressing immediate power stability needs but also contributing to long-term sustainability goals. Nuclear power, known for being a zero-emission energy source, aligns with the company’s commitment to reducing its carbon footprint.

This initiative is part of a larger movement among tech companies to embrace nuclear energy. As data centers become increasingly vital, the demand for stable and clean energy sources is surging. Companies are investing in Generation IV reactor technology, which promises enhanced safety and efficiency. This trend is indicative of a shift in how corporations view their energy responsibilities, balancing operational needs with environmental stewardship.

“They Just Changed the Game”: China’s New Reactor Promises Endless Clean Power (and it could upend global energy dominance)

The Revolutionary Xe-100 SMR

At the heart of Amazon’s nuclear initiative is the Xe-100 Small Modular Reactor (SMR) developed by X-Energy. This High-Temperature Gas-cooled Reactor (HTGR) employs TRISO-X fuel, consisting of uranium particles encased in durable carbon and ceramics. This innovative fuel design enhances safety and efficiency, offering a self-regulating nuclear reaction.

The Xe-100 generates 80 MWe of power, a modest output compared to traditional reactors. However, its compact design allows for scalability and ease of production. These reactors can be manufactured in factories and transported to sites, significantly reducing construction costs and time. Furthermore, their small land footprint and simplified engineering requirements make them an attractive option for companies seeking sustainable power solutions.

“They’re Burying a Reactor a Mile Deep”: This Startup’s Underground Nuclear Plan Could Redefine Clean Energy Forever (and It’s Funded by the U.S.)

Scaling Up: The Cascade Advanced Energy Facility

The Cascade Advanced Energy Facility, slated to begin construction by the decade’s end, exemplifies the scalability of SMRs. Initially, it will host four reactors with a combined output of 320 MWe, with plans to expand to twelve reactors producing 960 MWe. This flexibility allows Amazon to adjust power capacity in response to evolving demands.

The project represents a significant investment in the future of energy and technology. Amazon’s ambition to introduce 5 GW of nuclear power to the U.S. by 2039 highlights the potential of SMRs to transform the energy landscape. This capacity could power approximately 3.8 million homes, underscoring the impact of such initiatives on national energy infrastructure.

“This project isn’t just about new technology; it’s about creating a reliable source of carbon-free energy that will support our growing digital world,” said Kara Hurst, Amazon’s chief sustainability officer.

Implications for the Energy and Tech Sectors

Amazon’s nuclear venture carries profound implications for both the energy and technology sectors. As global energy demands rise, the need for innovative solutions becomes increasingly urgent. SMRs offer a promising avenue, combining low emissions with reliability and scalability.

Moreover, the integration of nuclear technology into corporate strategy signifies a paradigm shift in how companies approach energy consumption. By investing in nuclear power, Amazon and its peers are setting a precedent for others to follow. This could spur further advancements in reactor technology, driving down costs and facilitating wider adoption.

The success of such projects will likely influence policy and regulatory landscapes, as governments and industries collaborate to harness the benefits of nuclear energy. The potential for SMRs to supply vast amounts of clean energy positions them as a key player in future energy strategies.

Amazon’s initiative to power its data centers with small modular nuclear reactors marks a significant milestone in the intersection of technology and energy. As companies seek sustainable solutions to meet growing demands, the role of nuclear power in corporate strategies is set to expand. How will the adoption of SMRs influence future energy policies and technological developments? The answers may reshape the energy sector for decades to come.

The automaker reports better-than-expected quarterly earnings, dials down tariff impact

Part of the F-150's appeal is its versatility, which makes it attractive to both business and retail buyers.

Ford Motor Co. unveiled late Thursday a plan to catch up on production of its most iconic vehicle and cleared a high bar with investors, sending the carmaker's stock more than 4% higher in the after-hours session.

Ford (F) is adding extra workers and taking other measures to meet ""strong"" customer demand for its F-Series pickup trucks, while making up for production losses stemming from a fire at an aluminum supplier's plant.

The goal is to increase production of its F-Series vehicles, including gasoline and hybrid models, by more than 50,000 trucks next year, Ford said.

Assembly of the F-150's electric version, the Lightning, will remain paused, however. Ford executives declined to give a timeline for an eventual production restart for the electric vehicle, but said it would be relatively easy to resume assembly.

The carmaker said it was giving priority to gas and hybrid F-Series trucks because they are more profitable and use less aluminum. Hourly employees at Ford's EV plant in the Detroit area will join a third crew at its Dearborn truck plant next door, the company said.

Ford's stock rose 3% in premarket trading Friday, which puts it on track to open at a 15-month high.

The fire last month at a Novelis Inc. plant in Oswego, N.Y., destroyed a key part of the facility. The Atlanta-based aluminum supplier has said it was sourcing materials from other plants and ""industry peers"" to help mitigate the gap in supply, which Ford confirmed on Thursday. Production at the plant is expected to resume by the end of the year, faster than expected.

The F-150 has been America's best-selling vehicle for decades running, and Ford has sold more than 400,000 of them this year. The carmaker said Thursday that the vehicle remains on track for a 49th straight year at the top.

Part of its appeal is its versatility: Businesses buy it for their commercial fleets, and it also attracts retail buyers, even if they are just hauling loads from retailers like Costco Wholesale Corp. (COST) or Home Depot Inc. (HD). The F-150 routinely outsells the next-most popular vehicles, the Chevy Silverado (GM) and the Toyota RAV (TM), by 100,000 vehicles every year.

Ford also tweaked its guidance for 2025 adjusted profit to between $6 billion and $6.5 billion, in part due to the supplier fire and the tariff headwinds the company has had to absorb. Ford said that if not for the fire, it would have raised its guidance.

The company in July guided for 2025 adjusted profit between $6.5 billion and $7.5 billion. Ford said that the Novelis fire is expected to cause a headwind of $1 billion or less this year and next.

Ford called for a net tariff impact of $1 billion for the year, down from a July estimate of $2 billion.

The carmaker earned an adjusted 45 cents a share in the third quarter on revenue of $50.5 billion. Analysts polled by FactSet expected adjusted profit of 35 cents a share on revenue of $47.1 billion.

""We are heading into 2026 as a stronger and more agile company,"" Chief Executive Jim Farley said in a statement. ""We will continue to focus on execution and on quickly making the right strategic calls on propulsion, partnerships and technology that will create tremendous value for our customers.""

The company's EV business, which it calls Ford Model E, posted an adjusted loss of $1.4 billion, wider than the $1.2 billion loss in the year-ago quarter.

The core business of traditionally powered vehicles, Ford Blue, reported a $1.5 billion profit, slightly less than the year-ago results, while Ford Pro, the part of the company geared toward commercial ventures, posted a $2 billion adjusted profit, up from $1.8 billion a year ago.

Ford's stock has rallied 24.7% in 2025 through Thursday, while shares of rival General Motors Co. have gained 25.5% and the S&P 500 index SPX has advanced 14.6%.

The Atlantic coast currently has no offshore oil and gas, while the Pacific has greatly scaled back its production in part due to state and federal laws to phase out or ban new offshore drilling.

In interviews Thursday, Democrats called the idea “not lawful,” a “huge mistake” and “absolutely ridiculous.” Coastal Republicans, for their part, said they would also oppose any offshore drilling, though at least one East Coast Republican was open to the idea — albeit with a caveat.

Trump faced bipartisan opposition when he attempted a similar move in 2020, during his first term. He eventually backed down following widespread outcry amid his reelection effort.

It’s unclear this time around whether lawmakers, especially coastal Republicans, will be able to stop him as intraparty opposition has largely evaporated in his second term. Moreover, any new drilling effort is likely to be met with multiple lawsuits.

Republican Sen. Rick Scott of Florida said on Thursday he was opposed to new drilling off the coast of his state. Trump’s plan, which POLITICO reported is expected to offer acres off the southern coast of California and “at least a small sliver” of the eastern Gulf of Mexico, is likely to be wildly unpopular in Florida. The plans have not yet been finalized.

“I haven’t supported drilling in the eastern Gulf of America,” Scott said, using Trump’s preferred name. “It’s important to Florida.” The Houston Chronicle, which first reported on the plans, said that Florida would continue to enjoy a drilling ban.

Coastal Republicans in the past have mounted stiff opposition to drilling off their coastlines, especially in states like Florida and South Carolina, where tourism is a major draw. Opposition only grew after the Deepwater Horizon disaster in 2010, which spilled millions of barrels of oil into the Gulf.

The Atlantic coast currently has no offshore oil and gas, while the Pacific has greatly scaled back its production in part due to state and federal laws to phase out or ban new offshore drilling.

Trump, in his last term, banned new drilling off the coasts of South Carolina, Georgia and Florida until 2032 following pressure from allies in those states and to shore up his own environmental standing as he faced off with future President Joe Biden. He could reverse those plans now.

Rep. Nancy Mace (R-S.C.), a Trump ally who is running for governor, said that the moratorium still stands and that she continues to oppose offshore drilling in South Carolina.

“President Trump put protections in place to prevent offshore drilling off South Carolina’s coast, and those remain in effect through 2032,” Mace’s communications director, Sydney Long, said in a statement to POLITICO’s E&E News. “Congresswoman Mace continues to oppose offshore drilling in South Carolina to protect our coastline, economy, and way of life.”

Wind and drilling … together?

At least one Republican senator, Thom Tillis of North Carolina, who has broken with the Trump administration on multiple issues and is retiring at the end of this term, said he supports drilling off of North Carolina’s coast.

“When I was speaker [of the North Carolina House], I wanted to explore the possibilities of extraction off the coast, off the sightlines of the coast, particularly for natural gas,” Tillis said. “Outside of the sightlines, you can’t see them from an 11-story building, which is the tallest building in Wilmington.”

Tillis’ support, however, came with a twist: He also wants to see offshore wind off the shore of North Carolina, which Trump hates.

“I support offshore drilling, but I also support offshore wind, and I think we should have both of them off the shores of North Carolina,” Tillis said.

Sen. Ted Budd (R-N.C.), was less committal when asked about the prospect of offshore drilling in North Carolina. He did not support or disavow the plan outright.

“I want to see their plans before I comment, I know the broad strokes but I don’t see the details,” Budd said. “I support energy, I’ll tell you that.”

Every Democrat interviewed Thursday, however, eviscerated the proposal.

“It’s going to be unacceptable for not just Democratic-run states, but for everybody. We don’t need to be moving in that direction,” said Sen. Andy Kim (D-N.J). “I can guarantee you there’ll be bipartisan pushback in New Jersey on that, as there was last time this came up a couple years ago.”

Kim pointed to the administration’s actions to halt or slow renewable energy projects up and down the Atlantic.

“The fact that they are literally trying to take offline other energy projects that we had moving, including ones along the Atlantic coast … this would be absolutely ridiculous to move in that direction,” he said.

Fellow Atlantic Sen. Mark Warner, Virginia Democrat, also said opposition is bound to mount for plans to drill off the coast. A major offshore wind project off the coast of Virginia supported by both parties is nearing completion.

“We kind of litigated this in Virginia, not technically in the courts, but there was such huge pushback from Virginia Beach and the communities, especially in terms of the challenge it would bring to the tourism industry,” Warner said. “In a regular world, I couldn’t believe they’d even be suggesting this, but let me see what comes to pass.”

Sen. Angus King, a Maine independent who caucuses with Democrats, said he has never supported drilling off the coast. Maine is famed for its fisheries, especially lobsters. King has also been a major proponent of offshore wind in the Gulf of Maine.

“I’ve been against it from the very beginning,” King said of offshore oil drilling. “The risk is far greater than the benefit.”

‘We’ll do everything we can’

On the Pacific coast, too, where no elected Republicans serve, there was intense pushback.

Sen. Alex Padilla of California, a Democrat, suggested that the move to open up more drilling in the state could be a jab at Gov. Gavin Newsom, who has become a top Democratic foil to Trump and is widely considered to be eyeing the White House in 2028.

“That may be the poke of the day,” Padilla said. “Not surprised, but not lawful.”

Sen. Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.), fresh off a nearly 24-hour speech on the Senate floor, also weighed in on potential drilling on the West Coast.

“We in Oregon are hugely opposed to any sort of drilling. We have the most productive fisheries, the most incredible coastline,” Merkley said. “This is nothing but a threat to our stakeholders in the fishing and crabbing world. And it would be a huge mistake to do any drilling off the Oregon coast.”

Merkley’s counterpart, former Environment and Natural Resources Chair and current Finance ranking member Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), was more terse: “We’ll do everything we can to block them,” he vowed.

“WTO law is still binding law.
“Various aspects of the NZIA Act are likely in tension with the EU obligations under WTO law,” he said.
He also argued that justifying protectionist green industrialization policies using the supply security argument may put at risk the energy transition.
“But with restrictive measures, there is a risk that the speed and scale of the energy transition may be negatively affected.","From pv magazine Global

Once a feared international entity regulating global commerce, the World Trade Organization (WTO) seems to be heading towards its sunset, in a geopolitical scenario that is contributing to the increase in various forms of protectionism in all world economies.

“The WTO is clearly in crisis,” energy and environmental law expert Anatole Boute told pv magazine. “The WTO Appellate Body, which is the organization’s main dispute settlement authority, is paralyzed and no longer functioning. First of all, this results from the blocking of appointment of judges since 2019 by the United States during the Trump and Biden administrations.”

The impasse has effectively crippled the system because the remaining judges’ terms were expiring and no new judges could be appointed to replace them.

This implies that, technically speaking, no appeals can be heard, which effectively undermines the WTO dispute settlement system. “Decisions by the panel can be appealed, but they are appealed into the void,” Boute explained. “But this paralyzes the entire dispute resolution process because an appeal means that the dispute cannot be solved and the decision cannot be enforced.”

The law professor also pointed to deficiencies in the regulation of cleantech disputes before the WTO due to the multi-year timeframe of its proceedings. “The WTO is not a perfect system,” he went on to say. “However, it is still being used. New disputes are being initiated. Contracting parties are still making use of its dispute settlement body, although they know that its decisions are likely not going to be enforced.”

Although these processes today do not lead to an enforceable decision, they still have great value, according to Boute. “WTO law is still binding law. The enforcement of international law in general is always a delicate issue, but that doesn’t mean that states don’t have legal obligations. And I think it’s useful to understand what these obligations are because they’re there for a reason. WTO decisions help understand the parties’ obligations under the WTO agreements, including in relation to trade in cleantech equipment and products.”

Europe has always been one of the most strenuous supporters of the WTO in an effort to ensure fair competition and strong trade ties with China, where most of the renewable energy technologies are manufactured, but this seems to have changed recently, as several European countries introduced incentives for domestic or EU-based manufacturing, not to mention the Net Zero Industry Act (NZIA), which is intended to help Europe produce at least 40% of its annual deployment needs for strategic technologies, including PV modules, batteries, and heat pumps.

“Despite these protectionist efforts, the European Union still cares about the WTO. It still tries to frame the policies as being WTO-compliant,” Boute said. “For instance, when the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) was defined, the EU emphasized the fact that it’s WTO-compliant.”

In the paper “Clean energy supply security and the international trade regime: A WTO law analysis of the EU Net-Zero Industry Act,” which was recently published in Energy Strategy Reviews, Boute argues that, although the WTO is in a deep crisis, its fundamental principles could still provide European nations with effective ways to implement the energy transition at the lowest possible costs and with the best technologies.

“Various aspects of the NZIA Act are likely in tension with the EU obligations under WTO law,” he said. In particular, the use of resilience criteria and diversification requirements in renewable energy auctions is likely to be incompatible with the WTO non-discrimination standards and difficult to justify under the existing exceptions.

“Of course, a potential claim would likely not result in an enforceable decision given the paralysis of the system. But in this paper, I was not investigating whether the WTO is still functioning. What I’m arguing is that designing clean energy security strategies in a WTO-compatible way would help minimize cost increases and delays of the energy transition. I think it doesn’t help the EU and certainly not the EU energy transition to ignore these obligations,” Boute stated.

He also argued that justifying protectionist green industrialization policies using the supply security argument may put at risk the energy transition. “If we look at the energy transition scenarios outlined by the International Energy Agency (IEA), the low-international cooperation case is the most pessimistic, with net zero achieved 40 years later than in a high cooperation case,” he stressed.

“The problem with the NZIA Act is that it’s trying to do many things at the same time, including achieving supply security, competitiveness, decarbonization, and geopolitical objectives that are difficult to reconcile with each other and with the non-discrimination principles governing the international trade regime,” he went on to say. “But with restrictive measures, there is a risk that the speed and scale of the energy transition may be negatively affected. What’s missing in my view in the NZIA Act is a detailed analysis of supply security risks for specific technologies.”

The creation of jobs is, according to Boute, another crucial factor in shaping the future of the European clean energy transition. “And from a jobs perspective, it makes sense not only to focus on cleantech manufacturing, but also on the opportunities created in the deployment of these technologies,” he emphasized. The latter jobs can be put at risk if trade restrictive measures delay the transition.

Located off the coast of the Lin-gang Special Area near Shanghai, this innovative project represents a $226 million investment in high-performance computing infrastructure. This facility is set to change how data centers operate by leveraging offshore wind power and natural seabed cooling. By doing so, it aims to significantly cut energy consumption and eliminate the need for fresh water, which is a critical resource in traditional data centers.

The Environmental Impact of Cooling

Data centers are notorious for their high energy consumption, particularly due to the cooling processes required to maintain optimal temperatures for servers. Traditional centers can use up to five million gallons of water daily for cooling purposes. This is equivalent to the daily water use of a small town. However, the Lin-gang Special Area facility is expected to challenge this paradigm by employing seawater for cooling.

By using the ocean as a natural cooling system, the facility aims to reduce its cooling energy consumption to less than 10% of total power use. This is a significant reduction compared to the 40-50% typically seen in other centers. The project is designed to achieve a Power Usage Effectiveness (PUE) rating of no higher than 1.15. This is well below China’s national guideline, which mandates a PUE of no higher than 1.25 by 2025 for new or retrofitted centers.

Beyond Data Storage: A Multifunctional Hub

The Lin-gang Special Area data center is designed to be more than just a data storage facility. It is poised to support a diverse range of digital-economy applications. From powering artificial intelligence workloads to providing computing infrastructure for 5G networks and the industrial Internet of Things (IoT), the center is a versatile addition to the region’s technological landscape.

Moreover, the center’s role extends to e-commerce and international data flows, making it a crucial part of the region’s digital backbone. This multifunctional capability underscores the facility’s potential to serve as a high-performance underwater computing cluster, marrying technological advancement with environmental sustainability.

Scaling Up: Future Prospects

The current phase of the underwater data center is a 2.3-MW demonstration facility. Plans for Phase 2 aim to scale this up to a 24 MW capacity, although no timeline for this expansion has been set. The facility’s successful integration of renewable energy and subsea cooling on a commercial scale marks a significant milestone in the evolution of data centers.

However, the transition from this demonstration phase to full-scale operations involves challenges. Engineers are closely monitoring potential maintenance costs, corrosion issues, and the impact on the marine environment. These factors will be critical in determining the long-term viability and scalability of such projects.

Challenges and Considerations

While the Lin-gang Special Area facility is a pioneering project, it is not without its challenges. As stated by Wang Shifeng, chairman of China Communications Construction Company’s Third Harbor Engineering, “Construction of UDCs is still in its initial stage.” The transition to large-scale applications will require advancements in technology and cost optimization.

The Shanghai municipal government has ambitious plans to scale up its intelligent computing cloud industry, aiming for a computing capacity of 200 EFLOPS by 2027. This underscores the need for continued innovation and improvement in underwater data center technology. The road ahead involves addressing technological maturity and refining cost structures to make these centers more feasible on a larger scale.

As China forges ahead with this innovative approach to data management, the world watches closely. The Lin-gang Special Area facility stands as a testament to the potential of combining renewable energy with cutting-edge technology. What steps will other nations take to follow suit, and how might these developments shape the future of data centers worldwide?

It is the first of a series of plans expected to set out how the government and employers will invest in training for “British workers” to bring down immigration and grow priority sectors.

Civil service “experts” have been tasked with producing jobs plans for each of the government’s priority sectors, setting out what “actions” will be taken to meet forecast demand for jobs.

A range of new and existing actions on skills are in the 81-page ‘clean energy jobs plan: creating a new generation of good jobs to deliver energy security’, published by the Department for Energy Security and Net Zero (DESNZ) earlier this week.

The plan forecasts that across the UK, jobs in the ‘clean energy’ sector will grow from around 440,000 in 2023 to 860,000 by 2030. This includes 31 priority occupations such as those in skilled construction, metal and electronic trades, as well as higher qualified engineers and machine operatives.

Energy Secretary Ed Miliband said: “Our plans will help create an economy in which there is no need to leave your hometown just to find a decent job.

“Thanks to this government’s commitment to clean energy, a generation of young people in our industrial heartlands can have well-paid secure jobs, from plumbers to electricians and welders.”

But any business investment?

While the clean energy jobs plan refers to large industrial investments that are expected to generate tens of thousands of new jobs, it contains limited details of new skills investments by businesses.

This is despite citing evidence of “significant underinvestment” in skills by employers in recent years and pledges in the new post-16 education and skills white paper to help businesses “invest further” in skills pipelines.

Addressing this, the plan says it aims to set “clear expectations” and create the “certainty” that industry needs to invest in skills.

Millions for more engineers

Announced in the industrial strategy this summer, the government has earmarked £182 million across the next four years to address engineering skills needs.

This includes £47 million to fund “engineering skills for adults”, £2 million to increase the number of engineering T Levels offered and £8 million in capital funding for clean energy engineering courses at levels 4 and 5.

Some of this funding will also go towards five new clean energy technical excellence colleges (TECs), with delivery expected to begin from April next year.

However, details of exactly how much funding is available for the new TECs are yet to be confirmed.

Build on what we’ve got

The UK and Scottish governments have also announced up to £20 million in funding to help North Sea oil and gas workers transition to “new roles”. This will extend a £1 million scheme, launched this year, until 2028-29.

Regional skills pilots in Cheshire West and Chester and North and North-East Lincolnshire will receive up to £2.5 million for “innovative” schemes to support workers “moving into clean energy”.

An existing energy skills passport scheme run by industry bodies RenewableUK and Offshore Energies UK will also be expanded to help workers in more roles move from “carbon-intensive industries” to clean energy sectors.

Veterans and prison leavers

A 12-month pilot led by Mission Renewable will connect veterans and service leavers with clean energy careers in the east of England, which the government hopes to learn from to “strengthen veteran pathways” across the UK.

The government also plans to prototype “innovative training and job-matching approaches” for non-violent offenders in regions with “critical energy sector vacancies”.

Keep coordinating

DESNZ has established a minister-led “steering group” to support joined-up implementation across the UK, “regular discussions” with trade union general secretaries, and “wider stakeholder engagement” on “specific themes”.

Both industry and government bodies such as the Careers and Enterprise Company have also committed to promoting clean energy careers, including through a UK-wide “awareness and attraction campaign” and engagement with young people.

Between DOGE, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act and a federal shutdown, state and local budgets are in upheaval.
The average person walking down the street knows that their government in Washington, D.C., is a locus of dysfunction and corruption.
If you think that’s simply common sense, you’d be surprised at how many states fail to do it.","In 1998, Louisiana’s legislature added a sovereignty clause to the state’s constitution that promises its citizens “the sole and exclusive right of governing themselves as a free and sovereign state.” The constitutions of New Hampshire and Montana, among others, have long contained the same phrasing. Mississippi’s constitution similarly asserts that “the people of this state have the inherent, sole, and exclusive right to regulate the internal government and police thereof.” Rhode Island’s constitution boasts a localist variant, confirming “to the people of every city and town in this state the right of self-government in all local matters.”

Such claims of autonomy notwithstanding, each of these states depends on federal agencies for over 40 percent of its annual revenue. Louisiana, so freshly drawn to the sovereignty clause, leads the pack at a whopping 52 percent dependency on federal funds. According to the latest Census Bureau data, Louisiana, along with 22 other states, is more reliant on federal dollars now than during the height of COVID-19 lockdowns.

There’s little space in other state capitols for gloating: The federal share of the average state’s revenue has doubled since 1990 and stands now at 37 percent. Given that those dollars come with strings and strictures, many of which have less to do with prudent program administration than with the ideological agendas of federal officials, it’s hard to believe that any citizenry substantially dependent on federal money maintains the “exclusive right of governing themselves as a free and sovereign state.”

We need look no further than the administration of public schools to see the threat federal funding poses to democratic self-governance. The federal government provides less than 14 percent of total spending on primary and secondary public education, yet thousands of school districts complied with Biden-era federal guidance on everything from transgender bathrooms to race-based school discipline practices. Some did so because they are run by administrators who share the ideology of Biden’s policymakers. But many complied — as they will with the directives of current and future administrations — for fear of losing funds, altering the school environments for hundreds of thousands of children. All this without a single vote by Congress or state legislatures, and with neither the consent nor even awareness of most parents.

They say he who pays the piper calls the tune, but federal agencies call the tune even when they barely cover the gratuity. “Self-government in all local matters”? It might be time for a revision, Rhode Island.

Between DOGE, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act and a federal shutdown, state and local budgets are in upheaval. The looming expenses for state participation in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program alone will run into the hundreds of millions for many states — driven in part by rising error rates caused by federal policies that have made it harder to confirm participants' eligibility.

And the thing is, the lawmakers and governors who allowed their states to drift into this peril knew exactly what kind of beast they were dealing with. The average person walking down the street knows that their government in Washington, D.C., is a locus of dysfunction and corruption. Our state leaders know federal funds are subject to interruption and reversal, that they entail fiat directives that run counter to the interests of average citizens, that they drive up long-term state costs by stoking state payrolls and shackling state programs with strictures that discourage measurement, efficiency and innovation.

Our elected state leaders know all these things, and yet they’ve made our communities more vulnerable than ever to D.C.’s pathologies. In many states they did so even as they cut taxes, fashioning themselves as small-government conservatives. Thankfully there are some bright lights: Tennessee had begun to practice legislative scrutiny of federal grant proposals, and Utah, Nebraska and Ohio now require state agencies to prepare contingency plans in the event of federal funding interruption. If you think that’s simply common sense, you’d be surprised at how many states fail to do it.

Some lawmakers and governors are working to safeguard their communities from federal chaos, but too many have looked the other way while services that should be fully under the authority of communities, from firefighter training to domestic violence shelters, became vulnerable to the D.C. whipsaw. They looked the other way, and now the people who elected them face the consequences. I wonder, will our state leaders face some political consequences as well? Perhaps it’s time they did.

Josh Shapiro announced Tuesday.

The move, which is set to take place in the latter part of 2026, is expected to create 735 jobs and retain 265 others. A state subsidy of $22 million will spur nearly $353 million in overall investment, Shapiro’s office says. The expansion will involve leasing a 432,000-square-foot facility in Marshall Township, where future production lines will augment its existing operations in Turtle Creek.

“We continue now to write the next chapter in Pennsylvania’s story of energy leadership,” said Shapiro at an afternoon press conference announcing the deal. “Eos … is massively expanding their manufacturing footprint here in Allegheny County and relocating their official headquarters from Jersey right here to Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.”

Shapiro said that he’d learned about Eos shortly after taking office, and that and his team had been working for more than two years on the deal. “We knew immediately that this technology would be a game-changer,” he said.

“If you look at energy and innovation landscape in our commonwealth, you’ll see that there is a ton of excitement and a whole lot of forward momentum, especially right here in southwestern Pennsylvania.”

Eos makes zinc-based batteries for industrial and other large-scale uses, and at a time when American energy policy is hotly contested, its Turtle Creek operations have been a success story everyone wants to be part of. Eos was among a number of area manufacturers to benefit from President Joe Biden’s clean-energy investments, and politicians ranging from progressive Democratic Rep. Summer Lee to Republican U.S. Senator Dave McCormick have championed its presence. It boasts a unionized work force — employees are members of the United Steelworkers — and relies almost entirely on American-made components and materials.

Zinc-based batteries also are less reliant on lithium, access to which has become a flashpoint in tensions between the United States and China.

Shapiro’s office said the move would allow the company to work with Carnegie Mellon University and other local schools to train workers proficient in robotics and other advancing technologies. Joe Mastrangelo, Eos’ chief executive officer, said that along with the skilled local workforce, “the ecosystem of universities” was a key resource to draw on for skilled workers and technological expertise.

”When you put those things together, it became almost a no-brainer [about] where we should be,” he said.

Mastrangelo said the new facility in Warrendale would be more efficiently configured than the company’s current, which as it has grown has taken up space in two different buildings and on multiple floors.

“The new building allows raw materials in one side and finished product out the other side,” he said. Asked whether the company would remain in the Turtle Creek location, he said, “for the time being.”

Mastrangelo said the relocation of its headquarters from Edison, NJ, would take place within the next few months, and that production in the new facility would get underway in the latter part of next year.

“With this expansion, Eos is strengthening two of the key industries at the center of our Economic Development Strategy — energy and manufacturing,” said Rick Siger, who heads the state Department of Community and Economic Development, in a statement.

The state’s investment includes $3 million already pledged to EOS, and the company may be eligible for other tax credits in the future. Allegheny County also contributed $2 million to the incentive packages.

The array, designed by Florida-based D3Energy LLC, is expected to generate up to 2 megawatts of energy, enough to power the water treatment plant, according to Lima Utilities Director Mike Caprella. The array will cover roughly half the surface area of the reservoir, held in place by 100 anchors.

“The floating solar project is a major step forward in our ongoing commitment to provide affordable, high-quality water, not just for the residents of the city but for businesses in Lima and outside of Lima, as well,” he said during a construction kickoff ceremony Thursday at the reservoir. “Every single day, our water treatment plant behind me works around the clock to deliver safe, reliable water. Throughout this project, we are going to turn our of our city’s largest energy consumers into a green-powered facility.”

The floating solar project is expected to be completed and come online in the first half of 2026.

Caprella estimated the savings from the solar array to total $10 million over its lifetime, with around $200,000 in savings coming in its first year of operation.

“That’s real money staying right here in our community that will protect both our taxpayers and our rate payers,” Lima Mayor Sharetta Smith said at the ceremony. “This project is the result of years of collaboration, partnership and shared vision.”

The city also received aid in construction costs thanks to $2.4 million in grant funds from the U.S. Department of Energy along with almost $900,000 in tax credits through the Inflation Reduction Act’s direct pay program, altogether covering about half the cost of the array.

D3Engergy managing director Stetson Tchividjian was also at the ceremony to celebrate the new project, touting its environmental and land use benefits, including reducing evaporation and algae growth in the reservoir and offsetting more than 2,500 metric tons of carbon dioxide every year. He said it’s the same impact as taking 500 vehicles off the road or planting 40,000 trees.

The Ohio Power Siting Board, for its part, is expected to finalize its rules within the next couple of months.
Ultimately, said Cherry of MAREC Action, the law ​“clears the path for developers to bring energy projects online quickly and affordably, something Ohio’s consumers and businesses desperately need.”","This story was originally published by Canary Media.

A new law in Ohio will fast-track energy projects in places that are hard to argue with: former coal mines and brownfields.

But how much the legislation benefits clean energy will depend on the final rules for its implementation, which the state is working out now.

Ohio has more than 567,000 acres of mine lands and about 50,000 acres of brownfields that are potentially suitable for renewable-energy development, according to a 2024 report from The Nature Conservancy. Federal funding to clean up abandoned mine lands has continued so far under the 2021 bipartisan infrastructure law, so yet more sites may become available. Overall, remediating documented hazards at Ohio’s abandoned mine lands is estimated to cost nearly $586 million, said spokesperson Karina Cheung at the state Department of Natural Resources.

The debate over HB 15 rules

Advocates and industry groups generally applaud the new law but want tweaks to the Power Siting Board’s proposed rules.

A big concern is making sure the board will allow wind and solar developments on mine lands and brownfields throughout Ohio, regardless of which county they’re in. Roughly one-third of Ohio’s 88 counties ban wind, solar, or both in all or a significant part of their jurisdiction. This authority was granted to them by a 2021 law, Senate Bill 52.

However, the language and legislative history of HB 15 make clear that it ​“was meant to be technology-neutral,” said Rebecca Mellino, a climate and energy policy associate for The Nature Conservancy.

HB 15 even states that its terms for permitting energy projects in priority investment areas apply ​“notwithstanding” some other parts of Ohio law.

“That clause is meant to bypass some of the typical Ohio Power Siting Board procedures — including the procedures for siting in restricted areas” under SB 52, wrote Bill Stanley, Ohio director for The Nature Conservancy, in comments filed with the board.

But the exemption provided by the ​“notwithstanding” clause is narrow, Mellino added, because local government authorities must ask for a priority investment area designation. That means, for example, that in a county with a solar and wind ban in place, officials would need to choose to request that a former coal mine or brownfield become a priority investment area.

The Nature Conservancy has asked the Power Siting Board to add language making it crystal-clear that renewable-energy projects can be built on any land marked a priority investment area — even if a solar and wind ban otherwise exists in a county.

Industry groups are pushing for additional clarifications to make sure the Power Siting Board meets the permitting deadlines set by the new law, both for expedited and standard projects.

For example, Open Road Renewables, which builds large-scale solar and battery storage, said in comments that, in order to align with HB 15, the board’s rules should require energy developers to notify the public of an application when it is filed, rather than after it is deemed complete.

Separate comments from the American Clean Power Association, MAREC Action, and the Utility Scale Solar Energy Coalition of Ohio ask for tweaks to provisions regarding notices on public hearings and for clarifications on application fees. The board should also promptly issue certificates for projects that are automatically approved, say comments by Robert Brundrett, president of the Ohio Oil and Gas Association.

The Department of Development hopes to finish draft standards and invite public comments on them soon, Waldvogel said. Meanwhile, the department has received its first request to designate a priority investment area. The ask comes from Jefferson County’s board of commissioners, which did not specify the type of energy that may be built in the area.

When we measure electricity prices relative to how much people earn, we find that the recent rise in prices is pretty modest.
What’s more, this is the exact opposite of the direction that electricity costs ought to be going in.
Energy prices should be going down, not up.
The locations and prices were tracked and aggregated monthly by Grid Status, an energy data analytics platform.","You may have heard that the cost of electricity is increasing in America. It’s true! Even as inflation has moderated in general, electricity prices have surged:

It’s important to put this increase in context. When we measure electricity prices relative to how much people earn, we find that the recent rise in prices is pretty modest. In fact, so far it hasn’t even canceled out the big drop in electricity prices in the late 2010s:

But rising costs are rising costs, and it would be a bad idea to wait until things get really bad before we address the problem.

What’s more, this is the exact opposite of the direction that electricity costs ought to be going in. We’re in the middle of a miraculous revolution in energy technology. The cost of solar power and battery storage has absolutely plunged in recent years, to the point where developing countries like India are choosing renewables over coal simply because it’s cheaper to do so. Energy prices should be going down, not up. And in China prices are going down, in fact, despite an explosion in demand. Why is America different?

Everyone agrees that there are a bunch of factors at work. For example, here’s Wired:

There are several dynamics driving the current power price spike. Rising electricity demand, volatile fuel prices, inflation, tariffs, a slowdown in transmission line construction, and long delays in adding new generators to the power grid are all conspiring to create more expensive utility bills.

The Wall Street Journal also cites the increasing cost of rebuilding power infrastructure after natural disasters.

But one factor that lots of people cite is the AI boom. AI runs on computing power (or “compute”, as they say). You need compute to train models, and you also need compute to make AI “think” about the answers it’s giving. Scaling up this latter type — which is called “inference compute” — is now the most important way that AI companies are improving their models over time. And compute requires energy, because you’re running electricity through a bunch of chips in some data center somewhere. Every time you ask AI a question, it’s using some noticeable amount of electricity.

People go back and forth about how much the increased electricity demand from AI is already affecting electricity prices. A recent report from Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory argues that AI hasn’t affected electricity prices yet, pointing out that states that saw greater electricity demand growth actually had falling prices over the past few years:

But Bloomberg Technology disagrees. Their analysis looks at smaller geographic areas, and considers wholesale rather than retail prices, and argues that data centers are already having big local effects:

A Bloomberg News analysis of wholesale electricity prices for tens of thousands of locations across the country reveals the effects of the AI boom on the power market with unprecedented granularity. The locations and prices were tracked and aggregated monthly by Grid Status, an energy data analytics platform. Bloomberg analyzed this data in relation to data center locations, from DC Byte, and found that electricity now costs as much as 267% more for a single month than it did five years ago in areas located near significant data center activity.

As the country builds a lot more data centers, we can expect this effect to filter through to retail prices, and start squeezing American consumers.

And remember that AI scaling tends to be exponential, meaning that AI is forecast to use a lot more compute in the near future. Here’s the EIA’s projection:

So right now, the rise in electricity costs has actually been modest, as has the effect of AI on those costs. But if AI keeps scaling up, things are going to get very hairy in the next decade. And that’s not even counting the increased electricity usage from switching from internal combustion cars to EVs.

It therefore seems like scaling up electricity generation in the U.S. is an incredibly important and pressing task. We don’t want a future in which AI outcompetes humans for scarce electric power and forces them to live in the dark and cold. Nor do we want a future in which America sacrifices the most crucial high-tech industry simply because we’re unwilling to build power lines, solar panels, and batteries. What we need, now more than ever before, is energy abundance.

And yet despite a few promising initiatives, the policies of the Trump administration are not geared toward providing America with energy abundance. In many cases they’re actually going to prevent us from getting the energy we need. Trump’s whole approach to energy seems like a mess of conflicting values, ideas, and policy initiatives.

What is the HON rule?

Last year, environmental advocates hailed the new rule as a major step in improving air quality for minority and poor communities that often bear the brunt of industrial pollution.

The rule required over 200 chemical manufacturers around the country to update operational practices, implement fenceline monitoring and repair their facilities, among other mandates. It put a special focus on reducing emissions of ethylene oxide and chloroprene, two chemicals linked to cancer.

Well, the truth about Louisiana’s shrimping industry and its recent challenges can now be explained as a result of President Donald Trump’s tariffs taking effect.

Environmental activists have been eager to blame liquefied natural gas companies for a sharp drop in shrimp prices. But, despite the claims of activists, the drop in prices is not a result of declining quality or supply of Louisiana’s product, or even a lack of skilled workers — far from it. Rather, it was the direct result of foreign producers, including Asia, flooding the market with cheaply farmed shrimp, often raised under conditions that would not meet American environmental or health standards.

In 1980, the U.S. imported 250 million pounds of shrimp at an average price of $10 per pound. In 2022, the U.S. imported two billion pounds of shrimp and prices plummeted to just $4.30 per pound and kept dropping.

The false narrative promoted by out-of-state climate activists that the drop is due to the oil and gas industry in the Gulf is now being busted with the implementation of Trump’s robust tariffs on imported shrimp. Tariffs help level the playing field by ensuring that imported shrimp does not have an unfair advantage over domestically harvested seafood.

Shrimpers say so themselves, and have welcomed Trump's tariffs, including the recent 25% tariff on India — one of the main countries sending cheap, low-quality shrimp our way and driving down prices.

One shrimper told a local news outlet recently: “If they keep importing and importing, you’re steadily putting workers out of work here. And getting food from overseas, sooner or later, everything is going to be from overseas. And where does that leave the country?”

He’s right. Maintaining a viable domestic industry brings benefits that far outweigh pennies added at the checkout counter. Supporting local shrimpers means supporting local economies, preserving jobs and ensuring that the seafood on our tables is healthy, sustainable and traceable to responsible sources. Most importantly, it keeps alive the intricate web of culture, tradition and community that defines Louisiana.

The energy industry’s presence along the Gulf Coast has also been a source of partnership, mutual prosperity and stability for many of our fishing families. LNG facilities, for example, have become economic engines in Plaquemines, Cameron and Calcasieu parishes, creating thousands of jobs and supporting the consumer base for shrimpers and local businesses alike.

And with President Trump’s tariffs in place, while it will take time for the impact of the tariffs to be felt fully, we are already beginning to see signs of prices moving back in the right direction toward where they were before the market was flooded with imports.

I urge every reader to consider the true cost of what’s on their plate. Behind each pound of Louisiana shrimp is a story — of hard work, of family, of endurance through hurricanes and hardship. By supporting tariffs on imported shrimp and the growth and development of America’s energy industry, we ensure that these stories continue, that our coastal communities remain strong and that Louisiana’s legacy as America’s seafood heartland endures for generations to come.",https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/nola.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/9/3a/93aa2776-8ce9-5eff-b1af-b153952815af/68d2fe98c12b2.image.jpg?crop=1793%2C941%2C0%2C106&resize=1200%2C630&order=crop%2Cresize,N,,2025-10-24 06:58:18.915921

Google’s approach integrates carbon capture directly into power generation, potentially setting a model for regions with limited clean energy access.
The Midwest’s grid, reliant on coal and gas, makes this a strategic fit, allowing Google to inject low-carbon power without overwhelming existing infrastructure.","In a bold move to reconcile the voracious energy demands of artificial intelligence with ambitious climate goals, Alphabet Inc.’s Google has struck a pioneering deal to purchase electricity from a natural-gas-fired power plant equipped with carbon capture technology. The agreement, announced Thursday, marks the first corporate pact of its kind in the U.S., aimed at powering Google’s expanding data centers in the Midwest. The plant, developed by Broadwing Energy on a site operated by Archer Daniels Midland Co. in Decatur, Illinois, is designed to generate over 400 megawatts while capturing and storing 90% of its carbon dioxide emissions underground.

This initiative comes as tech giants grapple with the surging power needs of AI training and operations, which have strained grids and complicated net-zero commitments. Google plans for the facility to begin commercial operations by early 2030, with the captured CO2 permanently stored in a deep saline formation. The deal underscores a shift toward hybrid energy solutions, blending fossil fuels with emissions-mitigating tech to meet immediate demands without fully abandoning renewables.

The Promise and Perils of Carbon Capture in Tech’s Energy Strategy

Skeptics, however, point to carbon capture’s checkered track record. Projects like Chevron Corp.’s Gorgon facility in Australia have underperformed, capturing far less CO2 than promised due to technical glitches and high costs. In the U.S., the Petra Nova plant in Texas, once hailed as a success, shut down in 2020 amid economic woes, raising doubts about scalability. Google acknowledges these hurdles but bets on advancements, partnering with ADM, which already operates carbon storage at the site from ethanol production.

According to reporting from The Verge, the technology’s history is fraught with overpromises, yet Google views it as a bridge to a cleaner future. The company has committed to 24/7 carbon-free energy by 2030, but AI’s exponential growth—projected to double data center energy use by 2026—has forced pragmatic compromises. This Illinois project could offset emissions equivalent to removing 100,000 cars from roads annually, per Google’s estimates.

Balancing AI Ambitions with Environmental Imperatives

Industry insiders see this as part of a broader trend among hyperscalers. Microsoft Corp. recently inked deals for nuclear power, while Amazon.com Inc. invests heavily in renewables, but all face criticism for leaning on offsets rather than direct cuts. Google’s approach integrates carbon capture directly into power generation, potentially setting a model for regions with limited clean energy access. The Midwest’s grid, reliant on coal and gas, makes this a strategic fit, allowing Google to inject low-carbon power without overwhelming existing infrastructure.

Financially, the deal involves Google providing upfront funding to de-risk the project, estimated at hundreds of millions, though exact terms remain undisclosed. Sources like Reuters note this could catalyze more corporate investments in carbon capture, bolstered by federal incentives under the Inflation Reduction Act, which offers tax credits up to $85 per ton of stored CO2.

Implications for Regulation and Innovation in Sustainable Power

Critics, including environmental groups, argue that backing gas plants, even with capture, prolongs fossil fuel dependence and diverts funds from true renewables like wind and solar.

When the Senate passed CRA resolutions disapproving the EPA waivers, Democrats in Congress, environmental leaders, and others cried foul.
The current Congress has enacted 15 CRA resolutions into law during 2025, the most ever.
But 16 CRA resolutions were enacted during Trump’s first term in 2017, three during Biden’s term, and so far, 15 in Trump’s second.
CRA resolutions have overturned vastly unpopular Energy Department rules banning gas water heaters and restricting refrigerators and other appliances.","The Congressional Review Act (CRA) was part of a small business package signed into law by President Bill Clinton in 1996. It provided a tool Congress sometimes uses to overturn federal regulatory agency actions. It requires agencies to report any new rules to Congress and provides special procedures under which Congress can disapprove them. It applies to “major rules, non-major rules, and interim final rules” very broadly, even including agency actions that have not been subject to traditional notice-and-comment rulemaking, such as “guidance documents and policy memoranda.”

When agencies report to Congress that they have adopted any new rules, Congress has 60 days to disapprove the rules before they go into effect. To disapprove a rule, the House and the Senate must pass a joint resolution, which the president must sign like any other law.

In passing the latest resolutions, the Senate used the CRA in an entirely new way. It had never been used to rescind land management plans, which some might have claimed are not “rules” under the CRA’s definition. Yet there was no major fight about it on the Senate floor, unlike the battle earlier this year when the CRA was used against California’s ban on gas-powered cars to cancel EPA “waivers” that had allowed California to ban gas-powered cars. Normally, states cannot impose environmental regulations that are stricter than federal standards, except if EPA grants “waivers,” which the Biden EPA had done for California.

When the Senate passed CRA resolutions disapproving the EPA waivers, Democrats in Congress, environmental leaders, and others cried foul. Both the Government Accountability Office (GAO) and the Senate parliamentarian entered the debate, saying EPA’s waivers were not technically “rules.” But ultimately the Senate makes its own rules, and the parliamentarian doesn’t have a vote. The resolutions were passed anyway and became law, effectively killing California electric vehicle mandates. This time, when rescinding the BLM management plans, the parliamentarian cleared the CRA resolutions without hesitation and they sailed through, and President Trump has already signed them into law.

That sends BLM back to the drawing board on three major plans. One was adopted by the Miles City, Montana Field Office, locking up virtually all of Montana’s coal deposits in the Powder River Basin, which contains nearly 30% of the entire nation’s coal supply. Second was the North Dakota Resource Management Plan, which walled off over four million acres of public land in North Dakota, prohibiting coal leasing on virtually all that state’s coal deposits, and stopping leasing on almost half of the available oil and gas acreage. Finally, the Central Yukon plan barred an LNG pipeline and other economic activity on over 13 million acres in Alaska, which already has 58 million acres of designated wilderness (and many other off-limits areas), more than all the other states combined. All three have now been disapproved by Congress.

Heads are turned and feathers are ruffled throughout the federal regulatory agencies, but in truth they ought to be getting used to Congress weighing in on such bureaucratic overreach. The CRA has been on the books for 30 years and has now been used by Congress to overrule regulatory agencies 35 times. The current Congress has enacted 15 CRA resolutions into law during 2025, the most ever. One such resolution was adopted during George W. Bush’s first term in 2001, overruling a Clinton-era ergonomic workplace regulation. But 16 CRA resolutions were enacted during Trump’s first term in 2017, three during Biden’s term, and so far, 15 in Trump’s second. It has been used by majorities of both parties and has become a useful tool for Congress because CRA resolutions require only simple majorities and are not subject to filibuster in the Senate.

CRA resolutions have overturned vastly unpopular Energy Department rules banning gas water heaters and restricting refrigerators and other appliances. The EPA has been overturned five times this year, and Congress has used the CRA to rein in the National Park Service, Bureau of Ocean and Energy Management, and Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, as well as the BLM.

Opponents claim this process undermines ordinary governmental procedures. But what is more “ordinary” than Congress making the rules?",https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/gjsentinel.com/content/tncms/custom/image/b32d0574-1b24-11ec-a31e-77e4d5ecaec6.jpg?resize=600%2C315,N,,2025-10-24 05:58:36.966121

In the UK, energy production is split between renewable sources like wind and solar, and fossil fuels such as coal and gas. However, the power output of renewable energy sources fluctuates based on weather conditions, directly affecting the carbon intensity of the electricity grid; less favourable weather means greater reliance on fossil fuels which increases carbon emissions.

This variability makes it crucial to understand when the grid is running on more renewables making it ‘more sustainable’, versus when it’s ‘less sustainable’ due to greater reliance on fossil fuels, to make informed energy choices.

Recognising this, the University of Sheffield Advanced Manufacturing Research Centre (AMRC) has developed a system to strategically schedule energy-intensive manufacturing tasks for periods when the grid’s carbon footprint is lowest – directly addressing the challenge of reducing the carbon dioxide equivalent (CO₂E) of manufacturing processes.

Tace Morgan, sustainability theme lead at the University of Sheffield AMRC, said: “A key challenge in improving manufacturing sustainability is reducing its carbon footprint. While using renewable energy offers a lower carbon intensity, its availability varies, making it an inconsistent source.

“Our research directly addresses this by leveraging the predictable link between carbon intensity and weather patterns. This allows us to intelligently schedule energy-intensive tasks for greener times, significantly lowering environmental impact without hindering productivity.”

The AMRC has also developed a web interface tool that showcases how manufacturers can utilise the technology to inform their scheduling decisions, providing a clear understanding of the trade-offs between production timelines and environmental impact.

With these promising initial findings, further research is needed to seamlessly integrate such a system into complex, real-world manufacturing environments and incorporate data from entire production facilities, where multiple factors influence schedules.

This groundbreaking work builds upon the AMRC’s previous research under Project Butterfly, which established the link between weather patterns and predictable energy carbon intensity. Funded by the national High Value Manufacturing Catapult network, of which the AMRC is a member, the current research further refines this concept, directly supporting the UK’s journey towards its net zero goals.

As part of the project, the AMRC developed a machine learning model capable of forecasting energy carbon intensity over 48 hours. Trained on historical weather data and additional insights such as the observed increase in renewable energy capacity and the periodicity of carbon intensity over days, weeks and annually, the model analyses publicly available weather forecast data alongside energy production trends to identify optimal times for running machinery with the lowest associated CO₂E emissions.

The effectiveness of this innovative approach has been validated through discrete event simulations (DES) using real-world manufacturing process data from AMRC North West. These simulations, which were applied to use cases involving melding, cutting and machining processes, compared traditional production schedules optimised for speed with those prioritising minimal carbon emissions.

Notably, one simulation demonstrated that accepting a modest increase in production time could lead to a significant reduction in overall emissions, specifically, a reduction of 4.74 kilograms of CO₂E was achieved by extending production time by just 2.8 hours – highlighting a tangible pathway to greener operations.

Dr Jon Hall, technical lead for connected factories at the University of Sheffield AMRC, said: “The model’s ability to accurately predict the maxima and minima in carbon intensity as a function of time is particularly valuable, as it helps identify the most and least sustainable periods for machine operation, and can also calculate the potential CO₂E reduction if sustainable scheduling was prioritised.

“At the end of the day, it’s all about making smarter choices when we use energy.”",https://themanufacturer-cdn-1.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/24085514/AMRC-Sustainability-small.jpg,N,,2025-10-24 07:17:57.826601

That exemption allowed auto companies to continue importing vehicles into Canada without paying tariffs, as long as they kept producing and investing in Canadian factories.
Governments in Canada have continued to provide financial aid to both GM and Stellantis as an incentive to retool factories and keep making cars in the nation.
The government’s move to shrink the tariff break for Stellantis and GM was reported earlier Thursday by the Canadian Broadcasting Corp.
General Motors didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.","General Motors Co. and Stellantis NV will be forced to pay tariffs on some US-made vehicles they import for sale in Canada, after the companies decided to reduce assembly-line work at factories in Ontario.

Canada put tariffs of as much as 25% on US-made cars and light trucks in April in retaliation for President Donald Trump’s levies on foreign vehicles. But Prime Minister Mark Carney’s government also carved out an exemption — known as “remission” — for automakers that make vehicles in Canada.

That exemption allowed auto companies to continue importing vehicles into Canada without paying tariffs, as long as they kept producing and investing in Canadian factories. But Stellantis will now see its quota of tariff-free vehicles slashed by 50% and GM will face a 24% reduction, according to a government official familiar with the matter, speaking on condition they not be identified because they were not authorized to speak publicly about it.

It’s an escalation of tension between Carney’s government and the automakers, which have been altering their manufacturing plans in response to Trump’s tariffs and changes in demand for electric vehicles.

GM announced this week it’s permanently ending electric van production in the town of Ingersoll, Ontario, casting doubt over the future of that plant, which doesn’t make any other model. Last week, Stellantis halted plans to make the Jeep Compass SUV at a factory near Toronto, putting 3,000 direct jobs at risk. The fate of that facility is also unclear.

The moves angered Canadian officials in part because Canada helped fund the bailout and restructuring of GM and Chrysler — now part of Stellantis — when they were in financial distress during the global financial crisis. Governments in Canada have continued to provide financial aid to both GM and Stellantis as an incentive to retool factories and keep making cars in the nation.

The government’s move to shrink the tariff break for Stellantis and GM was reported earlier Thursday by the Canadian Broadcasting Corp.

Both companies still have one operating assembly plant in southern Ontario, but most models they sell in Canada are imported — usually from the the US or Mexico. General Motors had 15.8% of the Canadian auto market in the first half of the year, making it the industry leader, the company said in July.

Canada is by far the largest export market for US-made new vehicles, buying about 629,000 last year, according to Commerce Department data.

General Motors didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. A spokesperson for Stellantis said the company was working on a response.

The numbers tell a powerful story: 32 million people have already gained access through World Bank supported programs, with another 157 million expected from approved and planned projects. Together, that gives line of sight to roughly 189 million of its 250 million-connection commitment under Mission 300 — a remarkable signal of progress and proof that large-scale delivery is possible when governments, development partners, and the private sector move in sync.

The Clock Is Ticking

But even with this acceleration, the challenge ahead remains steep. Many of us have been working in this space for a very long time, and we know what needs to be done, including crowding in more partners, more resources, more action, and even greater accountability among ourselves and our partner countries.

This new data shows us that despite significant progress, the WBG still needs to identify projects to bring electricity to an additional 61 million people to meet its 250-million-person pledge- a goal within reach.

We also need to track the African Development Bank’s progress against its commitment to bring electricity to 50 million people, which will bring us closer to 300 million.

Unleashing Energy for Development

Understanding what types of connections Mission 300 is delivering is also essential. Some will be basic solar home systems that light homes and charge phones, which is important. Others will be mini grid or grid connections that can also power appliances and tools that will help generate new jobs, boost productivity, and increase incomes.

Ultimately, Mission 300 is about unleashing the power of energy to change lives and grow economies. It’s no coincidence that the five African countries with the largest job gaps — Nigeria, Democratic Republic of Congo, Ethiopia, Tanzania, and Uganda — are the same countries with the largest unelectrified populations. Mission 300 has transformational potential, and our design and metrics must drive towards this.

Every connection matters: power for jobs, health, schools, farmers, small businesses, and even data centers — everything needed to power a modern economy. This is what the fight against energy poverty is really about — economic growth and human dignity.

To meet our goal, electricity must reach an average of more than 4 million people each month between now and December 2030, which will not happen right away. We expect a sharp uptick in electrical connections by 2028, as projects approved in 2025 and 2026 come online. All told, the next five years will determine whether Africa closes the world’s largest energy-access gap — or risks leaving millions behind.

A Call to Accelerate

Mission 300’s first-year results show what’s possible. Now we must go faster. That means:

Expanding partnerships — especially with the private sector — to close the financing gap;

Scaling innovation in technology, finance, and delivery models; and

Increasing our partnerships — we need even more collaboration than what we have.

We are at an inflection point. New technologies, digital tools, and business models are making universal access both achievable and investable. We also need to keep working people up the energy ladder so that they have not only light in their homes but also productive levels of electricity to power jobs. The foundation is strong. The plan is working. The pathway is clear. But time is short — and complacency is the enemy of progress.

Mission 300’s success will depend on how quickly we move. The data is now clearer, along with the opportunity. The time to act is now, and The Rockefeller Foundation remains fully committed to ensuring Mission 300 delivers on its vision of energy as the foundation for inclusive, sustainable development — powering progress in health, education, gender equity, enterprise growth, and climate resilience.",https://www.rockefellerfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Solar-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-10-24 10:19:49.367522

Energy Department offers $1.6 billion loan guarantee to upgrade transmission lines across Midwest

MATTHEW DALY

Associated Press

Published: October 24, 2025

WASHINGTON (AP) — The Department of Energy said recently it has finalized a $1.6 billion loan guarantee to a subsidiary of one of the nation's largest power companies to upgrade nearly 5,000 miles of transmission lines across five states, mostly in the Midwest, for largely fossil fuel-run energy.

AEP Transmission will upgrade power lines in Indiana, Michigan, Ohio, Oklahoma and West Virginia to enhance grid reliability and capacity, the Energy Department said. The project, first offered under the Biden administration, is meant to help meet surging electricity demand from data centers and artificial intelligence.

Ohio-based American Electric Power, which owns AEP Transmission, is one of the nation's largest utilities, serving 5.6 million customers in 11 states. It primarily produces electricity from coal, natural gas and nuclear power, along with renewable resources such as wind and hydroelectric power.

The announcement deepens the Trump administration's commitment to traditional, polluting energy sources even as it works to discourage the U.S. from clean energy use.

Earlier this month, the administration cancelled $7.6 billion in grants that supported hundreds of clean energy projects in 16 states, all of which voted for Democrat Kamala Harris in last year's presidential election. A total of 223 projects were terminated after a review determined they did not adequately advance the nation's energy needs or were not economically viable, the Energy Department said.

The cancellations include up to $1.2 billion for California's hydrogen hub aimed at developing clean-burning hydrogen fuels to power ships and heavy-duty trucks. A hydrogen project costing up to $1 billion in the Pacific Northwest also was cancelled.

The finalized loan guarantee is the first offered by the Trump administration under the recently renamed Energy Dominance Financing program created by the massive tax-and-spending law approved this summer by congressional Republicans and signed by President Donald Trump. Electric utilities that receive loans through the program must provide assurances to the government that financial benefits from the financing will be passed on to customers, the Energy Department said.

The project and others being considered will help ensure that Americans ""will have access to affordable, reliable and secure energy for decades to come,"" Energy Secretary Chris Wright said in a statement.

""The president has been clear: America must reverse course from the energy subtraction agenda of past administrations and strengthen our electrical grid,'' Wright said, adding that modernizing the grid and expanding transmission capacity ""will help position the United States to win the AI race and grow our manufacturing base.""

The upgrades supported by the federal financing will replace existing transmission lines in existing rights-of-way with new lines capable of carrying more energy, the power company said.

More than 2,000 miles of transmission lines in Ohio serving 1.5 million people will be replaced, along with more than 1,400 miles in Indiana and Michigan serving 600,000 customers, the company said. An additional 1,400 miles in Oklahoma, serving about 1.2 million people and 26 miles in West Virginia, serving 460,000 people, will be replaced.

The projects will create about 1,100 construction jobs, the company said.

The loan guarantee will save customers money and improve reliability while supporting economic growth in the five states, said Bill Fehrman, AEP's chairman, president and chief executive officer. ""The funds we will save through this program enable us to make additional investments to enhance service for our customers,"" he added.

Wright, in a conference call with reporters, distinguished the AEP loan guarantee from a $4.9 billion federal loan guarantee the department cancelled in July. That money would have boosted the planned Grain Belt Express, a new high-voltage transmission line set to deliver solar and wind-generated electricity from the Midwest to eastern states.

The Energy Department said at the time it was ""not critical for the federal government to have a role"" in the first phase of the $11 billion project planned by Chicago-based Invenergy. The department also questioned whether the project could meet strict financial conditions required, a claim Wright repeated.

""Ultimately that is a commercial enterprise that needs private developers,"" Wright said. The company has indicated the Grain Belt project will go forward.

Trump and Wright have repeatedly derided wind and solar energy as unreliable and opposed efforts to combat climate change by moving away from fossil fuels. Wright said the Grain Belt Express loan was among billions of dollars worth of commitments ""rushed out the door"" in the waning days of former President Joe Biden's administration.

The loan guarantee to AEP was among those conditionally approved under Biden, a fact Wright acknowledged to reporters.

""Not all of the (Biden-era) projects were nonsense,"" he said, adding that he was ""happy to move forward"" with the transmission upgrade.

The terminal will be connected by the proposed CP Express natural gas pipeline, which will originate in Jasper County, Texas, traverse Newton County, Texas, and Calcasieu Parish, Louisiana, before reaching the CP2 LNG terminal.
The DoE stated that President Trump had lifted the Biden administration’s restrictions on LNG exports and resumed pending applications for LNG export to non-FTA countries.
Under President Trump’s administration, the DoE has authorised more than 13.8bcf/d of LNG exports.
Currently, US LNG exports stand at approximately 15bcf/d, a 25% increase from 2024 levels, said the statement.","The US Department of Energy (DoE) has granted non-Free Trade Agreement (non-FTA) export authorisation for Venture Global’s CP2 LNG project in Cameron Parish, Louisiana.

This approval permits the export of up to 3.96 billion cubic feet per day (bcf/d) of liquefied natural gas (LNG) from the US to non-FTA countries.

The decision follows the DoE’s conditional authorisation issued in March 2025. It aligns with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission’s (FERC) approval in May 2025 for the facility’s siting, construction and operation.

The approval is also supported by the DoE’s recent response to comments on the 2024 LNG Export Study, which stated that LNG exports enhance the country’s energy leadership, create local job opportunities and ensure reliable energy access.

Venture Global CEO Mike Sabel said: “Venture Global is grateful for the Trump Administration’s final approval of CP2, a critical project that will supply American allies with low-cost LNG for decades, support thousands of jobs and greatly benefit the US balance of trade.

“The CP2 project construction is well under way, and we look forward to continue advancing the project safely and quickly to bring new LNG to the global market at a record pace, beginning in 2027.”

The CP2 LNG terminal is due to be built on an approximately 1,150-acre site adjacent to Venture Global’s existing Calcasieu Pass LNG plant.

This facility will be positioned on Monkey Island, between the Calcasieu Ship Channel and Calcasieu Pass.

The terminal will be connected by the proposed CP Express natural gas pipeline, which will originate in Jasper County, Texas, traverse Newton County, Texas, and Calcasieu Parish, Louisiana, before reaching the CP2 LNG terminal.

Office of Fossil Energy Assistant Secretary Kyle Haustveit said: “In less than ten months, President Trump’s administration is redefining what it means to unleash American energy by approving record new LNG exports.

“Finalising the non-FTA authorisation for CP2 LNG will enable secure and reliable American energy access for our allies and trading partners, while also providing well-paid jobs and economic opportunities at home.”

The initiative is part of the UK’s mission to become a clean energy superpower, backed by record investment in renewables, nuclear, and carbon capture technologies.

The announcement includes the publication of the first national plan to train the next wave of clean energy workers, with employment in the sector expected to double to 860,000 across the UK by the end of the decade.

Wales will see a 15,000-job increase from 2023, with high demand for skilled trades such as electricians, plumbers, bricklayers, engineers, and metal workers. The largest clean energy employer in the region is expected to be in carbon capture and offshore wind.

Pembrokeshire will benefit directly from a £2.5 million skills pilot scheme, alongside Cheshire and Lincolnshire, to fund training centres, courses, and career advisers.

Clean energy jobs offer 23% higher entry-level pay compared to similar roles in other sectors. Average salaries in wind, nuclear, and electricity networks exceed £50,000, well above the UK average of £37,000.

The plan also includes:

Five new Technical Excellence Colleges

Tailored schemes for veterans, ex-offenders, school leavers, and the unemployed

£20 million training support for oil and gas workers transitioning to clean energy

Expansion of the energy skills passport to nuclear and electricity grid sectors

Ed Miliband, Energy Secretary, commented:

“Wales is essential to the clean energy revolution that this government is delivering. Communities across Wales have long been calling out for a new generation of good industrial jobs. The clean energy jobs boom can answer that call - and today we publish a landmark national plan to make it happen.

“Our plans will help create an economy in which there is no need to leave your hometown just to find a decent job. Thanks to this government’s commitment to clean energy a generation of young people in our industrial heartlands can have well-paid secure jobs, from plumbers to electricians and welders.

“This is a pro-worker, pro-jobs, pro-union, agenda that will deliver the national renewal our country needs.”

The government is also reaffirming its support for trade unions as essential partners in securing high pay and good working conditions. Union coverage in the energy sector has dropped from 70% in the 1990s to 30% today, and the plan aims to reverse that trend.

With over £50 billion in private investment already secured since last July, the UK’s clean energy mission is driving a jobs boom across coastal and post-industrial communities.

Projects like the Hynet CCUS in North Wales and the Mona Offshore Wind Farm are expected to create thousands of jobs, offering long-term, well-paid careers for young people across Wales.

October 23, 2025 – The Environmental Finance Center Network (EFCN), led by the Southwest Environmental Finance Center (SWEFC) at the University of New Mexico, is proud to announce two new cooperative agreements awarded by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). These awards, totaling $17.74 million, will usher in a new wave of support for small, rural, and tribal communities working to improve their drinking water and wastewater systems across all 50 U.S. states and territories.

With this funding, the SWEFC, alongside the Environmental Finance Centers at Syracuse University (SU-EFC) and Wichita State University (EFC WSU), will lead a national partnership of university and non-profit organizations to deliver technical assistance, training, and capacity building. Together, the EFCN will work alongside hundreds of communities to secure funding, address regulatory requirements, and strengthen critical water infrastructure that protects public health and drives local economies.

Across the country, many small and rural communities continue to face serious challenges – from a rapidly retiring water workforce and chronic staffing shortages to a growing crisis of aging infrastructure, where pipe breaks and system failures are becoming more frequent and costly. These new awards will allow the EFCN to continue breaking down barriers by offering practical, tailored support that helps communities tackle these obstacles, build capacity, and move forward.

As part of this effort, Syracuse University will lead the launch of a new Rural and Tribal Outreach Bench. This initiative will make it easier to bring valuable resources and expertise directly to communities that are often hardest to reach. By building on-the-ground partnerships to provide targeted outreach, promote training opportunities, and connect local leaders with EFCN services, this approach will ensure that technical support reaches the places that need it most.

“Small drinking water and wastewater systems are the foundation of many rural communities across the U.S. They often rely on volunteers and lack the technical, managerial, and financial capabilities and resources needed to serve their customers reliably and sustainably.” said Heather Himmelberger, Director of the Southwest EFC. “We – the entire Environmental Finance Center Network team – are grateful for EPA’s continued trust in us and are excited to partner with small communities to build stronger, more viable, and compliant systems nationwide.”

“Rural communities across the United States urgently need to upgrade their wastewater and drinking water infrastructure, with the EPA estimating $625 billion in drinking water system needs and $630 billion in wastewater infrastructure needs over the next 20 years,” said Tess Clark, Assistant Director of the Syracuse University EFC. “Nearly half of public water systems serve communities of fewer than 500 people, and over 20% of U.S. households rely on septic systems – many of which are aging, undersized, or failing – posing serious risks to water quality and public health.”

“One-on-one work with small water and wastewater utilities is some of the most meaningful work we do. Our team regularly sees communities take long-awaited steps toward their planning, financial, compliance, or infrastructure goals after we spend dedicated time working with them on their unique challenges,” said Tonya Bronleewe, Director of the EFC at Wichita State University.

These awards build on more than 30 years of Environmental Finance Centers supporting communities nationwide, and over a decade of partnership through the Environmental Finance Center Network to help local governments and water systems across all 50 states and territories deliver clean, safe, and reliable water.

In addition to project leadership, this national partnership draws on the expertise of universities and nonprofit organizations across the country, including:

Environmental Finance Center at the University of Maryland

The Capacity Collaborative

Great Lakes Environmental Infrastructure Center at Michigan Technological University

Moonshot Missions

Mississippi State University Water Resource Research Institute

Environmental Finance Center at the University of North Carolina

Tennessee Water Resources Research Center at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville

Colorado State University

Morgan State University

As the nation continues to invest in infrastructure and rural economies, the EFCN remains committed to making sure that no community is left behind – no matter how small. For more information about the EFCN and its services, visit efcnetwork.org.

It also had 140,000 hosts who were renting out 340,000 vehicles across 1,600 vehicle makes and models.

Instead of managing four $250 trips a month, a host can opt for one $1,000 monthly rental.","Owning a car in the U.S. can be a serious squeeze on your wallet—and that's only getting worse.

Monthly payments have been climbing, high interest rates have become the norm, and the average transaction price for new vehicles has continued to soar, with buyers taking longer-term loans to pay for them. With the $7,500 federal tax credit for electric vehicles now gone, battery-powered cars aren’t easing the pressure on the broader market either.

Car-sharing platform Turo thinks it has a solution for this growing affordability problem. It has introduced long-term rentals lasting up to a year.

The idea is simple: Customers can rent a car for a month, three months, or any period up to a year without any long-term commitments, down payments, depreciation worries, or maintenance costs. Since they’re renting, not owning, none of those hassles really apply.

“The traditional models of accessing a vehicle through financing or leasing are long-term commitments; it means that you are beholden to loan repayments, and maybe a credit check,” Tim Rossanis, Turo’s Senior Vice President, U.S., told InsideEVs in an interview. “What we're putting into the market is really focused on providing Americans with flexible access to vehicles.""

According to car research firm Edmunds, the number of buyers taking on monthly payments over $1,000 is hovering near record highs, making up nearly one-fifth of all new vehicle purchases. More than one in five car loans now stretch seven years or longer, with the average loan amount climbing to nearly $43,000 in the third quarter of 2025.

Turo said its long-term rentals will make driving more flexible for customers and provide steady revenue streams for owners renting their vehicles out. If customers rent for a month, the pricing is similar to your regular daily or weekend car rentals on platforms such as Hertz and Enterprise. They pay a sum up front, which includes the cost of renting the vehicle, plus Turo’s Standard insurance and taxes.

If customers rent for longer than one month, they pay in monthly installments. But they still retain the ability to make changes to their booking, like shortening or extending the rental. If owners have vehicles lying idle for long durations, renting them out makes sure the vehicle is running and they’re earning revenue from that.

Turo claims that at the end of last year, it had about 3.5 million active guests on its platform globally. It also had 140,000 hosts who were renting out 340,000 vehicles across 1,600 vehicle makes and models. Rossanis said internal research was already showing trends of longer-term rentals, with a growing share of younger customers, especially in the Gen Z and Millennials categories, looking for flexible options to rent vehicles.

The downside to Turo’s long-term rental program is ironically also the cost. Monthly payments can range from $600 to over $1,000, depending on the car and the region. That’s slightly higher than the average new-vehicle finance payment of $754 in the third quarter, according to Edmunds. And unlike a car loan, those payments don’t lead to ownership. The vehicle eventually has to go back.

In an extremely car-dependent America, that’s possibly a dealbreaker for many, unless you live in a big city like New York or Chicago, where public transit actually works. It can also be tricky to find a vehicle with unlimited mileage for the rental period, and costs can rise quickly if you go over the limit. In other words, you’ll need to predict your driving needs and plan accordingly.

But Turo isn’t the first to experiment with longer-term car rentals. Several automakers and rental companies have tried similar programs, often ending up with mixed results.

Cadillac launched a $1,800-per-month subscription service called Book by Cadillac, but shut it down in 2018, just two years after its introduction, due to back-end technology issues and high operating costs, The Wall Street Journal reported at the time.

Similarly, the Access by BMW program, which started at around $2,000 a month, offered flexible access to luxury models but ended in 2021. The Care by Volvo program, which was also a low-commitment alternative to leasing, also ended in 2024.

Traditional rental giants like Hertz and Budget still offer monthly rentals, though it’s unclear how popular those programs actually are. The monthly rental costs swing wildly for these, from anywhere in the low $1,000 range to over $3,000 in some cases, depending on the vehicle and region.

Still, Rossanis believes Turo has an advantage. The company doesn’t need to raise massive amounts of capital or chase profitability from scratch. It already has a vast network of hosts, people who now have an incentive to rent out their cars with less hassle. Instead of managing four $250 trips a month, a host can opt for one $1,000 monthly rental. That also means fewer pickups and drop-offs (if customers choose delivery) and only one cleaning instead of four.

And unlike the failed subscription programs of the past, Turo’s pricing looks more competitive, if not exactly cheap. In the Jersey City ZIP code, for instance, a 2016 Hyundai Tucson rents for about $700 a month, including taxes and insurance. A 2024 Tesla Model Y or BMW X3 run closer to $1,000. Not exactly a steal, but still cheaper than the Cadillac and BMW subscription programs ever were.

“We encourage our hosts to list the car that they already have, the cars that are sitting idle 95% of the time,” Rossanis said. Putting those vehicles back onto the road benefits both sides, he said. Customers get access when they need a car for a longer duration, and owners earn extra income.

The goal isn’t to add more cars on the road, but to make the most of the ones already out there. “Our mission is to put the world's one and a half billion cars to better use,” he added.

The state had spent $23.6 million in land for the project and will try to recoup those costs

‘This is not the outcome we hoped for,’ Michigan officials say

Gotion Inc.’s plans to build a $2.4 billion electric vehicle battery plant near Big Rapids are dead, following years of lawsuits, delays and controversy over the firm’s ties to China.

Michigan officials on Thursday released a letter stating the company was in default of its agreement with the state, which had pledged $175 million to the company and purchased 270 acres for the project in Green Charter Township.

“This is not the outcome we hoped for,” the Michigan Economic Development Corporation said Thursday in a statement.

The state will now pursue repayment of $23.6 million spent on the land Gotion had planned for the factory. The rest of the funding had not been used.

Michigan economic officials told Bridge Michigan this month there was no change in the status of the project, even though the default letter sent to Gotion was dated Sept. 17.

Announced with fanfare in 2023, the project was expected to create 2,350 jobs. It was beset with controversy from the start and became an issue in the 2024 campaign for president because Gotion is a US subsidiary of the Chinese company Gotion High-Tech Inc.

The release of the letter comes after Gotion replied to the state on Oct. 15, saying it was “shocked” by the default and sought a six-month delay.

“It is even more surprising that the state of Michigan suggests that Gotion has ‘abandoned’ the project considering the immense challenges that Gotion has experienced in Michigan,” wrote the company’s attorney, Mark Heusel of Dickinson Wright, in the letter.

It is the second major project to die in the past few months in Michigan, following Sandisk’s decision in July not to build a $63 billion semiconductor plant in Genesee County.

The Gotion project was also one of the higher-profile beneficiaries of Gov. Gretchen Whitmer’s signature economic development program, the $2 billion Strategic Outreach and Attraction Reserve.

The Legislature defunded the program earlier this month.

Senate Majority Leader Winnie Brinks, D-Grand Rapids, said in a statement sent to Bridge she is disappointed Gotion “did not live up to its commitments” but Michigan must “double down to create better, more effective tools to attract and retain high-wage jobs.”

“The overall goal is and always has been to create good jobs that people want to come to and stay in Michigan for – jobs that anchor good neighborhoods and schools and communities – and that remains my objective,” she said.

Activists near Big Rapids opposed the project because of its size, potential impact on the environment and worries about its viability. They cheered the news of the project’s demise on Thursday.

“Thank you,” said Marjorie Steele, who founded the Economic Development Responsibility Alliance .

“It’s about damned time.”

Steele said residents felt railroaded by local officials who “colluded” with the state to finalize the project. Opposition was ignored, she said, as local officials and the state officials rubber-stamped the project.

“What the MEDC tried to pull here in Big Rapids was just so egregious,” Steele said.

Voters in Green Charter Township recalled township officials who supported the project in 2023, electing members who rescinded support for the project and prompting a lawsuit with Gotion.

The company’s attorney blamed the litigation for slowing the project. In the letter to the state, Heusel wrote that the opposition was “politically motivated” and “due solely to racist and ethnically charged stereotypes.”

Rep. Tom Kunse, R-Clare, said the project was ill-conceived and lacked transparency, despite the tax subsidies.

“This is yet another example of why corporate welfare doesn’t work. Taxpayer funded incentive deals often fail to deliver on promises, leaving our communities with broken commitments and wasted public dollars,” said Kunse, whose district includes the Gotion site.

The next step is unclear. Rich Studley, the former president and CEO of the Michigan Chamber, said he has “zero confidence” Michigan will recover the millions spent on the land or “or that they won’t do it again.”

“I’m not happy that we missed an opportunity to encourage job creation and economic growth in the Big Rapids area,” he added. “But, it is encouraging to see the (state) and Gotion held accountable.”

The Gotion announcement comes amid ongoing questions about the future of Michigan’s economic development programs, particularly SOAR.

The largest SOAR projects have received about $1 billion of $1.5 billion in promised state funding, but so far have yielded zero of the more than 13,000 jobs promised.

State officials have said hiring was a long-term goal, in many cases giving the companies awarded SOAR funds several years to reach their goals.

However, the projects also have experienced delays and other issues.

Ford Motor Co. shrunk its Marshall plans. Our Next Energy — which received approval of its $200 million SOAR award on the same day as Gotion — recently announced a downsizing in Van Buren Township. General Motors sold its new EV battery factory near Lansing to partner LG Energy Solution, which plans a different product there. Another Ford project was never finalized after it was announced.

Guest Columnist

Data centers are multiplying across the Midwest as fast as big tech companies are able to buy up land and convince local communities to let them build.

This proliferation has already led to a huge spike in energy costs that’s causing residential customers’ rates to skyrocket.

There are solutions, including battery storage and affordable, available clean energy, that could help mitigate the energy challenge if policymakers pave the way for self-generation and distributed generation.

Unfortunately, data centers are just as water-hungry as they are energy-hungry, but there’s no easy solution to that challenge, which should worry communities across the state.

These massive warehouses of servers depend on enormous amounts of water to stay cool, often hundreds of millions of gallons each year – as much water as a small city. Yet almost no one can tell you exactly how much water they use, how it is sourced, or what safeguards exist to protect communities.

Recent research found that 75 percent of city leaders and more than half of business executives in the United States expect water risks to outpace all other infrastructure threats, especially as the American manufacturing sector continues to see rapid growth.

Indiana sits above deep aquifers and is crisscrossed by rivers, but our seeming water abundance has bred a dangerous complacency that data centers are poised to exploit.

A new report from the Alliance for the Great Lakes underscores how precarious this really is. Groundwater makes up a significant portion of the region’s water budget, and approximately two thirds of all Hoosiers depend on groundwater for their drinking and household water.

That means families from South Bend to Evansville depend on clean, accessible groundwater for their homes, farms and businesses. More than half of the water used by data centers is what’s called “consumptive.” That means it evaporates and does not return to the watershed – once it’s gone, it’s gone.

What makes this even more concerning is the lack of transparency.

The Great Lakes report found that while nearly all data centers purchase water from municipal systems connected to groundwater, less than one-third track or publicly report their use. In Indiana, that means local leaders are offering tax breaks and incentives for data centers whose true water footprint is invisible to the public. Without oversight, it’s impossible to know whether a facility will strain the same aquifer that supplies drinking water to nearby residents or irrigation water to farmers.

The industry points to technological fixes, like cooling with recycled wastewater or reducing evaporation rates, but these are imperfect and unguaranteed solutions that have other associated costs like increased energy requirements or potential pollutants. The truth is simpler and starker: we can’t manufacture more water.

Aquifers don’t refill on command. Remove too much water too fast, and the consequences are irreversible. Communities will see dry wells, higher costs for ratepayers and residents left scrambling to secure what once seemed plentiful.

This is why Indiana needs to step back and demand transparency and accountability. Water impacts must be part of every incentive package and siting decision, and data centers should be required to disclose their consumption and demonstrate sustainable practices before a shovel hits the ground.

State regulators must have the authority to curb withdrawals when water levels are at risk, not just after damage is already done. And economic development should never prioritize speculative digital infrastructure over the basic human right to safe, affordable drinking water.

Our water is our life. It fuels our farms, sustains our families, and anchors many parts of our economy. But once it’s over-promised to industries that take without returning, it’s gone for good. Indiana can and should embrace growth and innovation, but not at the expense of a finite resource none of us can live without.",,N,,2025-10-24 03:57:28.530248

The resolution will be brought to the governor, the Louisiana Department of Conservation and Energy, the EPA administrator, and all relevant state and federal legislatures.

Class VI injection wells are a specific type of well used for storing carbon dioxide long-term.

By passing the resolution, the council affirmed its overall opposition to the wells being used in the parish.

Parish District 8 Councilman Dean Coates, with Councilwoman Erin Sandefur and others, shaped the resolution that went before the parish council. The approved resolution, which Coates read to the council, states that the carbon capture and storage technology along with its infrastructure present many possible risks to the people and environment of Livingston Parish, “including seismicity and geological instability and long-term storage uncertainty of financial and liability risk.” In addition, the projects could have a negative impact on property values and future economic development.

At the meeting, more than 75 parish residents signed up to speak on the subject, but due to timing issues and a common opinion, most decided to defer their speaking time to others. Their concerns addressed these same risks and impacts from the resolution.

Bill Whittington, a Springfield resident and president of the Lake Maurepas Preservation Society, kept his comments short but firm: “We all know the hazards. We’ve been doing this for about three or four years. Y’all have all been to the meetings. Y’all know what it is. Y’all are representatives of the people. I’m going to go out and say there’s not one person in this room that wants this.”

Another resident, Chris Gaunthier spoke on the matter, saying he was missing his granddaughter’s volleyball game because of the lasting importance of the issue: “I served on city council when I was living in Oklahoma. Resolutions are good, quick fixes. We need an ordinance. We need a law after this…this is a good first step, but it’s weak. We need to stand strong and say, No, absolutely not.”

After the council voted to approve the resolution, Parish President Randy Delatte spoke on the issue, saying he has fought against carbon capture projects in the area and spoken to Gov. Jeff Landry on the concern, as well.

“If we let the governor do his job, I believe he will give us the tools where we can do these things. But preaching to us is like preaching to the choir,” Delatte said.

He added: “Work with the Governor as hard as we can to get the tools to where it takes a vote of the people, or the vote of local politicians to let (those projects) here. Our first primary concern, as one of the speakers got up here said, is the safety and welfare of our people. That’s the first primary concern.”

Concerns over a proposed carbon capture project

The resolution comes after Livingston Parish landowners received letters in September about a proposed carbon capture project, sparking concern among the community.

On Sept. 10, 1PointFive and Enbridge Inc. announced the formation of a joint venture to develop the Pelican Sequestration Hub and transportation infrastructure in Louisiana. 1PointFive is responsible for developing the facilities that will store carbon dioxide underground, and Enbridge will build and operate pipelines from customer facilities to this hub, according to a press release.

Coates met with an Enbridge company representative on Sept. 24, before holding a public meeting the same day. He invited company representatives to speak at the public meeting, but they declined, he told UWK.

Earlier in October, Coates said he’s talked with people all across Livingston Parish about the carbon capture sequestration projects and their potential effects.

“There’s a big contingency of people against this, and we just have to bond together to make a difference,” Coates said.

COMPREHENSIVE SYSTEM TRANSFORMATION The development of renewable energy projects is undergoing a period of profound reflection.
The debate concluded with a joint call to improve social acceptance of renewable energy, a task still pending.
Eduardo Medina (CEO, RES), Juan Otazu (Production Director, Acciona Energía), and Javier Amelivia (CEO Wind, Spie) will participate.","The 4th International Congress of the Industry for the Energy Transition, CITE25, organized by Enercluster with the special collaboration of the Government of Navarre, made Pamplona the European capital of renewable energy this Thursday. Players linked to this industry, totaling more than 400 guests, gathered at the Baluarte Congress Center and Auditorium of Navarre, where they shared the solutions and proposals they believe are necessary to increase their level of autonomy and competitiveness.

CITE25 was sponsored, on this occasion, by Acciona Energía, Nordex Group, and Inge team, as TERApartners; Grupo Enhol, Laulagun Bearings, Nabrawind, Repsol, and Sakana Group, as GIGApartners; along with ARENA, ARPA Abogados Consultores, Array, Industrial Barranquesa, Beeplanet, EDP Renewables, Elektra, EnergyLoop, EOSOL, IED, Grupo Inerzia, Leadernet, Renercycle, Ríos Renovables, Rose Holm, SIG, Sta tkraft, and Urgon as MEGApartners.

From then on, the long shadow of China loomed over Baluarte at all times, and discussions focused on what levers the European renewable energy industry should use to counter the growing influence of Asian players. Therefore, political unity was called for around the entire European value chain, from suppliers to developers. Also emphasized was the need to invest in local networks and infrastructure, facilitating and streamlining bureaucratic procedures as much as possible.

Thirdly, a call was made to boost reindustrialization through measures that go beyond subsidies and without falling into protectionism. All of this without forgetting the development of a communication exercise that helps the population share the benefits of the energy transition and decarbonization process.

GO ON THE OFFENSIVE

The Minister of Industry and Tourism, Jordi Hereu, opened his speech at CITE25 by congratulating the organizers for bringing together the protagonists of one of the most decisive processes for the economic and energy future of Europe: the industrial transition towards a sustainable model.

Sustainable. He emphasized that both Spain and the European Union must reaffirm their commitment to reindustrialization and the fight against climate change, two strategies he considered “inseparable” and which, he stated, are championed “here in Navarre, in Spain, and within the European Council.” For the minister, Navarre represents an example of a region that has managed to turn industry into its main source of progress, with increased exports, innovation, and social quality. In this regard, he praised its pioneering role in the development of wind energy, “one of the great competitive advantages of the Spanish economy,” and asserted that investing in renewables “not only saves the planet, but also opens the door to new industrial sectors and a virtuous cycle of growth.”

Hereu also championed strategic autonomy as an essential principle of European industrial and energy policy. He recalled that the sun, soil, and wind are European resources and, therefore, the foundation of a development model that is less dependent on external sources. “The defense of our freedoms and democracy requires a foundation of economic power,” he stated, linking industrial strength with Europe’s ability to maintain its influence and well-being. In this regard, he insisted that the renewable energy value chain must have greater European influence, but without falling into protectionism, instead supporting international cooperation and an energy policy that guarantees fair conditions for all.

In his final message, he conveyed to the companies in the sector the support of the Spanish government and its willingness to maintain a constructive dialogue to jointly address the challenges of the ecological transition and industrial competitiveness: “Our present and future are at stake. It’s time to go on the offensive in reindustrialization and the green transition.”

For her part, the President of Navarre, María Chivite, highlighted the role of the Autonomous Community as a European leader in renewable energy generation and in its commitment to a sustainable economic model. “Navarra is the land of the renewable energy industry,” she stated.

He recalled the “almost self-taught” origins of this industry and that his government will continue to promote public-private cooperation to consolidate this leadership. Chivite emphasized that this sector is part of Navarre’s “DNA” and that, along with the automotive industry, agri-food, and renewable energy, they are pillars of its competitiveness and well-being.

In her speech, the president also warned of the need to protect European industry from unfair competition and international trade tensions, calling for a “boost to localization” as a guarantee of the future of the value chain. Therefore, Chivi urged the European Union to act decisively to avoid losing its productive capacity and argued that the energy transition is not only viable but also a driver of competitiveness, as demonstrated by the growth of the Spanish economy. “Europe cannot be the museum of the world,” she said, urging the companies present to turn the congress into a space for alliances and solutions that strengthen the continent’s green industry.

Previously, and in the same vein, the European Commission’s Executive Vice-President for a Clean, Fair and Competitive Transition, Teresa Ribera, stressed that “competitiveness is green.” In a video message, Ribera argued that the energy transition is not only a climate issue, but also an economic issue, one of prosperity and

security for Europe. He cited Spain as an example, where the growth of wind and solar energy has reduced the influence of fossil fuels on electricity prices by 75% since 2019, placing the cost of electricity 32% below the European average. “Clean energy is synonymous with competitive prices and well-being,” he stated, insisting that the Clean Industrial Deal seeks to make clean technologies the pillar of European industrial strength.

Ribera warned, however, that Europe cannot be left behind in a global context where powers like China have invested more than €210 billion in clean technologies since 2022. In this regard, he called for accelerating energy integration and providing security to investors and innovators. He also announced new large-scale financial tools, such as a €409 billion Competitiveness Fund, a decarbonization bank with the capacity to mobilize €100 billion, and a European electricity interconnection package that will be launched by the end of the year. “The world is changing rapidly, but Europe has what it takes: innovation, unity, and vision,” Ribera concluded, calling for the clean transition to become the continent’s main competitive advantage.

CEOs of renewable energy companies defend “Made in the EU”

China, which by 2024 had more than half of the world’s installed wind power capacity, dominated the first panel of the day, making it clear that it is the greatest rival of European wind energy companies. “They are already taking away market share from us in regions like South America, Africa, and even Spain,” warned José Luis Blanco, CEO of Nordex Group.

Blanco admitted that the Asian giant is an “imminent threat,” warned of the “potential risk” that the majority of the energy generated is “controlled” by Chinese companies, and explained that this country’s superiority is due to four reasons: the “total support” of its government, which has developed a “national strategy to globally dominate” renewable energy; its technology; its demographics, which in unpopulated areas allow for the installation of larger facilities than those in Europe; and its innovative infrastructure network, which allows for the efficient transport of wind turbines.

To reverse this situation, the Nordex CEO advocated accelerating project licensing, investing in networks and infrastructure, focusing on European suppliers, and being independent throughout the entire value chain. “It’s pointless to have wind turbines on our land if we don’t develop the technology ourselves,” he emphasized.

Michael Larsen, CEO of SM Industries, argued that components should be manufactured in Europe and, along the same lines, urged companies to purchase from the old continent, even if they would save less and offer slightly more expensive energy. “Citizens must pay a few euros more for energy in exchange for preserving jobs and local industry. Only then will we grow again,” he added.

Torsten Tiefel, CEO of SIlbitz Group GmbH, pointed out that Europe’s strategy should not be to imitate the new Chinese wind turbines, which, due to their enormous size, are capable of generating up to 20 gigawatts. “We don’t have the appropriate infrastructure, and it would require a large investment. Furthermore, I believe these wind turbines will not significantly reduce energy prices,” argued Tiefel. According to the CEO of SIlbitz Group GmbH, European companies must “improve the reliability” of their wind turbines,

Better recycle the materials that make up these devices, reduce bureaucracy, and work with global regulations to compete on a level playing field.

Adolfo Rebollo, CEO of Ingeteam, also rejected increasing the capacity of European wind turbines to the level of those of Chinese companies because their transportation and the adaptation of infrastructure (tunnels, bridges, roads) would significantly increase energy prices and, consequently, lead to a loss of competitiveness. Like his fellow panelists, Rebollo advocated strengthening European industry, technology, and the supply chain. “We can’t buy from abroad; we have to protect ourselves. If there is local industry, value is created, wealth is generated, and it reverts to society,” he explained. Furthermore, to protect European companies from those from other continents, he requested that only local companies be able to benefit from public aid granted by public and national institutions.

REINFORCED AND COLLABORATIVE VALUE CHAIN

The subsequent roundtable discussion, moderated by Enercluster’s manager, Iker Chasco, focused on various international experiences in building a renewable energy value chain. The United States, India, and Brazil are some of the countries that have developed specific regulations to support local production and strengthen this chain in the face of, for example, Chinese exports.

The first to speak was Mike Carr, executive director of the Solar Energy Manufacturers of America (SEMA). He began his remarks by mentioning that the organization had already recognized, even before the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) was passed in 2022, that it would be impossible to compete with China if the supply chains for materials used to build photovoltaic panels were “too concentrated” in the Asian giant. “Currently, thanks to this law, there is a record rise in energy demand in many states. A large number of data centers and component factories for photovoltaic plants and wind farms are being built in Michigan and Georgia,” he explained.

At the same time, he noted that the messages President Trump is sending about renewable energy “are contradictory.” “Finally, it appears that the Senate and Congress are not going to eliminate the subsidies proposed by the IRA and that Trump had announced. Instead, many industrially depressed areas will experience a boost in the short and medium term.”

“long-term,” Carr said. In his final speaking session, he emphasized the need for greater manufacturing capacity for photovoltaic panel components. “We can’t ignore the fact that solar energy is the cheapest and fastest way to obtain electricity,” he concluded.

The next speaker was Silvia Gavorníková, head of the Export Credits and Competition Division of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), who took over from Carr to refer to the report published a few months ago by the OECD on public subsidies in the business environment. “The global steel market is distorted by extra-market forces, in which producers who do not benefit from subsidies cannot compete on a level playing field,” Gavorníková stated. Along these lines, she noted that the Chinese government has not yet begun requiring foreign companies to obtain special permits to export critical raw materials for the construction of photovoltaic panels or wind turbines, such as silicon, aluminum, steel, semiconductors, and so on.

“The data shows there is no level playing field. Our report indicates that the steel subsidy rate in China is five times higher than the average of other economies,” she stated. However, she emphasized that each government should apply subsidies based on its needs, “but they must be used to create a level playing field.” In closing, Gavorníková recommended that those present contact export agencies if they want to penetrate the international market. “If Europe stands united as one nation, we will be stronger,” she emphasized.

The third member of the panel was Ruben Davis, Head of Policy at Cleantech for Europe, who began his presentation by explaining where the need for European countries to build renewable energy value chains comes from. “At the industrial and political level, Europe has focused too much on innovation, leaving manufacturing behind, while China has managed to combine both aspects. We Europeans have top-level universities, research centers, and incubators, but we have neglected everything else,” he lamented. In this regard, he described the Asian giant’s value chain. “China has adopted a more comprehensive approach. It has created a local supply chain around its companies to control market access by attracting talent, providing training, and exploiting raw materials,” he noted.

The solution? Davis recommends a change of mentality at the European level. “Subsidies are not the only solution. We have to build a suitable trade environment. If we don’t create mechanisms to defend local trade and industry, we Europeans will always lose against China,” and advocates adopting a position similar to that of the United States, although he clarified that “the American pendulum has swung too far toward protectionism and isolationism.” “Europe must remain open and commit to reindustrialization,” he concluded.

COMPREHENSIVE SYSTEM TRANSFORMATION

The development of renewable energy projects is undergoing a period of profound reflection. This was highlighted by Arantza Ezpeleta, CEO of Acciona Energía; João Costeira, Executive Managing Director of Repsol Low Carbon Generation; and Rocío Sicre, General Manager of EDP Renováveis ​​Spain, during the CEO Developers panel at the International Congress of the Industry for the Energy Transition (CITE25). They agreed that the energy transition cannot be limited to “a race to install megawatts” but must be approached as a comprehensive transformation of the energy and production system.

The three executives acknowledged that 2025 is proving to be a challenging year, with more than 600 hours of zero or negative electricity prices and stagnant demand. “We are facing unbalanced generation, without grids that can absorb production, and with demand that is not growing,” warned Ezpeleta. According to the Acciona Energía director, “Spain is doing very well at decarbonizing supply, but we are failing at decarbonizing demand.” In her opinion, meeting the PNIEC targets will require electricity consumption to grow by 6% annually, which requires active electrification policies, more robust grids, and greater storage capacity.

For her part, Rocío Sicre considered the current imbalances to be “temporary, not structural,” but emphasized the urgent need to implement capacity mechanisms that restore value to the megawatt hour and enable the viability of new projects. “The demand is there and wants to be established, but it needs competitive prices and regulatory certainty ,” she explained. She also called for reducing the administrative bottlenecks that hinder new investments and warned of the need to “sophisticate markets” and avoid unpredictable quality that erodes companies’ margins.

Repsol’s João Costeira was more cautious: “We’ve had more supply than demand for years, and solutions aren’t short-term.” He championed investment in storage, networks, and digitalization, and insisted that “not all megawatt hours are equal: only the most efficient projects with the capacity to add value to the system will survive.” Costeira also warned of the risk of overcapacity and the need to adapt business models to an increasingly demanding market: “In the coming years, only the truly good projects will be built.”

Regarding regulatory matters, the three agreed on a review of the auction model to ensure that awarded projects are executed and do not become speculative exercises. Sicre argued that auctions should take into account “price indexation and realistic development times,” while Ezpeleta recalled that “they were a useful tool in the past, but they only work if they are well designed and adapted to each market.” Costeira was more blunt: “In Spain, there is no need for new onshore auctions; the objective should be to consolidate existing ones and strengthen the supply chain.”

Another focus of the conversation was the defense of European content in the renewable value chain. “We cannot continue decarbonizing at the expense of deindustrializing Europe,” Costeira warned. “The rules must reflect real costs; manufacturing a turbine here cannot be more expensive than importing it from China, without taking into account the taxes and the jobs it creates.” Along these lines, Ezpeleta called for a European incentive framework that supports the purchase of products manufactured in Europe.

The debate concluded with a joint call to improve social acceptance of renewable energy, a task still pending. “Twenty-five years ago there was ignorance, today there is opposition,” lamented Ezpeleta, who called for greater education and transparency in explaining the local benefits of the projects. Sicre agreed: “We develop in rural areas that need investment, but the opposition has become politicized and is resorting to legal proceedings with thousands of megawatts at a standstill.”

EUROPE AND ITS INDUSTRIAL SOVEREIGNTY

At the PV & Storage CEO panel, Christoph Podewils, Secretary General of the European Solar Manufacturing Council (ESMC), noted that Europe has lagged behind due to its “complicated” bureaucratic legislation that requires “too many requirements and conditions,” the new IRA regulation implemented by the United States that has attracted many companies to the North American country, and the power of Chinese batteries, which have greater “overcapacity.” Podewils said the key lies in changing mentalities and making consumers see that it is worth paying more money for higher-quality batteries. Along the same lines, he asserted that only 60% of modules manufactured in China meet their own specifications and, for example, are not resistant to hailstorms.

Marc Rechter, CEO of MCPV, advocated for the European Union to have its own legislation to make manufacturing in Europe “simple, fast, and clear .” Specifically, he advocated for European regulations requiring solar panel components to be manufactured in the old country, increasing European manufacturing capacity, and creating a favorable regulatory framework for investment. “We have to prevent money from going to China or the United States,” he asserted. Furthermore, Rechter indicated that Europe must change its mindset, streamline regulations, and “adjust the rules to the speed of change in the modern world.”

Laurent Bodin, Chief Commercial Officer of Holosolis, argued that fewer Chinese modules should be purchased and, like the other speakers, considered it vital that European laws require the manufacturing of modules and batteries to be carried out on the continent. “Modules cannot come from China. We have to buy in Europe and have everything in order.”

Made in Europe. We’re talking about our own freedom, sovereignty, and resilience,” he warned. According to Bodin, this is “Europe’s last chance,” which must create an industrial base capable of absorbing “new innovation,” reduce regulatory oversight, and accelerate procurement.

Finally, Hervé Amossé, EVP of Saft Energy Storage Solutions, explained that the company has been manufacturing its own lithium battery modules and cells for over a decade, but has been entering the Chinese market for the past five years. “During the pandemic, they took the lead because their batteries have much greater capacity,” he acknowledged. Amossé noted that Europe must “become stronger” in other areas, such as the development of software that regulates energy injection or absorption, grid connection, and battery maintenance.

AFTERNOON PROGRAMMING

In the afternoon, the program will transition to parallel sessions in two Baluarte rooms. The O&M Panel will be held in the Sala Cámara, where participants will discuss how new technologies—such as artificial intelligence, drones, and robots—can revolutionize operation and maintenance services, one of the fastest-growing and most profitable businesses. Eduardo Medina (CEO, RES), Juan Otazu (Production Director, Acciona Energía), and Javier Amelivia (CEO Wind, Spie) will participate. Elisa Manero, president of AEMER, will moderate the panel.

Simultaneously, in the Luneta Room, the Energy Storage Panel will take place. It will address questions about the viability of the Spanish market, lessons learned from other more mature markets, and the future beyond lithium batteries. Speakers will include Rodrigo Harstein (Head of Portfolio Management – ​​Battery Energy Storage Systems at Siemens Energy), Peer Piske (Managing Partner at Alantra), Susana Gómez (Head of Renewable Energy at Nexus), and Will Broad (Global Director of Policy and Market of Long Duration Storage at LDES Council), moderated by Eugenio Domínguez, Vice President of AEPIBAL.

Subsequently, the Green Hydrogen Panel will open again in the Chamber of Deputies, addressing the realistic expectations of this technology and its competitive applications. Participating will be Susana de Pablo (General Director of Engineering, Technology and Digitalization at Enagas), Alan Ripa (CEO of Acciona Plug), Juan Peña (Chief Corporate Business and Institutional Affairs Officer at Grupo Enhol), Carlos Ayuso (Technology Development & New Ventures Director at Moeve), and Luis Solla (CEO of Nordex Electrolyzers), moderated by Antonio González (Vice President of the Spanish Hydrogen Association – AeH2).

Meanwhile, in the Luneta Room, the Grid Panel will take place, focusing on the role of the electricity grid in the energy transition and its capacity to integrate the current and future deployment of renewables. Alfredo García-Borreguero (Managing Director of Hitachi Energy Spain), José Manuel Pérez (Director of Regulation at EDP Spain), Eduardo Pedrosa (Managing Director of Transmission & Distribution at Ingeteam), and Concha Sánchez (General Manager of Operations at Red Elétrica) will be present, moderated by Héctor de Lama (Technical Director at UNEF).

After another coffee break, the day will conclude with a keynote address by Yana Popkostova, founder of ECEGA, who will offer an overview of the challenges and opportunities facing the European renewable energy industry in the current geopolitical context. It will conclude with an institutional closing address by Mikel Irujo, Minister of Economic and Business Development for the Government of Navarre, and Aitor Erquicia, President of Enercluster.",https://strategicenergy.eu/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/cite23-10-2025-137-1024x683.jpg,N,,2025-10-24 03:18:09.602221

National priorities Redwood's two-pronged approach, critical materials and energy storage, positions it as both a new-age miner and power provider for the AI age.","Redwood Materials, the battery recycling startup run by Tesla cofounder JB Straubel, just raised $350 million in a funding round that pushes its valuation past $6 billion.

The deal, led by Eclipse with participation from Nvidia's venture capital arm NVentures, supports Redwood's surprising new role powering the generative AI boom.

At first glance, a company known for reclaiming metals such as cobalt, nickel, and lithium might seem far removed from the realm of large language models and GPU clusters. But as AI data centers multiply across the US, power has become a defining bottleneck. Redwood's growing grid energy storage business aims to solve that.

Back in June, the startup unveiled Redwood Energy to help power the AI revolution by repurposing used batteries into energy storage systems. Its massive new battery installations store electricity at low cost, releasing it during high-demand periods to stabilize the grid and feed energy-hungry data centers.

Eclipse's Joe Fath, a former T. Rowe Price fund manager who backed Tesla early on, helped drive the latest funding round. Nvidia's involvement as a strategic investor is also notable as the chip giant seeks ways to keep the AI boom energized.

""This energy business is a really exciting opportunity for them to go attack,"" Fath told Business Insider in an interview. ""They have a unique opportunity to build out battery energy storage solutions and leverage all kinds of power generation, whether it be solar, wind, industrial gas turbines and ultimately nuclear, to power data centers that are off grid.""

Keeping the Fath

Straubel and other Redwood leaders initially pitched the energy business to Fath in August 2024 and the company went live with AI data center provider Crusoe this June, less than a year later.

""Time to market is extremely quick,"" Fath added. ""They have a very strong and proven ability to scale.""

Fath also likes how Redwood has evolved over time, with each new business getting better in terms of financial returns.

The startup's original business of recycling EV batteries, which started back in 2017, was a ""wedge,"" Fath said. A more recent move to manufacture Cathode Active Material is promising but takes big upfront investment that will take time to recoup. In contrast, Redwood's energy installations start generating revenue quicker, Fath said.

National priorities

Redwood's two-pronged approach, critical materials and energy storage, positions it as both a new-age miner and power provider for the AI age. By recycling key minerals domestically and integrating them into advanced battery systems, Straubel's company is tackling two national challenges at once: energy security and technological competitiveness.

""We need to have energy independence and protect sovereignty in the US,"" Fath said. ""So it plays into their strengths.""

The timing is critical. With foreign supply chains tightening and renewable generation still intermittent, Redwood's US-made storage systems could help unlock stranded grid capacity and enable faster AI deployment. The company's systems, designed with sophisticated power electronics and software, aim to complement natural gas and future nuclear plants, boosting efficiency and reliability.

YCC: Are farm animals necessary to regenerative agriculture?
YCC: What are the advantages, in terms of biodiversity and climate adaptation and mitigation, in letting nature into a farm?","Kelsey Timmerman grew up in farm country. He has witnessed firsthand the damage that modern industrial agriculture can inflict. In the process of writing his bestselling “Where Am I” trilogy –“Where Am I Wearing,” “Where Am I Eating,” “Where Am I Giving” – Timmerman traveled the world and, in the process, began to see how agricultural practices affect natural ecosystems, human communities, and the climate.

In his new book, “Regenerating Earth,” Timmerman explores this topic with equal breadth – he travels the world again, but in greater depth. Yale Climate Connections interviewed Timmerman via Zoom at the homestead he farms with his family outside Muncie, Indiana, where he teaches at Ball State University.

This interview is the second in a series on new and recent books about climate change and agriculture. Our interview with Michael Grunwald, author of “We Are Eating the Earth,” is here. We’ll publish an interview with Mark Easter, author of “The Blue Plate: A Food Lover’s Guide to Climate Chaos,” later this month.

This interview has been edited and condensed.

Yale Climate Connections: You begin and end your book in Indiana, where you live. Why did you feel that you needed to speak as a Midwesterner in telling these stories?

Kelsey Timmerman: Although it looks like a jungle behind me, [he gestures to the window] my land is surrounded by corn and soybeans, so I’m surrounded by industrial agriculture. I’ve seen the decimation that is happening in and around me. I have family and friends who feel like they are being exploited by this system. Then, when I heard about regenerative agriculture, I wondered what that could mean for my community, for me.

Writing the book was a personal journey. I wanted to show how it changed my life and the place where I live. I wanted to tell the story as a rural citizen living on Earth today.

YCC: Early in your introduction, you give a gloss for industrial agriculture. You say “corporations farm farmers.” What do you mean by that?

Timmerman: That came from a guy who lives just down the road from me. He’s a conventional soybean and corn farmer. What he means is that the folks making money are the giant agrochemical conglomerates who are supplying the seed and who are writing the prescriptions for how much of their [fertilizers and pesticides] to spray on the fields. The costs for these things keep going up, but what farmers are being paid per bushel is not. So many farmers wonder if their farm will even be there for their kids.

YCC: You make a contrast between monocropping and multicropping or diversity. And you repeat the key point of that contrast in almost every chapter of your book: If you’re raising a whole lot of something like corn or soybeans or cows or pigs – and only that thing – then you need a whole lot of chemical support. And that chemical support is dangerous not just to farmers, but to the people who live around them.

Timmerman: I’ve been to too many funerals of farmers in their 50s and early 60s who have died of cancer, and the family wonders if it was the time that dad got doused in this or that chemical that caused it.

One of the things I wanted to get at with this book was how much industrial agriculture is being exported around the world.

To be in the Amazon and see a farm that looks like my neighbor’s farm – John Deere tractor, grain bins, and corn – you think it’s Indiana. One of the most ecologically diverse places on our planet, and we’ve turned it into a monocrop of corn or soybeans. Same goes for Hawaii. Same goes for Kenya. I saw that again and again and again.

But in the face of this degeneration, I meet people who believe in regeneration, who believe that they can do something different in their communities to make a difference. And that, for me, makes this a hopeful book, because if a woman restoring a small farm in Kenya can have hope, how can the rest of us not?

YCC: Let me just give a quick rundown of the places you include in your book. In the United States, you talk about Wisconsin, Ohio, Minnesota, North Carolina, Indiana, and Hawaii. Outside the U.S., you visit Brazil, Colombia, and Kenya.

So at the end of your book, to follow this point to its conclusion, you list seven practices that unite the farmers that you profiled over its course. At the top is promoting diversity. So why is it so important to multi-crop as opposed to monocrop?

Timmerman: My neighbor does relay cropping. He plants wheat in the winter, which grows up in the spring; then he plants soybeans down into that. With just this diversity of two, he’s using less fertilizer and fewer chemicals.

But also really critical is biodiversity. A pest is only a pest if the predator is not nearby. If you have diversity, chances are that in a natural system, the predator of that pest is also attracted to that area.

Cultural diversity is really important as well. I know that in certain circles, we’re not even supposed to say “diversity” anymore. But we have big challenges ahead of us. And who’s to say what culture or what plant or what practice will really help us in a changing climate.

YCC: When you describe farms that are growing five, six, seven different kinds of crops that are all laced together into an ecosystem, those were, I thought, really fascinating chapters. One was in the Amazon, which was an agroforestry model. But you describe something similar in Wisconsin.

Timmerman: Yeah, Mark Shepard in Wisconsin had a big perennial food forest.

YCC: Right, to the point that you often couldn’t tell that you were looking at a farm.

Timmerman: Mark Shepard’s 100-acre farm is a great example of a highly productive system. From the overstory to the understory, the underbrush, and then the rows of vegetables, you are getting calories every step of the way.

Mark’s done the math, and he’s more productive per acre than a field of corn, which is saying a lot because corn produces a lot of dense, very dense calories. His farm is successful economically. He makes a living. But every farm is different. Mark’s is very close to Organic Valley, one of the largest buyers of organic produce in the nation. He also does consulting to build systems like that.

But there’s another factor that doesn’t get talked about enough: It can be very efficient to grow a monocrop, but not very resilient when it comes to a pest or when the system breaks down.

YCC: Are farm animals necessary to regenerative agriculture?

Timmerman: I think it depends on the context. For our family to live regeneratively, it sure is nice having chickens that eat scraps. And they have bedding that is great in our compost pile, which later goes to the garden, which then feeds us. In the springtime, we can put the chickens out and let them turn over the soil. There’s so many good things about having chickens where we live.

There are also benefits to having animals in certain places in the arid regions. In Kenya, some lands have been turned around by reintroducing cattle and bunching and herding them.

So, yes, animals can have a positive impact. In my Environmental 101 class in college, we talked about animals being the cause of desertification. But now there are places and people that show that animals can actually help bring that land back, too.

YCC: What are the advantages, in terms of biodiversity and climate adaptation and mitigation, in letting nature into a farm?

Timmerman: When you let nature in, the land is able to hold more water and to hang on to its soil. And then other life is attracted to the environment you’ve created.

We’ve let some of our land go wild. We rotated the sheep around and saw the trees pop up. There were no squirrels when we first got here; now there are. And the fields are now humming with insect life out here. We’ve got a ton of milkweed growing. We’re now this little oasis for the monarchs. Other people in the area are doing the same, and we’re seeing a greater diversity of birds.

I met people who have been on their land for 40, 50 years; they’ve seen things change and turn around. We live at a time when many humans lack meaning and purpose, and we face a future where we might even be more alone. Getting outside and getting your hands in the soil is good.

YCC: Another point that several of your farmers make is that you have to listen to what the land needs, and you have to figure out the very specific formula for turning the land around. And that seems to make this model more exportable than the industrial model when we’re talking about Africa, Asia, Latin America.

Timmerman: Other than that, the industrial model has a lot more money behind it. There’s a lot of money to be made by selling seeds and fertilizers and pesticides into other countries. But in Kenya, the farmers discovered that the seeds they were sold wouldn’t grow; then they couldn’t buy additional seeds, and they couldn’t afford to buy the fertilizers. Whereas working with cattle, they were able to regenerate the land.

Growing a single monocrop like corn on degraded land is really tough for subsistence farmers in Kenya. And it’s not all that effective in helping people eat more calories or get out of poverty.

YCC: So would you say, then, that regenerative agriculture is the solution to living on a climate-changing planet with 10 billion people, or that it’s a necessary part of the solution?

Timmerman: I would not say it’s the whole solution. I know some reports suggest that we can completely sequester all the carbon that humans produce in the soil. That’s not going to happen. But the holistic practices of being part of a place, noticing change, and getting to know what works, those could be really critical for our future, whether it’s farming on a small scale on your own homestead, or it’s on a larger level where you’re a regenerative farmer who’s feeding other people.

YCC: Are you familiar with “We Are Eating the Earth” by Michael Grunwald and his skepticism about regenerative agriculture?

Timmerman: Yes.

YCC: What do you think Grunwald gets right about regenerative agriculture? What do you think he gets wrong?

Timmerman: There are probably three ethanol plants less than a 30-minute drive from my house. So I appreciate Searchinger [Grunwald’s number-crunching adviser] showing that biofuels aren’t the magic bullet people thought they would be, that they’re a waste of land that could actually produce food for humans.

I also agree with him that this idea of sequestering so much carbon constitutes a sort of tunnel vision. I myself suffered from carbon tunnel vision for a while. That’s not a magic bullet either.

YCC: What does he get wrong?

Timmerman: Well, I never really understood what his definition of regenerative agriculture was, and that’s a challenge because there are many different definitions of regenerative agriculture out there. His book, I think, is very focused on yields and overlooks other benefits of regenerative agriculture, like biodiversity and keeping soil on the land. He says land is not infinite; well, neither is soil. And it is washing down our rivers at an alarming rate. He talks about land use a lot; I think land used up is a problem, too.

YCC: I loved the opening title to the first chapter of yours, “Plant the World You Want to Live In.” What message would you like readers to take away from your book? From this interview?

Timmerman: The culture practitioners in Hawaii ask the younger kids, “What river do you belong to?” I would love if my neighbors, other farmers, and anyone who reads my book asked themselves, “How can we be part of the places that we live and be protectors of those places?” Even though we’ve done so much wrong, we should believe that humans can be a force for good, working with and within the cycles of nature to heal the planet and to heal ourselves a little bit as well. If people on the front lines of this fight against degeneration can still look towards the future with hope, how can we not?",https://i0.wp.com/yaleclimateconnections.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/20251022-regenerative-agriculture-climate-change.jpg?fit=1600%2C900&ssl=1,N,,2025-10-24 04:58:47.622970

Thursday morning, the Michigan Economic Development Corporation (MEDC) told 13 On Your Side they are trying to recoup $23 million from Gotion for the land purchase. They are also taking back another $24 million that was never spent by the company.

In a statement, a spokesperson for the MEDC said:

“While this is not the outcome we hoped for, we recognize the tremendous responsibility we have to the people we serve to make sure their hard-earned tax dollars are spent wisely and appropriately. Because milestones were not met, none of the $125 million CIP grant to Gotion, Inc. was ever disbursed to the company. We will actively pursue repayment by Gotion of the $23.6 million in SSRP grant dollars that went to toward reimbursing the purchase of the land. The remaining $26.4 million SSRP dollars were not spent and will return to the state.

We continue to focus on securing advanced manufacturing investments, especially across ICE, EV and hybrid vehicles to position Michigan at the forefront of the mobility revolution as it evolves and adapts to market conditions within this decade and beyond. We will continue doing all we can to bring good paying jobs and economic opportunity to Michiganders everywhere.”

13 On Your Side called Chuck Thelen, Gotion's VP of North America Operations, Thursday afternoon. In a text message, Thelen said:

""As we describe in our letter responding to the Michigan Strategic Fund's notice, Gotion has not abandoned its project in Green Charter Township. Gotion, however, recognizes the significance of the hurdles that have been placed in front of this project by those who oppose it. And, it is true that the local municipalities' actions are presenting a barrier to the project proceeding, and without their support, neither this project nor any other project could be completed. The current steps taken by the MSF are a direct result of those actions by the local municipalities. Nonetheless, we welcome a conversation with the state and the local governments regarding the future of this development.""

In the past, Gotion said over 10 years the plant would bring over 2,000 jobs to Mecosta County. Congressman John Moolenaar, who has expressed concerns over Gotion, disagrees with those claims.

""Let's acknowledge that those numbers that Goshen was touting were never realistic,"" said Moolenaar. ""They were relying on billions of dollars of federal dollars, hundreds of millions of taxpayer dollars in the state of Michigan, and an EV battery market that has plummeted and so it was never a sound investment.""

Controversy has surrounded the Gotion project since it's announcement in 2022. Opponents have said in the past that their concerned with the companies ties with the Chinese Communist Party. Thelen has denied any affiliation with the Chinese Government. He released this statement last year:

""Gotion High-Tech is an independently operated international private enterprise. The political affiliation of any employee does not affect the company’s business decision-making process. Gotion complies with all laws and regulations of the countries where it conducts business and provides high-quality products to their customers.""

Earlier this year, Gotion sued Green Charter Township in federal court for what the company calls a ""breach of contract.""

The lawsuit alleges Green Township failed to approve a water line for the project, which is stated as being a violation of the development agreement that was put in place under the previous township board.

At the time of the filing, the Mecosta Environmental Security Alliance (MESA) issued a response that stated the original agreement under the previous township board was reached without a public meeting, making it a violation of the Opening Meetings Act. Due to this, the MESA said the lawsuit is not legitimate.",https://media.wzzm13.com/assets/WZZM/images/dcaa3484-4825-4549-b8e2-2d3bb2330138/dcaa3484-4825-4549-b8e2-2d3bb2330138_1140x641.jpg,N,,2025-10-24 01:58:09.617514

By the Environmental Working Group

A diverse coalition of 84 organizations has called on House and Senate lawmakers to oppose any legislative efforts that would block state laws protecting consumers from toxic chemicals in food.

The coalition includes the Environmental Working Group and many other public health and environmental groups. The letter they sent says state laws are often the first line of defense for consumers facing emerging chemical-safety threats in the food supply, especially since the Food and Drug Administration has failed to act. It says:

[S]tates have led efforts to address the risks posed by food and food contact chemicals – by enacting laws in five states and considering laws in more than 20 states.

The ingredients addressed by these state laws and bills have already been addressed by many of our trading partners in other nations.

We understand that Congress may consider food safety legislation. As you do so, we urge you to reject efforts to limit the power of states to protect consumers.

While we remain hopeful that FDA will fulfill their food safety responsibilities, we urge you to reject efforts to undermine the important supplementary role played by states.

Here is the letter

Dear Senator:

Our organizations strongly oppose efforts to limit the power of states to help ensure the safety of

food and food contact chemicals.

For many decades, the Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, has failed to address the safety

of food and food contact chemicals. Most food chemicals enter commerce without a safety

review by the FDA, and the FDA does not routinely reconsider the safety of food chemicals

once they have entered commerce. As a result, many food and food contact chemicals allowed

chemicals by enacting laws in five states and considering laws in more than 20 states. The

ingredients addressed by these state laws and bills have already been addressed by many of

our trading partners in other nations.

We understand that Congress may consider food safety legislation. As you do so, we urge you

to reject efforts to limit the power of states to protect consumers. While we remain hopeful that

FDA will fulfill their food safety responsibilities, we urge you to reject efforts to undermine the

important supplementary role played by states.

Rivian has struggled to achieve consistent profitability due to costs related to ramping up of production, tariffs and intense competition from Tesla and traditional automakers.

High tariffs on imported auto parts have driven up manufacturing costs and squeezed margins for EV makers, forcing them to revamp supply chains, curb reliance on foreign components and boost US investment in line with the Trump administration policy.

Analysts expect Rivian’s quarterly revenue to surge 71.5 per cent and loss to narrow, when it reports third-quarter results after markets close on Nov 4.

The company lowered the midpoint of its annual deliveries forecast earlier this month, despite reporting a nearly 32 per cent jump in the third quarter, largely driven by a last-minute rush to grab the now-expired federal incentive.

Rivian is focusing on improving manufacturing efficiency and streamlining operations at its Normal, Illinois plant to align costs with the weaker near-term demand outlook, while preparing for its next-generation R2 models, which are expected to broaden its reach beyond the luxury segment.

First-of-its kind project in the G7 will create 18,000 jobs and secure province’s energy future

BOWMANVILLE — As part of its plan to protect Ontario and build a more competitive, resilient and self-reliant economy, the province is investing $1 billion through the Building Ontario Fund in the first small modular reactors (SMRs) in the G7 at Darlington Nuclear Station. Ontario’s SMRs will create 18,000 jobs during construction with 3,700 jobs during operation, while contributing $38.5 billion to Canada’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP) over 65 years.

“Today’s investment to support the first SMRs in the G7 is a down payment on Ontario’s nuclear energy future,” said Premier Doug Ford. “We’re protecting Ontario by supporting good-paying, long-term jobs for Ontario workers and building the energy infrastructure — including both SMRs and new, large-scale nuclear — needed to make Ontario an energy superpower.”

The province and federal government are making historic investments in this nation-building project, including a $1 billion provincial investment through the Building Ontario Fund and a $2 billion federal investment through the Canada Growth Fund, respectively. Once construction of the four SMRs is complete, they will produce 1,200 megawatts (MW) of electricity, enough to power the equivalent of 1.2 million homes.

“The Darlington New Nuclear Project will create thousands of high-paying careers and power thousands of Ontario homes with clean energy,” said Mark Carney, Prime Minister of Canada. “This is a generational investment that will build lasting security, prosperity and opportunities. We’re building big things to build Canada Strong.”

Construction on the first SMR began in May 2025, with the SMR expected to come online in 2030. Today’s funding will support the construction and operation of the first SMR with an innovative model to allow for additional private sector and Indigenous investment.

“As we navigate tariffs and global volatility, it’s never been more important to create a more competitive, more resilient and self-reliant province that can withstand whatever comes our way,” said Peter Bethlenfalvy, Minister of Finance. “Through the Building Ontario Fund, we are investing in this nation-building project that will secure the clean, reliable energy our growing province needs while creating thousands of good-paying jobs for Ontario workers.”

The first-of-their-kind in the G7, the SMRs that make up the Darlington New Nuclear Project will inject $500 million annually into the Canadian supply chain. The construction, operation and maintenance of the four units will add $38.5 billion to Canada’s GDP over the next 65 years. The government has worked with Ontario Power Generation (OPG) to ensure that 80 per cent of project spending goes to Ontario companies, including steel produced in Ontario, by Ontario steelworkers, and that construction and operations will protect workers and jobs by sustaining an estimated 3,700 highly skilled, good-paying jobs annually.

“With rising instability in the global economy, now is exactly the time to be building big, creating thousands of jobs, and investing in the Canadian nuclear supply chain,” said Stephen Lecce, Minister of Energy and Mines. “Ontario’s leading the largest nuclear expansion on the continent, anchored by the G7’s first SMR being built at Darlington. Our government secured a commitment to keep at least 80 per cent of the SMR construction in Ontario — supporting our workers, technology sector and economy.”

In addition to the Darlington New Nuclear Project and refurbishments at the Darlington and Pickering nuclear generating stations and Bruce Power, Ontario is exploring multiple new nuclear energy generation projects to build for the future. This includes OPG’s Wesleyville site in Port Hope, which could host up to 10,000 MW of reliable, emissions-free power and conducting pre-development work with Bruce Power to site the first large-scale nuclear build in over three decades with up to 4,800 MW of new nuclear generation.

Boston University News Service

In the face of federal attacks on the clean energy movement, players in the Massachusetts solar industry are pushing for state reforms to smooth out bumps in the solar installation process. And one particular barrier is weighing heavy on the minds of installers and advocacy groups alike.

“Permitting is the state’s biggest blocker when it comes to residential installation,” said David Bridge, president of Great Sky Solar, a local installer based in Lexington. “Arlington is easily the best town to operate in in the state. The main problems the state has are problems that Arlington has solved.”

Each of Massachusetts’ 351 municipalities require different permits, installers say. Some claim the decentralized system entangles installers in red tape, exacerbating delays, costs and administrative burdens.

On Thursday, advocates urged Massachusetts lawmakers to pass a slew of clean energy bills directed at expanding and improving the state’s solar sector during a meeting held by the Committee on Telecommunications, Utilities and Energy.

A bill pushing for the statewide introduction of an online permitting software drew support from an array of industry figures advocating for expedited permit applications.

“This legislation would modernize and streamline residential solar permitting,” said Trish Fields, executive director of the Solar Energy Business Association of New England, during her testimony. “It seeks to make solar easier to deploy, more affordable and more equitable across the commonwealth.”

If passed, the bill, an act to facilitate distributed energy resources in the commonwealth, would implement the Smart Residential Solar Permitting Platform, an online software that issues permits instantly for residential solar photovoltaic systems.

As of July, 125 jurisdictions in Massachusetts still required in-person permitting.

Arlington employs an online system which enhances efficiency, said Bridge. Great Sky Solar completes 20 to 30 projects in the town each year.

“Arlington uses permitting portal OpenGov, which is the easiest permitting portal to navigate through,” said Byron Johnson, a project manager at Great Sky Solar. “Other towns use more challenging permitting portals that make it hard to have an open communication with the administrators and inspectors.”

When applying for a permit in Arlington, the average turnaround from submission to issuance is typically a week, said Johnson. In other jurisdictions, it can sometimes take months.

James Manzer, senior solar designer at regional installer ReVision Energy, said streamlining permitting in the commonwealth would reduce non-hardware expenses, which include labor and administrative costs.

“If you want to decrease the costs of solar, lower the soft costs of permitting,” he said.

Advocates asserted that lightening the bureaucratic load lugged by installers will help mitigate the impact of federal actions aimed at dismantling the clean energy industry.

“Federal rollbacks and declining tax incentives threaten local companies’ clean energy jobs and progress toward the state’s climate goals,” said Fields. “That’s why state leadership is essential.”

The passage of the federal One Big Beautiful Bill Act in July cut the lifespan of residential solar tax incentives short, leaving residents across the country scrambling to panel their roofs before the 30 percent tax credit expires on Dec. 31.

Bridge said Great Sky Solar has seen a 250 percent spike in interest since the legislation was passed.

“We’ve seen some concerns increase, with people trying to access the credits before they expire,” said Talia Fox, sustainability manager for the town of Arlington. “It’s something on people’s minds.”

After the credit is slashed, installers expect customer interest to initially wane, before eventually bouncing back.

“The tax credit was nice to have, but it wasn’t necessary to have for the adoption of solar, because unfortunately our electricity costs are so high,” said Bridge.

Eversource, the provider supplying approximately 640,000 Massachusetts residents with energy, has announced customers will face a 13% price increase this winter. The average bill is set to rise by about $41.

An aging grid, influx of power-hungry data centers and increased demand for energy will likely cause electricity costs to continue climbing, according to clean energy advocates.

Installers and activists believe solar, a quickly accessible and readily available energy source, will play a significant role in meeting the skyrocketing demand.

“Renewables are as powerful as they’ve ever been,” said Manzer. “We plan to be here for a long time.”",,N,,2025-10-24 03:18:20.262713

The highest priority for the reforms must be to ensure land clearing is properly regulated.
However, such standards are of limited value if the projects that pose the biggest environmental risk – such as land clearing – are not regulated.","""The Australian Parliament will soon consider proposed reforms to federal environmental laws – known as the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act (EPBC Act). Unfortunately, signals from the Government suggest this may be another reform process that fails to deliver the progress we need despite everyone agreeing that Australia’s biodiversity is in catastrophic decline.

When introduced, the EPBC Act was a historic reform by a conservative Government. For the first time since Federation, the Australian Parliament exercised the full suite of its constitutional powers to regulate environmentally harmful actions on all tenures. Previous Commonwealth environmental laws were restricted to Commonwealth land (<2% of the country), to Commonwealth decisions and to a very limited set of actions in world heritage areas. Even then, the role of the Commonwealth Environment Minister was advisory only – approval decisions were made by the Ministers responsible for the relevant portfolio, such as the Minister for Resources.

The EPBC Act rejected this approach and gave the Commonwealth Environment Minister direct control of actions impacting “matters of national environmental significance” like threatened species. Early litigation highlighted the potential of the Act – for example, a conservation group in north Queensland secured an injunction to prevent lychee farmers using large electric grids to kill spectacled flying-foxes.

Importantly, the Act was established with a framework that could evolve. Notably, the Act allows for regulations to be made to add new “triggers” (which dictate when environmentally harmful activities need approval) and to deem certain classes of actions to be within existing “triggers”.

Sadly, the Act has failed to realise its potential. There are three key reasons for this. Firstly, the Commonwealth bureaucracy has failed to enforce the existing laws. Actions that breach the Act have been taken by proponents without attracting any compliance and enforcement action. This includes land clearing activities that have routinely not been referred for approval despite having significant impacts on threatened species.

Secondly, mechanisms in the Act which could have expanded its scope, or provided certainty about its scope, have not been utilised. Regulations could have been made to deem land clearing over a specified threshold as requiring approval. A climate change trigger could have been added at any time – indeed, back in 2000, a draft climate change trigger was published by the Howard Government but never made.

Thirdly, the exemption for native forest harvesting should have been phased out. Instead, it has been extended.

The current reform process appears not to be addressing any of these issues. Unless a reset occurs, the reforms will not (and cannot) deliver substantive additional environment protection.

The highest priority for the reforms must be to ensure land clearing is properly regulated. Since the Act commenced in 2000, over 11.5 million hectares of native forest has been cleared, including over 3 million hectares of remnant (intact) native vegetation. Amendments should prohibit the clearing of remnant vegetation, subject only to a very limited exception where Parliament decides a project is essential to address a compelling need and there is a robust offset. All clearing of mature regrowth (e.g. previously cleared vegetation that has regenerated and not been disturbed for 15-25 years) should require approval if it exceeds a specified area threshold.

We suggest 3 simple KPIs for the reform process. Within 12 months, clearing of remnant vegetation should be near zero and there should be an initial 50% reduction in mature regrowth clearing. Secondly, the native forestry exemption should be removed. Thirdly, all projects likely to directly or indirectly result in 50,000 tonnes or more of greenhouse gas emissions per year - on average or at their peak – should trigger the Act and all emissions from these projects should be subject to a carbon price that aligns with the aims of the Paris Agreement. (If the Howard Government could propose a climate trigger in 2000, it can hardly be described as radical in 2025).

Unfortunately, it appears the reform process will not address these substantive issues. Instead, it has focused on the introduction of “national standards” and an EPA. Standards will be important in limiting the broad discretion that currently exists when approval decisions are made. However, such standards are of limited value if the projects that pose the biggest environmental risk – such as land clearing – are not regulated.

While there is value in a properly constituted EPA, this is also not the main game. Failure to address the scope of the Act means the EPA will be a mere observer as land clearing continues unabated, native forests are logged and our biodiversity continues to decline.

We urge real reform that provides substantive additional protection – expanding the scope of the Act, as well as introducing standards and an independent EPA. Real reform means, in 5 years’ time, we can celebrate measurable improvements rather than read another report on how the Act has failed to play its role in reversing the decline in Australia’s environment.""",,N,,2025-10-24 03:18:42.997835

The letter condemns the administration’s politically motivated freeze on $32 billion in critical infrastructure projects in Democratic-led states and cities, and demands the immediate release of funds that rightfully belong to the American people.
Joining her in this letter was the Ohio Democratic House Delegation, Reps. Shontel Brown (OH-11), Marcy Kaptur (OH-09), Greg Landsman (OH-01), and Emilia Sykes (OH-13).
On the freeze of $32 billion in critical infrastructure projects “These projects are not designed to benefit one party, but to improve our nation’s infrastructure, boost economic growth, and enhance quality of life for all Americans – regardless of political affiliation,” said Members in the letter.
“Freezing these projects will only result in unnecessary delays, more congestion, and substantial job losses.","WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, U.S. Congresswoman Beatty – in a double-duty effort to condemn the Trump Administration’s abuse of power during the federal government shutdown – led two letters to Trump Cabinet officials demanding the release of critical infrastructure funding and the reversal of unlawful federal employee firings, for the American people.

Joined by 25 Members of Congress, Beatty sent a letter to U.S. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy and Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Director Russell Vought. The letter condemns the administration’s politically motivated freeze on $32 billion in critical infrastructure projects in Democratic-led states and cities, and demands the immediate release of funds that rightfully belong to the American people.

In a second letter to United States Secretary of the Treasury Scott Bessent and OMB Director Vought, Beatty — Ranking Member of a House Financial Services Subcommittee and a longtime advocate for equitable access to financial services — denounced the Trump Administration’s decision to terminate all employees at the Community Development Financial Institutions (CDFI) Fund, urging the reversal of those firings and calling for the Fund to continue its mission of expanding economic opportunity in underserved communities. Joining her in this letter was the Ohio Democratic House Delegation, Reps. Shontel Brown (OH-11), Marcy Kaptur (OH-09), Greg Landsman (OH-01), and Emilia Sykes (OH-13).

On the freeze of $32 billion in critical infrastructure projects

“These projects are not designed to benefit one party, but to improve our nation’s infrastructure, boost economic growth, and enhance quality of life for all Americans – regardless of political affiliation,” said Members in the letter. “Freezing these projects will only result in unnecessary delays, more congestion, and substantial job losses. President Trump and Director Vought think that these abuses are demonstrations of strength, but they only hurt Americans – many of whom voted for them – and hardens opposition to their lawless administration.”

On the attempted firings of employees of the CDFI Fund and abrupt shuttering of the Fund

“Despite the Fund’s historic bipartisan support and proven effectiveness, President Trump has made several attempts to undermine the Fund and is now using the government shutdown as cover to unlawfully fire all Fund staff, rendering it unable to fulfill its statutory obligations,” said Members in the letter. “…Abruptly shuttering the Fund threatens to undo all the gains achieved by the program in recent years and will only serve to limit access to affordable credit, small business loans, and mortgages for rural families, low-income households, and first-time homebuyers.”

Of that total, Republican voting districts have suffered the greatest losses, shedding $12.4 billion in investment and losing approximately 15,000 jobs.
The cancellations mark a reversal from an unprecedented run of clean energy investment since the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) of 2022.
“The loss of these projects isn’t just a setback for clean energy – it’s a setback for America’s workers and competitiveness,” said Michael Timberlake, communications director, E2.

The US clean energy economy continues to contract under the second Trump administration as a series of executive actions and Congress’ One Big Beautiful Bill crack down harshly on solar and wind industrial policy.

The latest data from E2’s Clean Economy Tracker shows that in September alone, nearly 3,000 jobs were lost and $1.6 billion in projects were cancelled, factories closed, or investment commitments downsized.

Through September, the United States have hemorrhaged more than $24 billion in announced investments and lost nearly 21,000 jobs. Of that total, Republican voting districts have suffered the greatest losses, shedding $12.4 billion in investment and losing approximately 15,000 jobs.

The latest wave of private-sector cancellations includes the cancellation of grid-scale battery storage and EV manufacturing facilities in Kansas, Michigan, North Carolina and Tennessee, said E2.

Along with the private sector cancelations, federal funding is being yanked in staggering amounts. In October, the US Department of Energy announced the termination of 321 financial awards supporting 223 energy projects, resulting in “savings of approximately $7.56 billion dollars for American taxpayers,” said the agency in a press release. The cancellations were exclusively in historically Democrat-led states.

The cancellations mark a reversal from an unprecedented run of clean energy investment since the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) of 2022. Since the nation’s largest-ever climate and energy spending package was passed, nearly $135 billion in private investment has been announced.

For the solar industry, over $18 billion in investment announcements were made since the IRA’s passage, leading to an expected 32,803 jobs. Of that total, $2.8 billion of private investment has been cancelled, leading to the loss of 2,381 jobs.

“The loss of these projects isn’t just a setback for clean energy – it’s a setback for America’s workers and competitiveness,” said Michael Timberlake, communications director, E2. “For every cancelled factory or downsized plant, behind the scenes many more projects are not being announced at all as more capital flees and businesses look overseas to invest instead. That means fewer paychecks, less local investment, and fewer opportunities for U.S. workers to lead in the industries of the future.”

Despite the widespread cancellations, new investments were also made. Businesses in September announced more $542 million in investments for new electric vehicle and solar parts manufacturing facilities, and critical grid infrastructure needed to support AI data center expansion, said the report. The projects are expected to create about 985 new permanent jobs, said E2.

""The national average at a moment's notice earlier this week fell below $3 a gallon,"" said Patrick De Haan, Head of Petroleum Analysis at GasBuddy.

That dip below $3 was a four-year low, but the price of gas has ticked up since then, averaging $3.07 per gallon as of midday Thursday.

Meanwhile, for many Americans, money saved at the pump is going toward other rising energy bills.

At a recent rally against rising energy costs, Vick Petersen told Scripps News Group Phoenix that his electric bill has gone up about $150 per month compared to last year.

""My bill runs about close to $600 per month,"" Petersen said.

One factor in that is the growth of artificial intelligence, says De Haan.

""Because of the advent of AI, natural gas has continued to see kind of upward pressure, electricity prices have seen upward pressure, because of the insatiable demand now for energy for AI. And a lot of that was electricity,"" De Haan said.

De Haan notes that natural gas that heats your home is different from gasoline that fuels your car, so the price of each can move in different directions.

Inc., Japan’s largest power generation company and one of the world’s leading LNG buyers, is expanding its North American presence with a major upstream acquisition in the Haynesville Shale.
The $1.5 billion transaction marks a significant step in JERA’s long-term strategy to build a diversified and resilient global energy portfolio.
“The U.S. energy sector is leading the way in the global LNG market and JERA’s investments have lined up accordingly,” said John O’Brien, chief executive officer of JERA Americas.
“The Haynesville acquisition substantially expands our partnerships in the United States,” Tsugaru said.
“The benefits are clear: enhanced diversification for JERA’s LNG value chain, expanded global reach, and overall risk mitigation in a volatile energy market.","JERA Co. Inc., Japan’s largest power generation company and one of the world’s leading LNG buyers, is expanding its North American presence with a major upstream acquisition in the Haynesville Shale. Through its U.S. subsidiary, JERA Americas Inc., the company has reached an agreement with Williams and GEP Haynesville II, LLC to acquire 100% of their respective interests in the South Mansfield upstream asset in western Louisiana.

The $1.5 billion transaction marks a significant step in JERA’s long-term strategy to build a diversified and resilient global energy portfolio. The Haynesville asset currently produces more than 500 million cubic feet per day (MMscfd) of natural gas and includes about 200 undeveloped drilling locations. JERA plans to increase total production to approximately 1 billion cubic feet per day (Bscfd) under a future investment program.

The South Mansfield property offers both scale and strategic value, featuring proven reserves, existing gathering and treating infrastructure, and proximity to the Gulf Coast’s LNG export and data center corridors. The location will allow JERA to strengthen its U.S. gas production base and support growing LNG export volumes from the region.

“The U.S. energy sector is leading the way in the global LNG market and JERA’s investments have lined up accordingly,” said John O’Brien, chief executive officer of JERA Americas. “The upstream Haynesville acquisition is a strategic addition to our asset portfolio, enabling us to advance our unique supply chain expertise while deepening our commitment to America’s energy future.”

Ryosuke Tsugaru, JERA’s chief low carbon fuel officer, said the deal enhances both the company’s diversification and its integration across the gas value chain. “The Haynesville acquisition substantially expands our partnerships in the United States,” Tsugaru said. “The benefits are clear: enhanced diversification for JERA’s LNG value chain, expanded global reach, and overall risk mitigation in a volatile energy market. The project clearly aligns with our strategic priorities and reinforces our mission to provide a stable and secure energy supply globally.”

The acquisition builds on JERA’s rapidly growing U.S. portfolio, which includes ownership stakes in 10 power generation assets and the recently announced Blue Point low-carbon ammonia development project. Earlier this year, JERA also signed one of the largest LNG offtake agreements ever executed by a single buyer in the U.S.—5.5 million tonnes per year for 20 years—further cementing its role as a key participant in the global LNG market.

The Haynesville transaction remains subject to customary closing conditions and regulatory approvals.

Headquartered in Tokyo, JERA produces roughly one-third of Japan’s electricity and operates across the entire LNG value chain—from upstream participation and fuel procurement to transport and power generation. Established in 2015, the company has pledged to achieve net-zero CO₂ emissions across its domestic and international operations by 2050.",https://www.compressortech2.com/Images/1260x628/index-20251023-180717-JERA-acquisition.png,N,,2025-10-23 21:03:16.013811

Biogas is energy captured from organic materials like manure, food waste, and wastewater solids as they break down. It can be used to power and heat homes, fuel vehicles, and generate electricity. In addition, the process creates a nutrient-rich organic fertilizer that offers a sustainable alternative to synthetic soil additives.

Addressing the conference today through pre-recorded remarks, U.S. Senator Pete Ricketts (R-Nebraska) highlighted biogas’ potential to both recycle waste streams into 24/7 renewable energy and nutrient-rich organic fertilizer, turning environmental challenges into valuable resources for farms, communities, and the broader economy.

“Family farms, ranches and agri-businesses are the backbone of communities across Nebraska and America,” Senator Ricketts said. “Expanding the use of biofuels like RNG strengthens American energy independence, supports Nebraska agriculture, and reduces our impact on the environment. Biofuels are a win-win-win for consumers, the environment, and farmers and ranchers.”

In addition to remarks from Sen. Ricketts, BUSINESS OF BIOGAS provided information on emerging market opportunities, cutting-edge technologies, and strategies to accelerate growth across the sector. From in-depth sessions to curated networking events and receptions, the ABC designed every element of the conference to bring industry leaders together to share expertise, spark innovation, and accelerate the growth of the biogas sector.

ABC Executive Director Patrick Serfass said BUSINESS OF BIOGAS reflected the growing recognition of biogas’ environmental and economic benefits and the industry’s collaborative spirit.

“This year’s record-breaking turnout shows just how far the U.S. biogas industry has come – and how much opportunity lies ahead,” said Serfass. “As more organizations realize the power of biogas to turn waste into renewable energy and organic fertilizer, we’re seeing unprecedented sharing and innovation. The excitement here in St. Louis has been tangible, and it’s a clear signal that the American biogas industry stands ready to provide both fuel and electricity to help meet increasing domestic needs and help global companies decarbonize their operations.”

BUSINESS OF BIOGAS continues to serve as the leading executive conference for companies driving growth across the biogas value chain, from agriculture and wastewater to food waste recycling and renewable natural gas production.

(Reuters) - is laying off 4.5% of its workforce, or over 600 employees, an internal email showed on Thursday, as the electric-vehicle maker contends with weakening demand following the expiry of key U.S. tax credits.

The expiration last month of a $7,500 U.S. federal tax credit for purchases and leases of new EVs has largely boosted prices and is expected to hit sales through the rest of the year for automakers such as Rivian already grappling with mounting cost pressures.

""These are not changes that were made lightly,"" Chief Executive Officer RJ Scaringe said in an email to staff. ""With the changing operating backdrop, we had to rethink how we are scaling our go-to-market functions.""

The layoffs are part of a consolidation of various operations into Rivian’s service, sales and marketing units, Scaringe said. He added the company also planned to hire a chief marketing officer.

Rivian shares closed 1.3% higher on Thursday.

Rivian has struggled to achieve consistent profitability due to costs related to ramping up production, President Donald Trump’s tariffs on imported parts and intense competition from and traditional automakers.

High tariffs on imported auto parts have driven up manufacturing costs and forced EV makers to revamp supply chains, curb reliance on foreign components and boost U.S. investment in line with administration policy.

Analysts expect Rivian’s quarterly revenue to surge 71.5% and loss to narrow, when it reports third-quarter results after markets close on November 4.

This month, the company lowered the midpoint of its annual deliveries forecast, despite reporting a nearly 32% jump in the third quarter, largely driven by a last-minute rush to grab the now-expired federal incentive.

Rivian is focusing on improving manufacturing efficiency and streamlining operations at its Normal, Illinois plant to align costs with the weaker near-term demand outlook, while preparing for its next-generation R2 models, which are expected to broaden its reach beyond the luxury segment.

Typically, a woman in rural India takes on the bulk of domestic work.
Cool roof technologies are another boon to health that the initiative brings to rural India, where heat waves have been known to strike with temperatures as high as 122 degrees Fahrenheit.
And even more collaborations—with the government, local organizations, banks, and vendors—will be necessary to fully integrate green technology in rural India.
And for rural women, this goes far beyond lower energy bills.","At 1.4 billion people, India has the world’s largest population, and it’s the third-biggest greenhouse gas emitter, following China and the United States. Its residents have long grappled with heavy air pollution, tied to the country’s coal-burning power plants, but now they are also bracing for rising energy demand. With that demand expected to grow 35 percent over the next decade, India knows its future prosperity relies on a transition to clean, reliable energy.

To that end, India has set ambitious climate targets, pledging in the 2015 Paris Agreement that non–fossil fuel power sources would make up half of the installed electricity capacity by 2030—a goal it reached this summer, five years ahead of schedule. In 2022, Prime Minister Narendra Modi also announced a goal to achieve net zero emissions by 2070. Since then, India has ramped up decarbonization efforts, such as passing a solar rooftop policy, promoting a transition to electric vehicles, and investing in green hydrogen development.

But a big challenge remains: bringing up-to-date renewable technology to the most rural parts of this large country. This is tech that helps irrigate crops, prevents pests from eating away at farm yields, and helps keep families cool during life-threatening heat waves.

“Nearly 60 percent of India’s population lives in rural areas, and access to clean energy in the villages is very, very limited,” says Lata. “We keep talking about the clean energy transition, but how can that transition be just and equitable if we’re not addressing such a large portion of the country?”

While the pollution that any one household emits is minimal, taken together—home after home, village after village, state after state across India—the collective climate emissions cuts would be enormous.

Typically, a woman in rural India takes on the bulk of domestic work. She gathers fuel and cooks. She raises livestock and grows crops to be eaten by her family or sold at market. She may care for children as well as older relatives.

And she usually performs this work with limited access to education, health care, land ownership, or financial credit. And as the climate crisis propels more extreme weather—droughts, heat waves, flooding—clean water may be harder to come by, her harvests may falter, and her income may decline. At times, her house may become too hot or her roof may leak. She will essentially be stuck in a loop of worsening conditions, in the fields and at home.

“Even though much of the household-related tasks are traditionally performed by women, oftentimes they have little say in choices in the home,” Lata says. The Green Village initiative seeks to change that. “It only made sense to consult with the people who were bearing the brunt of the labor and impacts,” she continues.

Take the use of traditional cookstoves, called chulhas, which typically burn biomass, like firewood or dung cakes, and emit hazardous pollutants, including carbon monoxide, methane, and particulate matter. Over the long-term, breathing in those fumes, especially in poorly ventilated homes, can lead to heart and lung disease and premature death.

Indeed, the World Health Organization estimates that indoor air pollution kills about 3.2 million people each year. Women face the gravest risks, since they tend to do most of the cooking, as do small children, who often stay inside the home alongside their mothers.

Switching to biogas for cooking significantly improves air quality in the home while simultaneously avoiding a near constant search for firewood, which is a strain on the women and local forests alike.

Cool roof technologies are another boon to health that the initiative brings to rural India, where heat waves have been known to strike with temperatures as high as 122 degrees Fahrenheit. Cool roofs help bring relief by not only reflecting sunlight and improving a home’s energy efficiency but also preventing leaks and water damage.

On top of their labor inside the home, women play a huge role in India’s agriculture sector, with 73 percent of the rural female workforce engaging in this work in some capacity. These include women like Bharti ben Vishnu Vaghela, who lives with her parents and six siblings in Mehlao village in Gujarat. Bharti ben’s family income relies on farmwork—irrigating fields, tilling the soil, and guarding the crops from pests. Carrying out these duties manually takes a lot of time and physical energy.

Enter the Green Village initiative, which introduces various solar technologies to farmers. Solar-powered electric fences, for instance, help prevent damage to crops caused by wildlife—anything from monkeys to cattle to elephants.

And Bharti ben now saves 90 hours a month on irrigation, thanks to a new solar precision irrigation system that improved her crop yields, cut down on water usage, and bypassed the need to till the soil before planting. And her new solar trap light reduces the use of toxic pesticides, to the benefit of the crops, the environment, and the health of her family. Meanwhile, inside the Vaghela home, portable solar lanterns have brought more consistent lighting during power outages and the ability to see potential hazards, such as snakes, at night.

Anticipating a potential glitch with introducing all this new equipment to areas where there’s little access to technological support, the initiative trains women to do simple maintenance and repairs themselves. Armed with the expertise to manage these energy systems, these women become in charge of their own work.

In the Green Village initiative’s early days, Lata recalls the staff spending a lot of effort explaining to villagers why these upgrades are necessary. “Climate change is not their priority. Deploying clean energy interventions is not their priority. Carbon emissions are not their priority,” she explains. “Their priority is making a decent livelihood and getting three meals on the table every day.”

Villagers pay for the equipment themselves. And because they have limited savings, they need to see that these investments will pay off. So, earning trust and demonstrating how these technologies could enhance women’s lives and incomes have been paramount to the initiative's success. Still, finding the right financing plan can be a hurdle.

That’s why NRDC India, a subsidiary of NRDC, works to ensure federal subsidies are available to rural households and then figures out how villagers can best take advantage of them. SEWA staffers help villagers apply for the subsidies and acquire micro-payment loans. These small-dollar loans are available for people who can’t otherwise qualify for traditional lending and, because the amounts are low, offer more affordable interest rates and loan terms.

On the national front, a government policy that decentralizes renewable power development would also be helpful. This would decrease overall dependency on unreliable transmission grids while improving energy access for more remote areas. Promoting local energy development could also boost village economies, create jobs, and lower energy costs.

Meanwhile, negotiations for bulk pricing on clean tech are also underway. “The more demand there is, the more bargaining power we have with companies,” says Lata. “And since we work with so many villages, there is a very good chance for us to reduce the prices.”

In its partnership with Energy Efficiency Services Limited, for example, the Green Village initiative was able to offer households a discounted appliance bundle that included LED bulbs, a fan, and a solar lantern.

And even more collaborations—with the government, local organizations, banks, and vendors—will be necessary to fully integrate green technology in rural India. After all, every aspect of village life must be considered: occupations, transportation, education, health, and living expenses. And for rural women, this goes far beyond lower energy bills. It’s about breaking through cultural and gender barriers and finally having a say in their own homes. “So there is still much more to be done,” says Lata.",https://www.nrdc.org/sites/default/files/styles/social_sharing_1200x630/public/2025-10/biogas-cooking-element-gujurat-india-12a.jpg?h=6113bb77&itok=GmPF_fxP,N,,2025-10-23 20:18:08.217038

About 4 in 10 U.S. adults say they are “extremely” or “very” concerned about the environmental impacts of AI.","WASHINGTON (AP) — As the United States rapidly builds massive data centers for the development of artificial intelligence, many Americans are concerned about the environmental impact.

Worries about how AI will affect the environment surpass concerns about other industries that worsen climate change, according to a new poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research and the Energy Policy Institute at the University of Chicago.

The results of the poll, conducted in September, suggest that as AI reshapes work, communication and culture, it’s also sparking anxieties about how the growing energy demands could further harm the environment.

It takes massive amounts of electricity to power AI. Electricity consumption from data centers is set to more than double globally by 2030, according to the International Energy Agency. The United States accounts for by far the largest share of the projected increase, followed by China. In many places, the electricity for data centers will come from power plants that burn coal, oil and natural gas. Burning these fossil fuels for electricity emits carbon dioxide, trapping heat in the atmosphere and warming the planet.

The energy needs are so large that major technology companies are investing in next-generation nuclear technology, which can produce electricity without emissions, and quietly scaling back their own goals to cut carbon pollution.

Aidan Collins, a 26-year-old Democrat in New York, said in his view, AI uses an “absurd amount” of energy.

“Using all this energy and contributing to climate change in a bad way, it all just seems very awful to me,” he said.

More worries about AI’s environmental impact than meat and aviation

President Donald Trump unveiled a plan this summer for America’s “global dominance” in artificial intelligence, which included cutting back environmental regulations to speed up the construction of AI supercomputers. The U.S. Department of Energy has identified federal sites where tech companies could build data centers to power AI. Trump, a Republican, has made sweeping strides to prioritize fossil fuels for electricity generation and hinder renewable energy projects.

About 4 in 10 U.S. adults say they are “extremely” or “very” concerned about the environmental impacts of AI. That’s higher than the share of Americans who are highly concerned about the environmental impact of the cryptocurrency, meat production and air travel industries, all of which contribute to climate change and cause environmental harm. Bitcoin mining uses enormous amounts of electricity. Livestock produce methane, a powerful greenhouse gas. And when airplanes burn jet fuel, it releases carbon dioxide.

Like Collins, several Americans said in follow-up interviews that they are worried about the energy and water required to power AI. Data centers need a tremendous amount of water to keep cool. Some communities strongly oppose data centers because they demand so much energy and water.

Aaron Gunnoe, a 29-year-old independent in Ohio, said he’s very concerned about the increasing electricity demand, when much of it is supplied by fossil fuels.

“They haven’t done anything in the way of offsetting it cleanly,” he said. “They just keep building more and more.”

Democrats are more likely than Republicans to be highly worried

Democrats are particularly likely to be concerned about the environmental impacts of AI.

“I feel like it’s going to be a greater and greater burden,” said Amy Fennewald, a 61-year-old Democrat in Minnesota.

But while about half of Democrats are “extremely” or “very” concerned, so are about one-third of independents and Republicans. Raymond Suarez, a 60-year-old living in Florida, considers himself a “strong” Republican. He fears data centers will be built on land that should be preserved or used for other things, such as farming, and he worries AI is becoming too pervasive.

“For them to uptick it and for them to think it’s a great thing, no, it’s not,” he said.

On the other hand, James Horner said he’s not at all concerned about the environmental impacts. The 52-year-old Republican living in South Carolina said he thinks artificial intelligence will be the solution to its own energy problem — it will show how clean energy can be built in an efficient, profitable way, and clean energy will be used to power AI.

“It’s going to help everybody,” he said. “I think it’s going to be able to figure out these processes happening in our body that scientists, as smart as they are, haven’t figured out yet. With supercomputers taking all that data, I think it will help everything, health care, the environment. If it’s used correctly, it will do good.”

The expected legacy of AI is more negative than positive

Americans are more likely to think that over the next decade, artificial intelligence will do more to hurt than help the environment, the economy and society as a whole.

Doug Bowen, a 79-year-old moderate Republican living in Kansas, said he thinks artificial intelligence will do more to hurt. The demand on the planet’s resources will be greater as AI and the number of companies involved in the field grow, he said.

Americans are divided on whether AI will do more to help or hurt them personally. About one-quarter say AI will do more to help them, and about the same share say it will do more to hurt them. About half say that it won’t make a difference in their lives or that they are unsure.

Amanda Hernandez, a 24-year-old Democrat in California, said she grew concerned after watching TikTok videos about the immense energy and water demands. Hernandez said she thinks she will be personally hurt by AI because she works as a cashier at a fast food restaurant.

“I’m more concerned, as AI continues to grow and advance, that we’re just not going to need any cashiers or customer service people altogether,” she said.

Fennewald, in Minnesota, said she doesn’t know whether she will be personally helped or hurt by AI in the future.

“I think it’s a black box. I don’t know how we can know,” she said. “We really have no idea what’s ahead.”

McDermott reported from Providence, R.I.

The AP-NORC poll of 3,154 adults was conducted Sept. 2-18, 2025, using a combined sample of interviews from NORC’s probability-based AmeriSpeak Panel, which is designed to be representative of the U.S. population, and interviews from opt-in online panels. The margin of sampling error for all respondents is plus or minus 2.4 percentage points. The AmeriSpeak panel is recruited randomly using address-based sampling methods, and respondents later were interviewed online or by phone.

The industrial sector is also a significant source of climate pollution, comprising 13% of Michigan’s total emissions. To meet the climate and health targets mandated by the Michigan Healthy Climate Plan while maintaining the state’s manufacturing might, policymakers must work to reduce emissions from its industrial sector in a way that allows businesses to stay regionally and globally competitive.

Many of Michigan’s industrial emissions come from burning natural gas in low and medium temperature ranges for which low-emissions technologies like industrial heat pumps, electric boilers, and thermal energy storage have already proven viable. The actions contained in this report can help Michigan policymakers ease the transition to clean manufacturing and production methods as these next-generation technologies continue down the cost curve and continue to improve in performance.

In this roadmap, we focus on solutions that are technologically and commercially ready and fall into three main categories: energy efficiency, electrification, and geothermal heat. Despite the technological maturity of many of these technologies, nearly every facility in Michigan remains reliant on natural gas to fuel its operations. Where facilities consider adopting lower-emissions equipment, a series of informational interviews (explored more deeply in the report) surfaced barriers, including technology integration, equipment financing, and system-level capabilities.

For over a decade, Louisiana has engaged in a dangerous experiment: privatizing government enforcement by handing sovereign powers over to outside trial attorneys operating under fee-shifting arrangements. The result is sprawling litigation backed by state and local governments targeting hundreds of energy producers.

The suits allege that Louisiana’s coastal erosion issues stem from energy production dating back to the 1940s, much of which was conducted under federal permits, contracts or wartime directives in support of America’s World War II efforts.

Defendants have sought to remove these cases to federal court under the federal officer removal statute, but a growing split among federal circuit courts has led to a high-stakes game of ping-pong with the coastal suits bouncing back and forth between state and federal courts for years. The Supreme Court’s intervention is essential to resolve the Circuit split and ensure that federal contractors, especially those acting under wartime directives, are shielded from state court bias.

After a $745 million jury verdict earlier this year, over 40 similar suits threaten billions in additional costs.

A 2019 Pelican Institute economic impact report estimated that Louisiana’s economy has lost between $44 million and $113 million annually since these suits began. More than 2,000 jobs disappeared in just the first two years of litigation, and it’s estimated state and local governments have forfeited up to $22.6 million annually in royalty revenue—money that could have funded schools, roads and coastal restoration.

The structural problems underlying these lawsuits are even more concerning than the economics.

Through a “joint prosecution agreement” with trial lawyers representing the parishes in these suits, Louisiana’s government agreed not to endorse any substantive defenses, regardless of merit. In other words, the state outsourced its investigative and prosecutorial powers to private attorneys who stand to collect hundreds of millions in fees.

As Louisiana’s former Department of Natural Resources secretary admitted under oath, the state abandoned its administrative enforcement process entirely and began “farming out” the government’s responsibility to a small group of politically active private litigators.

This arrangement violates basic constitutional principles.

When private lawyers are empowered to assert legal claims on behalf of the government while simultaneously funding the political campaigns of the elected judges who decide them, the appearance of impartial justice is compromised. According to state campaign finance reports, the outside counsel spearheading these lawsuits collectively contributed over $2.5 million to help elect Louisiana judges and justices since 2012. This is exactly what the federal officer removal statute was designed to prevent: local tribunals sitting in judgment of private parties acting on behalf of the federal government, especially where those tribunals have a direct financial incentive to rule against those parties.

The Trump administration agrees. In an amicus brief to the Supreme Court, U.S. Solicitor General John Sauer affirmed that the case belongs in federal court.

“[H]ere, removal is appropriately tied to the kinds of connections that risk state-court interference with federal operations,” Sauer wrote. “During World War II, the oil industry operated as a unique public–private partnership with a special wartime agency, the Petroleum Administration for War, overseeing the industry’s operations in service of the Nation’s shared wartime mission.

That special relationship supports the removal of these suits challenging wartime production practices.”

Unfortunately, this flawed approach is not unique to Louisiana. In Suncor v. Boulder County, the Pelican Institute joined with the Manhattan Institute and others to argue that Boulder’s attempt to apply Colorado’s state tort law to regulate global greenhouse gas emissions violates constitutional principles of horizontal federalism.

Allowing such suits to continue would empower one state to dictate energy policy for the entire nation. The Constitution wisely grants this authority to Congress, not state and local governments.

If the Court allows this litigation model to stand, it signals to every state that they can circumvent democratic processes, federal authority and constitutional limits by hiring outside lawyers to craft new and novel legal claims.

Today, it’s energy companies facing retroactive liability for federally authorized activities. Tomorrow, it could be any industry that falls out of political favor or popular opinion.

The founders designed our constitutional system to prevent local bias against interstate commerce, concentrated prosecutorial power in private hands and the use of courts to accomplish what legislatures cannot.

America’s prosperity has always depended on the rule of law, not the rule of lawyers. The Supreme Court should reverse both decisions decisively, sending a clear message that our constitutional system will not tolerate the transformation of justice into a business model. Our economy, national security and energy future depend on it.

Plastic pellets—also known as nurdles—are the raw material used to make everyday plastic products, from bags to bottles. Each year, an estimated ten trillion pellets are spilled or dumped into the world’s oceans, making them the second-largest source of marine microplastics. Along the Texas coast, volunteers have collected hundreds of thousands of these pellets littering beaches and marshes. Once they reach waterways, nurdles are nearly impossible to remove and can persist for centuries. Marine animals such as fish and sea turtles often mistake them for food, leading to starvation and death with bellies full of plastic. The problem first attracted public attention when a Texas shrimper and fisherwoman, Diane Wilson, documented major pollution of Matagorda Bay.

Environment Texas and other conservation groups are calling on Governor Abbott and state regulators to halt these discharges, citing the harm to wildlife, ecosystems, and growing concerns about links between microplastic exposure and human health. Companies that spill or dump these pollutants should be held accountable—just as everyday Texans are fined for littering.

On October 20, a coalition of coastal organizations representing recreational fishermen, oyster harvesters, and tourism advocates sent a letter to Governor Abbott urging decisive state action against microplastic pollution. The letter highlights that Texas’s beaches are not only cultural and recreational treasures but also vital economic engines—supporting tourism, fishing, and local businesses. The groups warn that pre-production plastic pellets are accumulating on beaches, threatening marine wildlife, seafood safety, and the livelihoods that depend on a healthy shoreline.

Public concern over microplastics is growing across the political spectrum. In July, Austin-based entrepreneur Joe Gebbia, co-founder of Airbnb and an advisor to President Trump, wrote an op-ed in the Washington Times calling for national action on microplastics. Earlier this year, Galveston oil executive J.P. Bryan published a Dallas Morning News column urging protection of sea turtles and coastal ecosystems from plastic waste.

The Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ) is now updating the state’s Surface Water Quality Standards—offering a key opportunity to set limits on plastic pellet pollution. TCEQ staff proposed such standards in 2022 but withdrew them under petrochemical industry pressure. Today, with stronger science and broader public support, the case for action has never been clearer.

Meyer, the SELC attorney, asked the appellate court judges to send the environmental justice grant case back to the district court.","The U.S. Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals in Richmond, Virginia, heard arguments Thursday on whether the Trump administration’s cancellation of billions of dollars in environmental and climate grants earlier this year violated the Constitution or was merely a contract dispute.

Kym Meyer, litigation director and senior attorney for the Southern Environmental Law Center, told the three-judge panel that in singling out these grantees for cancellation, the Trump administration violated the Constitution. She likened it to “eliminating this grant because you’re Catholic or Black.”

The administration also allegedly did not follow correct procedures when it summarily canceled the grants on a single day, the plaintiffs argued.

“This is not contractual,” Meyer said.

Attorneys for the Trump administration argued the case should be heard in the Court of Federal Claims, a specialized court that hears contract and monetary disputes with the U.S. government. Unlike the Fourth Circuit, the Federal Claims Court is shut down because of the congressional budget impasse. When it resumes, there will likely be a significant case backlog.

The Claims Court also has limited authority; it can only rule on what damages are owed, not on larger legal questions like whether the Trump administration acted unconstitutionally.

The SELC and the Public Rights Project are representing 13 nonprofits and six cities that received money under the Inflation Reduction Act and the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, which were approved and funded by Congress.

Shortly after taking office, President Donald Trump issued several executive orders directing agencies to evaluate programs and funding to determine whether they aligned with the administration’s priorities. This included the elimination of diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) initiatives.

As a result, many federal departments, including the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, canceled hundreds of grants. Many funded environmental justice programs, which would have helped communities of color and other low-income neighborhoods disproportionately harmed by high levels of pollution or other environmental ills.

The plaintiffs sued the Trump administration in March, alleging its freeze of congressionally mandated programs and their respective funding was “unlawful and arbitrary.” They said the administration’s actions violated “multiple statutory provisions, as well as fundamental constitutional and administrative safeguards.”

This included the separation of powers because, the plaintiffs argued, the executive branch was meddling with congressional appropriations.

“The grantees spent years applying for grants, started the work and then the executive branch came in and said, ‘We’re canceling what Congress told us to do,’” Meyer told the court.

CleanAIRE NC, based in Charlotte, is among the plaintiffs. The nonprofit received a $500,000 Environmental Justice Problem Solving grant in June 2024 from the EPA to monitor the air in four underserved communities in northern Mecklenburg County.

The grant would have also allowed CleanAIRE NC to train community health workers to track air quality and to conduct a health impact assessment with several local health departments and North Carolina State University.

The Trump administration appealed to the Fourth Circuit for a stay. In June, in a 2-1 decision, it granted the government’s request and put a hold on the district court’s ruling.

At Thursday’s hearing, Appellate Judge Paul Niemeyer, an appointee of President George H.W. Bush, seemed skeptical of the plaintiffs’ argument. “It cannot be that every time an executive branch official exercises power beyond their authority, that they have also violated the Constitution,” he said.

Since the stay in June, the legal landscape has become more complicated. In a 5-4 emergency decision, the U.S. Supreme Court in August sided with the administration in NIH v. American Public Health Association, which raised similar issues.

The Supreme Court allowed the National Institutes of Health to cancel $800 million in grants for research on health equity, ruling that the dispute is under the purview not of federal district court, but of the Court of Federal Claims.

However, Justice Amy Coney Barrett broke from the other conservative justices on the issue of whether the government’s guidance that informed the cancellations could be challenged in traditional federal courts. As a result, a majority of the Supreme Court left a narrow window of opportunity for grantees to challenge the reasoning behind the Trump administration’s termination of grant programs.

Meyer, the SELC attorney, asked the appellate court judges to send the environmental justice grant case back to the district court. There, a judge could use the precedent of the NIH case to rule more broadly on the administration’s justification for cancelling entire programs, instead of on the issue of whether money is owed to individual grantees.",https://insideclimatenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/GettyImages-2194985045-1024x683.jpg,N,,2025-10-23 19:04:46.840459

The companies on October 22 said Heimdall is installing 75 advanced monitoring devices, known as “Neurons,” on about 100 miles of electricity transmission lines across five counties in western Washington.

The companies said the sensors provide real-time data about conditions on the transmission line, which enables PSE to optimize power grid capacity. The equipment also helps the utility better manage power delivery to its 1.2-million electricity customers.

Heimdall Power is part of POWER’s Experience POWER event in Denver, set for Oct. 29-31 at the Hyatt Regency Convention Center hotel. Heimdall, along with Great River Energy, is part of a panel discussing “How DLR Deployment Unlocked Nearly 50% More Transmission Capacity.” Register today to attend Experience POWER and learn how Great River Energy deployed a DLR system using Heimdall sensors to improve transmission line capacity.

“Highly reliable energy is the number one must-have for our customers,” said Michelle Vargo, PSE’s senior vice president of Energy Operations. “Innovative solutions like Heimdall Power’s technology help us maximize the value of our existing infrastructure while strengthening our defenses against extreme weather and incorporating more renewable energy sources.”

The Neurons were installed by Heimdall Power during a weeks-long process. Heimdall utilized autonomous drones, and also used traditional line installation methods, across transmission infrastructure in Whatcom, Island, King, Kitsap, and Pierce counties.

“With this project, PSE is stepping into a leadership role in the vital effort to modernize the U.S. power grid,” Loni Colen, director of business development at Heimdall Power, told POWER. “We’re proud to play a small part in PSE’s work to strengthen not only its own network, but the regional energy system as a whole.”

The companies said the project is one of the largest deployments of DLR sensors in the U.S. Heimdall said multiple sensors inside the Neurons monitor factors including line temperature, sag, electrical current, wind speed, and localized weather conditions. The groups noted that a continuous data stream allows PSE to safely increase transmission capacity based on actual operating conditions, rather than on conservative estimates.

Neurons Named a ‘Best Invention’

The Neurons were recently included among TIME Magazine’s list of Best Inventions of 2025.

“DLR is the next evolution of line rating technology,” said Alex Brotherston, Grid Modernization Principal Engineer with PSE. “Historically, we rely on estimations of the conditions around our transmission lines to determine how much power we can push through the lines. Now with these sensors, we can measure the actual real-time conditions at specific critical points on the line so that we know exactly what is happening and how much power we can safely push through our transmission lines.”

Brotherston told POWER: “DLR technology gives us more information and flexibility about how we control the transmission system. When we are armed with more knowledge about how much power can flow through the lines, it allows us to make safer, smarter, strategic decisions in real-time about operating our system in the most efficient way possible.”

“The energy challenges we face demand solutions that can deliver impact today while building the foundation for tomorrow,” said Jørgen Festervoll, CEO of Heimdall Power. “PSE is meeting those challenges head-on by unlocking new capacity, strengthening communities, and pioneering a smarter, more resilient grid that puts PSE’s customers first.”

PSE will continue to test the DLR technology through summer 2026. The utility will then analyze the data and other observations and data to determine how to implement DLRs using the Neuron data on live transmission lines across its network.

“This technology gives us much more insight into all the factors that influence how much power can flow on our lines. It provides more flexibility in how we manage system load and more strategically select future investments,” Vargo said.

The air monitoring groups said during Tuesday’s meeting that they’re concerned this is the case at several of the refineries.
“Ozone is always present in the air, and it increases in the afternoon because it reacts to sunlight,” said Kathy Kerridge of the Benicia Community Air Monitoring Program.","BENICIA – Local air monitoring groups are questioning emissions data at local Bay Area refineries and asking the Bay Area Air District to more strictly regulate refineries by revising their rules around how they track and report emissions.

The Benicia Community Air Monitoring Program and the Phillips 66 Fenceline Working Group, which monitors emissions around the Phillips 66 refinery in Rodeo, presented their arguments to the air district during a meeting Tuesday attended by several environmental nonprofits, scientists, and former U.S. Environmental Protection Agency officials.

“Having accurate air monitoring is really important to us,” Maureen Brennan, a member of the Phillips 66 Fenceline Working Group, said at the meeting. “There are risks living near a refinery. We’re living next to a very explosive and fire-driven industry, and we live with daily uncertainty. Is it a big leak today, or just a small, daily oozing of gases? We need to know.”

The groups brought up a number of concerns, including how the refineries are measuring the chemicals and how spikes in emissions are flagged. They noted that community members approached them because they said they don’t trust that the numbers that the refineries are reporting are always accurate.

In Benicia, there’s been good reason to question the accuracy of the refinery’s reporting. Valero was fined $82 million last year for not reporting two decades of excess emissions from their Benicia refinery to the air district.

Gov. Gavin Newsom vetoed a bill last year that would’ve strengthened monitoring at the state level. But the Bay Area air district is set to revisit their rules around this issue, and the environmental groups said they hope to have a seat at the table to draft stricter regulations.

Measuring toxic emissions at refinery fencelines

The environmental groups argued that refineries should be required to improve fenceline monitoring and reporting. Fenceline monitoring is when oil companies measure the chemicals in the air around the boundary of refineries to see if gases are leaking out into nearby areas called “fenceline communities.”

Reporting requirements vary by districts, but the groups argue that this data should be publicly available as soon as it’s captured.

Companies like Chevron and Phillips have been operating refineries in California since the late 1800s, and fenceline communities — which often skew Black and Latino — have long complained about the smells and health effects of living around those sites.

Before fenceline monitoring, communities were often left in the dark about what they were breathing, as agencies didn’t look into leaks until after residents complained of odors or flaring, when most of the chemicals had already dissipated.

Community activism around this issue has spanned decades. In August 1994, gases leaked for 16 days from the Rodeo refinery. Nearby Crockett residents experienced sore throats, nausea, and headaches. No alert was sent out, and the leaking unit was only shut down when a nearby plant complained their workers were getting sick.

The incident caused an uproar, and led to Crockett and Rodeo residents demanding that the company’s land use permit not be renewed unless it installed an air monitoring system at the refinery’s border.

Despite years of community engagement, the EPA didn’t pass a federal rule for fenceline monitoring until 2015, and it only required oil companies to measure one chemical, benzene.

California strengthened these requirements in 2017 and required refineries to install more comprehensive monitoring systems by 2020. But regional air districts had to decide what chemicals to monitor, what thresholds to set, and if community notifications were needed.

In the Bay Area, talks to improve these systems happened earlier, due to a 2012 fire at the Chevron refinery in Richmond, which resulted in a five-hour shelter-in-place order and thousands of residents seeking medical treatment.

That led to the air district passing Rule 12-15 in 2016, which required the five refineries in the area to monitor for five hazardous chemicals — benzene, toluene, ethyl benzene, xylenes, and hydrogen sulfide — at the fenceline.

Residents can find all the refinery monitoring pages on the air district’s website.

Eric Stevenson, an advisor for the Benicia Community Air Monitoring Program and the former director of meteorology and measurement at the Bay Area air district, helped write Rule 12-15.

He said they wanted to institute the rule because air monitoring sites used to be stationed far away from refineries in order to track the overall air quality. But that meant that it wasn’t always obvious how bad the air quality was within the fenceline communities.

“The intent of Rule 12-15, specifically to fenceline monitoring, was to give the community an idea of what was crossing the refineries’ fence line and to hopefully have the refineries mitigate those emissions quickly and effectively,” Stevenson said. “The reason that that matters is that the residents living near these refineries were deeply concerned about their health impacts, and they wanted transparency.”

Limitations of fenceline monitoring technology

Stevenson explained that Rule 12-15 requires that refineries use open-path technology for monitoring. These systems work by shooting a long, straight beam of light along each side of the perimeter. If a gas crosses that lightpath, the refinery can determine what the chemical is and how much of it crosses the fenceline.

He added that different systems measure different chemicals, so it’s important for the fencelines to have a variety of them installed. “It’s all based on the type of light that’s emitted,” Stevenson said. Ultraviolet light detects chemicals like benzene and toluene, while infrared light looks at chemical families called alkanes, which includes gases like propane and hexane.

If these systems are well-maintained, Stevenson said they work well to detect chemicals. “But if you don't operate the systems well, and if you don't take the appropriate actions to ensure that the data is of high quality, then the value of those systems is degraded,” said Stevenson.

The air monitoring groups said during Tuesday’s meeting that they’re concerned this is the case at several of the refineries.

They highlighted an issue with ozone detection at the Phillips 66 Rodeo refinery.

“Ozone is always present in the air, and it increases in the afternoon because it reacts to sunlight,” said Kathy Kerridge of the Benicia Community Air Monitoring Program.

Kerridge told the Vallejo Sun that the Benicia group moved one of their own air monitors into the backyard of someone who lived near the refinery in order to test for the chemical.

“Ours and the air district’s always showed the increase in ozone in the afternoon, and Phillips 66’s just shows it's not being detected,” Kerridge said.

Jochen Stutz, a professor at UCLA’s Department of Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences, works with the South Coast Air Quality Management District in Southern California on their own fenceline monitoring programs. He noted that a refinery in LA is also using UV light to measure ozone, but unlike the Bay Area, their data is consistent with the air district’s.

“This is part of the reason why the residents are very concerned about these systems,” Stutz said. “You should be able to measure ozone with these things, and if you can't, then can you measure anything else?”

Stevenson also talked about an issue with data collection. The groups noticed that some of the refineries weren’t showing as many alkanes as they expected. So they brought the raw data to an outside expert, and found what’s called “background creep.” The alkanes are measured by comparing results to a “clean air” file, which isn’t supposed to have any traces of those gases in it. But they found the clean air files did have the gases, which threw off the results.

“If you're saying that background doesn't have any compound in it, and it actually does, when you take the next measurement and you compare it to that background, you're not subtracting the actual pollution measurement from a zero,” Stevenson said.

As a result, Stevenson said, the system can begin to “forget” what clean air really is and report no pollution, even when the gases are still present.

Mike Davis, a former EPA regional laboratory director, brought up other concerns about Rule 12-15’s flagging rules. He noted that under the current rules, any reading that fluctuates over a certain amount — like a sudden, catastrophic leak — is held for review until the refinery verifies it.

“When these filters are applied to this real world event, most of the data would not be released to the public in real time,” Davis said.

Ultimately, Kerridge said they’d like the district to require refineries to be more accountable to the community. They asked for more access to raw data, for the refineries to monitor for more pollutants, and that the district set limits for how much pollution is allowed before the community is notified of an exceedance.

For comparison, air districts in the Central Valley and Southern California already require that refineries set pollution limits, publish quarterly data reports, and send out notifications if a threshold level is crossed.

Kerridge noted that all these provisions would have been required under state law if Newsom hadn’t vetoed SB 674.

The environmental groups said they also want the air district to more thoroughly vet the monitoring data from the refineries for accuracy, and continue to hold forums with the community to discuss fenceline data.

Joseph Lapka, the principal air quality specialist at the Bay Area Air District, said at Tuesday’s meeting that the air district is in the process of creating a survey to get community feedback on what matters the most to people when it comes to fenceline monitoring.

“I think that the fact that a facility can do these sort of things within the bounds of Rule 12-15 speaks not only to the current limitations of the rule, but also to the types of technical details and the level of detail that we need to think about when writing the new rule requirements,” he said.",https://www.vallejosun.com/content/images/size/w1200/2025/10/Phillips66-Rodeo-refinery.jpg,N,,2025-10-23 19:59:55.406455

“Instead of raising prices for our customers via peak and off-peak tariffs, our preference would be to try to keep that price as consistent as possible,” said Nandwani. “AMPECO supports us with live management of the fleet output, and that supports grid stability, sustainability and also margin.”

AUSTIN – The Railroad Commission of Texas (RRC) hosted senior representatives from four leading Canadian pension funds and five major Canadian banks at its Austin headquarters October 22, to discuss the agency’s role as a global leader in energy regulation.

Led by the Honorable Susan Harper, the Consul General of Canada in Dallas, the delegation received an overview of the RRC’s regulatory duties and Texas’ leadership in energy development.

RRC Executive Director Wei Wang provided opening remarks to guests where he spoke about the Commission’s close relationship with the Canadian provinces, specifically though the RRC’s participation in the Interstate Oil and Gas Compact Commission.

""We welcome opportunities like this to engage with international partners who share our goal of promoting safe and reliable energy production and transportation,” said RRC Executive Director Wei Wang. “The RRC remains a key player in maintaining Texas’s position as a global leader in responsible energy development, and discussions like these strengthen our efforts.""

Following the presentation, representatives asked the assembled panel of RRC experts about a variety of topics including gas rate determination, hydrogen production, economic development in Texas, and the RRC’s relationship with other federal, state and foreign regulatory agencies. The Commission’s government relations director also provided an overview of the recent state legislative actions impacting the RRC.

This visit is just the latest example of how the RRC remains at the forefront of the global conversation on energy production and regulation. In its role as regulator for one of the most dynamic energy economies in the world, the Railroad Commission has played host to multiple foreign delegations so far this year, including representatives from Germany and Argentina.

Much of those programs have since been defunded by the Trump administration.
“Vermont has an agreement with the EPA for this money, and the Trump Administration cannot go back on this deal,” Clark said in the release.","Vermont joined a lawsuit directed at the Trump administration on Wednesday for abruptly cutting $7 billion in federal funding for nationwide solar energy projects.

The complaint joins together a coalition of 20 states from Arizona to Maine, including Vermont Attorney General Charity Clark. The complaint, filed in the U.S. Court of Federal Claims, targets the Environmental Protection Agency’s cancellation of the Solar for All program under EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin.

The state was first notified that their grant would be terminated in a letter from the agency on Aug. 7. The next day, Zeldin posted a video that said his agency “no longer has the authority to administer the program or the appropriated funds to keep this boondoggle alive.” He called Solar for All a “grift,” with 15% of programmatic costs going toward “middle men taking their own cut.”

A week later, on Aug. 13, the EPA suspended Vermont’s account, which included more than $62 million in federal funds. By Sept. 19, the account was “liquidated,” and more than 90% of the funds were drained, according to the attorney general’s office.

The program was designed to pass on solar benefits to more than 900,000 households in low-income and disadvantaged communities, according to the Environmental Protection Agency, the federal office that administered the grant to 49 states and six tribes, among others.

“In keeping with a longstanding practice, EPA does not comment on pending litigation,” the agency’s press office said in an email Thursday.

The White House declined to comment.

The program was part of the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund, $27 billion that aimed to reduce carbon emissions and was repealed under President Donald Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill on July 4. The Solar for All page on the Environmental Protection Agency’s website has since been replaced with a quote from Zeldin that claims cutting federal programs would reduce “frivolous” spending “in the name of ‘climate equity.’”

Vermont’s congressional delegation championed the initiative, including U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., who introduced Solar for All into the Inflation Reduction Act. The 2022 act, under the Biden administration, channeled hundreds of billions of dollars toward the clean energy transition. Much of those programs have since been defunded by the Trump administration.

“I introduced the Solar for All program to slash electric bills for working families by up to 80% — putting money back in the pockets of ordinary Americans, not fossil fuel billionaires,” Sanders said in the attorney general’s Thursday press release. “Donald Trump wants to illegally kill this program to protect the obscene profits of his friends in the oil and gas industry.”

Last year, Vermont received $62.5 million from the federal program through the Vermont Department of Public Service. Funds were temporarily frozen in February, but in May, Vermont had allocated more than $22 million of the state’s total grant to help install solar panels on low-income housing through the Vermont Housing Finance Agency, a quasi-public entity that acts like a bank for affordable housing.

At that point, the state had spent roughly $150,000 on staffing that was billed to the agency on a month-by-month reimbursement basis, Melissa Bailey, director of the state energy office within the Vermont Department of Public Service, previously said.

Kerrick Johnson, the department’s commissioner, said he hoped the funding for the program could be restored.

“Thousands of Vermonters stand to benefit if we can get this done,” Johnson wrote in an email.

The state expected to serve about 8,300 low-income households, reduce electric bills by at least 20% and create about 300 new jobs, according to the release.

In May, Sanders said that Trump’s budget bill that canceled the program could not legally rescind the funds.

“Vermont has an agreement with the EPA for this money, and the Trump Administration cannot go back on this deal,” Clark said in the release.

The industrial sector contributes about 25% of global carbon dioxide emissions, but there has not been enough study on how decarbonization efforts to reach net-zero goals set by the Paris Agreement impact the broader economy. This scarcity of empirical studies could hinder efforts to lower greenhouse gas emissions, Yale School of the Environment economists argue in a paper recently published in Science.

“There is vast space for broad-scale work on industrial decarbonization that can leverage research partnerships and new data sources. Quantifying impacts on decarbonizing energy-intensive industries can inform policy makers and the public on different approaches, trade-offs, and spillovers to the macroeconomy,” said Kenneth Gillingham, the Grinstein Class of 1954 Professor of Environmental and Energy Economics, a lead author of the paper.

The authors call for opening new lines of research on how industrial decarbonization technologies and policies interact with the broader economy and how using real-world data can help measure impacts. They cite several suggestions for further study, including the spillover effects of decarbonization on jobs, wages, trade, and incentives.

“We really need to know how supply chains are going to be affected. Where are prices going to be changing? Where are people gaining jobs and where are people losing jobs? How can all this be quantified?” Gillingham said

Citing specific examples, the authors noted that additional inquiry would be useful to analyze what happens when upstream subsidies offered by governments for factories using clean hydrogen production are not adapted by downstream industries such as shipping because it is not cost effective for them to switch to clean hydrogen. While clean energy firms can provide high-paying and stable jobs, opportunities to transition to these jobs historically have been limited to individuals in fossil fuel industry and additional research on the effects on careers and wages for those who aren’t able to move to clean energy jobs is also needed. In another example of impacts that need to be examined, the authors pointed to environmental regulations that can shift production of polluting goods to less-regulated countries.

“When the public, policymakers, or researchers hear the words ‘industrial decarbonization,’ the first instinct is often to see it as a narrow, technical topic — an issue for those living near a smokestack, a matter for regulators, or a specialized field of study. However, industrial decarbonization is an emerging frontier that affects everyone,” said Aleh Tsyvinski, the Arthur M. Okun Professor of Economics at Yale and a study co-author.

Recent initiatives, such as the Inflation Reduction Act, the European Green Deal Industrial Plan, and China’s 1+N Policy Framework, provide opportunities for foundational research quantifying the impacts of the policies, the authors note. Yet, research in the field can be difficult for several reasons, including acquiring data on production networks that are often tightly guarded because of market competition. However, there has been progress in recent years in obtaining such data, Gillingham noted. Financial regulations which typically require companies to publicly disclose their Scope 1, 2 and sometimes Scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions along with climate-related financial risks and mitigation strategies are helping researchers build better networks to consolidate and extend existing data sources. The authors also pointed to the unique opportunities governments and international organizations have to better facilitate data collection and resource collaboration.

“Whether real-world policy impacts and technology dynamics play out as envisioned at the broad scale across the economy thus remains one of the most pressing open research questions in the field,” the authors stated. “Cross-cutting research partnerships and data sharing could vastly improve our understanding of and inform the critical new frontiers in industrial decarbonization that cover a broad economic context.”

Gillingham said that the paper grew out of a 2023 workshop at the National Bureau of Economic Research that brought together economists, engineers, and social scientists for discussions on decarbonization efforts in hard-to-abate sectors. The initial gathering, organized by Gillingham and Lint Barrage ’13 PhD, an associate professor at ETH Zürich, led to a follow-up conference and a multidisciplinary agreement among scientists on the need for new research that can help inform policy initiatives on decarbonization.

“The economy can remain stuck with high emissions even if it has conventional climate policies in place, highlighting the need to consider cross-industry spillovers,” said Barrage, a co-author of the paper.",https://environment.yale.edu/themes/yse/favicon.ico,N,,2025-10-24 03:18:32.170897

LCI documents suggest the project will employ a post-combustion amine absorption system to capture “some percentage” of CO2 from the power plant’s flue gas.","Google has signed a first-of-its-kind corporate offtake agreement to purchase power from a new 400-MW natural gas–fired cogeneration plant outfitted with carbon capture and storage (CCS) in Decatur, Illinois.

In an Oct. 23 blog post, Michael Terrell, head of Google’s Advanced Energy division, unveiled the corporate agreement that will allow the hyperscaler to purchase power from Broadwing Energy Center, a project on which Low Carbon Infrastructure (LCI)—a portfolio company of I Squared Capital—plans to begin construction next year. Broadwing is slated to begin producing power and 1.5 million pounds of steam an hour by the end of 2029. LCI anticipates its carbon capture component will be operational by early 2030.

The project, currently in the permitting phase, is being developed on an existing Archer Daniels Midland (ADM) site in Decatur, adjacent to ADM’s longtime CO₂ sequestration operation. ADM operates one of the nation’s longest-running carbon storage sites in Decatur, where more than 4 million metric tons of CO₂ from its corn-processing operations have been injected about 1.5 miles underground into the Mt. Simon sandstone under an Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Class VI well permit. Developed with the Department of Energy and the Illinois State Geological Survey, ADM’s system will likely serve as the technical foundation for Broadwing’s planned sequestration network.

The power will be distributed to Google “via the grid and behind the meter to ADM, while the steam is supplied to ADM to their industrial processes,” the facility website notes.

If completed, Broadwing would mark one of the first commercial-scale natural gas plants in the U.S. to pair combined heat-and-power generation with carbon capture and dedicated geologic storage. The project also signals how corporate clean-energy buyers are expanding beyond renewable PPAs to back firm, low-carbon capacity—an emerging pillar of reliability as AI and data-center loads surge.

“By agreeing to buy most of the power [Broadwing] generates, Google is helping get this new, baseload power source built and connected to the regional grid that supports our data centers,” Terrell said in his blog post. He also noted the company views the collaboration as a way to “accelerate the path for CCS technology to become more accessible and affordable globally.”

LCI and I Squared have also characterized the project as “a blueprint for delivering reliable, dispatchable, low-carbon power at commercial scale.” Broadwing “demonstrates that carbon capture can be commercially viable today,” said Jonathan Wiens, LCI’s CEO. “Working alongside I Squared and Google, we’re proving that low-carbon power can be both affordable and reliable, while driving job creation and community investment.”

How Broadwing’s Cogeneration System Works

The Broadwing Energy Center is designed to operate as a gas-fired combined heat-and-power (CHP) facility (also known as cogeneration) to produce continuous electricity and process steam, and when operational, is designed to capture and permanently store more than 90% of its CO₂ emissions.

The project will employ a single Mitsubishi Power M501JAC gas turbine, LCI noted. “The captured CO₂ will be compressed and injected into ADM’s EPA Class VI-approved wells, stored permanently more than a mile underground.” The company noted that engineering, procurement, and construction (EPC) services are being led by Kiewit Power Constructors. Project financing is “expected to reach final investment decision in Q2 2026 and commercial operations targeted for 2030,” it said.

LCI documents suggest the project will employ a post-combustion amine absorption system to capture “some percentage” of CO2 from the power plant’s flue gas. Exhaust from the gas turbine will first pass through a heat recovery steam generator (HRSG), which captures waste heat to produce steam used both in ADM’s industrial operations and in the capture process.

The cooled flue gas then moves through a quencher before entering a large absorber column, where it comes into contact with an amine-water solution. The amine “chemically reacts with the CO₂ in the flue gas, bonding with the CO₂ to form a stable compound,” it notes. The resulting CO₂-rich solution is transferred to a regenerator, which uses steam heat to release the absorbed gas. The separated CO₂ is subsequently compressed into liquid form by a series of compressors and permanently stored underground nearby in ADM’s EPA Class VI sequestration wells within the Mt. Simon sandstone formation.

Google’s Newest Pioneering Corporate Agreement

According to Terrell, the project has already achieved substantial progress. “We look forward to helping Broadwing achieve commercial operation by early 2030,” he wrote. “LCI has already engaged a broad range of community stakeholders in the development of the project and will continue to do so throughout its lifecycle. Broadwing is designed to meet rigorous safety and environmental standards and will bring significant benefits to the local community, including creating an estimated 750 full-time jobs over the next four years and supporting dozens of permanent jobs once the plant is running,” he wrote.

For Google, the central driver is access to dependable, low-carbon capacity that can scale with the company’s surging data-center demand and support its commitment to round-the-clock carbon-free electricity across its global portfolio. “Our goal is to help bring promising new CCS solutions to the market while learning and innovating quickly—the same approach we’ve taken with other energy technologies,” Terrell wrote. “Our collaboration with LCI will help fast-track critical technical and operational improvements, from continuing to raise CO2 capture rates to improving system performance and economics.”

The hyperscaler is notably pursuing a deliberate corporate strategy to commercialize next-generation clean firm power through first-of-a-kind procurement structures. Since publishing its 2023 report, “The Corporate Role in Accelerating Advanced Clean Electricity Technologies,” the company has systematically underwritten emerging technologies critical to its 24/7 carbon-free energy (CFE) goal for 2030. Each deal has appeared to pioneer a novel contracting mechanism—utility tariffs, master plant development agreements, or utility-led research frameworks—which are designed to de-risk early-stage deployments as well as create replicable commercial pathways for technologies still climbing the cost curve.

In 2021, Google signed the world’s first corporate geothermal agreement with Fervo Energy to deliver enhanced geothermal power to Nevada data centers and scaling from 3.5 MW to 115 MW through a pioneering Clean Transition Tariff model with NV Energy. In October 2024, the company announced the first U.S. corporate nuclear deal, committing to purchase 500 MW from Kairos Power’s fleet of small modular reactors by 2035. Google has also launched collaborative procurement efforts—partnering with Microsoft and Nucor to aggregate demand for advanced nuclear, next-generation geothermal, and long-duration energy storage (LDES)—and initiated a first-of-its-kind LDES research partnership with Arizona’s Salt River Project to accelerate non-lithium storage technologies.

And in August 2024, Google and Indiana Michigan Power (I&M) filed a landmark contract with Indiana regulators that introduced a dual-purpose arrangement: a Clean Capacity Agreement allowing Google to transfer accredited clean capacity from its existing power purchase agreements into I&M’s PJM resource adequacy portfolio, paired with a custom demand response program that enables Google to flex its Fort Wayne data center operations during grid stress periods. The I&M model demonstrates that Google’s role extends beyond procuring new generation—the company now acts as a grid asset, transferring capacity credits and providing load flexibility to help utilities meet reliability obligations without cost-shifting to other ratepayers.

Share your Extreme Weather Story Global warming solutions Share your Extreme Weather Story In 2024, there were 27 ""billion-dollar"" weather disasters in the United States, an average of one every two weeks.","Just six months before the tragic flooding in Texas this summer, catastrophic wildfires were still raging across Los Angeles. Just three months before that, residents of southern Florida were taking stock of the $34.3 billion of damage in their communities in the wake of Hurricane Milton. Two weeks before that, North Carolinians watched as Hurricane Helene caused the area’s worst flooding since 1916, leading to 219 deaths and $79.6 billion of damage across the Southeast.

It might feel like every other week there is a new catastrophic weather event in the news— tearing through a community, taking homes and lives, and leaving a multi-billion-dollar recovery effort in its wake. If it feels that way, it’s because it’s increasingly true. In 2024, there were 27 “billion-dollar” weather disasters in the United States, an average of one every two weeks.

In the 1980s, the U.S. averaged just 3.3 billion-dollar disasters each year. That average grew to 5.7 annually in the 1990s, 6.7 in the 2000s, and 13.1 in the 2010s. Since 2020, we have averaged 23 billion-dollar weather disasters each year in the United States. The trend has been growing for decades, and points to an increasingly undeniable reality — extreme weather events have been growing more common, more destructive, and more expensive over the last several decades.

Our current approach is making things worse

The costs of this more frequent and extreme weather are, of course, felt most acutely by those directly affected, who have to take stock of the damage and rebuild their lives. Yet, in the end, these significant and growing costs fall on all of us. Consider the huge, unplanned disaster relief spending packages passed by Congress last year, or how homeowners’ insurance rates have been suddenly hiked up.

Despite clear signals that extreme weather is more frequent and severe than ever before, and a growing body of evidence that further emissions from greenhouse gas polluters will only make these events more common, our state and federal strategies for disaster prevention, relief, and recovery do not reflect those realities. Instead, we’re trying to rely on systems that were designed to manage 3 disasters per year to help us deal with 27— that’s just poor planning.

This failure to plan responsibly is already showing up in Americans’ lives in a few ways:

A growing federal tax bill

Disasters are more common and more destructive now, but Congress has not made funding for disaster agencies more sustainable or reliable in response. Between the 1993 and 2023 fiscal years, 68% of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA)’s spending was funded through unplanned, supplemental appropriations. Since 2001, FEMA has predicted it would run out of money before the end of the year ten times, entering a state of “immediate needs funding” where it is forced to pause all non life-saving activities. Just eight days into the 2025 fiscal year, FEMA had already spent half its annual disaster budget.

For the victims of a disaster, this means critical relief comes slower, and more cost burden is placed on affected families in the immediate aftermath of a crisis, when people need aid the most. For the rest of us, it means getting sent an ever-growing bill after the fact, as this significant portion of critical spending is left chronically underfunded and without a thought-out, designated source of revenue. Common sense suggests that acting in a crisis, especially if one is unprepared and ill-equipped, will always be more costly. Right now, it is often the US taxpayer that is paying those additional costs.

Increased vulnerability to catastrophe

Dealing with extreme weather in the reactive way means that we don’t take full advantage of opportunities to prepare and adapt our communities ahead of time. The scale of lives lost and destruction of property and the natural environment depends on the nature of a disaster, but it also depends on a communities’ natural and built resilience. Strong building codes, home and roof hardening, nature-based restoration projects, and other programs that minimize risk could keep communities safer and protected from total destruction, if we invested in them.

Of course, we never know when or where the next disaster will strike, so planning ahead is a challenge. But in many regions we have an idea of which areas are most vulnerable, and which types of resilience projects are cost-effective. For example, sea-level rise and flooding threatens many coastal regions, but we know coastal wetlands provide an estimated $23.2 billion in storm protection annually. Still, we often don’t start building resilience until we’re re-building a community in the wake of a disaster that has already left it devastated. In a country facing 23 major weather disasters each year, failure to be proactive about resilience projects costs us immensely in dollars, homes, and human lives.

A flailing insurance market

When disaster strikes, we rely on private homeowners insurance to protect families from catastrophic losses. But after ignoring the growing severity of disasters for decades, private insurers have, in recent years, started shifting more and more risk onto homeowners by raising premiums nationwide and in some places pulling their coverage entirely in order to minimize their exposure to risk.

The result is that millions of Americans, all across the country, are struggling to pay higher and higher premiums for insurance policies that cover less and less risk. Homeowners insurance non-renewal rates increased in 46 states in 2023. Between 2021 and 2024, annual insurance premiums for a typical homeowner increased by 24% percent on average. When homeowners lose access to private home insurance, they are often left with no option but “insurers of last resort,” which are high-premium, low-coverage insurance plans backed by state governments. These plans now cover over $1 trillion in assets nationally.

We need a proactive approach to weather disasters

Whatever we do now, there is more destructive weather in our future. What we can do is prepare ourselves for it, and ensure that the systems we have in place to help communities recover are up for the challenge. A responsible approach to extreme weather would be one that acknowledges our riskier reality, is proactive about funding relief and recovery, and prioritizes preventative action to both prevent extreme weather from getting worse and mitigate the impacts of weather disasters that strike moving forward.

A proactive approach might include:

1. Investment in resilient communities

One of the most effective ways to minimize the impacts of extreme weather is building up the resilience of our communities. Some of the most cost-effective types of adaptation are nature-based projects, which both build community resilience to weather and restore natural habitats and environments. Coastal wetland and dune restoration, for instance, can protect shorelines from flooding.

During Hurricane Sandy, the South Cape May Meadows Preserve, which had been restored in 2007, saw significantly less coastal flooding than much of the New Jersey shoreline. Nature-based solutions are also cost-effective— according to the Nature Conservancy, recent research has shown that for every $1 spent restoring wetlands there are $7 saved by reducing floods. Other types of adaptation, like building code requirements that require elevating buildings in flood zones or clearing brush to limit wildfire risk can save $4–$11 per $1 invested.

Given the clear benefits of resilience projects, we should prioritize making them happen. Nature-based solutions in particular are a win-win because they restore our natural world and make us more resilient.

Comprehensive state-level and national adaptation plans, as well as incentives for state and local governments to implement resilience projects, would go a long way towards making our communities safer and more resilient to extreme weather—before disaster strikes.

2. An insurance market that incentivizes minimizing risk

At its best, insurance would both protect homeowners from massive losses, and incentivize them to take steps to build up resilience on their own. For example, an insurer charging higher premiums in an area with high wildfire risk but offering discounts to policyholders who fireproof their homes would both effectively price for climate risk and incentivize investments that lower risk exposure. At scale and over time, this could lead to more resilient communities that are less exposed to catastrophic losses in the event of a wildfire. Our overarching goal should be an insurance market that prices for inherent risks, incentivizes risk reduction, and minimizes the type of major disruptions caused by pulling coverage and spiking prices.

3. Proactive funding for recovery and resilience, that holds polluters accountable

None of these things will be cheap, but we will pay for the costs of extreme weather one way or another. Right now, we’re just sending taxpayers a bill after the fact.

As a first step, we need to increase annual disaster budgets. It’s well past due. Accurately accounting for extreme weather risks in our budgets ahead of time could ensure that critical relief is delivered to people right when they need it, allow us to plan for smart adaptation and resilience efforts, and also give us the opportunity to be forward-thinking about how we should source the revenue for those expenses.

Given that opportunity, why not source the money in a way that also reduces our overall risk? One way to do that would be to tax the pollution that contributes to extreme weather. There is a lot of evidence that burning fossil fuels and the pollution it emits is a significant contributor to the rise of extreme weather. Putting a tax on burning fossil fuels would both help mitigate future pollution and its impact on weather, and create a source of revenue to fund proactive preparedness and resilience as well as timely and effective disaster relief.

Paying more to fill up your gas tank, or heat your home with gas is no small concern– but we will have to pay for the costs of extreme weather regardless. Rather than raising everyone’s taxes, why not pay for it in a way that has the added benefit of encouraging less of the pollution driving the problem in the first place.

It’s not just the coasts. This is an urgent, national, and worsening problem.

While extreme weather is often considered a coastal problem, recent years have shown us that all parts of the country are at heightened risk. In 2024, no region of the country avoided a billion-dollar catastrophe. In addition to the southeast hurricanes, the list of these disasters included wildfires in New Mexico, hail storms in Texas, catastrophic flooding in Minnesota and Iowa, and near-simultaneous winter storms in the Pacific Northwest.

Insurance woes are not confined to California and Florida either. Insurance premiums went up in 95% of U.S. ZIP codes between 2021 to 2024. The four states with the highest premium percentage increases between 2021-2024 were Utah, Illinois, Arizona, and Pennsylvania. 77% of Allstate’s catastrophic losses in 2024 were from wind and hail storms. Hail storms are most prevalent in Texas, the Great Plains and the Midwest.

The costs of dealing with extreme weather will only get worse without action. By 2050, annual federal spending on hurricane relief alone could increase by up to $36 billion. The Chair of the Federal Reserve Board testified to Congress this year that in high-risk areas where insurers and banks have started pulling out entirely, it could become impossible to secure a mortgage within the next decade.

A better approach wouldn’t make these problems go away. Reducing emissions is critical to keep the problem from getting worse, but the frequent and severe weather we see now is likely here to stay. There will be no way to get around hard conversations about how to fairly share the costs of insurance, relief, and recovery or how to manage the fallout when some areas become simply too risky to be livable. But the responsible path forward cannot be to bury our heads in the sand.

We can build broad support for a better approach

Environment America and our state affiliates have a history of working across the political spectrum to build broad support for common-sense solutions that protect our natural world.

There is a broad and growing base of Americans who have been personally affected by weather disasters, who understand that this is a problem, and who want to see it addressed in a proactive, rational, and cost-effective way. We have staff based in communities all over the country who have experienced extreme weather who are ready to organize their communities to advocate for a better, more proactive approach.

(AP) — Michigan is demanding millions of dollars in incentives back from a Chinese company after plans to build an electric vehicle battery plant collapsed following years of pushback against the project from neighbors and members of Congress.

READ MORE: Michigan Gives $175 Million for EV Battery Plant

Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer supported the $2.36 billion factory in 2022, and state lawmakers approved nearly $175 million in incentives for the project. The state is now holding Gotion Inc. in default of $23.6 million, accusing the company of abandoning the project.

""While this is not the outcome we hoped for, we recognize the tremendous responsibility we have to the people we serve to make sure their hard-earned tax dollars are spent wisely and appropriately,"" Danielle Emerson, a spokesperson with the Michigan Economic Development Corporation, said in a statement.

Representatives for Gotion, which is headquartered in California, did not respond to multiple messages seeking comment.

In a letter dated Sept. 17, Michigan informed Gotion that it was in default of economic development grant obligations because no ""eligible activities"" had occurred on the site's property in over 120 days.

According to the MEDC, the state is seeking to claw back $23.6 million that was disbursed toward the purchase of the site's land near Big Rapids, about 200 miles (322 kilometers) northwest of Detroit. $26.4 million remaining from the grant that was not spent will be returned to the state, Emerson said. Citing a lack of progress on the project, a different $125 million grant was not distributed to Gotion.

The news was first reported by Crain's Detroit Business.

The state also said two project-related lawsuits are imposing a ""material adverse effect"" on its progress, which counts as grounds for default. The letter said that if the defaults are not resolved in 30 days, the state expects repayment of $23.6 million. That deadline passed Oct. 17.

Residents of nearby Green Township so firmly opposed the project, some over environmental concerns, that voters in 2023 recalled five local elected officials who supported bringing the factory to the area.

Auto manufacturing is the lifeblood of Michigan's economy, which has been hard hit by tariffs imposed this year on the industry and Canada. When the project was proposed, officials said the factory would produce cathodes and anodes, two components key to electric vehicle batteries, as well as over 2,000 jobs. The original economic development incentives came as officials sought to bolster manufacturing in the state.

Whitmer's office did immediately respond to a request for comment.

Republican U.S. Rep. John Moolenaar, who represents a swath of rural Michigan, had been the loudest and most prominent critic of the project, accusing Gotion of ties with forced labor and the Chinese Communist Party. Moolenaar chairs the House Select Committee on China and introduced a bill that stopped companies like Gotion from receiving electric vehicle tax credits from President Joe Biden's Inflation Reduction Act. Moolenaar's bill was signed by President Donald Trump earlier this year.

""Now that its contract with the State of Michigan and MEDC is set to be terminated, the people of Green Charter Township can finally move on from Gotion's lies and broken promises,"" Moolenaar said in a press release.",https://img.manufacturing.net/mindful/im/workspaces/default/uploads/2025/10/michigan.GPIvpaMKy4.jpg?auto=format%2Ccompress&crop=focalpoint&fit=max&fp-x=0.48&fp-y=0.53&q=70&w=1200,N,,2025-10-23 18:00:18.168911

The Alpha 50 plant – priced at €50m – can be skid-mounted, prefabricated and standardised to reduce costs and aims to produce high-purity hydrogen at 30 bar pressure.

CEO Dennis Schulz said it was time to “disrupt” how large-scale projects are deployed and Alpha 50 would set a new standard for execution at scale.

Large-scale hydrogen production faces challenges including high energy input, high costs, and the need for new infrastructure for production and transportation.

Existing methods like steam methane reforming are carbon-intensive, while green hydrogen production via electrolysis requires large amounts of renewable energy and faces high costs, even with advancing technology.

Other challenges involve developing efficient and cost-effective storage and transportation methods, ensuring safety due to hydrogen’s high flammability, and establishing government policies and regulations that support investment.

ITM Power launched a German-based subsidiary in the summer, as it continues to explore new openings. It will build, own, and operate green hydrogen plants based on the OEM’s electrolysis technology, following a similar business model that has served industrial gas majors for decades.

Today the most eye-catching large-scale developments are in China.

Envision Energy recently commissioned what it claims is the world’s most advanced green hydrogen and ammonia production facility, in Chifeng.

Powered entirely by an off-grid renewable energy system, the plant, located in Chifeng Net Zero Industrial Park, is also the first of its kind to be fully artificial intelligence-enabled.

It signals strong investor confidence in more compact, land-efficient solar technologies — an important trend as global energy systems look to decarbonize.

With this seed round in place, Janta is better positioned to engage with strategic customers (such as airports, data centers, commercial rooftops) and to refine its technology and business model.

With the fresh capital, Janta Power intends to:

Accelerate product development and manufacturing of its vertical solar towers.

Deploy pilot installations in key sites — validating performance, durability, cost competitiveness and operational integration.

Expand partnerships with infrastructure-owners (e.g., airports, campuses, industrial sites) which benefit from high-energy density solar solutions.

Advance its international footprint, with potential applications in markets where land is at a premium or grid infrastructure is limited.

The company differentiates itself by offering higher energy output per unit footprint. Its 3-D vertical towers aim to capture sunlight from multiple angles, making better use of ground area.

The reduced land requirement is especially useful in environments where space is restricted or expensive (urban sites, airports, etc.).

The solar towers can be adapted for challenging sites. For example, airports require solar installations that do not generate glare, interfere with radar or air traffic control, or occupy large open fields. Janta’s design addresses such constraints.

Potential Challenges Ahead

While the seed funding is a strong vote of confidence, the company will face several challenges:

Manufacturing scalability: Turning a novel design into high-volume, cost-efficient production is non-trivial.

Operational validation: Real-world performance, maintenance costs, longevity and reliability need to be proven over time.

Commercial rollout: Selling to large-scale infrastructure players (airports, etc.) often involves long sales cycles, regulatory hurdles, and integration complexities.

Competition and differentiation: The solar market is crowded; establishing a unique value and defensible position will be key.

Janta Power’s $5.5 M seed round places it in a strong position to lead a wave of solar innovation focused on density, versatility and high-impact deployment. If its pilot projects succeed and the technology proves cost-competitive, the company could play an important role in how and where solar is installed in the future.",https://www.renewableenergymagazine.com/ficheroenergias/fotos/agenda/ampliada/j/janta.jpg,N,,2025-10-23 18:18:40.522437

During Careers in Energy Week, the Michigan Department of Labor and Economic Opportunity has been busy highlighting its efforts to funnel both young people and adults into the energy sector and its related skilled trades. Some stats to chew on: the state's got almost half a million energy-related jobs, and it's looking at about 40,600 yearly openings in professional trades by 2032, as noted by the Michigan Department of Labor and Economic Opportunity.

The big cheese of the LEO's Workforce Development division, Krista Johnson, did make it clear. ""Careers in Energy Week gives us the opportunity to spotlight the programs and partnerships that are helping Michiganders gain the skills they need to succeed in our state’s growing energy workforce,"" she told the Michigan Department of Labor and Economic Opportunity. The initiative is not just about filling seats; it's hooking up workers with the kind of gigs that pay well and, more importantly, are in demand.

Now, don't snooze on STEM. That's Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics if you were wondering. These fields are on an upward swing, with over 23,200 annual openings and an employment jump expected at 7.8% from 2025 to 2032. These careers are pivotal for powering Michigan's future, and they need a workforce that's sharp on tech, ace at problem-solving, and locked and loaded with real-world, practical chops.

LEO is stepping up to the plate with something called the Employer-Led Collaboratives. These are alliances where businesses, educators, and workforce pros huddle up to focus on talent needs and cook up some innovative solutions to meet industry demands. They're gunning to make sure the workforce is on point for these high-visibility roles, and they've got something to show for it — they've already had a hand in spooling up Registered Apprenticeship programs throughout the state. These apprenticeships are key: they let folks earn their keep while learning the ropes, setting them up for solid careers in energy and trades.

There's also a squad called the Michigan Energy Workforce Development Consortium, a robust team-up of over 50 employers and partners throwing their weight behind grooming Michigan's energy workforce. They're the boots on the ground, providing hands-on experiences, flinging open the doors to training resources, and making sure students and job seekers get to rub elbows with actual employers. Now that's how you pipeline talent into a burgeoning sector.

Last year, a whopping 8,200 students got their minds blown by more than 26 partnering organizations hosting 31 different career discovery mash-ups across the state. Small-scale programs didn't miss a beat either, reaching nearly 1,000 additional students, per Michigan.gov's tally.

Worries about how AI will affect the environment surpass concerns about other industries that worsen climate change, according to a new poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research and the Energy Policy Institute at the University of Chicago.

The results of the poll, conducted in September, suggest that as AI reshapes work, communication and culture, it’s also sparking anxieties about how the growing energy demands could further harm the environment.

It takes massive amounts of electricity to power AI. Electricity consumption from data centers is set to more than double globally by 2030, according to the International Energy Agency. The United States accounts for by far the largest share of the projected increase, followed by China. In many places, the electricity for data centers will come from power plants that burn coal, oil and natural gas. Burning these fossil fuels for electricity emits carbon dioxide, trapping heat in the atmosphere and warming the planet.

The energy needs are so large that major technology companies are investing in next-generation nuclear technology, which can produce electricity without emissions, and quietly scaling back their own goals to cut carbon pollution.

Aidan Collins, a 26-year-old Democrat in New York, said in his view, AI uses an “absurd amount” of energy.

“Using all this energy and contributing to climate change in a bad way, it all just seems very awful to me,” he said.

More worries about AI’s environmental impact than meat and aviation

President Donald Trump unveiled a plan this summer for America’s “global dominance” in artificial intelligence, which included cutting back environmental regulations to speed up the construction of AI supercomputers. The U.S. Department of Energy has identified federal sites where tech companies could build data centers to power AI. Trump, a Republican, has made sweeping strides to prioritize fossil fuels for electricity generation and hinder renewable energy projects.

About 4 in 10 U.S. adults say they are “extremely” or “very” concerned about the environmental impacts of AI. That’s higher than the share of Americans who are highly concerned about the environmental impact of the cryptocurrency, meat production and air travel industries, all of which contribute to climate change and cause environmental harm. Bitcoin mining uses enormous amounts of electricity. Livestock produce methane, a powerful greenhouse gas. And when airplanes burn jet fuel, it releases carbon dioxide.

Like Collins, several Americans said in follow-up interviews that they are worried about the energy and water required to power AI. Data centers need a tremendous amount of water to keep cool. Some communities strongly oppose data centers because they demand so much energy and water.

Aaron Gunnoe, a 29-year-old independent in Ohio, said he’s very concerned about the increasing electricity demand, when much of it is supplied by fossil fuels.

“They haven’t done anything in the way of offsetting it cleanly,” he said. “They just keep building more and more.”

Democrats are more likely than Republicans to be highly worried

Democrats are particularly likely to be concerned about the environmental impacts of AI.

“I feel like it’s going to be a greater and greater burden,” said Amy Fennewald, a 61-year-old Democrat in Minnesota.

But while about half of Democrats are “extremely” or “very” concerned, so are about one-third of independents and Republicans. Raymond Suarez, a 60-year-old living in Florida, considers himself a “strong” Republican. He fears data centers will be built on land that should be preserved or used for other things, such as farming, and he worries AI is becoming too pervasive.

“For them to uptick it and for them to think it’s a great thing, no, it’s not,” he said.

On the other hand, James Horner said he’s not at all concerned about the environmental impacts. The 52-year-old Republican living in South Carolina said he thinks artificial intelligence will be the solution to its own energy problem — it will show how clean energy can be built in an efficient, profitable way, and clean energy will be used to power AI.

“It’s going to help everybody,” he said. “I think it’s going to be able to figure out these processes happening in our body that scientists, as smart as they are, haven’t figured out yet. With supercomputers taking all that data, I think it will help everything, health care, the environment. If it’s used correctly, it will do good.”

The expected legacy of AI is more negative than positive

Americans are more likely to think that over the next decade, artificial intelligence will do more to hurt than help the environment, the economy and society as a whole.

Doug Bowen, a 79-year-old moderate Republican living in Kansas, said he thinks artificial intelligence will do more harm. The demand on the planet’s resources will be greater as AI and the number of companies involved in the field grow, he said.

Americans are divided on whether AI will do more to help or hurt them personally. About one-quarter say AI will do more to help them, and about the same share say it will do more to hurt them. About half say that it won’t make a difference in their lives or that they are unsure.

Amanda Hernandez, a 24-year-old Democrat in California, said she grew concerned after watching TikTok videos about the immense energy and water demands. Hernandez said she thinks she will be personally hurt by AI because she works as a cashier at a fast food restaurant.

“I’m more concerned, as AI continues to grow and advance, that we’re just not going to need any cashiers or customer service people altogether,” she said.

Fennewald, in Minnesota, said she doesn’t know whether she will be personally helped or hurt by AI in the future.

“I think it’s a black box. I don’t know how we can know,” she said. “We really have no idea what’s ahead.”",https://finance-commerce.com/files/2025/10/AI-Impact.jpg,N,,2025-10-23 18:00:35.264502

Williams is the first partner Woodside has added since giving Louisiana LNG the final go-ahead in April.
Before that, it sold a 40% stake in the project's infrastructure company to U.S. investor Stonepeak for $5.7 billion.
Once Louisiana LNG is complete, Woodside is keen to tap European markets in particular as they cut LNG imports from Russia, O'Neill said.
Louisiana LNG already has a supply deal with Germany’s Uniper and a heads of agreement with Turkey’s BOTAS.","Australia's Woodside Energy has enlisted U.S.-based Williams as an investor and pipeline operator of its Louisiana liquefied natural gas plant, to tap its infrastructure experience and ease cost pressures as construction ramps up.

Under the arrangement, Williams will get a 10% stake in Louisiana LNG's holding company and 80% of the Driftwood pipeline that will supply feed gas to the $17.5 billion project.

Williams, which operates more than 33,000 miles (53,108 km) of pipeline across 24 U.S. states, will pay Woodside $378 million and contribute $1.9 billion towards the project’s construction costs.

Woodside CEO Meg O’Neill told Reuters her company had expertise with developing LNG projects, but it needed to partner with an experienced operator of onshore pipelines in the U.S. like Williams.

The Louisiana LNG venture forms part of Woodside’s major expansion strategy into North America, betting on a pro-fossil fuel U.S. administration and growing global demand for gas.

O’Neill said Woodside was ""off to the races"" with the project and its construction workforce had ramped up ahead of first production expected in 2029.

Woodside is looking to sell a further 10% to 20% in the holding company after the Williams deal to reduce its overall interest in the project to 50%.

""We do want to bring other investors into the project,"" O'Neill said. ""We're not going to set a timeline on it. We'll continue to be patient, but the window is narrowing.""

Williams is the first partner Woodside has added since giving Louisiana LNG the final go-ahead in April.

Before that, it sold a 40% stake in the project's infrastructure company to U.S. investor Stonepeak for $5.7 billion.

MST Marquee analyst Saul Kavonic said Williams was a “very strong partner” and would help ease balance sheet pressures associated with the huge project.

“It's going to really raise the profile of the project within the U.S.,” he said. “From an investor perspective, the sell-down is viewed positively.”

But further sell-downs would be needed to affirm the project’s value, he added.

Shares in the Australian company gained as much as 4.1% to A$24.11 on Thursday.

Once Louisiana LNG is complete, Woodside is keen to tap European markets in particular as they cut LNG imports from Russia, O'Neill said.

Louisiana LNG already has a supply deal with Germany’s Uniper and a heads of agreement with Turkey’s BOTAS.

“There's very strong interest in LNG from our project from those customers in Europe,” she said.

“They're absolutely going to need LNG from other sources, and the U.S. is going to be one of those key sources.”

“Broadwing demonstrates that carbon capture can be commercially viable today,” said Jonathan Wiens, CEO of Low Carbon Infrastructure.","Google has agreed to buy power from a 400-MW Illinois natural gas plant using carbon capture, a first-of-its-kind deal to supply electricity to its Midwest data centers while storing CO₂ underground.

(Reuters) — Google has entered into the first corporate agreement to buy electricity from a U.S. power plant using carbon capture and storage in a deal to help fuel its data centers in the country's Midwest region, the technology company said on Oct. 23.

Big Tech's plans to expand technologies like generative artificial intelligence, which will require vast amounts of electricity, have butted up against the realities of a U.S. power grid running short on supplies.

That has led to a flurry of announcements in recent months by companies like Google to help fund the development of new and expanded power plants across the country.

Google's recent deals have included purchasing electricity from advanced nuclear reactors, geothermal and hydropower. It is also working with the biggest U.S. power grid, PJM Interconnection, which covers the world's largest concentration of data centers, to speed up the connection of new power supplies.

Google's latest power offtake agreement involves a 400-megawatt power plant in Decatur, Illinois, which will be developed by privately held Low Carbon Infrastructure. It is expected to produce power using carbon capture, which involves trapping about 90% of CO2 emissions and injecting them underground, in the early 2030s.

Google did not disclose the financial terms of the deal, while Low Carbon Infrastructure said project financing was expected to reach final investment decision in the first half of 2026.

Natural gas-fired power that is produced while capturing and storing carbon dioxide had been missing from the equation, said Michael Terrell, head of Advanced Energy at Google.

""We've been really focused on advancing all these new technologies for around-the-clock clean technologies and this is an important piece of the puzzle,"" Terrell said. ""It's a very important technology that the world needs.""

The Broadwing project will be built at an existing industrial site operated by agribusiness company Archer Daniels Midland, which has a history of injecting carbon dioxide underground from ethanol production.

“Broadwing demonstrates that carbon capture can be commercially viable today,” said Jonathan Wiens, CEO of Low Carbon Infrastructure.

Construction is expected to last four years and create 650 union labor jobs and 100 construction management and support staff in that time, the companies said.

Carbon sequestered at the site will be stored permanently in special wells that are 5,000–7,000 feet (1,524-2,133 m) underground.

ADM will also have the ability to purchase power from the operation, which will initially deliver electricity to the Midcontinent Independent System Operator, which covers 15 Midwest states and multiple Google data centers.

Google and Low Carbon Infrastructure said they plan to pursue additional CCS facilities in the U.S., though they did not disclose specific locations or timelines.

Carbon capture and storage has been promoted by the International Energy Agency and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change as a tool to reduce emissions from fossil fuel-based power and heavy industry.

S. 323 would reduce that cost threshold to $5 million for broadband projects.
Second, because most broadband projects are categorically excluded from NEPA’s documentation requirements, CBO expects that very few broadband projects would benefit from FAST-41 participation.
S. 323 contains no intergovernmental mandates as defined in UMRA.","Bill Summary

S. 323 would require the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) to develop a plan for improving coordination among federal agencies to expand access to broadband Internet and to submit that plan to the Congress. The bill also would direct several federal agencies to report to the NTIA and the Congress on efforts to track broadband construction and to assist the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) with filling in its map that depicts national access to broadband. In addition, the bill would require the Government Accountability Office (GAO) to study and report on the plan’s effectiveness.

Under the bill, agencies specified in the bill would be required to track processing times for permit applications to install, construct, modify, or maintain communications facilities on federal land. (Under current law, such applications must be processed within 270 days.) The bill would require those agencies to analyze any delays, expedite processing, and report annually to the Congress.

Finally, S. 323 would amend title 41 of the Fixing America’s Surface Transportation (FAST) Act to expand the types of projects that are eligible for coverage under the FAST-41 program, which was established in 2015 to streamline federal permitting and environmental review for large energy and infrastructure projects. The bill would lower the cost threshold at which covered broadband construction projects that are subject to review under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) qualify for the FAST-41 program from $200 million to $5 million.

Estimated Federal Cost

The estimated budgetary effect of S. 323 is shown in Table 1. The costs of the legislation primarily fall within budget function 370 (commerce and housing credit).

Basis of Estimate

CBO assumes that S. 323 will be enacted by the end of 2025.

Spending Subject to Appropriation

Using information from the NTIA, CBO estimates that implementing S. 323 would cost $6 million over the 2026-2030 period. Any related spending would be subject to the availability of appropriated funds.

CBO estimates that the costs for employee compensation and contracting to develop a plan to improve coordination among federal broadband programs would total $5 million over the 2026-2030 period. Among other responsibilities, the NTIA would be directed to coordinate the work of federal agencies to establish a strategy, identify potential funding caps for certain broadband subsidies, and create benchmarks for the performance of federal broadband programs.

Using information about the cost of similar reports, CBO estimates that the cost for GAO to complete its study, for 15 federal agencies to report to the NTIA within 60 days of enactment, and for federal agencies to report on delays in processing permits for communications facilities would total $1 million over the 2026-2030 period.

CBO estimates that it would cost the FCC less than $500,000 over the 2026-2030 period to consult with and report to the NTIA and to the Congress about broadband projects. However, because the FCC is authorized to collect fees each year that are sufficient to offset the appropriated costs of its regulatory activities, CBO estimates that the net cost to the agency would be negligible, assuming appropriation actions consistent with that authority.

Direct Spending

S. 323 would authorize certain broadband construction projects to participate in the FAST-41 permitting program, which is administered by the Federal Permitting Improvement Steering Council. To participate in FAST-41 under current law, a project must require an investment of more than $200 million and be subject to NEPA review. S. 323 would reduce that cost threshold to $5 million for broadband projects. CBO expects that under the bill many broadband construction projects that will be funded through the NTIA’s Broadband Equity, Access, and Deployment (BEAD) Program would be newly eligible for FAST-41 coverage. The Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act provided $42 billion in 2021 for the BEAD Program, which is designed to increase high-speed Internet access across the United States by funding planning, mapping, and deployment of broadband networks. CBO expects that funds for some BEAD projects that would participate in the FAST-41 program could be spent more quickly under S. 323 than under current law. Thus, net direct spending would increase over the 2026-2035 period for those projects.

CBO expects that the increase in direct spending under the bill would be insignificant for three reasons. First, participation is voluntary, so many projects may not choose to participate in FAST-41 even if they are newly eligible under the bill. Second, because most broadband projects are categorically excluded from NEPA’s documentation requirements, CBO expects that very few broadband projects would benefit from FAST-41 participation. Only projects that require an environmental impact statement (EIS) or environmental assessment under NEPA would be eligible for FAST-41.

Third, CBO is uncertain about the extent to which any BEAD projects that newly participate in FAST-41 under the bill would spend funds more quickly than under current law. The Permitting Council’s fiscal year 2024 report to the Congress shows that FAST-41 projects completed their environmental impact statements 23 percent faster than all projects requiring an EIS in that year. However, the NTIA is also streamlining requirements for permitting and environmental review, which reduces the effect of FAST-41 on the permitting process. Certain large, complex projects could benefit by using FAST-41, but those projects would still need to adhere to federal, state, and local permitting and environmental requirements, which all serve to delay project timelines regardless of FAST-41 participation.

Pay-As-You-Go Considerations

The Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010 establishes budget-reporting and enforcement procedures for legislation affecting direct spending or revenues. CBO estimates that enacting the bill would increase direct spending by less than $500,000 over the 2026-2035 period.

Increase in Long-Term Net Direct Spending and Deficits

CBO estimates that enacting S. 323 would not increase net direct spending or on-budget deficits in any of the four consecutive 10-year periods beginning in 2036.

Mandates

If the FCC increases annual fees to offset the costs of implementing provisions in the bill, S. 323 would increase the cost of an existing private-sector mandate as defined in the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act (UMRA) on private-sector entities required to pay those fees. CBO estimates that the incremental cost of the mandate would be small and would fall well below the annual threshold established for private-sector mandates ($206 million in 2025, adjusted annually for inflation).

S. 323 contains no intergovernmental mandates as defined in UMRA.

Analysts polled by FactSet expected adjusted profit of 35 cents a share on revenue of $47.1 billion.","By Claudia Assis

Ford reports better-than-expected quarterly earnings, dials down tariff impact

Part of the F-150's appeal is its versatility, which makes it attractive to both business and retail buyers.

Ford Motor Co. late Thursday unveiled a plan to catch up on production of its most iconic vehicle and cleared a high bar with investors.

Ford (F) is adding extra workers and taking other measures to meet ""strong"" customer demand for its F-Series pickup trucks while making up for production losses stemming from a fire at an aluminum supplier's plant.

The goal is to increase production of its F-Series vehicles, including gasoline and hybrid models, by more than 50,000 trucks next year, Ford said.

Assembly of the F-150's electric version, the Lightning, will remain paused, however. Ford executives declined to give a timeline for an eventual production restart for the electric vehicle but said it would be relatively easy to resume assembly.

The carmaker said it was giving priority to gas and hybrid F-Series trucks because they are more profitable and use less aluminum. Hourly employees at Ford's EV plant in the Detroit area will join a third crew at the Dearborn Truck Plant next door, the company said.

The fire last month at a Novelis plant in Oswego, N.Y., destroyed a key part of the facility. The Atlanta-based aluminum supplier has said it has begun sourcing materials from other plants and ""industry peers"" to help mitigate the gap in supply, which Ford confirmed on Thursday.

The F-150 has been America's best-selling vehicle for decades running, and Ford has sold more than 400,000 of them this year. The carmaker said Thursday that the vehicle remains on track for a 49th straight year at the top.

Part of its appeal is its versatility: Businesses buy it for their commercial fleets, and it also attracts retail buyers, even if they are just hauling loads from Costco or Home Depot. The F-150 routinely outsells the next most popular vehicles, the Chevy Silverado and the Toyota RAV, by 100,000 vehicles every year.

Ford also tweaked its guidance for 2025 adjusted profit to between $6 billion and $6.5 billion, in part due to the supplier fire and the tariff headwinds the company has had to absorb. Ford said that, if not for the fire, it would have raised guidance.

The company in July guided for 2025 adjusted profit between $6.5 billion and $7.5 billion. Ford said that the Novelis fire is expected to be a headwind of $1 billion or less this year and next.

Ford called for a net tariff impact of $1 billion for the year, down from a July estimate of $2 billion.

The carmaker earned an adjusted 45 cents a share in the third quarter on revenue of $50.5 billion. Analysts polled by FactSet expected adjusted profit of 35 cents a share on revenue of $47.1 billion.

""We are heading into 2026 as a stronger and more agile company,"" Chief Executive Jim Farley said. ""We will continue to focus on execution and on quickly making the right strategic calls on propulsion, partnerships and technology that will create tremendous value for our customers.""

The company's EV business, which it calls Ford Model E, posted an adjusted loss of $1.4 billion, wider than the $1.2 billion loss in the year-ago quarter.

The core business of traditionally powered vehicles, Ford Blue, reported a $1.5 billion profit, slightly less than the year-ago results, while Ford Pro, the part of the company geared to commercial ventures, posted a $2 billion adjusted profit, up from $1.8 billion a year ago.

The DOE’s $7.6 billion in cancellations do not bring our country any closer to American Energy Dominance.
Monday's letter noted that over $2 billion in funding terminations directly impact projects in California districts represented by Republicans in Congress.
On Oct. 3, California's Senators specifically noted the terminations included California's Alliance for Renewable Clean Hydrogen Energy (ARCHES) Hydrogen Hub, a $1.2 billion public-private hydrogen hub project, funded by the bipartisan Infrastructure Law passed during the Biden Administration.
""California and ARCHES will continue to work with our 400+ partners to develop a renewable hydrogen ecosystem that will enable multiple industries to cost effectively transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy,"" vowed Governor Newsom earlier this month.","WASHINGTON D.C. – California lawmakers issued a letter this week denouncing the Trump Administration's plans to selectively terminate billions in energy investments previously approved by Congress.

The letter, signed by 30 members of the California Congressional delegation, levels claims that the approximately $7.6 billion in Department of Energy grants announced for termination are vindictively selected, pose a risk to the future of the nation's economy, and are potentially unlawful.

""We write to express our outrage at the unlawful cancellation of nearly $8 billion of crucial Department of Energy grants supporting projects which, if reinstated, would make our country’s electric grids, industrial processes, and workforce stronger, safer, and more resilient,"" opened the letter. ""Many of these projects had already begun implementation, and their cancellation abandons hardworking Americans for the sake of cheap, partisan retribution. The DOE’s $7.6 billion in cancellations do not bring our country any closer to American Energy Dominance. Instead, they threaten the country’s progress toward reliable, resilient, and affordable energy for all and undermine thousands of American jobs along the way.""

The announcement of the grant terminations came the day the current government shutdown officially started on Oct. 1 of this year with Russell Vought, the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, dubbing the projects the ""Green New Scam"", a play on the name of a the proposed legislation which inspired the programs -the Green New Deal- that was scaled down significantly prior to passage and is known as the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act.

Monday's letter noted that over $2 billion in funding terminations directly impact projects in California districts represented by Republicans in Congress.

On Oct. 3, California's Senators specifically noted the terminations included California's Alliance for Renewable Clean Hydrogen Energy (ARCHES) Hydrogen Hub, a $1.2 billion public-private hydrogen hub project, funded by the bipartisan Infrastructure Law passed during the Biden Administration.

The program intended to use the $1.2 billion in federal funding to bring together more than 300 organizations across California representing state, county, and city governments; industry; community groups; universities; labor unions; non-governmental organizations; and national labs detailed California's Senior Senator Alex Padilla in 2023.

""This cancellation forgoes an agreement that garnered over $10 billion in primarily private sector cost share, threatens over 200,000 new family-sustaining jobs and undermines a program slated to save nearly $3 billion in health costs per year, improving the health of Americans that have suffered from some of the worst air quality in the nation,"" stated California Governor Gavin Newsom after the announced terminations this month.

The ARCHES hydrogen hub network of public and private groups includes the Central Coast Clean Cities Coalition and The Hydrogen Delivery Company, both located here in Santa Barbara, and two other local projects cited for termination -$2 million for the Community Environmental Council and $8,796,815 for Smartville Inc.- were included in the announced cuts and identified by members of the House Appropriations Committee.

The graphic below, courtesy of the California Governor's Office, showed the industries that would be most impacted by a move towards the use of hydrogen as a fuel source.

The project was expected to create a functioning hydrogen market by 2030 as part of California's roadmap to carbon neutrality by 2045 which included a 1,700-fold increase in the use of hydrogen as a fuel source across multiple sectors.

""For California to meet its goal of net zero emissions by 2045, it must decarbonize its transportation sector, which accounts for 50% of the state’s carbon emissions,"" explained a Master's group project at UC Santa Barbara's Bren School of Environmental Science & Management in 2024. ""However, current electric vehicle batteries are not equipped to suit the needs of larger vehicles, like freight trucks or buses. Green hydrogen, or hydrogen made from renewable electricity and water, can fill this gap. However, green hydrogen is currently produced in lesser quantities than carbon-intensive fuels, such as diesel, making green hydrogen an unaffordable fuel option.""

California's hydrogen project was one of seven nationwide hydrogen generating projects, two of which -California's ARCHES and the Pacific Northwest Hydrogen Hub- were included in the announced cuts on Oct. 1 of this year.

A full list of the seven regional hydrogen hubs are below:

Mid-Atlantic Hydrogen Hub (Mid-Atlantic Clean Hydrogen Hub (MACH2); Pennsylvania, Delaware, New Jersey)

Appalachian Hydrogen Hub (Appalachian Regional Clean Hydrogen Hub (ARCH2); West Virginia, Ohio, Pennsylvania)

California Hydrogen Hub (Alliance for Renewable Clean Hydrogen Energy Systems (ARCHES); California)

Gulf Coast Hydrogen Hub (HyVelocity Hydrogen Hub; Texas)

Heartland Hydrogen Hub (Minnesota, North Dakota, South Dakota)

Midwest Hydrogen Hub (Midwest Alliance for Clean Hydrogen (MachH2); Illinois, Indiana, Michigan)

Pacific Northwest Hydrogen Hub (PNW H2; Washington, Oregon, Montana)

All seven hydrogen hubs nationwide were projected to produce more than three million metric tons of clean hydrogen per year, nearly one-third of the 2030 national production goal while simultaneously eliminating an estimated 25 million metric tons of carbon dioxide emission from end uses each year noted Haris Talwar, Regional Communications Director for the Biden Administration when the projects were detailed in October of 2023.

""California and ARCHES will continue to work with our 400+ partners to develop a renewable hydrogen ecosystem that will enable multiple industries to cost effectively transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy,"" vowed Governor Newsom regarding the termination. ""Greenhouse gas emissions in California are down 20% since 2000 – even as the state’s GDP increased 78% in that same time period all while becoming the world’s fourth largest economy.""

Monday's letter also noted that a total of 79 projects across California are part of the planned terminations including:

$30 million to build long-term energy storage systems for Valley Children's Hospital that serves 1.3 million children in the Central Valley region

$13 million for Liberty Utilities' Leapfrog program to improve energy reliability with an emphasis on rural communities

$500 million for the National Cement Company as part of the Lebec Net-Zero Project that was part of efforts to reduce and capture emissions created by the cement industry

$75 million for the Gallos Glass Project in Modesto that aimed to decarbonize the glass industry

Monday's letter from members of California's Congressional delegation concluded by asking Secretary of Energy Chris Wright and Director Russell Vought of the Office of Management and Budget to restore federal funding, but the fate of California's hydrogen hub is not quite sealed.

""California and ARCHES will continue to work with our 400+ partners to develop a renewable hydrogen ecosystem that will enable multiple industries to cost effectively transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy,"" vowed Governor Newsom earlier this month.

Elisabeth Cremona, Senior Energy Analyst at Ember, opened the flagship session, “Smart Grid of the Future: From Vision to Reality”, underlining that grids have moved from the technical fringes to the political spotlight. Her presentation focused on the security and resilience benefits of grids, particularly interconnections and described how network planning and grid preparedness have become a decisive factor in commercial investment decisions.

“Grids are no longer background infrastructure – they are now central to Europe’s economic growth, security and resilience,” Cremona said.

Three interlinked drivers are shaping the debate:

Growth – Grid capacity is now determining where new industries, data centres and manufacturing hubs are going to be located. Trends in Europe’s data-centre market, valued at $47 billion in 2024 and expected to double by 2030, highlights how network availability has become a critical economic pull factor for the tech industry.

Security – In the past five years, European interconnectors have prevented or mitigated at least three major blackouts, underscoring their role as a resilience mechanism. Cross-border flows between Ukraine and its European neighbours also demonstrates how grid cooperation supports regional security and energy independence during times of geopolitical tensions.

Coordination – Many national projects are technically ready but stalled by regulatory and permitting barriers. The forthcoming European Grid Package (expected by the end of 2025) offers an opportunity to streamline planning, align incentives and secure financing.

Key insights from the Slovak and regional context

Across the two days, discussions covered electricity market reform, grid flexibility, gas security and European cooperation, highlighting a sector where technical progress and policy ambition are increasingly aligned.

Market innovation and flexibility

The session “Innovation and Trends in the Power Market” reflected the rapid transformation of electricity trading. Speakers shared initial experiences with quarter-hourly day-ahead trading in Slovakia and the Czech Republic – a development that improves price accuracy but requires faster data exchange and new forecasting tools.

The Energy Data Centre (EDC) was highlighted as a cornerstone of digitalisation, offering new functionalities for market transparency and supporting the aggregation of flexibility from distributed sources. Energy suppliers described how they are adapting to more dynamic pricing structures and evolving customer behaviour, demonstrating that flexibility is becoming a standard feature of regional electricity markets.

Gas and heat in transition

Panels focused on gas and district heating examined the structural changes underway as Slovakia adapts to reduced Russian gas transit and diversifies supply routes under the RePowerEU framework. Speakers from Eustream, SPP and Veolia argued that although transported volumes are falling, continued maintenance works to ensure pipeline integrity and system reliability remain vital for national and regional energy security.

The debate centred on the financial sustainability of maintaining infrastructure with declining throughput, the pace of EU diversification policy and the balance between security, affordability and decarbonisation.

European cooperation and new platforms

The second day of the conference introduced the European Commission’s Energy Platform for joint purchasing, presented by Maciej Ciszewski (DG ENER). The initiative aims to increase transparency in collective energy procurement, strengthen the EU’s bargaining position and accelerate decarbonisation by coordinating demand across member states. Participants agreed that cross-border coordination and shared data frameworks will be essential to Europe’s next phase of energy integration.

Shared direction

Taken together, the sessions at ENERGOFÓRUM 2025 demonstrated how digitalisation, diversification and cooperation are shaping Central Europe’s energy systems. Market innovation enables finer control and more efficient trading, gas and heat operators are redefining resilience in a changing geopolitical context and European institutions are building new tools for coordinated procurement and planning.

The conference captured a region in transition – pragmatic, data-driven and increasingly aligned with Europe’s wider energy objectives, yet still managing the realities of its fossil-based legacy.",https://ember-energy.org/app/uploads/2025/10/energoforum-01.jpg,N,,2025-10-23 17:20:24.261794

Now, It Could Lower Energy Bills - Honolulu Civil Beat",Stewart Yerton,,,,,https://www.civilbeat.org/2025/10/hawaii-balked-at-natural-gas-now-it-could-lower-energy-bills/,"For more than a decade, natural gas was off the table as an energy source for Hawaiʻi, following former Gov.
Natural gas is cheaper and burns more cleanly than oil, but can’t be shipped or sent by pipeline to Hawaiʻi.
JERA would benefit by selling natural gas to HECO, Hawaiʻi Gas and shipping companies to power vessels, Yonamine said.

He acknowledged leaks during natural gas mining and transportation — part of so-called life-cycle emissions — can create greenhouse gas emissions worse than burning oil.","Critics say an agreement between the state and a Japanese energy firm lacks details and could bind Hawaiʻi to using fossil fuel to produce electricity.

For more than a decade, natural gas was off the table as an energy source for Hawaiʻi, following former Gov. David Ige’s edict that trying to import natural gas would distract the state from its mandated goal of producing 100% of its electricity with renewables by 2045.

Now Gov. Josh Green is bringing natural gas back, a move his team says will lower carbon emissions and electric bills for residents while moving the state toward its renewables goal.

A tentative agreement between Green’s office and Tokyo-based JERA Co. Inc reached last week would bring liquefied natural gas to Hawaiʻi. It would also unlock a $2 billion investment into Hawaiʻi’s energy system — nearly equal to the market value of Hawaiian Electric Co.’s parent company, Hawaiian Electric Industries, which was valued at $2.03 billion as of Wednesday.

It’s the biggest proposed energy deal since NextEra Energy unsuccessfully tried to take over Hawaiian Electric Industries in 2016.

If it goes through, the investment would make JERA a major player in Hawaiʻi, expanding business ties between the islands and Japan, a major tourism market and ancestral home of almost a quarter of Hawaiʻi residents. And it would transform Hawaiʻi’s energy economy.

The proposed deal comes as the Trump administration has expressed hostility to state renewable energy mandates, and renewables in general, while supporting the U.S. liquefied natural gas industry. In June, the U.S. Department of the Interior announced four 20-year agreements under which JERA will purchase up to 5.5 million tons per year of LNG from U.S. suppliers.

The agreements “underscore President Trump’s efforts to unleash American LNG production and the significant role the U.S. LNG industry plays in strengthening the U.S. economy,” the Interior Department said in a news release.

Green traveled to Washington on Wednesday to meet with the U.S. secretaries of energy and the interior, as well as top officials of other agencies, including the military.

“These meetings will support Hawai‘i’s ongoing transition to clean energy,” among other things, the governor’s office said in a news release.

JERA’s six-page, non-binding agreement with Hawaiʻi calls for the company to pay for fuel-flexible infrastructure with the goal of starting with liquefied natural gas — a fossil fuel — and transitioning to renewables such as hydrogen by 2045.

Opening the door to LNG in Hawaiʻi wouldn’t need legislative approval. But anticipated regulatory changes would have to go through the Public Utilities Commission, and projects would be subject to environmental reviews and permitting. HECO would also have to be a major player.

Environmentalists have expressed opposition to the effort. Hawaiʻi Rep. Nicole Lowen, who chairs the House Energy and Environmental Protection Committee, is calling for more details.

The agreement includes nearly two pages of clauses laying out things like challenges Hawaiʻi faces, JERA’s status as a global energy company positioned to help Hawaiʻi reach its goals and estimated cost savings to residents. Actual terms of the non-binding agreement were limited to three pages, leaving people like Lowen at a loss to comment.

“They have to stop talking in these big generalizations and get real and put something on the table,” she said.

Mark Glick, who heads the Hawaiʻi State Energy Office as the state’s Chief Energy Officer, said a more detailed preliminary analysis is expected by year’s end.

Green Renews Idea Blocked By Predecessor

Renewable resources such as large-scale solar and onshore wind farms have emerged as the least expensive ways to produce electricity, and the cost of battery storage systems has also declined in recent years. By law, Hawaiʻi must transition entirely to such renewables by 2045.

In the meantime, the state relies heavily on generators that burn oil, which can be shipped to the state.

Natural gas is cheaper and burns more cleanly than oil, but can’t be shipped or sent by pipeline to Hawaiʻi. LNG producers super-cool natural gas into a liquid, which can be shipped to users, then turned back into gas at offshore terminals and sent onshore by pipelines.

Former Gov. Neil Abercrombie had been open to using LNG. But former Gov. David Ige took it off the table by fiat in 2015, saying it would distract Hawaiʻi from meeting its 2045 renewables mandate.

LNG came on the table earlier this year, when Green’s State Energy Office issued a study in January highlighting the possibility of using LNG as a transition or bridge fuel. The study identified LNG as a lower-cost, low-emission, short-term alternative to oil, which could be replaced later by hydrogen when such fuel becomes feasible.

The study came out the same month Green issued an executive order supporting renewables.

A few months later, in a speech at the Hawaiʻi Energy Conference in May, Green said LNG had to be part of the mix.

The Green administration had held talks with JERA as early as 2023 when the U.S. Department of Energy had announced plans to create seven regional hydrogen hubs in the U.S., Glick said. The governor had been introduced to the company by Central Pacific Bank Chairman Emeritus Paul Yonamine, a booster of building business ties between Hawaiʻi and Japan who is also a volunteer advisor to Green on Japan affairs.

Hawaiʻi wasn’t the right place for a hydrogen hub, Glick said, but JERA came back over the summer of 2023 to discuss LNG.

“I wasn’t particularly excited at that time,” Glick said, but he asked for more information.

JERA came back later that year — about two months after the Maui wildfires, which had dealt a devastating financial blow to HECO and created the specter of massive liability for the company and potential bankruptcy. JERA said it was interested in investing in HECO, helping to help cover potential liability HECO faced as part of an overall LNG plan, Glick said.

While Yonamine had made the introduction to JERA, it was the details of JERA’s plan that interested the energy office, Glick said.

“Post-Lahaina, it became much more serious interest,” Glick said. “And we looked at it in a whole different light.”

‘This Will Create A Savings’

The serious interest became an agreement-in-principle with the “Strategic Partnership Agreement,” which Green’s office made public last week.

The agreement anticipates a new procurement process and energy grid modifications aligned for LNG. It also envisions five modernized, fuel-flexible generators being built or updated on Oʻahu. The idea is the generators will be able to use multiple fuels, including LNG and renewables like biodiesel and hydrogen after 2045, Glick said. The cost of at least some of these conversions, Glick said, can be built into existing customer electricity rates.

“LNG is just meant to be a bridge to get us using modernized equipment, not 70-year-old, inefficient power plants,” Glick said.

The agreement proposes that JERA would invest up to $2 billion for LNG infrastructure, including an offshore terminal and pipelines. JERA would benefit by selling natural gas to HECO, Hawaiʻi Gas and shipping companies to power vessels, Yonamine said.

He stressed that there’s no intent for JERA to be Hawaiʻi’s exclusive natural gas supplier.

“The price has to be right,” he said. But Yonamine said that given JERA’s position as a major LNG producer, the company “could provide LNG at the best price for users.”

Using lower-cost fuel will more than offset expenditures on equipment and infrastructure, Glick said.

“The intention is this will create a savings,” he said.

Concerns About Current Renewables Program

HECO’s spokesperson expressed tempered optimism about the deal, but said any final agreement must align with the utility’s current efforts to modernize its existing grid and encourage big, third-party wind- and solar-farm developers to continue to invest in Hawaiʻi.

“We thought it was a great idea 15 years ago,” said Jim Kelly, HECO’s vice president for government and community relations and corporate communications. “It was our idea to begin with. It’s great that the governor is revisiting this and looking at options.”

Still, Kelly raised numerous questions that the agreement doesn’t answer. The state Public Utilities Commission and HECO already administer a robust procurement regime in which wind, solar and battery storage companies submit proposals to build big projects, from which HECO agrees to buy power under long-term, PUC-approved contracts.

Likewise, HECO is going through the process of creating a new, comprehensive plan to update its grid to handle the new power sources.

It’s unclear, Kelly said, how the JERA agreement would fit into that.

The deal would require a closer look at grid planning to make sure what’s envisioned complements what HECO is already doing, Kelly said. Also requiring a close look is any spending needed to upgrade power generators, which Kelly said is highly regulated.

Glick said the programs proposed under the JERA deal won’t affect current renewables procurement or grid planning.

New procurement regulations mentioned in the agreement, Glick said, are needed to make sure the state can move forward with public-private partnerships in the complex projects the agreement envisions.

Glick commended HECO’s current grid work. But, he said, “What we’ve seen is they’re capital constrained.”

JERA’s capital can change that, he said.

Glick pointed to the state’s mandate to decarbonize its transportation system by 2045, which will massively increase demand for electricity by 2045, when the grid must be powered entirely by renewables.

“Obviously, Hawaiian Electric is looking at that as well,” Glick said. “But, you know, frankly, to ensure that we can grow and have enough generation capacity to be able to handle that, we need to really look at all of the possible opportunities, particularly if there are capital constraints.”

Lowen, the House energy committee chair and a major player concerning Hawaiʻi’s energy policy, said the agreement was too vague to comment on in detail.

“They’re way ahead of themselves,” she said. “First, they need to put a project on the table: What are they proposing, and what’s the cost of it?”

Only then would Hawaiʻi utility regulators, as well as the Hawaiʻi Consumer Advocate, which represents rate-payers in matters before the PUC, be able to weigh in. That’s part of the process of approving new projects and regulatory changes, Lowen noted.

“I think we should all have an open mind to consider whatever is being proposed,” Lowen said. “But my suspicion would be that it would be quite expensive, and not necessarily to the benefit of the people of Hawai‘i.”

Environmentalists say they don’t need to know more. They’re adamantly opposed.

Wayne Tanaka, director of the Sierra Club’s Hawaiʻi chapter, pointed to safety concerns, including a 2004 accident at a production facility in Algeria in which 27 people were killed.

He also pointed to operational problems that have shut down offshore regasification facilities for months.

While LNG might burn more cleanly than oil, it is worse, Tanaka said, when factoring in leaks in the production and transportation of the fuel.

In addition, he said, there are questions about costs, which he said could balloon and be passed to consumers. He described the idea of creating a whole new LNG infrastructure as “the Honolulu rail of utilities.”

Finally, Tanaka pointed to the vision of transitioning from LNG to hydrogen in 2045. Current technology simply doesn’t allow it, he said, meaning Hawaiʻi could be stuck with LNG past the 2045 deadline.

“That’s my major concern,” he said. “There’s no end to the bridge.”

Japan Is ‘All In’ On Hydrogen

Glick said LNG is relatively safe. Terminals are located miles offshore, far from people. And he said natural gas poses a relatively low risk of explosions because it’s lighter than air and dissipates quickly.

Glick acknowledged emissions related to natural gas can make it worse than oil. He acknowledged leaks during natural gas mining and transportation — part of so-called life-cycle emissions — can create greenhouse gas emissions worse than burning oil. But it depends on the locale and regulations in those places, Glick said.

“Some people have sort of cherry-picked instances where it’s definitely worse, and they sort of cite those and say, ‘Well, this is really bad,’” Glick said. “And you know, no one will disagree that it can be really bad.”

But, he said, that’s not always the case. He pointed to British Columbia, Australia and some places in Mexico as examples where environmental protections prevent leakages.

The bottom line, he said, is that using LNG can reduce life-cycle carbon emissions by 50% or more compared with Hawaiʻi’s current practice of burning oil.

“What we’re doing now is extremely bad,” he said. “We’re the most carbon-intensive state in the nation.”

When it comes to hydrogen, Glick said, nobody can predict what the emerging leader in renewable fuels will be in 2045.

Yonamine agreed there are no guarantees. But he said an indication of the fuel’s promise is Japan’s all-out effort to power its economy with hydrogen by 2050.

“The Japanese are banking on this,” said Yonamine, a former president of IBM’s Japan operations. “They’re all in on this.”

Nearly 1 in every 3 cars sold in Colorado from July 1 to Sept. 30 were electric vehicles, according to a state news release. Electric vehicles have made up 27.3% of all sales so far into 2025, with electric vehicle registrations in the state surpassing 210,000. These third-quarter numbers mark the highest single-quarter percentage of sales in the country.

This comes after the end to federal support for electric vehicles at the start of this month, when Congress’ passing of the “one big, beautiful bill” ended federal electric vehicle tax credits that were supposed to continue until the end of 2032. The Clean Vehicle Credit provided a tax discount worth up to $7,500.

Colorado continues to offer incentives for electric vehicle buyers, with rebates for purchasing or leasing an electric vehicle increasing from $6,000 to $9,000 for new vehicles and $4,000 to $6,000 for used ones through the Vehicle Exchange Colorado program beginning Nov. 3.

Depending on the price of the vehicle, Colorado taxpayers can be eligible for up to $6,000 in state tax credit for the purchase or lease of electric vehicles through the end of 2025, after which the base state tax credit will be reduced due to ongoing budget shortfalls in the state’s general fund.

“The transportation sector has long been the hardest to decarbonize so we are grateful that so many Coloradans are making the transition to EVs, but these numbers shouldn’t be surprising, as EVs represent great value and are just plain fun to drive,” Colorado Energy Office Executive Director Will Toor said in the release.

Earlier this month, Colorado received federal approval for the final $12 million of its $56.5 million in funding from the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Program . To date, the state has awarded nearly $25.6 million in program funding to support 246 fast-charging ports along major transportation routes across the state.

Colorado’s charging network currently includes more than 5,000 Level 2 ports and more than 1,400 fast-charging ports across the state.

“Moving forward, we are confident that, despite federal headwinds, this trend will continue as more people experience the joy and convenience of driving an EV, and we keep on building out our EV charging infrastructure in both urban and rural areas, which make it easy to power up your EV no matter where you are in the state,” Todd said.",https://swiftmedia.s3.amazonaws.com/mountain.swiftcom.com/images/sites/5/2025/10/23141112/CAP-atd-100818-2.jpg,N,,2025-10-23 17:19:58.404972

Many have compared the resulting environmental damage to the catastrophic 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill.

The leak occurred at an underground gas storage facility northwest of Los Angeles and went on for over 100 days before eventually being plugged.

By that time, thousands of residents were displaced from their homes and reported experiencing severe nose bleeds, headaches and other health impacts. Studies on the longer term health impacts of the disaster are still ongoing, but a recent study indicated that pregnant women living near the facility were significantly more likely to have babies with low birth weight. Meanwhile the climate impact of the gas emitted during the leak is similar to that of a large European country’s annual greenhouse gas emissions.

The gas company responsible for the leak ultimately agreed to pay out over $1 billion to settle lawsuits regulated to the damages. The facility has remained in operation in order to meet the region’s energy demands but with new regulations to help prevent another incident. Will it be enough?

The leak exposed significant vulnerabilities in the way the United States’ natural gas system is managed — drawing attention to both the impacts of mega leaks at storage facilities, as well as to the millions of smaller leaks occurring everyday across the entire natural gas supply chain.

So what has changed since the leak drew international attention to the methane problem?

New rules for gas storage, but largely on the industry’s terms

The Aliso Canyon gas storage facility is not unique. It’s one of 400 facilities across the country that store about half of the country’s natural gas. For many years, there was effectively no federal oversight and only minimal state oversight of these facilities, which has had fatal consequences.

The international attention generated by the Aliso Canyon gas leak triggered the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration to adopt new recommended practices, developed by industry, for gas storage sites in 2017. And in fact, earlier this month, PHMSA adopted industry’s updated recommended practices for gas storage, which feature significantly improved risk management and emergency response planning — good news worth celebrating.

However, because even these improved practices were originally written as voluntary industry best practices and not meant to act as regulation, they can be vague, ambiguous and difficult to enforce. And the recommended practices are not easily accessible since industry groups charge a fee to view them online. PHMSA should make access to these recommended practices publicly available. And its critical that it develops and enforces more comprehensive regulations for gas storage facilities to reduce risks to our health and our environment.

Further, the underlying law giving PHMSA authority to oversee gas storage creates an arbitrary bifurcation in safety regulations. States have the ability to go beyond PHMSA standards for facilities that store gas for use in that state, but can’t apply those same standards to a facility if that gas is sent elsewhere. There’s essentially no difference in the operations of these interstate vs. intrastate facilities — they all can experience single points of failure leading to catastrophic blowouts. In fact there are some 17,000 wells that feed these storage sites and, as they age and corrode, many are at risk of failing. While it’s good that there are improved federal guidelines for safer gas storage, it’s clear we still need a more coherent plan for upgrading facilities and managing these long term risks.

It’s unclear whether any of that will happen anytime soon. Under the Trump Administration, PHMSA has been hemorrhaging staff. There are nearly 50 job vacancies in the department, including key experts and people at leadership levels, and enforcement actions have plummeted to record lows. Without staff and resources, it’s highly unlikely the agency will be able to achieve its mission of protecting people and the environment from the risks associated with energy transport and storage.

More scrutiny on methane – for now

Since the leak, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has also made significant progress to limit leaks at hundreds of thousands of oil and gas production sites across the country. Cumulatively, emissions from the oil and gas industry add millions of tons of methane and other toxic smog-forming and cancer-causing pollutants into the atmosphere each year. Studies have revealed that unchecked pollution from oil and gas facilities has caused thousands of premature deaths, asthma attacks and hospitalizations and are responsible for over $77 billion in annual health costs. Over the past decade, leaky equipment and other wasteful operations at oil and gas facilities have led to nearly 90 million metric tons of wasted gas.

While some states have led on efforts to address oil and gas methane pollution (California, Colorado, New Mexico and Pennsylvania) many states have not yet adopted cost-effective practices that can reduce energy waste and save lives. And despite the known health and environmental impacts, as well as the massive waste of American energy resources, the Trump Administration is attempting to demolish these federal methane protections and has even said it will no longer track greenhouse gas emissions altogether.

Want to take action? The deadline to provide public comments regarding proposed changes to the EPA’s Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program is open through Nov. 3, 2025.

In the decade since the Aliso Canyon disaster, oil and gas companies have demonstrated that controlling emissions isn’t just feasible, it’s economical. EDF estimates that since the first oil and gas emissions regulations went into effect in 2012, companies have saved around $2.6 billion worth of natural gas — demonstrating that with the right practices, it’s possible to safely and economically manage methane as we transition to safer forms of energy.

As super storms, wildfires and other severe climate impacts wreak havoc on communities across the globe, the anniversary of one of the worst emissions events in our nation’s history, and the actions that have unfolded since, should serve as a reminder that controlling methane is crucial for our climate, for energy security and our health.",https://blogs.edf.org/energyexchange/wp-content/blogs.dir/38/files//aliso-blog-thumbnail.jpg,N,,2025-10-23 18:00:04.700844

Key Developments

Foley & Lardner partners Vanessa Miller and Mark Aiello share insights on the challenges and potential of autonomous vehicles (AVs) in their ITS International article, “Rise of the Transformers.”

Foley & Lardner’s “Made in America: End-to-End Guide to Developing Your U.S. Manufacturing Footprint” series delves into the critical decisions U.S. manufacturers face as they rethink where and how they build. The most recent article in the series is Clearing the Path: Environmental Permitting in the Era of Renewed American Manufacturing.

Foley & Lardner partner Gregory Husisian shared insights on the Trump administration’s reliance on alternative trade measures as the U.S. Supreme Court reviews the use of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) to impose tariffs in the SupplyChainDive article, “What tools does Trump have to impose tariffs?”

An October 17 executive order announced 25% tariffs on medium- and heavy-duty trucks and parts, as well as 10% tariffs on buses, will take effect November 1, 2025 in response to a Section 232 national security investigation. The same order includes an extension of certain tariff relief programs for automakers until 2030, as well as new provisions to offset the cost of certain duties related to engine production and certain steel and aluminum duties. “Automobile manufacturers may apply to the [Commerce] Secretary for an import adjustment offset amount equal to 3.75 percent of the aggregate Manufacturer’s Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) value of all automobiles assembled in the United States by the manufacturer, as determined annually by the Secretary, from April 5, 2025, through April 30, 2030.”

A number of automakers and trade groups including the Alliance for Automotive Innovation and the German Association of the Automotive Industry (VDA) have warned of the risk of semiconductor supply disruptions after chipmaker Nexperia halted shipments due to a Dutch government takeover from its Chinese owner.

Ford temporarily cut production of at least five models, and Stellantis will temporarily idle its Warren Truck Assembly plant, due to a fire at a significant aluminum supplier.

Suppliers expressed more pessimism about the outlook for the industry than automakers and dealers in the latest Automotive News Auto Industry Confidence Index.

Global automakers could collectively incur a $30 billion reduction in 2025 operating profits because of import tariffs, according to analysis released this month from Moody’s Ratings.

China’s rare earths exports fell 31% in September 2025 from August. This preceded the imposition of new restrictions on Chinese exports of rare earths and other critical materials due to national security concerns. China produces roughly 90% of the global refined supply of rare-earth minerals.

Mexican lawmakers postponed discussions until late November concerning a proposal to impose tariffs of up to 50% on vehicles, steel and other products imported from China and other nations with which it lacks a trade agreement.

OEMs/Suppliers

GM is expected to be the only U.S. automaker with a notable direct supply of American-made rare-earth magnets due to the automaker’s previous efforts to reduce reliance on Chinese exports by securing long-term purchase agreements with new suppliers.

Stellantis will invest $13 billion in U.S. manufacturing by the end of the decade, in an initiative that is expected to increase domestic production by 50% and add more than 5,000 jobs across plants in Michigan, Illinois, Indiana and Ohio. The automaker recently announced the return of Mauro Pino to oversee North American manufacturing operations.

BorgWarner indicated it is seeing rising interest in range-extender architectures in certain markets.

Daimler Truck and Toyota Motor will combine their Japanese truck units into a new joint company, ARCHION Holdings, that is scheduled to begin operations in April 2026.

Linamar will acquire the North American assets of Aludyne Inc. for $300 million, in a deal that is expected to significantly expand Linamar’s manufacturing footprint in the region.

Market Trends and Regulatory

Kelley Blue Book analysis indicates the U.S. new-vehicle average transaction price (ATP) rose 3.6% year-over-year in September 2025, and surpassed $50,000 for the first time.

Since 2010, the average auto loan balance has risen 57% and delinquencies have increased by more than 50%, according to a study published this month by VantageScore.

The portion of subprime auto loans that are 60 days or more overdue on payments hit a record of more than 6% this year, according to Fitch Ratings.

Ford will recall nearly 1.5 million vehicles in the U.S. due to the risk of rearview camera malfunctions.

AlixPartners estimated automotive factories in Europe are running at 55% capacity on average amid market challenges that include heightened competition from Chinese automakers and reduced consumer demand. The consultancy also predicted that up to eight automotive plants in the EU may face closure in the years ahead.

Global aluminum supplies are projected to enter a deficit beginning between 2027 and 2028, according to predictions from Citi and Wood Mackenzie.

China’s vehicle exports for the first nine months of 2025 were up 14.8% year-over-year, and domestic vehicle sales rose 7.8% YOY for the same period.

Proposed regulations in China would require all passenger vehicles sold domestically to have “mechanical door releases accessible from both inside and outside the car.” This follows concerns over the risk of malfunction of electronically-operated car door handles.

Autonomous Technologies and Vehicle Software

Waymo announced plans to enter the European market with the launch of robotaxi service in London next year.

Lyft Inc. will partner with autonomous vehicle developer Tensor Auto to deploy a fleet of hundreds of robotaxis in North America and Europe beginning in 2027.

GM plans to debut “eyes-off” highway driving capabilities on the Cadillac Escalade IQ in 2028.

Stellantis will partner with Pony AI to gradually roll out robotaxi services in certain European cities in 2026, beginning with testing in Luxembourg in the coming months.

Hybrid and Electric Vehicles

Automotive News provided an update on canceled or postponed U.S. EV models.

Tesla’s third quarter 2025 net income fell 37% year-over-year to $1.37 billion, and total revenue increased 12% YOY to a record-high $28 billion.

GM reported a one-time $1.6 billion charge in Q3 2025 resulting from a “strategic realignment” in EV manufacturing capacity, as well as “contract cancellation fees and commercial settlements associated with EV-related investments.” The automaker recently extended temporary layoffs for 280 workers until early 2026 due to a temporary shutdown at its Factory Zero EV plant in Detroit-Hamtramck that affects production of the GMC Hummer EV and Cadillac Escalade IQ.

GM has recently canceled programs and initiatives that include production of the BrightDrop electric commercial van produced at its CAMI Assembly plant in Ontario, the expansion of a joint venture battery materials plant in Quebec, and the HYDROTEC hydrogen fuel cell development program, which included a planned $55 million hydrogen plant with Piston Automotive in Detroit.

Ford delayed a lithium supply deal with Australia’s Liontown Resources Ltd. and reduced scheduled volumes by half.

A number of battery companies that attended The Battery Show North America this month in Detroit emphasized opportunities in energy storage systems amid the expectation for muted EV demand, while expressing concerns over the supply chain ramifications of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act’s foreign entity of concern (FEOC) eligibility restrictions to the 45X advanced manufacturing production tax credit.

GM announced the all-electric 2027 Chevrolet Bolt will begin shipping to customers in the first quarter of 2026.

,EVs,2025-10-23 20:11:28+00:00,Battery Technology,X-Ray Tech Prevents EV Battery Fires Before They Start,Joe Darrah,,,,,https://www.batterytechonline.com/testing-safety/x-ray-vision-for-ev-batteries-how-inner-s-technology-stops-fires-before-they-start,"Today, INNER is helping to put out battery fires in electronic vehicles (EVs) before they even start, through an X-ray/computed tomography modality that can see evidence of abnormalities by detecting underlying internal physical faults during battery pack assembly line production.
The hidden crisis in EV battery safety Statistics from the National Transportation Safety Board and other analysts show that the rate of fires in gasoline-powered automobiles and hybrid-powered cars is significantly higher than they are in EVs.
""A lot of these pack diagnostics are sensor-based, partial to software, and are attempts at prediction when the pack is already built,"" she explained.
""We want to offer the ability to help along the life of the battery pack,"" said Steinberg.
Reutilizing EV batteries is the most sensible thing to do.","Without appropriate diagnostics, many recycled batteries could go to waste, while batteries that are in use will cause accidents. In June 2024, a fire at a South Korean plant killed more than 20 people and injured others. In a more recent incident, residents were evacuated from an apartment complex when an EV fire spread to multiple vehicles parked in an underground lot.

""It's a phenomenon that needs to be stopped,"" says Efrat Avnet Steinberg, co-founder and chief executive officer at INNER, a startup diagnostics company based in the Netherlands. ""And it's not just about the actual fires. It's also about improving the length of battery life and the impact on sustainability. The simple fact is that it's extremely hard to repair batteries today. Because if a battery goes bad along its life, you're really looking in the dark.""

Today, INNER is helping to put out battery fires in electronic vehicles (EVs) before they even start, through an X-ray/computed tomography modality that can see evidence of abnormalities by detecting underlying internal physical faults during battery pack assembly line production.

A solution that sought a problem

The solution had already been identified. Steinberg and her partners just needed to find the right problem. It was 2023, and the INNER team had acquired a breakthrough technology that was intended to alleviate the size constraints associated with the development of traditional X-ray machines. Because detector arrays are typically built using large, fragile silicon wafers, most X-ray devices are not known for their scalability when it comes to larger dimensions, and development comes at a high cost. Although X-ray has been a great benefit to the healthcare industry for more than a century, and its application for industrial use continues to grow, its utilization remains limited compared to its capabilities. But with detectors utilizing complementary off-the-shelf metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) chips, as opposed to silicon wafers, INNER had in its hands a patented design of modular components that were more suitable for device versatility at a lower cost. Following a previously successful commercial launch of a static imaging detector for the medical veterinary field, it was time to do more with their inherited technology, which was acquired from Israel-based company Cmosaix Ltd.

""We were looking for a problem that the world could not solve with the use of the large detectors,"" said Steinberg. ""Because we knew that we had something unique with this product. We started a long investigation route [across many industries]. And when we began talking to automakers, it was immediately clear that we had found the problem that nobody else seemed to be able to solve at that point.""

The hidden crisis in EV battery safety

Statistics from the National Transportation Safety Board and other analysts show that the rate of fires in gasoline-powered automobiles and hybrid-powered cars is significantly higher than they are in EVs. According to data recorded in 2022, only 25 fires occur per 100,000 EV sales compared to approximately 1,530 fires in gas cars and 3,475 fires in hybrids per 100,000 vehicles on the road. Still, the risk of EV battery fires creates significant concerns around costs and safety, as these types of fires are said to be more difficult to extinguish for a variety of reasons, including thermal runaway chain reactions among neighboring cells that increase fire spread and the tendency for more toxic gases to be released during an EV blaze. Recent estimates by U.S. News & World Report project that by 2030, 1.2 million end-of-life batteries will be recycled annually to meet demand.

Additionally, the impact of recalls that can be necessary in the event of defects continues to add to the financial burden despite the relatively low fire incidence rate.

The methodology used at INNER to detect battery anomalies is akin to the push for why today's healthcare industry conducts earlier screenings – whereby preventative measures are proving to be valuable investments thanks to improved diagnostics. ""We're able to combine an analysis of the battery's State of Health, State of Charge, and State of Integrity for the first time to give a full, complete understanding of the state of each battery,"" said Steinberg. ""This is exactly what the industry has needed to be able to really rely on batteries as a source of energy storage long term.""

X-Ray vision into battery packs

From a functionality perspective, the imaging devices operate similarly to how they do within healthcare settings: an X-ray tube emits radiation to the detector, which translates the radiation into visible light within images of the scanned object. A cross-section of images is taken by CT to view batteries from multiple angles and depths for a more detailed, comprehensive assessment. ""We're using a type of CT known as laminography to get to points in the battery where we can really penetrate,"" said Steinberg. The devices are configured in a modular fashion that can be adapted to have packs of different sizes placed within the container at the end of any production line. With the aid of automated artificial intelligence (AI)-based algorithms, evaluations are conducted in minutes and can reveal blemishes that could otherwise be weeks or perhaps months away from causing complications.

According to Steinberg, too often the electrical measures utilized today to assess batteries cannot accurately diagnose the very well-known types of problems, such as anode-cathode overhang, delaminations, torn wires, and tap defects. ""And this is where, if the pack was transparent and you could look inside it, you would see these details and correct something that has gone wrong,"" Steinberg said. ""If a battery overheats, you want to know about it. If a battery emits gas, you want to know about it. The problem is that when the temperature rises, or gas is evaporated, or something in the voltage or the current changes, it might be too late. There's a need to know about these problems long before. Because a failure will happen.""

In these situations, Steinberg says the INNER X-ray/CT scanner has the ability to examine such details to potentially avoid the consequences of recalls and/or repairs. ""The processes to repair batteries today are extremely manual,"" she said. ""You need to open the pack and, by doing so, you're actually destroying a huge part of the components. Many times, batteries are recycled, which is great. But recycling should happen after 15 or 20 years. When that happens after five years, it's ridiculous.""

Beyond detection, AI-powered analysis at production speed

Another key differentiator about INNER's strategy is that diagnostics are performed for the battery pack as a whole, which runs adjacent to the work of cell analysis diagnostics and is more advanced than many of the evolving diagnostics for battery packs in recent years, says Steinberg. ""A lot of these pack diagnostics are sensor-based, partial to software, and are attempts at prediction when the pack is already built,"" she explained. ""There's a lot of information gathered, but none of that is really based on visualization of the concrete problem that is already within the battery. We're actually seeing what's happening in the battery to be sure of exactly what the issue is. What is the size of the problem? What is the exact location? It's empowering to do something about it on time, before it's too late. And our goal is not to open and break the packs into their components. Because that is the most efficient way.""

The deep-tech technologies within the scanners can detect internal faults down to 50-100 microns, a key feature to meet growing demands and high-throughput workflows of battery pack assembly in the automotive space, says Steinberg. ""There will naturally be no need to disassemble the battery packs, and we will never slow down the production line,"" she said. ""Our goal is to fit the throughput and the high pace.""

Beyond the hardware aspects, there's an abundance of analysis happening behind the scenes. ""We're talking about terabytes of data, and we're looking for failures that are 50 microns in size — so the processing, which is extremely challenging, is also part of our proprietary software,"" said Steinberg. ""We're measuring, flagging, classifying, and reporting. It's equal parts of our innovation and the core of our technology.""

With the assistance of AI, the analytics are primarily focused on pattern recognition with agnostic technology intended to observe irregularities within masses of data. ""And to do that in a reality where every single battery uses different types of chemistry, where there's a huge variety in cell formations, we are able to detect faults in every single one of those variations,"" said Steinberg.

Reports are generated when analysis is complete, with all image analysis completed by INNER software. If no problems are found, production can be finalized. When scans uncover issues, an alert is generated to remove the affected batteries so that any potential repairs can be completed. If there's a systematic problem revealed, there's an opportunity to make corrections that ensure future batteries are produced without default.

""And because we've designed the process to fit the automaker's throughput, there are no bottlenecks,"" said Steinberg. ""There's nothing that you need to actually change in your behavior.""

A startup with no end in sight

The vision behind the design of the technology and the overall process is meant to connect with industry at important product cycle touchpoints — analysis at assembly, during times of recall, when used EVs are purchased, and for a battery's second life. ""We want to offer the ability to help along the life of the battery pack,"" said Steinberg. ""Having a green, energy-based world relies upon batteries to be used in stationary applications as well. Sending energy back to the grid is not always possible. Reutilizing EV batteries is the most sensible thing to do. You just need to make sure the battery is safe and that there's no cracks, swelling, leakages, or anything growing in there that would put lives in danger.""",https://eu-images.contentstack.com/v3/assets/bltb299798942522069/bltf84bc3c4bf772ff4/667981df3d282a36eef709bf/Aricell-fire-2158458957.jpg?disable=upscale&width=1200&height=630&fit=crop,N,,2025-10-23 19:19:14.722758

If buying solar panels is not for you, leasing them is an option to lock in low energy rates.","Much of the conversation about the changing climate is doom and gloom. In one way, it's appropriate: Rapidly rising global temperatures are causing myriad extreme problems. In another, it's not: There are plenty of reasons to be hopeful.

Journalist Bill McKibben is an expert on the topic, and he has become a leading proponent of climate action in the United States. In a conversation with Yale Climate Connections, he talked about his work and the developments that are ushering in a clean energy future.

In his latest book, Here Comes the Sun, McKibben details the advantages of solar and wind power and the promise of worldwide equitable energy access. He told YCC that China, earlier this year, was installing 3 gigawatts of solar power every day, which he compared to ""a coal-fired power plant every eight hours."" He noted that there has been a similar upswing in Pakistan, powered by everyday people.

""I've watched what has happened over the last year when a flood of very cheap Chinese solar panels enabled Pakistanis to essentially remake their country's electric grid,"" McKibben said. ""They built the equivalent of half the country's electric grid in eight months just using TikTok videos to put together solar panels.""

He added that solar is the only thing that could be scaled quickly enough to cut off the flow of heat-trapping gases into Earth's atmosphere.

Installing panels at home is the best way to save money on energy costs, and EnergySage offers free tools to get quick installation estimates and compare quotes. With the help of the independent clean energy adviser, the average person can save up to $10,000 on a solar system.

The federal government is also offering tax credits of 30% of the cost of projects. However, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act will end this incentive on Dec. 31. EnergySage has a mapping tool that shows the average cost of a solar setup as well as details on incentives for each state.

If buying solar panels is not for you, leasing them is an option to lock in low energy rates. Through Palmetto's LightReach program, you can get a solar system for no money down. Pairing panels with other electric appliances, such as an efficient heat pump, can drive utility costs even lower, and Mitsubishi can help you find the right unit and installer.

McKibben said the Trump administration, as well as the high cost of solar panels and varying regulations, were impediments the U.S. must overcome. Changing the conversation would help show people how affordable and efficient solar energy is. In the footsteps of those in European and African countries, Americans could put aside ""absurd excuses"" such as aesthetic preferences and fully embrace cleaner, cheaper, renewable energy.

""This is our chance. Not to stop global warming, too late for that, but to stop it perhaps short of the place where it cuts civilization off at the knees,"" he said.

Demand peaked for the summer at 26,586 megawatts (MW) on June 24 between 5 and 6 p.m., when the regional average temperature was 97° Fahrenheit (F) and the dew point, a measure of humidity, was 67°F. The peak exceeded ISO New England’s forecast for above-average summer conditions. It was also significantly higher than last year’s summer peak of 24,871 MW on July 16, 2024, when the temperature was 91°F and the dew point was 70°F.

For the summer as a whole, temperatures averaged 70.6°F, or 0.5°F above normal. New Englanders consumed about 3% less electricity — 32,470 gigawatt-hours (GWh) in June, July, and August of 2025 versus 33,305 GWh during the same period in 2024.

Wholesale energy prices increased year-over-year, largely due to higher natural gas prices.

Reserve shortage prompts charges

Heat and humidity, high demand, and some unexpected generation reductions and outages left the region short of the resources needed to maintain required operating reserves for more than three hours around the evening peak on June 24. Power continued to flow throughout the region without interruption despite the reserve shortage. The event triggered approximately $97.1 million in charges under the capacity market’s Pay-for-Performance rules.

The rest of the summer proceeded without incident. The ISO did issue a precautionary alert July 16 in anticipation of tight system conditions during another stretch of hot, humid weather. But system conditions remained stable, and the alert was lifted the following night.

June 24’s peak demand (26,586 MW) was the region’s sixth highest summer peak since at least the year 2000. The highest summer peak before that (27,379 MW) was on July 19, 2013, when the temperature was 95°F and the dew point was 72°F. The region’s all-time peak demand (28,130 MW) occurred on Aug. 2, 2006, when the temperature was 94°F and the dew point was 74°F.

Wholesale prices up compared to 2024

Real-time wholesale electricity prices averaged $49.65 per megawatt-hour (MWh) this summer, up 33% from the summer 2024 average of $37.45/MWh. Prices were also higher in the Day-Ahead Energy Market, at $53.31/MWh, compared to $39.03 last summer.

The increases are attributable in part to the elevated cost of natural gas, the region’s primary energy fuel. Average natural gas prices for summer 2025 were $3.22 per million British thermal units (MMBtu), an increase of 80% from summer 2024, when the average price was $1.79.

Resource mix and emissions

Natural-gas-fired resources produced 59% of energy consumed in the region in summer 2025. Nuclear power contributed 22%, followed by wind and grid-connected solar at about 8% and hydroelectric power at 5%. Imports supplied about 2%, while oil and coal combined produced about 1%.

ISO New England estimates carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions associated with the region’s electricity use through an analysis that combines data on electricity generation by fuel type with emissions factors based on US Environmental Protection Agency data and generator data reported directly to the ISO.

CO2 emissions for the summer months increased by about 5% or 448,000 metric tons from the previous year. Nearly 300,000 metric tons of CO2 was emitted in July alone, a result of increased generation from natural-gas-fired resources that month. July’s average temperature was 74°F, five degrees higher than both June and August. July’s energy consumption was roughly 2,000 GWh higher than the other months.

Meanwhile, emissions from oil- and coal-fired resources nearly doubled compared to last summer. Because the region’s wholesale electricity markets select the lowest-priced resources needed to meet demand, oil- and coal-fired resources tend to run more frequently when natural gas prices rise, and less frequently when natural gas prices are low.",https://isonewswire.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/weather-04.png,N,,2025-10-23 19:59:59.169953

Soaring LNG exports to assert America’s energy dominance have intensified competition for U.S. natural gas supply, pushing domestic energy prices higher—the opposite of what President Trump promised during his election campaign at this time last year.

As more U.S. LNG export facilities come online or ramp up operations, demand for LNG exports is set to exceed U.S. residential gas demand for the first time ever, according to estimates by Reuters based on the year-to-date growth trends.

LNG Feedgas Demand Set to Top Residential Use

The electric power sector remains the single biggest user of U.S. natural gas production, but LNG export demand has grown each year since America’s first exports in 2016.

Residential consumption held a higher share of LNG exports as a source of U.S. gas demand in the first half of the year, when temperatures are typically the lowest and demand for space heating is the highest. But U.S. LNG exports usually accelerate in the second half of any year as Europe and Asia are rushing to fill up storage ahead of winter.

If this trend pans out this year, and all signs point to that, then LNG feedgas demand will outstrip residential gas use, Reuters columnist Gavin Maguire notes.

Energy Prices Soar

With heated competition for America’s natural gas production from LNG export plants, residential gas utility prices have jumped in recent months.

U.S. policymakers could soon be confronted with uncomfortably high energy costs for consumers and accelerating inflation.

Electricity use has become more common for residential heating in the United States in recent years, with its share surging to 42% in 2024, from 35% in 2010, data from the American Community Survey by the U.S. Census Bureau showed earlier this month.

Natural gas remains the preferred source of space heating, with 47% of households heating with gas last year, but the share is down from 49% in 2010.

“Evolving trends in home heating fuels reflect shifts in housing populations, changes in technology and policy, and decisions by households and home builders,” the Energy Information Administration (EIA) said.

Homes exposed to warmer temperatures in the South and West are more likely to use electricity as their main heating fuel, per the EIA’s latest available Residential Energy Consumption Survey (RECS).

Despite the rise in electricity as the main space heating, natural gas still has the biggest share, and bills have jumped over the past few years.

Consumer prices for utility (piped) gas service jumped by 13.8% in the year to August 2025, the highest price increase in any consumer item in the latest Bureau of Labor Statistics inflation CPI report.

The U.S. average consumer price of natural gas in the residential sector soared from $12.34 per thousand cubic feet in January 2025 to as much as $25.27 per thousand cubic feet in July 2025, data from the EIA’s latest Natural Gas Monthly report revealed.

Higher natural gas prices and increased demand for feedgas to LNG export facilities have hiked energy costs for households.

Year to date, the benchmark U.S. natural gas futures at Henry Hub have traded at an average 37% higher compared to the 2024 average.

LNG Export Boom

This year, the Trump Administration provided a shot in the arm to U.S. LNG exporters, who saw the reversal of the Biden Administration’s pause on new LNG project approvals.

Encouraged by the current Administration, LNG developers are taking advantage of the market and regulatory tailwinds to approve investments in new projects.

Australia’s Woodside has announced the FID for the Louisiana LNG project and plans to start production in 2029. U.S. LNG exporter Venture Global in July took FID and successfully closed the $15.1 billion project financing for the first phase of the company’s third project, CP2 LNG (CP2), together with the associated CP Express Pipeline. And top U.S. exporter Cheniere has made a positive FID for the Corpus Christi Midscale Trains 8 & 9 and Debottlenecking Project.

These projects will boost global LNG supply and domestic feedgas demand toward the end of the decade. But there are other projects that will imminently increase American LNG export capacity.

The U.S will add 5 billion cubic feet per day (Bcf/d) in LNG export capacity in this year and next, as Plaquemines LNG and Corpus Christi LNG Stage 3 projects come online, the EIA projects in its latest Short-Term Energy Outlook for October. The EIA assesses that additions to LNG export capacity will boost total LNG exports to 14.7 Bcf/d this year, and to 16.3 Bcf/d in 2026, up from 11.9 Bcf/d in 2024.

LNG exporters in the United States have announced plans to more than double U.S. liquefaction capacity, adding an estimated 13.9 Bcf/d between 2025 and 2029, the EIA estimated last week. The United States is already the world’s largest LNG exporter and has 15.4 Bcf/d of operating export capacity.

While surging LNG exports are perfectly in line with the Trump Administration’s “energy dominance” agenda, soaring feedgas demand is putting upward pressure on residential gas prices in the United States.

The Framework also sits against the backdrop of the investigation initiated on April 22, 2025 by the Secretary of Commerce under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 (“Section 232”), as amended, to examine critical minerals and their derivative imports’ effect on national security.

See our publications dated May 25, 2023, and May 1, 2025, for more details on the Compact and the Section 232 investigation, respectively.

A. The Framework

The Framework provides for the following commitments:[2]

Securing supply. The countries will jointly strengthen and accelerate secure supply chains for critical minerals and rare earths by leveraging existing policy tools, such as the United States’ industrial demand and stockpiling infrastructure and Australia’s Critical Mineral Strategic Reserve.

Investment in mining and processing. The countries will utilize both government and private capital.

Project selection. The countries will identify projects to address gaps in priority supply chains.

Financing. Within 6 months, each country will provide at least US$1 billion in financing to qualifying projects expected to deliver end products to buyers in both countries.

Investment support. The countries will work together to develop new or tailored mechanisms to strengthen and secure critical minerals and rare earths supply chains.

Ministerial. A Mining, Minerals and Metals Investment Ministerial will be convened within 180 days to promote investment in mining.

Permitting. Each country will accelerate permitting and project execution for critical minerals and rare earths mining, separation, and processing.

Price Mechanisms. The countries will work to protect their domestic critical minerals rare earths markets from non-market policies and unfair trade practices, including developing standards-based market transparency measures, including potential price floors or similar measures, and will coordinate with international partners to develop a complementary global approach.

Asset Sales. Both countries will enhance or develop authorities to review and, where necessary, restrict foreign critical mineral and rare earth asset sales on national security grounds.

Scrap. The countries commit to investing in minerals recycling technologies and to collaborate on the management of critical minerals and rare earth scrap to diversify supply.

Third parties. The countries will coordinate with third parties, as appropriate, to reinforce supply chain security.

Geological mapping. The countries will collaborate on mapping mineral resources in both countries and elsewhere, as mutually agreed.

Rapid Response. The countries will establish an advisory U.S. – Australia Critical Minerals Supply Security Response Group to identify priority minerals, assess supply vulnerabilities, and coordinate accelerated delivery.

B. Implementation of the Framework and Financing Outlook

The Framework establishes a project pipeline of up to US$8.5 billion[3], with near-term joint funding of more than US$3 billion expected within the next six months.[4] Based on industry estimates (and not government sources), the recoverable resources for these critical minerals projects are estimated to be worth up to US$53 billion.

Beyond the initial government contributions, the U.S. Export–Import Bank announced seven non-binding expressions of interest totaling more than US$2.2 billion in potential (but not yet committed) financing to advance critical minerals projects in Australia, which could support up to US$5 billion in total investment.[5] Additionally, the U.S. and Australian governments have entered into a non-binding agreement with Alcoa Corporation to invest through a joint venture in the construction of an advanced gallium plant with capacity of approximately 100 metric tons per year and to benefit from U.S. and Australian government co-financing and offtake arrangements.[6] Collectively, these measures are designed to expand processing capacity and reduce concentration risk in midstream supply chains.

The Framework formalizes the critical-minerals partnership and reinforces the broader Australia–United States alliance by aligning industrial, defense, and energy-security policy. Implementation of the Framework is expected to improve price visibility, facilitate capital formation, and advance eligible project development through coordinated government financing and procurement programs aimed at addressing capacity constraints in processing and refining critical minerals.",https://www.sullcrom.com/SullivanCromwell/_Assets/images/sc-logo-2D_1200x630.png,N,,2025-10-24 03:18:36.624429

Google has announced a groundbreaking partnership that positions the tech giant at the forefront of innovative energy procurement strategies. The company will become the first major corporation to purchase electricity generated from natural gas plants equipped with advanced carbon capture and sequestration technology, marking a pivotal shift in how technology companies address their growing energy demands while maintaining environmental commitments.

This initiative represents a strategic response to the unprecedented power requirements of artificial intelligence and cloud computing operations, which demand consistent, reliable electricity that traditional renewable sources cannot yet provide at scale. The partnership with energy developers signals a new era where corporations actively invest in bridging technologies that combine fossil fuel reliability with carbon reduction capabilities.

Understanding Carbon Capture Technology in Power Generation

The Technical Foundation of Carbon Sequestration

Carbon capture and sequestration technology fundamentally transforms conventional natural gas power generation by intercepting carbon dioxide emissions before they reach the atmosphere. This process involves three critical phases: capturing CO₂ at the point of combustion, compressing and transporting the gas through specialised pipeline networks, and permanently storing it in deep geological formations.

Modern carbon capture systems achieve capture rates exceeding 90% of total emissions produced during natural gas combustion. The captured carbon dioxide undergoes compression and injection into EPA-approved Class VI wells, located more than 5,000 feet below ground in stable rock formations that have been geologically proven to contain CO₂ for millennia.

Performance Metrics and System Specifications

The technology relies on post-combustion capture methods that separate CO₂ from flue gases using chemical solvents or solid sorbents. These systems operate continuously, monitoring gas compositions and adjusting capture efficiency in real-time to maintain optimal performance standards.

System Component Performance Specification CO₂ Capture Rate >90% of total emissions Storage Depth 5,000+ feet underground Monitoring Duration Continuous for decades Storage Security 1,000+ year containment Pipeline Pressure 1,500-2,200 psi

Transportation infrastructure includes high-pressure pipelines designed specifically for CO₂ transport, with materials and engineering standards that prevent leakage and ensure safe delivery to storage sites. Monitoring systems track pipeline integrity through sensor networks that detect pressure variations, temperature changes, and potential leak indicators.

The Energy Challenge Driving Tech Industry Innovation

AI Operations and Power Reliability Requirements

Artificial intelligence workloads impose extraordinary demands on electrical infrastructure that distinguish them from traditional computing applications. Machine learning model training and inference operations require massive parallel processing capabilities that cannot tolerate power interruptions, voltage fluctuations, or supply inconsistencies.

Data centres supporting AI applications typically operate at power densities exceeding 50 kilowatts per rack, compared to 6-10 kilowatts for conventional servers. These facilities require power availability ratings of 99.99% or higher, meaning acceptable downtime measures in minutes per year rather than hours or days.

Renewable Energy Limitations in Industrial Applications

While renewable energy sources provide environmental benefits, their inherent variability creates operational challenges for energy-intensive industrial processes. Furthermore, the uranium market volatility has highlighted how traditional energy sources face their own supply chain challenges.

Solar photovoltaic systems generate zero electricity during nighttime hours and experience significant output variations due to cloud cover, seasonal changes, and weather patterns.

Renewable Energy Constraints:

Solar generation ceases completely after sunset

Wind output varies by 70-80% based on atmospheric conditions

Hydroelectric capacity fluctuates with seasonal water availability

Battery storage remains economical for 2-6 hour duration periods

Grid-scale storage costs range from $150-300 per megawatt-hour

Google backs carbon-captured gas as a solution that offers significant advantages:

24/7 baseload power generation capability

>90% emission reduction versus conventional natural gas

Immediate scalability using existing infrastructure

Load-following capability to match demand fluctuations

Integration potential with renewable energy systems

Current battery technology costs and duration limitations prevent renewable sources from providing the reliable, long-duration power supply required for continuous industrial operations. Lithium-ion battery systems optimised for grid applications typically provide 4-8 hours of storage duration, insufficient for multi-day renewable energy gaps.

The Broadwing Energy Project: Technical Specifications

Project Infrastructure and Capacity

The Broadwing Energy facility will feature a 400+ megawatt natural gas cogeneration plant strategically positioned in Decatur, Illinois, on existing Archer Daniels Midland industrial property. This location provides access to established CO₂ storage infrastructure that ADM has operated for over a decade through their ethanol production processes.

In addition to this innovative approach, the broader energy landscape is evolving as Google's carbon capture investment demonstrates the tech giant's commitment to bridging solutions while conventional energy markets experience their own transitions.

Cogeneration technology maximises energy efficiency by simultaneously producing electricity and industrial steam from the same natural gas input. This configuration typically achieves overall system efficiencies of 65-80%, compared to 35-45% for conventional power generation that wastes heat energy.

Strategic Location Benefits

The Decatur site offers unique advantages that reduce project development costs and timeline risks. However, recent developments in global energy markets, including the US Senate ban on Russian uranium imports, have highlighted the importance of diversified energy strategies.

ADM's existing CO₂ pipeline networks and proven geological storage formations eliminate the need for extensive new infrastructure development.

Infrastructure Advantages:

Operational CO₂ injection wells and monitoring systems

Established natural gas transmission pipeline connections

Existing electrical transmission and distribution access

Industrial zoning and environmental permits in place

Skilled workforce experienced in industrial operations

Economic Benefits:

Reduced capital expenditure through infrastructure sharing

Accelerated project timeline using proven storage methods

Lower operational costs through economies of scale

Enhanced project viability through demonstrated technology

Shared monitoring and maintenance infrastructure

The geological formations beneath the Decatur site consist of deep saline aquifers within the Mount Simon Sandstone formation, which has been extensively characterised for CO₂ storage capacity and containment properties. These formations have successfully stored millions of tons of carbon dioxide from ADM's ethanol operations without leakage or environmental impacts.

Global Carbon Capture Technology Landscape

International CCS Deployment Strategies

Carbon capture technology deployment varies significantly across global markets, reflecting different energy policies, geological conditions, and economic frameworks. Each region has developed distinct approaches based on local resources and strategic priorities.

Norway's CCS Leadership:

Norway operates the world's longest-running commercial CCS projects, including the Sleipner field which has stored over 20 million tons of CO₂ since 1996. The Norwegian government provides direct financial support for industrial CCS development and has established the Northern Lights project to provide shared CO₂ transport and storage services for European industries.

Canada's Oil Sands Integration:

Canadian CCS projects focus primarily on oil sands operations and enhanced oil recovery applications. The Quest project in Alberta captures approximately 1 million tons of CO₂ annually from Shell's Scotford upgrader operations. Provincial governments provide investment tax credits and regulatory frameworks specifically designed for CCS deployment.

Australia's Research Focus:

Australia has invested heavily in CCS research and development through government-industry partnerships. The Gorgon project incorporates carbon capture as part of liquefied natural gas operations, though technical challenges have limited its effectiveness compared to design specifications.

Economic Analysis of Carbon-Captured Gas Technology

Capital Cost Structure and Investment Requirements

Carbon capture technology significantly increases upfront capital costs for natural gas power generation projects. Industry analyses suggest CCS systems add 35-65% to total project costs compared to conventional natural gas plants, depending on capture technology selection and storage infrastructure requirements.

Major Capital Cost Components:

CO₂ capture equipment installation: $400-600 per kilowatt

Compression and transportation infrastructure: $50-100 per kilowatt

Deep well drilling and completion: $3-8 million per well

Enhanced monitoring and safety systems: $10-25 million per project

Extended construction timeline costs: 12-24 month delay penalties

Operational Cost Implications:

Plant efficiency reduction of 8-15% due to capture energy requirements

Increased natural gas consumption of 15-25% per unit of electricity generated

Water usage increases of 40-60% for CO₂ processing systems

Auxiliary power requirements consuming 10-20% of plant output

Revenue Opportunities and Financial Incentives

The federal 45Q tax credit provides significant financial support for carbon capture projects, offering up to $85 per metric ton for CO₂ storage in dedicated geological formations. This incentive can offset 20-40% of capture system operational costs over the project lifetime.

Consequently, this initiative aligns with broader market trends as natural gas plants with CCS become increasingly attractive for corporate energy procurement strategies.

State-level incentives vary by jurisdiction, with some states providing additional tax credits, accelerated depreciation schedules, or regulatory rate recovery mechanisms for utility-scale CCS projects.

Technical and Regulatory Challenges

Storage Integrity and Long-term Monitoring

Carbon dioxide storage requires continuous monitoring to ensure geological containment over decades. EPA Class VI injection well regulations mandate comprehensive monitoring programmes that track reservoir pressure, CO₂ plume migration, groundwater quality, and surface deformation.

Critical Monitoring Requirements:

Real-time injection pressure and flow rate measurement

Seismic monitoring arrays to detect induced seismicity

Groundwater sampling programmes above and below storage zones

Surface deformation measurements using satellite interferometry

Annual well integrity assessments and pressure testing

Technical Risk Factors:

Potential CO₂ migration along abandoned wellbores

Pressure-induced fracturing of caprock formations

Chemical interactions between CO₂ and formation minerals

Long-term steel casing corrosion in CO₂ environments

Efficiency Penalties and Performance Impacts

Carbon capture systems reduce overall plant efficiency by consuming significant amounts of energy for CO₂ separation, compression, and transport. Post-combustion capture typically reduces net plant efficiency by 10-15 percentage points compared to uncontrolled operations.

This efficiency penalty translates to increased fuel consumption and higher operating costs per unit of electricity generated. Natural gas plants with CCS typically consume 15-30% more fuel than conventional plants to produce the same electrical output.

Integration with Climate Policy Frameworks

Federal Support Mechanisms and Incentives

The Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act allocated $12 billion for CCS research, development, and deployment programmes administered by the Department of Energy. These funds support technology demonstration projects, infrastructure development, and workforce training initiatives.

Key Federal Programmes:

Carbon Capture Demonstration Projects Programme: $3.5 billion

Regional Direct Air Capture Hubs: $3.5 billion

Industrial Emission Demonstration Projects: $5.0 billion

CCS Transportation Infrastructure Grants: $2.5 billion

The 45Q tax credit structure includes automatic annual increases designed to maintain economic incentives as technology costs decline. Credit values increase by approximately 2-3% annually through 2032, with potential extensions under consideration in climate legislation.

State-Level Policy Development

Illinois has established comprehensive frameworks supporting industrial decarbonisation through the Climate and Equitable Jobs Act. This legislation includes specific provisions for carbon capture projects, including streamlined permitting processes and utility cost recovery mechanisms.

Illinois CCS Support Framework:

Expedited environmental review for qualified projects

Public utility commission pre-approval for CCS investments

Industrial site selection assistance and zoning coordination

Workforce development programmes for clean energy jobs

Property tax incentives for carbon storage infrastructure

Future Implications for Energy Infrastructure Development

Innovation Opportunities:

Advanced capture technology efficiency improvements reducing energy penalties

Modular system designs enabling faster deployment and cost reduction

Enhanced monitoring systems utilising artificial intelligence and automation

Integration capabilities with renewable energy and storage systems

Carbon utilisation pathways creating additional revenue streams

Regional CCS development could establish industrial clusters where shared infrastructure reduces individual project costs and creates economies of scale for transportation and storage services.

Understanding the Strategic Significance

Market Psychology and Industry Transformation

Google backs carbon-captured gas represents more than individual corporate energy procurement—it demonstrates how major technology companies can drive market transformation through strategic purchasing decisions. By providing guaranteed long-term demand, corporate buyers create economic certainties that enable infrastructure investment and technology deployment.

This approach reflects sophisticated understanding of how early adopters can influence technology cost curves and market development. Corporate leadership in emerging clean energy technologies often establishes pricing benchmarks and operational standards that benefit broader industry adoption.

Furthermore, this initiative contrasts with traditional energy sectors, where projects like the Kayelekera uranium project face different challenges in securing long-term purchase agreements and market stability.

Hybrid Energy Strategy Implementation

The initiative exemplifies hybrid approaches to industrial decarbonisation that combine multiple technologies rather than relying exclusively on single solutions. This strategy acknowledges current limitations in renewable energy and storage technology while investing in bridge solutions that provide immediate emission reductions.

Strategic Implementation Elements:

Diversified energy portfolio reducing supply risk

Flexible operational capabilities matching variable demand

Incremental emission reductions while technology advances

Market development supporting broader clean energy transition

Regulatory relationship building facilitating future projects

Investment Implications and Market Dynamics

Capital Markets Response to CCS Development

Financial markets are increasingly recognising CCS as a necessary technology for achieving net-zero emissions in hard-to-decarbonise sectors. Investment flows into carbon capture projects have increased substantially, with private equity, infrastructure funds, and institutional investors allocating capital specifically for CCS development.

Corporate power purchase agreements like Google's provide the revenue certainty required for project financing. Long-term contracts with investment-grade counterparties enable developers to secure debt financing at favourable rates, reducing overall project costs.

Risk Assessment and Mitigation Strategies

Technical Risks:

Capture system performance variations affecting economics

Storage site geological uncertainties and long-term integrity

Integration challenges with existing electrical infrastructure

Technology obsolescence as alternatives develop

Regulatory Risks:

Carbon-captured gas plants provide grid stability services that intermittent renewable sources cannot deliver. These facilities offer frequency regulation, voltage support, and rapid response capabilities essential for maintaining electrical grid reliability as renewable penetration increases.

Grid Services Capabilities:

Load following within 5-10 minutes of dispatch signals

Frequency response providing automatic generation control

Voltage regulation supporting transmission system stability

Black start capability enabling grid restoration after outages

Spinning reserve capacity maintaining system security margins

Environmental Performance Monitoring

Comprehensive environmental monitoring programmes track air quality, water resources, and ecosystem impacts throughout project lifecycles. These programmes exceed regulatory requirements to demonstrate environmental stewardship and inform continuous improvement efforts.

Monitoring Programme Components:

Continuous emissions monitoring for criteria pollutants and greenhouse gases

Groundwater quality assessments at multiple depths and locations

Soil gas monitoring detecting potential CO₂ migration

Ecological surveys documenting wildlife and vegetation impacts

Community air quality monitoring at property boundaries

The success of Google backs carbon-captured gas initiative will likely influence corporate energy strategies across technology, manufacturing, and other energy-intensive industries. This development occurs as traditional energy markets experience their own transitions, with sectors examining largest uranium mines for long-term supply security while corporations seek reliable, lower-carbon alternatives for industrial operations.

The initiative potentially establishes new paradigms for balancing operational reliability with environmental responsibility in industrial decarbonisation efforts.

“These conditions are increasing in the U.S.,” she told the Subcommittee on Chemical Safety.
More than 600 among thousands of PFAS chemicals have been approved for industrial use by the EPA.","WASHINGTON — Chemical industry experts warned a Senate panel Thursday to be careful as it tries to balance safety against economic development with a planned rewrite of the rules on potentially harmful substances.

The chemical industry complains that prolonged regulatory approvals are making the United States fall behind other countries in a field where Americans traditionally have been world leaders.

Environmentalists say health problems such as cancer and autism are rising from exposure to toxins. They blame microplastics, asbestos and the PFAS “forever” chemicals as some of the culprits.

Setting the right priorities is “an issue that lies at the intersection of innovation, safety and U.S. competitiveness,” said Sen. John Curtis, R-Utah, chairman of the Environment and Public Works Subcommittee on Chemical Safety.

Legislation pending in Congress would revise the Toxic Substances Control Act that is the cornerstone of U.S. chemical regulation.

The 1976 law grants agencies such as the Environmental Protection Agency authority to regulate the manufacture, import, processing, distribution and disposal of chemical substances.

Several bills have been introduced in Congress to modify the Toxic Substances Control Act but the primary proposal is H.J.Res. 76. It aligns closely with Trump administration policy that seeks to speed up approvals for chemicals and reduce the regulatory burden on industries.

The bill would give manufacturers an easier approval pathway for new chemicals and limit the EPA’s authority to restrict or delay their introduction into commerce.

Environmentalists caution that too much haste could increase hazardous substance risks, such as from PFAS.

PFAS — short for per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances — are a large family of synthetic chemicals known for their durability and resistance to heat, water, and oil. They can take centuries to break down naturally, which is why they often are called “forever chemicals.” Since the 1940s, they have been put in consumer products such as non-stick cookware, water- and stain-resistant fabrics and food packaging.

PFAS are also linked to birth defects, cancer, cardiovascular disease and immune system problems, said Tracey Woodruff, a University of California environmental researcher.

“These conditions are increasing in the U.S.,” she told the Subcommittee on Chemical Safety.

More than 600 among thousands of PFAS chemicals have been approved for industrial use by the EPA. Woodruff said some might have won approval to gain “more profits” for corporations.

“Sometimes it gets through the process because there has been some political interference,” she said.

Peter Huntsman, chief executive of chemical manufacturer Huntsman Corp., said he agreed safety was important but that the United States is falling behind China and other countries in getting new chemicals into marketplaces.

“This is all about innovation and about speed,” Huntsman said.

Some chemicals that might take two years to win approval in the United States can be ready for manufacturing in 90 days in China, he said.

At times, regulatory objections raised by environmentalists and lawmakers are “politically driven,” Huntsman said. “They’re not science driven.”

Gwen Gross, chief chemist for research and development at Boeing Co., told the Senate about an EPA and Federal Aviation Administration regulatory process that took 20 years to win approval for chemicals used in airplane fire extinguishers.

Sen. Jeff Merkley, D-Ore., said any revisions to chemical regulations should avoid putting profits before health.

“Our highest priority must be protecting public health,” Merkley said.

Following the defunding of the program, solar energy business leaders from across North Carolina wrote a letter to Jackson that discussed the implications of the cuts for the North Carolina Department of Environmental Quality.
“NC DEQ has already invested time, energy, and resources in developing our state’s Solar for All program and ensuring that it delivers for people across North Carolina,” the letter stated.
The release said the EPA allegedly breached the program grant agreement when it rescinded the funds.
The lawsuit is currently waiting on a decision as plaintiffs asked the court to reinstate the Solar for All program.","On Oct. 16, North Carolina Attorney GeneralJeff Jackson, alongside 21 other states and Washington D.C., sued the Environmental Protection Agency, alleging that President Donald Trump's administration acted illegally when canceling $7 billion in federal grants to low-income communities in pursuit of providing alternative energy sources.

After affirming Trump's landmark domestic policy bill (H.R. 1, the ""One Big Beautiful Bill Act""),the EPA withdrew almost 90 percent of funds from the Solar for All program, which would have impacted more than 12,000 households across North Carolina.

The Solar for All program was established as a part of the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, which required the EPA to make competitive grants to states in order to enable low-income communities to benefit from zero-emission technologies. The program would have provided financially disadvantaged communities with clean energy alternatives, which would reduce electricity bills.

“The program was designed effectively to help lower their bills,” UNC environmental sciences and engineering professor Noah Kittnersaid. “And without the program, their bills are not likely to go lower. They're probably going to increase as a result.""

8MSolar, a North Carolina-based solar energy company, consulted the EPA on the financial logistics of installing solar energy panels.

“We were one of about a dozen solar installers that started working with them to create the program,” 8MSolar Director of Residential SalesBryce Bruncatisaid. “So, what does it look like when someone says, 'I'm interested in Solar for All grant,' or, you know, 'lower my electric bills,' and from that stage, all the way through to potentially what would have been us installing a system.”

In February, the EPA entered into binding grant agreements with each plaintiff — the 22 different states a part of the program — in which they promised the full grant amount. Plaintiffs later received the full grant amount and were permitted to start work on installing solar panels.

Trump signed the Working Families Tax Cut Act into law in July, repealing Section 134 of the Clean Air Act, which previously authorized funding for the Solar for All program. The EPA no longer has authority to fund the program, regardless of former grant agreements.

In August, EPA administratorLee Zeldin made a statement on X announcing the cancelation of the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund, which directly funded the Solar for All program.

“Today, the Trump EPA is announcing that we are ending Solar for All for good, saving US taxpayers ANOTHER $7 BILLION,” Zeldin wrote.

Following the defunding of the program, solar energy business leaders from across North Carolina wrote a letter to Jackson that discussed the implications of the cuts for the North Carolina Department of Environmental Quality.

“NC DEQ has already invested time, energy, and resources in developing our state’s Solar for All program and ensuring that it delivers for people across North Carolina,” the letter stated. “Terminating DEQ’s grant would deny small businesses the benefits of those investments that they have planned for in anticipation of the program.”

The North Carolina Department of Justice released a statement on Thursday detailing the specifics of the lawsuit. The release said the EPA allegedly breached the program grant agreement when it rescinded the funds.

Despite funding cuts, there are clean energy alternatives for low-income communities, such as community solar power.

“Hopefully, there'll be some kind of lease options that are becoming more available and in our area,” Doug Ager, CEO of Sugar Hollow Solar, an Asheville-based solar installation company, said.

The lawsuit is currently waiting on a decision as plaintiffs asked the court to reinstate the Solar for All program.

“I’m not sure that something like this lawsuit is really going to have a major impact, given we’re in this era that is so polarized,” Bruncati said. “It kind of stinks, because it’s something that is very bipartisan.”",https://snworksceo.imgix.net/dth/f140d2dd-039e-491c-bf9f-4f3c04645676.sized-1000x1000.png?w=800&fit=crop&ar=16%3A9&crop=faces%2Cedges,N,,2025-10-23 16:00:32.998542

DAILY COVER STORY

The Most Valuable NBA Teams 2025

For the fourth year in a row, the NBA’s most valuable team is the Golden State Warriors, worth an estimated $11 billion.

No other NBA team was within $300 million of the Warriors’ estimated $880 million in revenue last season, with the club far outpacing the rest of the league with its income from sponsorships and premium seating, and ranking in the top three in virtually every category tracked by Forbes. In fact, Golden State more than doubled the $417 million league average for total revenue, and compared with the other North American sports leagues, the Warriors generated more cash than every franchise except the NFL’s Dallas Cowboys. But even for the rest of the NBA, business these days is very, very good.

According to Forbes estimates, league-wide revenue last season was up 10% year-over-year, to roughly $12.5 billion, including money from non-NBA events held at teams’ arenas but netting out arena debt service. And another significant jump is coming in 2025-26—the first season of the 11-year, $76 billion national media package the NBA signed last year with Disney, NBCUniversal and Amazon Prime Video.

With all of that cash pouring in, Forbes estimates that the 30 NBA teams are worth $5.4 billion on average—or just over $160 billion collectively—representing an increase of 21% over last year and more than doubling the average of $2.5 billion from just four seasons ago.

WHY IT MATTERS “The Celtics sold for a blended valuation of roughly $6.7 billion in August, and the Lakers are awaiting the NBA’s approval for a $10 billion transaction—figures that, given the franchises’ business performance in 2024-25, make them look more like fast-growing tech startups than sports teams in a nearly 80-year-old league,” says Forbes senior editor Brett Knight. “Forbes now values the 30 pro basketball teams at 12.9 times last season’s revenue on average, well ahead of the other major men’s leagues, which demonstrates just how desperate investors are to break into basketball. And no one is expecting that to change anytime soon.”

Energy Transition

From Sun to Core | Renewables Peak, Nuclear Builds Steam

Enverus Intelligence® Research (EIR) just released its long-term capacity expansion forecast, projecting rapid growth in solar capacity from 2025-35 alongside a steady battery buildout to bolster grid reliability. That outlook is already materializing. Torch Clean Energy recently selected Fluence Energy to deliver a 640 MWh battery system at its Arizona solar plant, aligning with the trend of colocating renewables with storage to stabilize output.

Corporate demand for clean energy remains strong. Enel North America signed a major solar power purchase agreement with Mars to supply electricity from its Texas portfolio, underscoring continued appetite for renewables even as tax credits phase out.

The forecast also points to accelerated nuclear capacity growth in the long term. Early signs are emerging, with companies like Microsoft restarting legacy nuclear plants such as Three Mile Island, renamed the Crane Clean Energy Center. Last week, Oklo announced a $2 billion partnership with the European firm Newcleo to develop nuclear fuels for U.S. projects.

Amazon also recently unveiled renderings for its Cascade small modular reactor (SMR) in Washington, expected to begin construction at the end of the decade. The Cascade site could host up to 12 SMRs — part of a growing trend among data center operators seeking carbon-free, baseload power.

Media reports earlier in the day pegged the number at around 600 workers and said the company had carried out a smaller round of layoffs a month ago.

The expiration of a $7,500 U.S. federal tax credit for purchases of new EVs last month is expected to drive up prices and further weaken demand, posing a fresh challenge for automakers such as Rivian already grappling with mounting cost pressures.

Rivian has struggled to achieve consistent profitability due to costs related to ramping up of production, tariffs and intense competition from Tesla and traditional automakers.

High tariffs on imported auto parts have driven up manufacturing costs and squeezed margins for EV makers, forcing them to revamp supply chains, curb reliance on foreign components and boost U.S. investment in line with the Trump administration policy.

Analysts expect Rivian’s quarterly revenue to surge 71.5% and loss to narrow, when it reports third-quarter results after markets close on November 4.

The company lowered the midpoint of its annual deliveries forecast earlier this month, despite reporting a nearly 32% jump in the third quarter, largely driven by a last-minute rush to grab the now-expired federal incentive.

Rivian is focusing on improving manufacturing efficiency and streamlining operations at its Normal, Illinois plant to align costs with the weaker near-term demand outlook, while preparing for its next-generation R2 models, which are expected to broaden its reach beyond the luxury segment.

The company expects the R2 model to open up a lower-price segment, competing with Tesla’s bestseller Model Y crossover, and counterbalance soft demand for its pricier R1 vehicles.

An increase in capacity means an increase in the many benefits of LNG exports, including reducing global emissions and strengthening global security.

With a doubling of capacity, North America, namely U.S. producers, can continue to provide affordable, reliable energy to the world, driving international and domestic benefits.

The Largest Exporter of LNG Looks to Double by 2029

According to EIA estimates, LNG export capacity in North America is on track to more than double by 2029, growing from 11.4 billion cubic feet per day (Bcf/d) to 28.7 Bcf/d.

Who is the key driver of that skyrocketing growth? The United States.

The United States is already the largest LNG exporter in the world, but in the next five years, the United States is on track to add an estimated 13.9 billion cubic feet per day (Bcf/d) to its LNG export capacity, increasing its capacity from 15.4 billion cubic feet per day (Bcf/d) to a total of almost 30 billion cubic feet per day (Bcf/d).

Global Demand Underscores the Need for Increased LNG Exports

The significant increases in LNG export capacity are underpinned by estimates of future global natural gas demand. As an American Gas Association 2025-2025 report analyzes, LNG export growth is set to largely drive overall growth.

Source: American Gas Association, Energy Information Administration, and Rystad Energy

Strong worldwide demand for natural gas emphasizes LNG exports’ role in energy security. Beyond Europe, which is a major consumer of North American LNG, demand of U.S. LNG in Asia is also strong. According to The International Gas Union’s 2025 LNG report, countries like Japan, India, and Indonesia have been increasingly turning to LNG to guarantee energy security and reduce emissions.

Following the U.S. Department of Energy’s May 2025 report on LNG exports, U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright summarized the global importance of LNG exports clearly:

“The facts are clear: expanding America’s LNG exports is good for Americans and good for the world.”

As Energy In Depth has previously analyzed, DOE’s report affirmed what many industry experts have long known: increasing U.S. LNG exports enhances domestic and international global security with no discernable impact to global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. In fact, it will likely do the opposite, as the U.S. LNG industry has long been a leader in emissions reduction success, strengthened by industry investments in innovative technologies such as carbon capture and storage (CCS).

LNG Projects Boost The National Economy

Fortunately for global demand, the United States is ready to export more affordable, clean energy to its allies. Recent support from the Trump administration for U.S. LNG production and exports has driven a slew of LNG projects across the nation, including 20 LNG export terminals approved by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.

This is a welcomed policy shift from the Biden administration’s misguided attacks on LNG, which included a damaging pause on permitting U.S. LNG export facilities. Instead of risking American jobs and economic growth, increased investments in LNG will do the opposite.

EIA’s newest analysis emphasizes the importance of continued investment and progress in LNG projects.

With five additional LNG exports in the United States currently under construction, the country’s dedication to increasing export capacity is clear. These increased LNG exports will not just benefit global energy security, they will also boost local economies.

According to recent industry estimates, U.S. LNG exports have provided more than 273,000 American jobs to date, and are projected to provide $166 billion in tax revenue through 2040. Construction of new facilities will only increase those benefits, while simultaneously allowing U.S. energy producers to provide sustainable, cost-efficient energy at home and abroad.",https://www.energyindepth.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/EID-LNG-post-1.png,N,,2025-10-23 15:20:47.543552

But most people are not Elon Musk.

The world’s richest man has only gotten richer this year and shareholders at Tesla, his electric car company, may make him wealthier yet by approving a trillion-dollar pay package in a bet he will succeed with new plans for a “robot army” and other technological breakthroughs even as some past promises remain unfulfilled.

“The genius of Elon Musk is keeping investors focused on what the company might look in like 5 or 10 years — while ignoring very near-term challenges,” marvels Garrett Nelson of CFRA Research. Or put more bluntly by Zacks Investment's Brian Mulberry, ""Your average CEO would likely not survive this.""

Musk started out the year with a side hustle — promising to cut $2 trillion in government spending as head of President Donald Trump's Department of Government Efficiency, before cutting that pledge in half. In the end, DOGE posted only $240 billion in savings, according to its own notoriously unreliable estimates, and it's not even clear those savings will hold as the Trump administration scrambles to refill many essential jobs DOGE cut that it shouldn't have.

“There is a pattern of them announcing great big firings, and then turning about and saying, ’No, that’s a mistake,’” said Elaine Kamarck, a Brookings Institute senior fellow who has compiled a list of 17,000 positions being refilled. “They cut without a plan, without regard to function.”

Musk used the same slash-and-burn tactics after he took over Twitter and evidence of that backfiring has emerged this year, too.

In the past two months, he’s settled a pair of lawsuits filed by 2,000 former Twitter employees and executives alleging that they were pushed out under false pretenses or never given severance as promised. The amount the ex-workers got was undisclosed, but if they received even a fraction of the combined $628 million they were demanding, the cost will cut deeply for a company whose advertising has plunged since his takeover.

More bad news for Musk came Wednesday when Tesla announced earnings had plunged 37% in the third quarter. Vehicle sales rose 6% as customers rushed to take advantage of a federal tax credit before it expired last month, but the figure for the full year is expected to drop significantly as car buyers turned off by Musk's right-wing political stances have boycotted the business.

This time a year ago Musk was telling investors sales could grow 20% to 30%.

The stock fell earlier this year as the bad news piled up. But after Musk appeared in the Oval Office in May for his farewell to DOGE sporting a shiner, it has doubled and is now posting a year-to-date gain of nearly 9% after the close of regular trading Wednesday. His net worth has also jumped — up $62 billion this year to $483 billion, according to Forbes magazine.

Investors are mostly buying Musk's line that plunging car sales don't matter as much now because the future of the company lies more with his new driverless robotaxis service, the energy storage business and building robots for the home and factory. To make his task worth while, Tesla’s directors are asking shareholders to sign off on his enormous new pay package at an annual meeting next month.

But there are big questions surrounding these endeavors, particularly the driverless cabs.

Musk's robotaxis, which began picking up passengers in Austin, Texas, and San Francisco this summer, can’t yet be called driverless because they still require “safety monitors” who are ready to seize control in case something goes wrong, which occasionally happens. One of them drove down the opposing lane, for example.

The robotaxi plans need approval from regulators in various states even as the ones in Washington have swarmed the company.

They've opened four investigations into Tesla so far this year, including one into why it hasn't reported accidents involving its self-driving software quickly to the government as required. Another launched earlier this month is looking into dozens of reported accidents in which Teslas using self-driving software ran red lights and broke other traffic rules, occasionally crashing into other vehicles and causing injuries.

Musk has disappointed before, talking big and missing deadlines repeatedly, only to deliver for shareholders eventually. Tesla investors who held on through a tough 2018 as the company struggled to produce its Model 3 vehicle at a profit, eventually saw their stock soar as sales jumped.

One money manager who rode that earlier surge then bought again earlier this year, says she’s confident Musk's magic is still there and he can pull off the seemingly impossible again.

“He frequently teeters on the edge of disaster,” said Nancy Tengler in a statement, “and then pulls back just in the nick of time.”

One difference now is most other Tesla investors also believe this and have bought up the stock, leaving little room for error.

Shares of U.S. companies in the S&P 500 index are valued at 24 times what investors expect them to earn next year. By contrast, Tesla is trading at 250 times expected profits, enough to make you believe that Musk, instead of having a very bad year is having a spectacular one.",https://images.wral.com/asset/business/2025/10/23/22211434/68fa79782c99c-media_c5483e3e9de04460adc815c67de5402c-DMID1-68r1t6gxu-640x480.jpg,N,,2025-10-23 19:05:36.013457

(AP) — Michigan is demanding millions of dollars in incentives back from a Chinese company after plans to build an electric vehicle battery plant collapsed following years of pushback against the project from neighbors and members of Congress.

Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer supported the $2.36 billion factory in 2022, and state lawmakers approved nearly $175 million in incentives for the project. The state is now holding Gotion Inc. in default of $23.6 million, accusing the company of abandoning the project.

“While this is not the outcome we hoped for, we recognize the tremendous responsibility we have to the people we serve to make sure their hard-earned tax dollars are spent wisely and appropriately,” Danielle Emerson, a spokesperson with the Michigan Economic Development Corporation, said in a statement.

Representatives for Gotion, which is headquartered in California, did not respond to multiple messages seeking comment.

In a letter dated Sept. 17, Michigan informed Gotion that it was in default of economic development grant obligations because no “eligible activities” had occurred on the site’s property in over 120 days.

According to the MEDC, the state is seeking to claw back $23.6 million that was disbursed toward the purchase of the site’s land near Big Rapids, about 200 miles (322 kilometers) northwest of Detroit. $26.4 million remaining from the grant that was not spent will be returned to the state, Emerson said. Citing a lack of progress on the project, a different $125 million grant was not distributed to Gotion.

The news was first reported by Crain’s Detroit Business.

The state also said two project-related lawsuits are imposing a “material adverse effect” on its progress, which counts as grounds for default. The letter said that if the defaults are not resolved in 30 days, the state expects repayment of $23.6 million. That deadline passed Oct. 17.

Residents of nearby Green Township so firmly opposed the project, some over environmental concerns, that voters in 2023 recalled five local elected officials who supported bringing the factory to the area.

Auto manufacturing is the lifeblood of Michigan’s economy, which has been hard hit by tariffs imposed this year on the industry and Canada. When the project was proposed, officials said the factory would produce cathodes and anodes, two components key to electric vehicle batteries, as well as over 2,000 jobs. The original economic development incentives came as officials sought to bolster manufacturing in the state.

Whitmer’s office did immediately respond to a request for comment.

Republican U.S. Rep. John Moolenaar, who represents a swath of rural Michigan, had been the loudest and most prominent critic of the project, accusing Gotion of ties with forced labor and the Chinese Communist Party. Moolenaar chairs the House Select Committee on China and introduced a bill that stopped companies like Gotion from receiving electric vehicle tax credits from President Joe Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act. Moolenaar’s bill was signed by President Donald Trump earlier this year.

“Now that its contract with the State of Michigan and MEDC is set to be terminated, the people of Green Charter Township can finally move on from Gotion’s lies and broken promises,” Moolenaar said in a press release.

RE: Banning Clean Energy is Costing People Money–Let’s Say So

The climate threat remains real, present and costly. People are losing their homes in massive floods, parents are keeping their kids inside because of wildfire smoke, families are struggling with insurance premiums, energy bills, and groceries. Trump’s attacks on cleaner, cheaper and faster renewable energy not only worsen future impacts of a warming world–they have created a rising cost crisis for people right now. This provides us an opportunity, if we take it, to win this debate once and for all and make progress on clean energy that is both immediate and lasting.

Don’t Be Afraid to Say the Electric Bill is Too Damn High and Call Out who is Making Them Higher

Energy prices are rising twice as fast as inflation while energy demand from data centers and others is only expected to rise sharply. Yet instead of prioritizing the energy that is fastest and cheapest to deploy, the Trump administration is raising costs by cancelling those projects and programs, and stubbornly forcing the country to build or keep less popular, slower-to-get-online, and more expensive sources like coal and gas. Important stories include::

The administration has forced the old, dirty Campbell coal power plant in Michigan to continue operating despite being due for retirement at the cost to ratepayers of $1 million a day.

The newest coal plant in the country failed so catastrophically that it will be offline for two years.

While Trump has announced $625 million to support the coal industry, he has cancelled $679 million for support of offshore wind and halted permitting for multiple wind farms.

High energy bills rank right up at the top with grocery and health care as urgent issues the public is most worried about. The public wants politicians who support affordable solutions that work right now. Trump’s solutions are far less popular with the public while clean energy is extremely popular.

That is why we must focus on affordability even more than we already are.

Political leaders and climate groups must work to meet people where they are–they are rightly stressed about the rising cost of everything. It’s also critical to acknowledge that many people don’t yet know that clean energy is cheaper, even though it’s true. Twenty years ago you would hear: “solar and wind are luxuries we can’t afford,” and the fossil fuel industry and MAGA Republicans still promote these falsehoods. Meanwhile a quiet energy revolution has happened. A new analysis found that nearly all states with a higher-than-average amount of wind and solar power are paying lower-than-average electric bills. Innovation, scale, and good policy brought costs for solar and onshore wind down 75% and 62% respectively from 10 years ago.

Overcoming outdated beliefs is difficult, especially when the conversation about energy has still been too disconnected from the daily lives of most people and when misinformation remains rampant. We must say: “With prices on the rise and energy demand also expected to rise dramatically, the status quo won’t cut it, we’ve got to do something different right now.”

Policy Must Be Focused on Building Things and Lowering Costs

The climate movement and our champions in office at the federal, state and local level need to put consumers first by supporting action on rising costs, and building infrastructure that lowers their costs. Members of Congress on both sides of the aisle must fight for funding to process permits and modernize more efficient reviews that include community engagement and result in faster build timelines for popular clean energy and efficiency programs. State leaders across the country are also already passing policies–including bipartisan policies–that put consumers first and deploy clean energy at scale, reduce pollution, and lower utility bills. And in recent years, states such as Illinois, Michigan and Massachusetts have all passed legislation to speed up solar and wind siting and permitting.

Just this year, Minnesota made sure utilities can’t pass along the cost of data centers’ energy demand to customers. Oregon established protections against data center rate hikes as well and directed utilities to adopt technologies to improves transmission lines. Ohio passed a historic bipartisan energy law that improves the grid, requires utility transparency, and creates a framework to prioritize brownfields and former coal sites for renewable energy. In Michigan lawmakers are working on a Ratepayers Bill of Rights, “a legislative framework to protect consumers from skyrocketing energy prices, poor service, out-of-control utility executive pay and the undue influence Big Energy CEOs wield in Lansing.”

These policies will lead to more clean energy that is better for the environment, and they are framed by the concerns people have right now to get costs under control. They will ease the burden on people spending the highest percentage of their income on energy. We need more solutions that follow this model and more leaders to speak out in support of them.

Go on Offense–Call Out Who is Raising Your Bills

It’s not enough to make the case that clean is cheaper and faster. We need to loudly and repeatedly say that banning clean energy and subsidizing expensive, outdated solutions is costing us money. We must call out the politicians like Trump, MAGA Republicans in Congress, and utilities who are forcing higher energy costs on families. Republicans are starting to acknowledge their short-sighted policies will result in higher energy costs and less manufacturing in their own districts. Now is the time to make sure the pressure to reverse course becomes insurmountable.

That’s why we are already running ads and field programs, hosting 140 district events, generating over 10,000 petition signatures, and 3,000 calls into offices asking members to stop raising costs and showcasing the widespread frustrations from community members. And we will continue this work along with our partners in key districts across the country because more has to be done.",https://www.lcv.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/LCV-Social-Share.png,N,,2025-10-23 15:20:25.138067

Since 2020, 33 Illinois counties have passed “advisory referenda” to secede — with seven of those votes occurring in the 2024 elections.
Merritt, who chairs the board of New Illinois, said that would “undermine our efforts to … escape from ‘Old Illinois.","The Indiana-Illinois Boundary Adjustment Commission met Wednesday for the first time — manned only by Hoosier members — to consider absorbing secessionist Illinois counties.

Prairie State Gov. J.B. Pritzker has dubbed it “a stunt” that is “not going to happen.” No Illinoisans were named to the panel.

Instead, a six-member Indiana quorum conducted business in Terre Haute, taking remote — and mixed — testimony from residents of both states. The meeting was livestreamed.

Since 2020, 33 Illinois counties have passed “advisory referenda” to secede — with seven of those votes occurring in the 2024 elections.

Scott Carpenter of Downstate Illinois Secession said redrawing borders would be “freeing” Prairie State residents from “bad Illinois law.”

He suggested absorbing 74 counties that had a higher share of support for President Donald Trump during the 2020 election than Indiana — or, a smaller number of eastern counties with a higher average income than Indiana.

“Some might argue that this whole border adjustment commission is a waste of time because the government of Illinois would not agree to let these counties go,” Carpenter said. But a debt crisis could force the state’s hand, he added.

“Your commission is an opportunity to sound out and settle on a politically expedient solution that can be repackaged and presented to the public in such a time of crisis,” he said.

It’s unclear how Indiana would handle the issue of debt.

Illinois has almost $250 billion in liabilities, according to a 2024 analysis by the Reason Foundation, a Libertarian think tank. Indiana, meanwhile, is running a modest surplus.

“We are essentially a drain on … Illinois, and they remind us of that regularly,” said fellow Downstate Illinois Secession member Eric Ivers. He argued those counties would be “much more productive” under Indiana’s governance.

“We would no longer have to deal with the limitations placed on us by Chicago,” Ivers added.

Those pushing to create a new state spoke against absorption.

G.H. Merritt, who chairs the board of New Illinois, said that would “undermine our efforts to … escape from ‘Old Illinois.'”

She envisions 101 of the Prairie State’s counties seceding — every one besides Chicago’s Cook County.

Merritt claimed the commission was just for show. She recounted a phone call with the office of Republican Indiana House Speaker Todd Huston, who authored the law creating the commission.

“The gentleman’s first question to me was, ‘Why do you want to do this?’ And my reply to him is, ‘Why do you want to do this?'” she told the commission.

“… The debt would be just make this prohibitively expensive. And so what he told me is that Indiana knew this was never going to happen because Gov. Pritzker would never appoint the Illinois commissioners to this group,” Merritt said. “He told me that Indiana’s motive for doing this was to send a message to Gov. Pritzker and (Chicago) Mayor (Brandon) Johnson to correct course.”

Molly Gillaspie, a spokeswoman for Huston, wrote that he’s “always pursued this in earnest while acknowledging it was not very likely” that Illinois would send appointees.

Companion legislation in Illinois was unsuccessful.

“When a third of counties in Illinois have expressed their dissatisfaction and voted to secede from their state, I’d say you should take that seriously,” Huston said in a statement. “We certainly take it seriously, we hear their frustrations, and we welcome them to the Hoosier State. I look forward to hearing the Commission’s recommendations on a path forward, and if and when Illinois comes to the table, we will be ready.”

Laurette Newland, with Illinois Separation Referendum, said her group has three factions: some would like to join a neighboring state, some seek a new state, and some don’t care “as long as Cook County is not in it.”

Illinois Separation Referendum has led the secession referenda campaign. Newland noted that voters were only asked about separating, not about joining Indiana. She recommended posing that question to voters before further legislative action.

A border shakeup of this magnitude is unlikely, however.

Illinois would need to approve the move, alongside Indiana. Then, it’d head to Congress for additional vetting.

The commission agreed to “shoot for” a meeting early next year, but hasn’t yet set a date.

David Ige’s edict that trying to import natural gas would distract the state from its mandated goal of producing 100% of its electricity with renewables by 2045.

Now Gov. Josh Green is bringing natural gas back, a move his team says will lower carbon emissions and electric bills for residents while moving the state toward its renewables goal.

A tentative agreement between Green’s office and Tokyo-based JERA Co. Inc reached last week would bring liquefied natural gas to Hawaii. It would also unlock a $2 billion investment into Hawaii’s energy system — nearly equal to the market value of Hawaiian Electric Co.’s parent company, Hawaiian Electric Industries, which was valued at $2.03 billion as of Wednesday.

It’s the biggest proposed energy deal since NextEra Energy unsuccessfully tried to take over Hawaiian Electric Industries in 2016.

If it goes through, the investment would make JERA a major player in Hawaii, expanding business ties between the islands and Japan, a major tourism market and ancestral home of almost a quarter of Hawaii residents. And it would transform Hawaii’s energy economy.

The proposed deal comes as the Trump administration has expressed hostility to state renewable energy mandates, and renewables in general, while supporting the U.S. liquefied natural gas industry. In June, the U.S. Department of the Interior announced four 20-year agreements under which JERA will purchase up to 5.5 million tons per year of LNG from U.S. suppliers.

The agreements “underscore President Trump’s efforts to unleash American LNG production and the significant role the U.S. LNG industry plays in strengthening the U.S. economy,” the Interior Department said in a news release.

Green traveled to Washington on Wednesday to meet with the U.S. secretaries of energy and the interior, as well as top officials of other agencies, including the military.

“These meetings will support Hawaii’s ongoing transition to clean energy,” among other things, the governor’s office said in a news release.

JERA’s six-page, non-binding agreement with Hawaii calls for the company to pay for fuel-flexible infrastructure with the goal of starting with liquefied natural gas — a fossil fuel — and transitioning to renewables such as hydrogen by 2045.

Opening the door to LNG in Hawaii wouldn’t need legislative approval. But anticipated regulatory changes would have to go through the Public Utilities Commission, and projects would be subject to environmental reviews and permitting. HECO would also have to be a major player.

Environmentalists have expressed opposition to the effort. Hawaii Rep. Nicole Lowen, who chairs the House Energy and Environmental Protection Committee, is calling for more details.

The agreement includes nearly two pages of clauses laying out things like challenges Hawaii faces, JERA’s status as a global energy company positioned to help Hawaii reach its goals and estimated cost savings to residents. Actual terms of the non-binding agreement were limited to three pages, leaving people like Lowen at a loss to comment.

“They have to stop talking in these big generalizations and get real and put something on the table,” she said.

Mark Glick, who heads the Hawaii State Energy Office as the state’s Chief Energy Officer, said a more detailed preliminary analysis is expected by year’s end.

Green Renews Idea Blocked By Predecessor

Renewable resources such as large-scale solar and onshore wind farms have emerged as the least expensive ways to produce electricity, and the cost of battery storage systems has also declined in recent years. By law, Hawaii must transition entirely to such renewables by 2045.

In the meantime, the state relies heavily on generators that burn oil, which can be shipped to the state.

Natural gas is cheaper and burns more cleanly than oil, but can’t be shipped or sent by pipeline to Hawaii. LNG producers super-cool natural gas into a liquid, which can be shipped to users, then turned back into gas at offshore terminals and sent onshore by pipelines.

Former Gov. Neil Abercrombie had been open to using LNG. But former Gov. David Ige took it off the table by flat in 2015, saying it would distract Hawaii from meeting its 2045 renewables mandate.

LNG came on the table earlier this year, when Green’s State Energy Office issued a study in January highlighting the possibility of using LNG as a transition or bridge fuel. The study identified LNG as a lower-cost, low-emission, short-term alternative to oil, which could be replaced later by hydrogen when such fuel becomes feasible.

The study came out the same month Green issued an executive order supporting renewables.

A few months later, in a speech at the Hawaii Energy Conference in May, Green said LNG had to be part of the mix.

The Green administration had held talks with JERA as early as 2023 when the U.S. Department of Energy had announced plans to create seven regional hydrogen hubs in the U.S., Glick said. The governor had been introduced to the company by Central Pacific Bank Chairman Emeritus Paul Yonamine, a booster of building business ties between Hawaii and Japan who is also a volunteer advisor to Green on Japan affairs.

Hawaii wasn’t the right place for a hydrogen hub, Glick said, but JERA came back over the summer of 2023 to discuss LNG.

“I wasn’t particularly excited at that time,” Glicksaid, but he asked for more information.

JERA came back later that year — about two months after the Maui wildfires, which had dealt a devastating financial blow to HECO and created the specter of massive liability for the company and potential bankruptcy. JERA said it was interested in investing in HECO, helping to help cover potential liability HECO faced as part of an overall LNG plan, Glick said.

While Yonamine had made the introduction to JERA, it was the details of JERA’s plan that interested the energy office, Glick said.

“Post-Lahaina, it became much more serious interest,” Glick said. “And we looked at it in a whole different light.”

‘This Will Create A Savings’

The serious interest became an agreement-in-principle with the “Strategic Partnership Agreement,” which Green’s office made public last week.

The agreement anticipates a new procurement process and energy grid modifications aligned for LNG. It also envisions five modernized, fuel-flexible generators being built or updated on Oahu. The idea is the generators will be able to use multiple fuels, including LNG and renewables like biodiesel and hydrogen after 2045, Glick said. The cost of at least some of these conversions, Glick said, can be built into existing customer electricity rates.

“LNG is just meant to be a bridge to get us using modernized equipment, not 70-year-old, inefficient power plants,” Glick said.

The agreement proposes that JERA would invest up to $2 billion for LNG infrastructure, including an offshore terminal and pipelines. JERA would benefit by selling natural gas to HECO, Hawaii Gas and shipping companies to power vessels, Yonamine said.

He stressed that there’s no intent for JERA to be Hawaii’s exclusive natural gas supplier.

“The price has to be right,” he said. But Yonamine said that given JERA’s position as a major LNG producer, the company “could provide LNG at the best price for users.”

Using lower-cost fuel will more than offset expenditures on equipment and infrastructure, Glick said.

“The intention is this will create a savings,” he said.

Concerns About Current Renewables Program

HECO’s spokesperson expressed tempered optimism about the deal, but said any final agreement must align with the utility’s current efforts to modernize its existing grid and encourage big, third-party wind- and solar-farm developers to continue to invest in Hawaii.

“We thought it was a great idea 15 years ago,” said Jim Kelly, HECO’s vice president for government and community relations and corporate communications. “It was our idea to begin with. It’s great that the governor is revisiting this and looking at options.”

Still, Kelly raised numerous questions that the agreement doesn’t answer. The state Public Utilities Commission and HECO already administer a robust procurement regime in which wind, solar and battery storage companies submit proposals to build big projects, from which HECO agrees to buy power under long-term, PUC-approved contracts.

Likewise, HECO is going through the process of creating a new, comprehensive plan to update its grid to handle the new power sources.

It’s unclear, Kelly said, how the JERA agreement would fit into that.

The deal would require a closer look at grid planning to make sure what’s envisioned complements what HECO is already doing, Kelly said. Also requiring a close look is any spending needed to upgrade power generators, which Kelly said is highly regulated.

Glick said the programs proposed under the JERA deal won’t affect current renewables procurement or grid planning.

New procurement regulations mentioned in the agreement, Glick said, are needed to make sure the state can move forward with public-private partnerships in the complex projects the agreement envisions.

Glick commended HECO’s current grid work. But, he said, “What we’ve seen is they’re capital constrained.”

JERA’s capital can change that, he said.

Glick pointed to the state’s mandate to decarbonize its transportation system by 2045, which will massively increase demand for electricity by 2045, when the grid must be powered entirely by renewables.

“Obviously, Hawaiian Electric is looking at that as well,” Glick said. “But, you know, frankly, to ensure that we can grow and have enough generation capacity to be able to handle that, we need to really look at all of the possible opportunities, particularly if there are capital constraints.”

Lowen, the House energy committee chair and a major player concerning Hawaii’s energy policy, said the agreement was too vague to comment on in detail.

“They’re way ahead of themselves,” she said. “First, they need to put a project on the table: What are they proposing and what’s the cost of it?”

Only then would Hawaii utility regulators, as well as the Hawaii Consumer Advocate, which represents rate-payers in matters before the PUC, be able to weigh in. That’s part of the process of approving new projects and regulatory changes, Lowen noted.

“I think we should all have an open mind to consider whatever is being proposed,” Lowen said. “But my suspicion would be that it would be quite expensive, and not necessarily to the benefit of the people of Hawaii.”

Environmentalists say they don’t need to know more. They’re adamantly opposed.

Wayne Tanaka, director of the Sierra Club’s Hawaii chapter, pointed to safety concerns, including a 2004 accident at a production facility in Algeria in which 27 people were killed.

He also pointed to operational problems that have shut down offshore regasification facilities for months.

While LNG might burn more cleanly than oil, it is worse, Tanaka said, when factoring in leaks in the production and transportation of the fuel.

In addition, he said, there are questions about costs, which he said could balloon and be passed to consumers. He described the idea of creating a whole new LNG infrastructure as “the Honolulu rail of utilities.”

Finally, Tanaka pointed to the vision of transitioning from LNG to hydrogen in 2045. Current technology simply doesn’t allow it, he said, meaning Hawaii could be stuck with LNG past the 2045 deadline.

“That’s my major concern,” he said. “There’s no end to the bridge.”

Glick said LNG is relatively safe. Terminals are located miles offshore, far from people. And he said natural gas poses a relatively low risk of explosions because it’s lighter than air and dissipates quickly.

Glick acknowledged emissions related to natural gas can make it worse than oil. He acknowledged leaks during natural gas mining and transportation — part of so-called life-cycle emissions — can create greenhouse gas emissions worse than burning oil. But it depends on the locale and regulations in those places, Glick said.

The bottom line, he said, is that using LNG can reduce life-cycle carbon emissions by 50% or more compared with Hawaii’s current practice of burning oil.

“What we’re doing now is extremely bad,” he said. “We’re the most carbon-intensive state in the nation.”

When it comes to hydrogen, Glick said, nobody can predict what the emerging leader in renewable fuels will be in 2045.

Yonamine agreed there are no guarantees. But he said an indication of the fuel’s promise is Japan’s all-out effort to power its economy with hydrogen by 2050.

“The Japanese are banking on this,” said Yonamine, a former president of IBM’s Japan operations. “They’re all in on this.”

### Read more on Trump’s challenge to the endangerment finding","The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) relied on shaky science and shady tactics to propose revoking its landmark greenhouse gas endangerment finding. Greenlighting the rescindment would be detrimental to public health and signal the erosion of science-backed decision making at our federal agencies.

Concerns about how EPA arrived at its proposed rule were echoed in many of the 380,000 public comments recently submitted to the agency, including PEER’s, and by hundreds of speakers who participated in public hearings on the rule.

Backdoor Convening of Climate Working Group

In March, Department of Energy (DOE) Secretary Chris Wright handpicked a group of five scientists to put together a climate study. They all had one thing in common: a history of countering scientific consensus on climate change.

Over the course of a few months, the group secretly authored a report concluding that climate change linked to greenhouse gases is less harmful than previously believed.

The report was cited over 20 times in EPA’s proposal to rescind the endangerment finding, despite it being hidden from the public eye and scrutiny up until that point.

A lawsuit filed by environmental groups alleges that this irregular secrecy violated a Federal Advisory Committee act mandating transparency from groups engaged in policymaking. In response, DOE disbanded the group to “invalidate” the lawsuit.

Using a hushed report to justify reversing a finding that will impact the entire globe demonstrates agencies’ abandonment of transparency to quickly advance an agenda. This is further evidenced by EPA suggesting that it might use artificial intelligence to read and respond to public comments, with little explanation on how the technology will be factored into review and decision making.

The People Behind the Controversial Report

Through cherry picking data and misrepresenting studies, the DOE report basically puts Groucho glasses on industry talking points and calls it science. It comes as no surprise, then, that some of the scientists downplaying the effects of greenhouse gas emissions have ties to the industries regulated under the endangerment finding.

Among the group is Steven Koonin, former Chief Scientist at the oil and gas company BP–a company that has been sued for deceiving the public about climate change. It also includes Judith Curry, who publicly acknowledged receiving funding from the fossil fuel industry for consulting services.

It’s also worth noting that the group was carefully chosen by Secretary Wright, a well-known fossil fuel entrepreneur and founder of the multibillion-dollar fracking company Liberty Energy. The report’s blessing on greenhouse gas emissions conveniently coincides with the Trump administration’s active halting of wind and solar energy projects in order to weaken renewable alternatives and bolster the fossil fuel industry.

Undermining Scientific Integrity

The proposal to repeal the endangerment finding is part of a concentrated effort by the Trump administration to abandon science in favor of a political agenda.

While Secretary Wright claims that the DOE report pushes back on the “cancel culture Orwellian squelching of science,” the truth is that it strategically ignores overwhelming scientific consensus. Ironically, his statement comes at a time when agencies are punishing employees for expressing dissent and demanding scientific integrity.

As PEER commented, rescinding the endangerment finding on the basis of flawed scientific evidence is antithetical to the reasoned decision-making required by the Administrative Procedures Act. It’s like choosing to cross a bridge after 97% of engineers say it’s structurally unsound just because five engineers say it’s not that bad.

Finalizing the rescindment, as EPA intends to, would harm public health, jeopardize infrastructure and investments, and discredit the missions that our scientific agencies are tasked with carrying out on behalf of the American people.

Eos, which develops and manufactures aqueous zinc batteries for utility, industrial and commercial power storage, said the expansion underscores its commitment to domestic manufacturing and to advancing energy independence through American-made technology.

The company, founded in 2008, currently operates facilities in Turtle Creek, Pa., where it installed a new automated production line in 2024.

A loss for NJ

The exit to the Keystone State marks a blow for New Jersey, particularly in spaces such as energy, domestic manufacturing and battery technology.

Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro joined company executives and local officials to announce the relocation and expansion, calling it a major win for his state.

“The demand for energy is going up — and my Administration is capitalizing on Pennsylvania’s strengths as a national energy leader and net energy exporter to attract leading energy manufacturers like Eos Energy to the Commonwealth,” said Shapiro. “We’re doubling down on our efforts to aggressively compete for — and win — major projects like this one by cutting red tape, building out our skilled workforce, and investing in the next generation of energy technology.

“I’m proud that Pennsylvania will be home to Eos’ new global headquarters — and my Administration will continue to work to cut energy costs, create good-paying jobs, and position the Commonwealth to continue to be a national energy leader for decades to come,” Shapiro continued.

‘You can make things in America again’

Eos CEO Joe Mastrangelo said the expansion represents the next phase of the company’s growth strategy.

“Energy storage is the backbone of a modern energy system, and this significant milestone marks our progress to bring America’s battery to scale,” Mastrangelo said. “Through Project AMAZE, we’re proving that you can make things in America again by building world-class capacity, pairing advanced manufacturing with innovative software, and doing it here in Pennsylvania to ensure a more energy-efficient and secure future.”

Mastrangelo continued, “In today’s competitive environment, and in what we’re working to achieve in powering the nation’s future, you need not only natural resources and technology innovations, but also a strong public-private partnership. What we are announcing today is built upon a strong industrial history, combined with a world class university ecosystem. Pennsylvania is positioning itself at the forefront of America’s energy transition – enabling us to bring America’s battery to scale.”",https://originnjbiz.wpenginepowered.com/files/2021/07/3920-Park-Avenue-Email-e1761234441472.jpg,N,,2025-10-23 15:20:33.497644

The Subcommittee convened the hearing on “Examining the Beneficial Use and Regulation of Chemicals.” ACC member company Huntsman Corporation, represented by its President and CEO Peter Huntsman, will testify before the committee to share the real-world impacts that EPA delays in chemical reviews have on manufacturing, innovation and domestic supply chains.

ACC is urging Congress to act now to make strategic changes to TSCA, including improvements to cut the backlog of new chemistries stalled in EPA review. While ACC commends EPA for recent steps to improve throughput, the backlog of new chemical reviews remains a significant barrier to American innovation and manufacturing dominance. This bottleneck limits access to advanced chemistries critical for breakthroughs in AI, health care, and national security, sectors where American leadership is vital.

Chris Jahn, President & CEO | American Chemistry Council

We appreciate Committee Chairman Shelley Moore Capito, Ranking Member Sheldon Whitehouse, and Subcommittee Chairman John Curtis and Ranking Member Jeff Merkley for their leadership in bringing attention to this critical issue. Every day that new chemistries sit idle in EPA’s review queue is another day America loses ground in innovation. The advanced materials that make AI systems smarter, defense technology stronger and modern health care more effective all depend on timely access to safe and innovative new chemistries. As part of the EPA’s ‘Powering the Great American Comeback’ initiative, EPA Administrator Zeldin has rolled out a number of new proposals and programs to streamline chemical reviews. And while we welcome EPA’s efforts, there remain strategic legislative changes Congress can make to TSCA that will help ensure it is truly modernized, grounded in the best available science, efficient, and effective. This isn’t just an industry priority; it’s a national imperative.

Peter Huntsman, President & CEO | Huntsman Corporation

The chemical industry provides the building blocks for both American prosperity and power. Continuous successful cooperation between our industry and regulators will see that this continues.

“Industrial pollution prevention means reducing or eliminating waste and pollutants at the source, before they are created, rather than treating them afterward,” he said.
Additionally, workshops provide industry leaders opportunities to network and learn more about pollution prevention.
Teamwork The EPA pollution prevention program grant runs through July 31, 2027.
The center, part of the College of Engineering and Technology, worked with on-campus and off-campus partners to obtain the grant.","East Carolina University’s Center for Sustainable Energy and Environmental Engineering (CSE3) received validation of its work to prevent pollution through a new $652,000 grant from the Environmental Protection Agency.

The center received grants totaling $1.2 million in 2023 and 2024 to help manufacturing facilities reduce or eliminate waste and pollutants from their processes. The result is improved profitability for the businesses and less pollution in the environment.

“This funding is a clear recognition of both the impact and value of this project,” said Dr. Tarek Abdel-Salam, engineering professor and director of the center. “For CSE3, it validates our ability to deliver measurable environmental and economic benefits to North Carolina’s manufacturing sector — reducing hazardous substances, emissions and water use while generating cost savings for industry. It also highlights the strength of our model, which integrates faculty expertise, student training and partnerships with state organizations to provide on-site technical assistance, pollution prevention assessments and workforce development.”

Abdel-Salam said the best way to prevent pollution in manufacturing is to never let it start.

“Industrial pollution prevention means reducing or eliminating waste and pollutants at the source, before they are created, rather than treating them afterward,” he said. “In manufacturing, this includes using safer materials, improving energy and water efficiency, and optimizing processes to cut waste, lower costs and reduce environmental impact.”

Finding Solutions

The center’s faculty, staff and students conduct site visits of manufacturing facilities. They observe the manufacturing process, collect data and produce reports with recommendations on how businesses can prevent pollution and improve their bottom lines.

“One of the suggestions we make all the time is the use of occupancy sensors,” said Katie Sperry, a CSE3 student worker and engineering major from Raleigh. “Especially in larger companies, they have a lot of lights that are constantly on when they don’t necessarily need to be because no one is in a room. Having an occupancy sensor makes it so the lights can be off if no one is in that room, but they come on when someone walks in. There can be a lot of savings in electricity there.”

Sperry, whose concentration is in electrical engineering, knows the difference that can make to the environment.

“Decreasing their electricity usage is more than decreasing their bill,” she said. “Thousands of kilowatt hours is a decent amount of electricity, but when you add everything up, they can save thousands and thousands and thousands of kilowatt hours. You can call up a greenhouse gas calculator and see that it can add up to a couple of hundred tons of CO2 (carbon dioxide) that’s not going into the atmosphere.”

Leaks in air compressors and coolers as well as poor pipe insulation can also be sources of waste, Perry said. Beyond that, the center also recommends safer alternative chemicals to more harmful ones used in some facilities, she said.

After the site visits, CSE3 faculty, staff and students examine the collected data. They then produce a comprehensive report that details pollution prevention strategies that can reduce the use of hazardous chemicals, lower carbon dioxide emissions, decrease water consumption and thus produce cost savings for the facilities.

The grant also allows the center to host online and in-person technical courses with industry experts to help manufacturers. Additionally, workshops provide industry leaders opportunities to network and learn more about pollution prevention.

Student Experiences

Bryan Mendoza, a senior from Middlesex, said his environmental engineering concentration made joining the CSE3 team as a student worker a no-brainer.

“I do plan to do something like this,” he said. “I want to help industries save energy, which is good for the environment. That’s why I applied here. I’m debating if I want to do wastewater or water treatment, or maybe consulting, data research or hydrology. It just all depends.”

Ash Davis’ concentration is in biomedical engineering, but the junior from Youngsville said attending the technical courses has allowed her to interact with professional engineers and to learn professional communications skills. Her role with the CSE3 team includes producing a newsletter and spreading the center’s work through social media.

“I think students want to hear what we’re about, especially if they’re in biochemical or environmental concentrations for engineering or even the environmental sciences,” Davis said. “We’re kind of a quiet center, so we’re trying to get ourselves out there or at least inspire others to act more in line with our goals for pollution prevention. I think we do good work.”

Sperry had the added benefit of a 12-week internship at a facility where she collected data and wrote recommendations on pollution prevention and energy use.

“That was a good experience in terms of seeing what a plant or manufacturing site looks like and working with actual engineers,” she said.

She said a recent career fair provided evidence that her work with CSE3 will benefit her upon graduation.

“A couple of the companies I talked to, my background in CSE3 was something they really appreciated,” Sperry said. “Me having this experience of doing energy assessments, taking data and writing recommendations based off that data is something that a couple of companies — especially ones that do more consulting — really appreciated.

Teamwork

The EPA pollution prevention program grant runs through July 31, 2027. The center, part of the College of Engineering and Technology, worked with on-campus and off-campus partners to obtain the grant.

Those on campus include faculty and staff from the Center for Innovation in Technology and Engineering and the departments of engineering, technology systems and construction management in the College of Engineering and Technology; the Department of Marketing and Supply Chain Management in the College of Business; the Department of Economics in the Thomas Harriot College of Arts and Sciences; and Merrill Flood, ECU’s director of research and innovation campus development.

Off-campus partners include the Clean Energy Technology Center at N.C. State as the sub-awardee; Pitt County Economic Development; the Greenville-Eastern North Carolina Alliance; and city managers and county developers across North Carolina.

Benchmark West Texas Intermediate U.S. crude oil prices hit five-month lows Monday and are down nearly 14% this year.
This would carry the added benefit of aiding U.S. shale oil producers who are under financial pressure from low prices, McNally said.
""You can afford to do it because next year it won't cause $100 oil — if anything it will help oil prices from dropping to $20 a barrel and killing shale,"" McNally said.
Immediate market impact The oil market may be close to pricing in the sanctions after the announcement caught traders by surprise, McNally said.","President Donald Trump could further rachet up sanctions against Russia's oil sector, with an expected global surplus of crude next year leaving the U.S. room to escalate while insulating American drivers from a price shock.

The Treasury Department on Wednesday announced sanctions against Rosneft and Lukoil, Russia's two largest oil exporters, citing Moscow's ""lack of serious commitment to a peace process to end the war in Ukraine.""

The sanctions mark the ""most material move to date by the United States to shutter the Russian war ATM,"" Helima Croft, head of global commodity strategy at RBC Capital markets, told clients.

The sanctions took the oil market by surprise. U.S. crude prices spiked nearly 6% to trade above $60 per barrel in response after many traders had discounted the risk of escalation due to Trump's focus on keeping energy prices low.

Benchmark West Texas Intermediate U.S. crude oil prices hit five-month lows Monday and are down nearly 14% this year. The market has been under pressure as OPEC+ increases production and renewed trade tensions between the U.S. and China trigger fears of a global economic slowdown.

Weaker oil prices have given Trump scope to act against Russia while shielding U.S. motorists, said Bob McNally, president of Rapidan Energy and a former energy advisor to President George W. Bush. The White House likely saw this as an opportune moment to hit Moscow, with the U.S. midterm elections still a year away, Croft said.

""It's about hurting the Russian finance ministry while protecting the U.S motorist,"" McNally said.

Escalation on the horizon

Trump's sanctions, which take full effect Nov. 21, are likely designed to force Russia to sell its oil at a steeper discount to global benchmark Brent rather than immediately targeting Moscow's export volumes, McNally said. This would reduce Russia's petroleum revenue while avoiding a price spike that pinches Americans' pocketbooks, he said.

But the oil market faces a looming surplus in 2026 that would give Trump more leeway to escalate sanctions against Russia further next year, by directly targeting its export volumes, according to the former Bush advisor.

This would carry the added benefit of aiding U.S. shale oil producers who are under financial pressure from low prices, McNally said. U.S. shale executives have been deeply critical of Trump's push to lower crude prices in anonymous responses to a quarterly survey conducted by the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas.

""You can afford to do it because next year it won't cause $100 oil — if anything it will help oil prices from dropping to $20 a barrel and killing shale,"" McNally said.

""Next year somebody has to cut big – OPEC, Russia, Iran or shale,"" he said. ""Take your pick. The president doesn't want shale to lose 2 million barrels a day plus like it did in 2020. He may want $40 oil but he doesn't want $20 oil.""

Immediate market impact

The oil market may be close to pricing in the sanctions after the announcement caught traders by surprise, McNally said. Where prices go from here depends on how the measures are implemented. If the sanctions are loosely enforced, U.S. oil could dip back into the $50s but there's also a risk that prices could push higher if the administration takes a hard line, the analyst said.

Lukoil and Rosneft account for more than half of Russia's more than 5 million barrels per day in exports, according to data provided by Kpler. Trump's sanctions come after former President Joe Biden in January sanctioned Russia's third and fourth largest producers, Gazprom Neft and Surgutneftegaz.",https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/107386155-1710249906319-gettyimages-459985760-RUSSIA_OIL.jpeg?v=1761232830&w=1920&h=1080,N,,2025-10-23 17:20:59.404508

Work there has been resumed and though there was no harmful leakage and the EPA monitoring protocols were activated, the episode highlights the complexity of permanent CO2 storage.","Tech giant Google has announced that it has struck the first corporate power-purchase agreement in the U.S. tied to a fossil-fuel plant enabled by carbon capture and storage (CCS) in support of its Midwestern data-center footprint.

The deal involves a 400-megawatt facility in Decatur, Illinois, to be developed by privately held Low Carbon Infrastructure and located on an industrial campus operated by agribusiness company Archer Daniels Midland.

The Broadwing Energy plant will deploy a CO2 injection system to sequester roughly 90% of its emissions and is slated to go online in the early 2030s. Google declined to share the financial terms of the contract.

One of many decarbonization paths for Google

Google noted that its deal represents a new front in the push to meet growing electricity demand while decarbonizing. “Natural gas-fired power that is produced while capturing and storing carbon dioxide had been missing from the equation,” said Michael Terrell, head of Advanced Energy at Google. “It’s a very important technology that the world needs.”

The agreement acknowledges that as Big Tech expands intensely energy-hungry activities such as generative artificial intelligence, the U.S. power grid is under pressure to supply reliable, large-scale capacity.

John Thompson, Technology and Markets Director at the global climate and energy NGO Clean Air Task Force commented on the announcement: “It’s an important milestone to see a company like Google invest in carbon capture to proactively address its emissions across its energy supply chain. With U.S. energy demand projected to grow, any new gas plants should be capturing their emissions.”

The firm is one of the largest corporate buyers of clean energy and is involved in a variety of efforts in the carbon removal space where it directly works with companies or uses the Frontier Climate coalition.

Relevant: The Frontier Coalition Makes A $41M Carbon Credits Purchase From Arbor

In 2024 alone, Google reported more than $100 million in contracted carbon removal credits, tripling its commitments from 2023. Spanning biomass capture, biochar, enhanced rock weathering and direct air capture the company has been one of the pillars of the growing industry.

The company continues emphasizing that its goal is net-zero emissions across operations and the full value chain by 2030 even while demand from AI is growing rapidly.

Natural gas and carbon capture

This combined approach that uses both fossil fuels and a decarbonization technology has drawn attention from other hyperscalers.

Meta is reportedly also looking into incorporating carbon capture technology into its future operations. The company is developing a sprawling data-center complex in Louisiana that could eventually exceed 4 million square feet.

To supply the project, Entergy Louisiana intends to construct three new natural gas turbines dedicated to the Franklin Farm campus with what can be described as carbon capture-ready units that can be retrofitted in the future.

In a recent report from carbon management services company Carbon Direct, the firm explains that to support surging electricity demand from data centres, AI and cloud computing, natural-gas-fired generation paired with carbon capture offers a “practical way to balance long-term climate commitments with the need for new electricity generation in the near term.”

The report underscores that only truly “capture-committed” facilities (where CO2 capture, transport and geological storage are embedded in project planning from day one) will deliver on the climate promise. It notes that retrofits or simply capture-ready plants rarely succeed and estimates that levelised cost of electricity with CCS can increase by 50% to 100% compared with unabated gas generation.

There are also risks when it comes to carbon storage. Archer Daniels Midland identified a leak at one of its wells causing brine and CO2 to migrate into unauthorized underground zones and paused injections at another storage site for 10 months.

Work there has been resumed and though there was no harmful leakage and the EPA monitoring protocols were activated, the episode highlights the complexity of permanent CO2 storage.

CATF’s Thompson emphasizes that “This project in Illinois would be one of the first gas power plants of this size to use carbon capture in the country, demonstrating clearly that we have the technology to prevent CO2 emissions and that unabated gas should no longer be a choice. What’s important now is that Google and its partners execute this project, safely and transparently — in collaboration with state officials and active participation by the public — to deliver real climate benefit.”

As Google embarks on this landmark offtake with a new gas-fired, CCS-enabled plant, the deal may send a signal that major technology users are willing to help shore up firm, reliable power by underwriting advanced fossil-fuel systems, even as they continue investing in renewables and removals.",https://carbonherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/google.png,N,,2025-10-23 16:00:16.983809

Since then, U.S. tariffs on Canadian-made vehicles have created headwinds for automakers, creating billions of dollars in costs, and given them reasons to defer expansions and investments in Canada — although it has not always been explicitly stated.

Similarly, U.S. President Donald Trump’s attempts to unwind many of his predecessor’s policies designed to ease the costs of the EV transition have created additional barriers to investing in the EV supply chain, including in Canada.

As EVs, battery storage systems and rooftop solar proliferate, utilities need to identify where these resources are located, quantify their grid impact, and deploy them to defer costly infrastructure upgrades.

Electron’s platform, ElectronConnect, is designed to enable utilities and system operators to optimize utilization of distributed energy resources, including EVs and stationary batteries. Electron says it currently works with over half of the UK’s distribution system operators, and is now expanding its operations in the US market.

Rhythmos.io provides data analytics for utilities and EV fleet operators. Its platform is designed to enable utilities to seamlessly integrate EV charging capacity without expensive infrastructure upgrades, while providing granular insights into charging patterns and grid impacts.

The combined company will offer “value orchestration technologies designed to bridge the gap between visibility and deployment.” This will enable utilities to identify and measure the impact of distributed energy resources on specific transformers and substations across their networks.

“DERs have the potential to unlock significant system-wide savings by optimizing both energy use and grid infrastructure, and our experience running flexibility markets internationally shows these benefits are real and scalable,” said Jo-Jo Hubbard, CEO of Electron. “The challenge isn’t on the supply side—virtual power plants have already aggregated gigawatts of flexibility. The challenge lies on the buy side: utilities need better visibility, valuation tools, and market capabilities to build defensible business cases for relying on DERs at scale. With Rhythmos, we’re bridging that gap by bringing grid awareness to flexibility markets, which helps both utilities deploy resources more strategically and DER providers capture more value.”

“For the first time, utilities can see precisely where distributed resources exist and how they affect the grid—right down to the service transformer—using data they already have,” said Ken Munson, CEO of Rhythmos. “By pairing Rhythmos’s grid-edge visibility with Electron’s flexibility marketplace, utilities gain the situational awareness needed to make smarter, data-driven investment decisions. They can now demonstrate, with evidence, when local flexibility is more cost-effective than building new infrastructure.”",https://chargedevs.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Microgrid-solar-charging-stock.jpg,N,,2025-10-23 14:59:36.206561

In a letter sent to congressional leaders that was also provided to The Center Square, API President Mike Sommers said legislative, regulatory, and market developments since the time the Nationwide Consumer and Fuel Retailer Choice Act of 2025 was introduced in February has led the 600-member organization to reassess its position and, ultimately, oppose advancement of the legislation in its current form.

Co-sponsored by 16 mostly farm-state senators, the Fuel Retailer Choice Act would amend the Clean Air Act to increase the ethanol allowed in regular gasoline to 15% year-round, now at 10% for part of the year.

API stands ready to work with Congress to develop a balanced approach to E15 legislation that promotes fuel choice, supports investment certainty, and contributes to a stable and fair marketplace for American consumers, said Sommers.

“Refiners are now navigating shifting federal compliance structures, a patchwork of state mandates, and a biofuels marketplace that is uncertain,” Sommers said in the letter sent to congressional leaders.

The legislation was introduced in response to eight Midwestern states that petitioned the Environmental Protection Agency to opt out of a summertime volatility waiver for E10, effectively requiring that their states be supplied E!5, a gasoline blend that could not be sold elsewhere during the summer months, said Sommers.

“To comply with the requests by these states, API member companies invested in new infrastructure and refinery operations to produce boutique, regional fuel blends necessary to meet those state-specific mandates,” Sommers said. But after the fuels were refined to produce E15 and delivered to the region in April, seven states asked to be exempt from their original requests, Sommers said.

“Mere days before these fuels were required at the terminal, EPA issued ‘emergency’ waivers that effectively negated the states’ original opt-out requests, turning these investments into sunk costs and creating unnecessary financial and operational harm to refiners,” said the API president.

Further complicating efforts by refiners to comply with federal requirements on gasoline blending, the Big Beautiful Bill signed by President Donald Trump on July 4 changed rules governing Section 45Z Clean Fuel Production Tax Credits, said Sommers. Tax credits were eliminated on feedstocks imported from countries with lower carbon intensity profiles, such as Brazil, noted Sommers.

“Because there is insufficient domestic feedstock to supply the available U.S. biofuel production capacity, foreign feedstocks will still be needed to ensure that U.S. production facilities can viably operate,” Sommers said.

The Honorable Greg Abbott

Office of the Governor

P.O. Box 12428

Austin, Texas 78711-2428

Dear Governor Abbott,

We write to ask you to protect Texas’s fishing and tourism industries by supporting efforts to reduce the harmful effects of microplastics on our coastal ecosystems.

Texas beaches hold deep meaning for many residents, woven into family traditions, summer getaways, and cherished time spent outdoors. Beyond their cultural importance, these coastlines contribute billions of dollars each year to the state economy through tourism, commercial and recreational fishing, and the many local businesses that rely on a thriving, healthy shoreline.

Unfortunately, these vital industries are under increasing threat from microplastic pollution. Microplastics–particularly pre-production plastic pellets–are accumulating along Texas’s coast, harming marine life, degrading natural beauty, and jeopardizing public health and economic stability.

Texas is home to at least 36 plastic production facilities and is the largest manufacturer of pre-production plastics in the United States. These facilities are major contributors to plastic pellet pollution. Wildlife such as fish, turtles, and birds often ingest these plastics, leading to intestinal blockages, starvation, and exposure to harmful pollutants. The presence of microplastics in fish can reduce their growth and reproductive capacity, threatening the commercial and recreational fishing sectors by decreasing yield and production. Additionally, the potential for toxic chemical transfer from microplastics to humans via seafood consumption presents serious health concerns and may discourage people from purchasing Texas-caught seafood.

The economic consequences are severe. The outdoor recreation industry in Texas supports nearly 300,000 jobs, $14 billion in salaries, and $31 billion in total value added to the state’s economy. Yet, Texas beaches are swamped with ten times as much plastic trash as other Gulf Coast beaches–an alarming disparity that could deter tourists and harm local businesses.

As a first step, we urge you to direct the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality to adopt standards, as part of the current revision of the Surface Water Quality Standards, to prevent the discharge of preproduction plastics into our waterways.

Protecting our coastline is not just an environmental issue–it’s an economic imperative for Texas. We urge you to take meaningful action to preserve the natural resources, industries, and way of life that so many Texans depend on.

Sincerely,

Picture this: Your current GM car runs on roughly 30 to 40 separate computer boxes.
GM plans to merge these scattered units into one central computer core.
Three hub stations will connect to hundreds of sensors throughout the vehicle, translating their signals into commands the core can execute instantly.

The Detroit giant plans to rip apart how its vehicles think and move, replacing dozens of tiny computers with a brain that actually works like one.

The transformation goes live in 2027 with the Cadillac Escalade IQ. By 2028, every GM vehicle rolling off the line—gas or electric—gets this treatment.

Picture this: Your current GM car runs on roughly 30 to 40 separate computer boxes. Each handles its own job. The radio doesn’t talk to the brakes. The navigation system operates independently from the steering. It’s inefficient and slow.

GM plans to merge these scattered units into one central computer core. Three hub stations will connect to hundreds of sensors throughout the vehicle, translating their signals into commands the core can execute instantly. Nvidia’s Drive AGX Thor supercomputer powers the whole operation, an expanded deal between the two companies revealed back in March.

The change runs deeper than hardware. GM’s aiming for a car that learns, adapts, and improves while parked in your garage. Think software updates that arrive wirelessly and actually matter—better performance, new features, fixed bugs. Tesla mastered this years ago. Chinese automakers threaten with similar capabilities.

Chief Product Officer Sterling Anderson arrived in May with urgency. He sees the new architecture as mandatory infrastructure.

“Going forward, on the core business, my focus has really been around speed, user experience of the product, and profitability,” Anderson told TechCrunch. “We’re looking across the business to find opportunities to dramatically reduce the development time for our vehicle platforms. Today, it’s on the order of four to five years. I’d like to get it closer to two.”

That timeline compression matters. Four to five years currently separate concept from consumer. Anderson wants two.

The payoff includes practical magic: a conversational AI assistant that responds naturally, hands-free highway driving while you stream movies, systems that diagnose and repair themselves remotely. GM promises 10 times more over-the-air update capacity than current models. Bandwidth jumps 1,000-fold. AI performance for autonomous features climbs 35 times higher.

A high-speed Ethernet backbone connects everything—propulsion, steering, brakes, entertainment, safety systems. No more isolated computers operating in silos.

GM didn’t start this journey yesterday. The Vehicle Intelligence Platform launched in 2020 to enable better data processing and wireless updates. Ultifi arrived in 2021 as a cloud-based software layer, though GM quietly retired the branding while keeping the technology. A 2022 consolidation merged the infotainment system’s multiple computers into one unit.

This latest blueprint builds on that foundation but goes further. GM bills it as a complete rethink of vehicle design, maintenance, and evolution.

Tesla took the software-first path from day one, building cars like smartphones on wheels. Legacy manufacturers spent the last decade scrambling to replicate that approach, pouring billions into catching up. The consensus emerged: outdated electrical architecture holds everyone back. Modern features demand modern infrastructure.

GM’s solution resembles the zonal architectures Tesla and Rivian use, though with distinct differences. The principle stays consistent—centralized intelligence beats distributed confusion.",https://www.technology.org/texorgwp/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/peggy-paulson-EgJ0V5h9Wzo-unsplash.jpg,N,,2025-10-23 14:59:39.503287

“Federal regulators should follow the Fourth Circuit’s lead and do more to prevent monopolies from maintaining their position through non-economic, anticompetitive conduct,” they said.","A case potentially being heard by the U.S. Supreme Court this term could decide the future of Duke Energy’s business practices. “Duke Energy v. NTE Carolinas”, which involves the company’s operations in Fayetteville, N.C., the sixth-largest city in the state. The case is awaiting input from the U.S. Solicitor General before it proceeds to the U.S. Supreme Court.

NTE Carolinas first sued Duke Energy in 2019, alleging that Duke Energy has monopoly power over North Carolina’s energy market and has practiced anticompetitive conduct to maintain that power.

Duke Energy is one of the largest domestic energy companies in the U.S., serving almost 8 million customers and dominating the energy market in the Carolinas. NTE Carolinas is a Florida-based company that builds and operates power plants, but relies on the transmission lines of other companies, like Duke Energy, to get electricity to customers.

The case centers around whether Duke Energy prevented NTE from negotiating with the city of Fayetteville by offering immense discounts and disrupting the construction of a new power plant that NTE was building amid the contract negotiations. The North Carolina Western District Court ruled in favor of Duke Energy in 2022, finding it did not engage in anticompetitive behavior.

The 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals reversed this decision, finding the district court did not consider the whole of Duke’s conduct and there were genuine disputes over its actions. The court sent the case back to the district court level for further arguments.

Duke Energy has petitioned the Supreme Court to review the decision, saying the legal theory the appeals court used in its decision is outdated and legally incorrect. The dispute centers around the ‘monopoly broth’ theory, which “permits the aggregation of independently lawful business practices into a single antitrust violation.”

“If an antitrust plaintiff pleads a series of independently lawful acts, each of which does not violate this Court’s precedents, those acts cannot together add up to some nebulous antitrust violation,” Duke’s lawyers wrote. “The court of appeals concluded otherwise, embracing a ‘monopoly broth’ theory prominent in the 1960s to 1980s but long since discarded.”

Lawyers for NTE Carolinas argued that anticompetitive behavior can’t always be neatly labeled, and a reasonable jury would look at the sum of all their actions as anticompetitive.

“Because this Court’s specific tests for common types of monopolistic conduct do not cover all the ‘many different forms’ of anticompetitive conduct, which ‘cannot always be categorized,’ the court below also considered Duke’s course of conduct ‘as a whole’ and found that a reasonable jury could find it anti-competitive,” NTE Carolinas’ lawyers wrote.

Kent Chandler and Joshua Macey wrote in Bloomberg Law the importance of this case and called for the government to pursue more of these antitrust cases in the future.

“Federal regulators should follow the Fourth Circuit’s lead and do more to prevent monopolies from maintaining their position through non-economic, anticompetitive conduct,” they said. “Until they do, electric bills across the country will be unnecessarily high, and existing monopolists will keep new resources out of the market.

The Court is considering taking up the case but is awaiting input from the U.S. Solicitor General before deciding to formally hear arguments in it. Now that the Court’s October term has begun, the decision to hear the case could come soon. If it does not decide to take the case, the case will be sent back down to the district court.",https://wfuogb.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/duke-energy.jpg,N,,2025-10-23 18:19:04.559168

You probably already know her work from The News & Observer, but now that she’s on the team, we wanted to give Korie a chance to tell you a little more about herself.

What’s your favorite story from your time on the higher ed beat?

It’s hard to pick one, but last summer I wrote about the impacts of UNC Asheville cutting academic programs that were central to the university’s longstanding liberal-arts mission. I interviewed professors from the cut programs, including one who had dedicated nearly 20 years of his career to starting and shepherding the religious studies department. Their stories, as well as those of students in the eliminated programs, showed the personal fallout.

The story also zoomed out to show how the cuts were indicative of trends at the state level, where falling enrollment at public universities can lead to budget constraints, and at the national level, where fewer students are completing degrees in the liberal arts and humanities. And it looked ahead, too, pondering where UNC Asheville would go from there.

Now, there are more questions about the university’s future and its millennial campus, which I’m curious to see unfold.

We tried (and sort of failed) to have a recurring feature called “The Quad on quads.” What’s your best memory from a North Carolina campus quad?

This is an easy one; I literally wrote about it right before I graduated. Early in my senior year at UNC-Chapel Hill, during the pandemic, my friends and I got together for a picnic on Polk Place. We chatted, ate some takeout, and watched the sunset. And as I looked around at the quad around me—surrounded by all of the buildings where I attended classes and the brick paths I tripped on—I became silently sentimental, realizing my time at UNC-CH would come to an end in a matter of months. I’m probably romanticizing it too much, but it was a perfect moment.

What was the coolest class you took in college?

I minored in Southern studies, so I took a lot of great classes about culture, literature, folklore, politics, and other disciplines in the American South. One of the coolest courses was a food studies class taught by professor Kelly Alexander, which urged us to think critically about food’s intersections with race, gender, class, and other factors. We learned about “rage baking,” debates over tipping, the environmental impacts of North Carolina’s pork industry, Indigenous foodways, and more. It was very hands-on, even though the course met virtually (another sign of my COVID-era college life). We ran a class Instagram account where we posted many of our homework assignments, including our attempts at making meals following federal school lunch guidelines. We also learned how to make biscuits over Zoom! (Don’t ask me how mine turned out.)

This means you could easily deploy the panel when you arrive at the office, and then retract it when you’re ready to go home.

While the Ao-Solar Extender’s usefulness would vary by location and weather conditions, the company estimates that owners could capture enough solar power to drive 1,864 miles (3,000 km) annually.

That doesn’t sound like much, but the average American drives less than 40 miles (64 km) per day, so you’re looking at more than a month and a half of range from the sun alone.

Nissan said they studied the usage patterns of Sakura drivers and found that many customers only travel short distances. For some, the Ao-Solar Extender would be able to “virtually eliminate the need for external charging.”

That’s pretty nifty, and Nissan noted that when the panel is extended, it effectively acts as a sunshade. This helps to keep the Sakura’s interior cool, which reduces power consumption by the air conditioner when you return.

And in true Japanese fashion, Nissan has given it one more layer of usefulness, allowing the Ao-Solar Extender to function as a backup power source during emergencies.",https://www.carscoops.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/251022-01_A4_09497-copy-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-10-23 14:06:23.325085

The world has shifted so significantly since then. I think it’s safe to say that the project is not going to happen as we had originally foresaw or planned or hoped.""

The MEDC notified top lawmakers of the move Thursday. Legislative committees narrowly blessed the incentives in 2023, the fourth package for a new EV battery-related plant in 13 months. Two have not come to fruition.

The development signals the end of an economic development project that three years ago was billed as the largest in Northern Michigan’s history, but ran into local backlash and broader political opposition despite having been touted by Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, Ferris State University President Bill Pink and others. In 2024, Gotion sued Green Township in Mecosta County, where the factory would have been built, alleging breach of contract after a recall election in which board members who supported the plant were replaced by trustees opposing it.

In a Sept. 17 letter to Gotion representative Chuck Thelen, MSF Fund Manager Matthew Casby said the company was in default of its grant agreement obligations for ""voluntary abandonment"" of the project because no eligible activities had occurred at the property for more than 120 consecutive days. It was also in default due to at least two lawsuits related to the project, ""each of which is having a material adverse effect on the Project and the Company's performance,"" he wrote.

Gotion attorney Mark Heusel responded on Oct. 15, saying the business was ""shocked"" over the letter given ""immense challenges"" it has experienced in Michigan. He called the suggestion that it had abandoned the project “utterly false” and said “it was instead the community that the state of Michigan led Gotion to that abandoned this Project.""

""These well-documented challenges, false accusations, and politically motivated attacks were not through any actions or inactions by Gotion, but solely due to racist and ethnically charged stereotypes that led Green Charter Township to breach the parties’ Development Agreement,” Heusel wrote, calling the breach “brazen and intentional.”

The company indicated in its most recent progress report to the state in October that no jobs had been created as part of the project.

In its response letter to the MEDC, Gotion’s attorney disputes the claim that “no eligible activities” have occurred with the project in the past four months, arguing that professional fees, property taxes, maintenance fees and utility costs qualify as “capital expenditures” under the agreement.

Noting that Green Township has no intention of allowing construction to proceed, he urged the state to suspend its default notice for six months so all interested parties can discuss the project’s viability and a long-term plan for the site.

""Gotion has invested millions of dollars to move forward with this site, but if neither the local governments nor the state of Michigan will support the project, then all stakeholders should be involved in a solution-based conversation,"" he said.

The collapse of the deal comes at a tense time for U.S.-China relations, strained by new tariffs and escalating trade restrictions. U.S. automakers are working to reduce their supply chain exposure to the Far East, which has become a leader in next-generation EVs due to rapid technology development and a near stranglehold on natural resources used to make batteries.

Proponents of Michigan’s agreement with Gotion, among the world's largest battery makers, lauded the project as a big step toward building a domestic supply chain before it became perhaps the most highly criticized Chinese project in the U.S. in recent years. Republicans in Congress and the state Legislature raised concerns about Gotion's ties to the Chinese Communist Party.

Armstrong said she is hopeful that an ""amicable resolution"" can be reached so the state will recoup the $23.7 million Strategic Site Readiness Program funds that were transferred to The Right Place, a Grand Rapids-based economic development agency, and in turn to Gotion to purchase 270 acres. The Michigan Strategic Fund could take title of the property if it is unable to recoup the money but wants to avoid a foreclosure process, she said.

The state will also move to terminate a Renaissance Zone property tax exemption worth $540 million over 30 years.

Asked if the company has confirmed it is stepping back from the project, Armstrong said: “I think that they are seeing the very real challenges to this project as well. They have to make some business decisions, obviously, themselves to move forward. I think more or less they’ve arrived at that same conclusion.”

Heusel told Crain’s that while Gotion has not ""abandoned"" the project, the company ""recognizes the significance of the hurdles that have been placed in front of this project by those who oppose it.""

""Without their support, neither this project nor any other project could be completed at this site,"" Heusel said in an email. ""The current steps taken by the MSF are a direct result of those actions by the local municipalities. Nonetheless, we welcome a conversation with the state and the local governments regarding the future of this development.""

Armstrong said conversations have occurred, and ""we know that they want to see an amicable resolution on the repayment event as well.""

The Right Place said it was awaiting further guidance concerning next steps with the disbursed and remaining Strategic Site Readiness Program funds.

Crain's reached out to Chuck Thelen, who had led Gotion's project in Green Township, to inquire about the company's plans.

It appears unlikely that the project would continue elsewhere in Michigan.

""At this time, we do not believe that is the scenario,"" Michelle Grinnell, chief communications and attraction officer for the MEDC, said in an email. ""If the company were considering it, we would have to evaluate that opportunity from square one with a fresh set of fact patterns.""

EV demand was falling far short of expectations even before the Trump administration cut the $7,500 consumer tax credit, which is set to cool sales of battery electric cars even more. But many automotive executives and experts still believe EVs are the future. For that reason, the Gotion project could have still been viable from a business perspective, said Tu Le, managing director of Sino Auto Insights, a global mobility advisory firm.

""If we want to accelerate the affordability of clean energy vehicles, then yes, the project was still viable,"" Le said. ""The narrative is that electric vehicle demand is going to fall off a cliff. Yes, momentum is slow; no, it's not going off a cliff.""

Rivals Ford Motor Co. and General Motors Co. are working to launch more affordable EVs and racing to be first to market with lithium-manganese-rich (LMR) batteries, thought to be key to cutting costs. Ford plans to launch production next year at its lithium iron phosphate battery plant in Marshall, which was built despite local protest and outcry over its licensing tech deal with Chinese battery giant CATL. Those batteries will supply lower-cost, mid-size pickup trucks launching in 2027.

Once EV prices fall and demand takes off, auto companies will again be looking to make big investments in the U.S., Le said. The Gotion fiasco could hurt Michigan's chances of landing them.

""This is thousands of jobs,"" he said. ""For Michigan, that's a missed opportunity, and it creates a reputation of not being friendly to foreign direct investment, no matter where it comes from.""

Pulling the plug on Gotion is a major loss for supporters who saw the factory as an opportunity to improve life for a poor part of rural Michigan that has few job options. Whitmer's office declined to comment Thursday, deferring to the MEDC.

It is a huge victory for the grassroots opposition that gained steam and international attention as the project became a political football.

U.S. Rep. John Moolenaar, a Republican whose district includes the site of the would-be plant, issued a statement Thursday saying Green Township residents ""repeatedly showed us they do not support a company beholden to the Chinese Communist Party setting up shop in their town. ... While fighting the rural community, the company was derelict in its responsibilities to the State. Now that its contract with the State of Michigan and MEDC is set to be terminated, the people of Green Charter Township can finally move on from Gotion's lies and broken promises.""

The Gotion project's demise is the latest setback for Michigan after it created a new economic development fund almost four years ago and used billions of dollars to secure several new factories and prep sites.

US electric vehicle giant Tesla's net income dropped 37% year-on-year in the third quarter, despite a recovery in sales from the previous two quarters' declines and a rush by consumers to take advantage of a federal tax credit.

The firm’s net income dropped to $1.37 billion in the third quarter from $2.17 billion a year earlier, even though American consumers rushed to purchase electric cars prior to the expiration of a $7,500 federal tax credit last month.

Meanwhile, revenue amounted to $28.1 billion in the June-September period, up 12% from $25.18 billion a year earlier.

The EV firm also reported a 6% rise in automotive revenue to $21.2 billion from $20 billion during the same period last year.

The federal tax incentives for electric vehicles, which were removed as part of President Donald Trump's funding package, expired at the end of the quarter. Customers hurried to take advantage of the incentive before it expired, which pushed sales ahead into the quarter.

Automotive regulatory credit revenue dropped 44% from $739 million to $417 million during the quarter.

Additionally, rather than committing to delivering a specific quantity of electric vehicles and energy products by the year's end, Tesla said ""it is difficult to measure the impacts of shifting global trade and fiscal policies on the automotive and energy supply chains, our cost structure, and demand for durable goods and related services,"" according to CNBC.

CEO Elon Musk and Chief Financial Officer Vaibhav Taneja alerted shareholders to the impact of increased tariff charges and the expiration of the tax credits during Tesla's most recent earnings call in July.

Even though overall sales growth has returned, Tesla's third quarter saw a persistent decline in sales in Europe, which was caused in part by customer backlash against Musk, political controversy, and competition from EV manufacturers such as Volkswagen and BYD.

In October, EVs represent just 5.2% of new-vehicle retail sales.
Incentive impact The change in EV sales mix is also affecting average transaction prices and average incentive spending.
‘The decline in manufacturers’ incentive spending is due almost entirely to reduced EV sales, since EVs typically have much higher discounts than non-EVs,’ King commented.","The electric vehicle (EV) share of new-car sales in the US is forecast to fall this month after incentives expired in September. J.D. Power unpacks its latest market expectations, including the impact on the different powertrains.

New-vehicle sales for October 2025, including retail and non-retail transactions, are projected to reach 1,249,800 units, a 6.9% year-on-year decrease. This month has 27 selling days, the same as October 2024.

The seasonally-adjusted annualised rate (SAAR) for total new-vehicle sales is expected to reach 15.1 million units, down 1.1 million units from October 2024. New-vehicle retail sales are projected to hit 1,051,400, a 5.9% year-on-year drop.

Expected but notable decline

‘October’s results reflect a notable, but expected decline in the new-vehicle sales pace, due almost entirely to sales of electric vehicles,’ said Thomas King, president of the data and analytics division at J.D. Power.

The expiration of federal EV credits on 30 September caused shoppers to pull their electric vehicle purchases forward. This drove a significant increase in sales and inflated the overall sales pace. In September, EVs accounted for 12.9% of new-vehicle retail sales, the highest ever, and well above the 8.5% recorded a year earlier.

Now that the federal EV credit has expired, the industry is dealing with the consequences of the accelerated purchases. In October, EVs represent just 5.2% of new-vehicle retail sales. On a volume basis, the technology is forecast to account for one million of the 1.2 million-unit decline in the industry sales pace compared with a month ago.

‘Despite the sharp deterioration in EV sales, the decline could have been worse. Actions by multiple manufacturers to reduce EV prices and increase discounts to offset the loss of the federal credit are helping to maintain EV affordability, thereby preventing an even larger decline in EV sales,’ King added.

For non-EVs, elevated transaction prices and restrained incentives are also contributing to the softer sales pace. Affordability pressures remain, with monthly finance payments reaching a record for the month of October at $758 (€653).

In response, more consumers are turning to extended 84-month loan terms, which are expected to account for 11.8% of financed sales this month. This is the second-highest level on record for the month of October.

Incentive impact

The change in EV sales mix is also affecting average transaction prices and average incentive spending. The average new-vehicle retail transaction price in October is expected to reach $46,057, up $994 (2.2%) from October 2024.

The average manufacturer incentive spend per vehicle is on track to reach $2,674, a decrease of $540 from September and a decrease of $444 from a year ago. Expressed as a percentage of manufacturer’s suggested retail price (MSRP), incentive spending is currently at 5.3%, down a percentage point (pp) from a year ago.

‘The decline in manufacturers’ incentive spending is due almost entirely to reduced EV sales, since EVs typically have much higher discounts than non-EVs,’ King commented. While the EV mix of industry is down, discounts on these models have increased to $13,161, up $2,211 from October 2024 and up $2,047 from September 2025, as manufacturers step in to replace some portion of the expired tax credit.

Discounts on non-EVs were $2,423 in October, down $282 from a year ago. While the decline in EV sales hurts manufacturers’ revenue performance, the mix shift to more profitable non-EVs, sold with lower incentives, is a positive for profitability.

‘Also, there are some positives for new-vehicle demand. Interest rates have edged lower and used-vehicle prices remain strong, thereby helping consumers with a trade-in,’ he added. The average interest rate for new-vehicle loans in October is 6.56%, a decrease of 14 basis points (one basis point is equal to 0.01%) from a year ago.

Used-car prices on the rise

‘The average used-vehicle price is trending toward $29,446, up $473 from a year ago. This reflects the combination of reduced supply of recent model-year used vehicles due to lower new-vehicle production during the pandemic, fewer lease maturities and manufacturers moderating discounts,’ King said.

The rise in used-vehicle prices is good news for new-vehicle buyers. A trade-in, as average trade-in equity, was up $386 in October to $8,378. That increase is partially offset by higher loan balances on vehicles being traded in. The number of new-vehicle buyers with negative equity on their trade-in is expected to reach 26.6%. This is an increase of 2.2pp from October 2024.

Elevated transaction prices in October are not enough to offset the lower sales pace, with consumers on track to spend nearly $46.1 billion on new vehicles this month. This is 4.2% lower than a year ago. Total retailer profit per unit, which includes vehicle gross plus finance and insurance income, is expected to be $2,295, up $97 from October 2024 and $137 from September 2025.

The improvement in retailer profit per unit is primarily a function of lower EV sales, which typically generate lower retailer profits than non-EVs. Total aggregate retailer profit from new-vehicle sales for this month is projected to be $2.3 billion, down 2.1% from a year ago.

Restrained manufacturer incentive spend

‘Looking ahead, the industry continues to navigate a complex mix of tariff-related cost pressures, challenging consumer affordability and EV-related disruption. November traditionally marks the beginning of the holiday sales event season, a period that typically features elevated manufacturer-backed promotional activity, including enhanced leases,’ King commented.

However, the number of leases set to expire in November and December is projected to be nearly 15% lower than the same period in 2024 and 48% lower than in 2023.

‘Throughout 2025, manufacturer incentive spending has been restrained, particularly in the now even more important non-EV segments. As manufacturers balance profitability with volume, the trajectory of sales will depend on how aggressively they choose to stimulate demand, especially during the holiday sales period. For now, most indicators point to relatively conservative strategies for the balance of the year,’ he concluded.

Sales details

Fleet sales are expected to total 198,412 units in October, down 12.1% from October 2024. Fleet volume is expected to account for 15.9% of total light-vehicle sales, down 0.9pp from a year ago.

Internal-combustion engine vehicles are projected to account for 79.2% of new-vehicle retail sales, an increase of 2.4pp from a year ago. Plug-in hybrids (PHEVs) are on pace to make up 1% of sales, down 1.4pp from October 2024, while EVs are expected to account for 5.2% of sales, down 3.4pp year on year. Full hybrids are expected to account for 14.2% of new-vehicle retail sales, up 2pp.

US final assembly vehicles are expected to make up 56.7% of sales in October, up 5.5pp from a year ago.

Trucks and SUVs are on pace to account for 82.3% of new-vehicle retail sales, up 1.3pp from October 2024.

Retail details

Retail inventory levels are currently at 2.27 million units, an 11.5% increase from October 2024.

The industry’s inventory days of supply are 61 days in October, up from 59 days a year ago.

The average new-vehicle retail transaction price in October is expected to reach $46,057, up $994 from October 2024. Transaction price as a percentage of MSRP rose to 90.5%, up 0.7pp from a year ago.

Retail buyers are on pace to spend $46.1 billion on new vehicles, down $2 billion from October 2024.

Average incentive spending per unit in October is expected to reach $2,674, down $444 from October 2024. Incentive spending as a percentage of the average MSRP is expected to decrease to 5.3%, down 1pp point from October 2024.

Average incentive spending per unit on trucks and SUVs in October is expected to be $2,798, down $473 from a year ago, while the average spending on cars is expected to be $2,068, down $350 from a year ago.

Leasing is expected to account for 20.5% of sales this month, down 2.7pp from a year ago.

Dealer details

The average time a new vehicle remains in the dealer’s possession before sale is expected to be 49 days in October, down from 50 days a year ago.

29.3% of vehicles sold in less than 10 days in October, down 1.8pp from a year ago.

Average monthly finance payments are on pace to be $758, up $21 from October 2024. The average interest rate for new-vehicle loans is expected to be 6.56%, down 0.14pp from a year ago.

So far in October, average used-vehicle retail prices are $29,446, up $473 from a year ago. Trade-in equity is trending towards $8,378, which is up $386 from a year ago.

26.6% of trade-ins are expected to carry negative equity this month, an increase of 2.2pp from October 2024.

Finance loans with terms greater than or equal to 84 months are expected to reach 11.8% of finance sales this month, up 2.2pp from October 2024.

Calculating market correction

‘The automotive industry is experiencing a significant recalibration in the EV segment in the first month following the expiration of the federal tax credits. October EV market share declined to 5.2% month-to-date, less than half of September’s 12.9%, signalling a notable shift in consumer demand and market dynamics,’ said Tyson Jominy, senior vice president of data and analytics at J.D. Power.

PHEVs are facing the steepest decline, with market share going from 2.2% in September to just 1% in October. As a result, carmakers and consumers are turning their attention to traditional hybrids, which have gained traction. The hybrid market share has risen to 14.2% month-to-date, up 2pp from last October, a near all-time high.

‘While hybrid growth is encouraging, the recent EV market correction underscores a critical lesson: consumers prefer having access to a range of powertrain options that deliver comparable value. A singular focus on any one technology, be it EVs or hybrids, risks repeating past missteps. A diversified strategy that embraces multiple powertrain solutions will be essential to meeting evolving consumer preferences,’ Jominy concluded.",https://autovista24.autovistagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2025/10/jd-power-23-10-25-e1761228523260.jpg,N,,2025-10-23 13:19:29.450112

TSCA is a federal law under which the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) evaluates chemicals to make sure human and environmental health will be protected before chemicals are allowed onto the marketplace.

Industry leaders and Republicans in Congress again signaled their desire to hasten federal reviews of new chemicals at a Senate hearing, while an environmental health expert warned such changes will lead to more pollution and human health impacts.

The hearing, held by the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works on Thursday, focused on the regulation of chemicals, specifically the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA). TSCA is a federal law under which the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) evaluates chemicals to make sure human and environmental health will be protected before chemicals are allowed onto the marketplace. Industry representatives have long called for changes to the act, which was updated in 2016 with bipartisan support, saying it is unnecessarily cumbersome and that the slow review process stifles innovation.

Environmental and health advocates, however, say it is a key defense against an onslaught of toxics that people — especially vulnerable populations like pregnant women, children, workers and frontline communities near polluting industries — are routinely exposed to.

“While industry says ‘faster, faster’ and uses buzz words like ‘progress and innovation,’ it is essential that policymakers understand the repercussions of unleashing new toxic chemicals on the population,” Tracey Woodruff, director of the Program on Reproductive Health and the Environment at the University of California, San Francisco, said at the hearing.

“Once [harmful chemicals] are out there, you can’t take them back, and the result is that people get sick and die,” she said.

The other two witnesses —Gwen Gross, senior technical fellow at The Boeing Company, and Peter Huntsman, president and CEO of the Huntsman Corporation, which manufactures chemicals — argued that the TSCA review process is too slow, creating uncertainty for companies and pushing chemical innovations out of the US into other countries.

“This regulatory uncertainty and delay holds back innovation and makes it difficult to invest in technologies we desperately need … 15 to 20 years ago, the vast majority of new chemistry science came from the United States and Europe,” Huntsman said. “Today, we see China, India, Southeast Asian countries, and the Middle East region investing billions to not just match our innovation, but to exceed our capabilities.”

Huntsman also said speedier reviews are an environmental win. “The vast majority of new chemistry” is to replace older, potentially harmful chemicals, he said.

In addressing chemical review delays, Woodruff said they’re often due to staffing shortages at the EPA and companies needing to submit more data.

“Once [harmful chemicals] are out there, you can’t take them back, and the result is that people get sick and die.” -Tracey Woodruff, Program on Reproductive Health and the Environment at the University of California, San Francisco

She added that the agency has approved an estimated 3,600 chemicals over the last eight years, including “low-volume exemptions for over 600 PFAS, a class of over 15,000 chemicals so persistent they have been detected in nearly all people tested” and a jet and boat fuel chemical that has a cancer risk 250,000 times greater than the level usually considered acceptable by the EPA.

The hearing fell along partisan lines, with Republican senators agreeing with Huntsman and Gross, saying federal chemical reviews are too slow and unreliable. Several Republicans cited national security concerns resulting from chemical review delays, and said the US already has some of the most health-protective environmental regulations in the world.

“Speed matters, but predictability matters as well,” said Republican Senator Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia, who chairs the committee.

Capito did try to find common ground on PFAS, encouraging senators across the aisle to tackle the widespread contaminants. “This problem is not going away and it hasn’t been addressed as aggressively as we can and should,” she said.

Lobbyists in charge

The hearing took place as the EPA is already proposing to remove TSCA amendments made in 2024 under the Biden administration. The proposed changes include removing the 2024 amendment that required the agency to consider every use and exposure route of a chemical when evaluating risk. Other proposed changes include scaling back how much information manufacturers need to provide for a proposed chemical; considering personal protection and safety equipment use when evaluating workplace chemical risks; and allowing the agency to determine if certain uses of a chemical carry unreasonable risks instead of making a single risk judgment based on all of the chemical’s uses. The agency is currently accepting public comments on the changes.

The EPA also keeps adding former industry lobbyists to the office that manages TSCA. Douglas Troutman, waiting for Senate confirmation to be the Office of Chemical Safety and Pollution Prevention’s assistant administrator, most recently served as an interim CEO and lobbyist at the American Cleaning Institute, an organization that represents that supply chain of cleaning products and frequently pushes back against the regulation of chemicals in the past, including TSCA.

“Speed matters, but predictability matters as well.” – Republican Senator Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia

He will join Nancy Beck, a former chemical industry executive with the American Chemistry Council (ACC) and now the office’s principal deputy assistant administrator, and Lynn Ann Dekleva, formerly with DuPont and the ACC. The ACC calls TSCA implementation “inconsistent, unpredictable, and increasingly disconnected from real-world scenarios” and has called for an overhaul.

Woodruff said the “revolving door” between the EPA and industry is a longstanding problem across administrations and adds to the pressure on the agency to approve potentially harmful chemicals.

“With the chemical lobby pouring millions of dollars into influencing the regulatory process, we have seen troubling patterns of EPA brushing aside rigorous science showing health risks, ignoring dangerous exposures to more than half of exposed populations, and weakening rules for scientific assessments,” Woodruff said.

Democratic Senator Jeff Merkley of Oregon said TSCA was imperfect, but weakening it was not the answer.

“TSCA can be improved,” Se. Merkley said. “But our highest priority must be to protect public health. Pollution isn’t partisan … it is our shared responsibility.”",https://www.thenewlede.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-23-at-10.32.14-AM-1024x567.png,N,,2025-10-23 13:04:32.168928

The EPA’s failures on toxic neonics highlight a broken process Let’s take just one example, drawn from NRDC’s work on neonicotinoid pesticides (neonics).
But when neonics were first approved, there was only industry-funded testing to show how the chemicals may affect our health.
And while it’s often hard to link particular harms to particular chemicals in a complex world, our health—especially our children’s health—almost certainly suffers.
Of course, the MAHA Commission knew as much, and it warned about this in its initial draft report.","Before he was our secretary of Health and Human Services, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. vowed to “ban the worst agricultural chemicals already banned in other countries.”

And just last May, his Make America Healthy Again (MAHA) Commission identified the one billion pounds of pesticides—like atrazine, glyphosate, and chlorpyrifos—used in the United States as being a serious threat to children’s health, citing industry-funded and ghostwritten studies as well as weak laws and regulations as part of the problem.

So when the commission released its final “strategy” to protect children’s health this fall, what was its bold prescription for how we regulate pesticides? Don’t change a thing. Instead, it recommended that the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) work with “food and agricultural stakeholders” (aka chemical companies) to make sure the public has confidence in the EPA’s “robust review procedures” for pesticides.

If your head is spinning, don’t worry: It’s a common symptom of witnessing extreme backpedaling.

The reality is that the commission got it right the first time. The EPA’s pesticide-approval process is too weak, too infrequent, and too discretionary to protect our health (or that of other species we share the earth with, like bees, butterflies, and birds).

Many of the toxicity studies that the EPA relies on are paid for and submitted by chemical companies. Making matters worse, the EPA’s notoriously industry-friendly pesticide office has a history of pressuring staff to approve pesticides and look the other way on documented risks. Once a pesticide is approved, the EPA does only the bare minimum required by law, which is a review once every 15 years. The agency almost never uses its authority to cancel pesticides that fail to meet the legal safety standard, instead engaging in years-long negotiations with pesticide manufacturers while leaving the toxic products on the market.

The EPA’s failures on toxic neonics highlight a broken process

Let’s take just one example, drawn from NRDC’s work on neonicotinoid pesticides (neonics). Neonics are neurotoxic insecticides—perhaps the most widely used in U.S. history—that mimic nicotine. If you haven’t heard of neonics, you’ve still likely eaten or drunk them: Monitoring by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found neonics in about half the U.S. population, and more recent testing found them in more than 95 percent of pregnant women tested across the country.

Today, we have a growing body of science linking neonics to a host of neurological and hormonal harms, including birth defects of the heart and brain, cognitive impairment, and reduced sperm and testosterone. But when neonics were first approved, there was only industry-funded testing to show how the chemicals may affect our health.

Those tests showed some alarming effects. Rodents exposed to neonics before birth had thinning in key areas of the brain, among other harms. Yet the EPA let industry applicants off the hook when they failed to submit missing data the agency asked for. Even worse, when it came time to set the maximum acceptable level for neonics in food, the EPA waived important protections designed to safeguard children’s brains, permitting 10 times more of the nicotine-like chemicals than the law allows in everything from tap water to fruits and vegetables and even baby foods.

While we’ve petitioned the agency, it’s unlikely the EPA will change course. And although the agency’s review of neonics is a big failure, given their vast use, neonics are by no means unique. NRDC also sued the EPA for failing to cancel uses of organophosphate pesticides like chlorpyrifos, which are so dangerous that even the agency finds that they pose serious health harms for families and farmworkers.

Ignoring the problem won’t make America healthy again

Unless the EPA takes action, Americans will continue to be on the losing end of this process, where pesticides banned or restricted in other countries slip through the system here, and we all get exposed as a result. And while it’s often hard to link particular harms to particular chemicals in a complex world, our health—especially our children’s health—almost certainly suffers.

Of course, the MAHA Commission knew as much, and it warned about this in its initial draft report.

Ask the commission today, however, and you’ll hear its members singing a different tune. It’s actually the same one that the chemical industry has been singing for years: Don’t worry, be happy.",https://www.nrdc.org/sites/default/files/styles/social_sharing_1200x630/public/2025-10/GettyImages-1195441728.jpg?h=790be497&itok=XwxiCvqZ,N,,2025-10-23 13:04:36.951113

CNBC also reported that in recent earnings, Wells Fargo raised its return on tangible common equity (ROTCE) targets by 17–18% over the medium term - more than double what it was in the fourth quarter of 2020.","Wells Fargo is reinforcing its leadership in innovation and employee experience by opening of its new state-of-the-art campus in the Las Colinas neighbourhood of Irving, Texas.

The 850,000-square-foot facility represents a major corporate investment in the Dallas-Fort Worth area and underscores the company’s commitment to advancing technology, collaboration and community impact.

Discussing the new facility Wells Fargo CEO and Chairman Charlie Scharf says: “By bringing our Dallas-Fort Worth area employees together in this dynamic environment, we’re better positioned to support our clients and customers across Texas and the US.

“The space was thoughtfully designed to inspire collaboration, drive success, and foster a sense of connection, both within our teams and within the community.”

According to Wells Fargo, the new campus brings together 4,500 employees in a modern, sustainable environment that embodies Wells Fargo’s vision for the future of work.

Designed to be the company’s first energy net-positive campus, the facility integrates cutting-edge technology such as solar power, smart irrigation systems and dynamic glass that adjusts to sunlight and weather.

The Las Colinas location aims to drive innovation not only in financial services but also for growth in community engagement.

Sustainability and community investment

Wells Fargo’s Las Colinas campus stands as a model for sustainability, representing the company’s broader strategy to align innovation with community impact.

The 22-acre development features solar energy generation, advanced energy management systems and eco-friendly landscaping designed to reduce water usage.

According to the company, the campus is intended to be its first energy net-positive facility, meaning it will produce more energy than it consumes over time.

Beyond environmental innovation, Wells Fargo continues to invest deeply in Texas communities.

As part of the campus opening, the company announced a US$1m donation to OneStar Foundation for the Central Texas Flood Recovery Fund, bringing its total flood relief and recovery contributions across the state this year to US$2m.

Since 2020, Wells Fargo and the Wells Fargo Foundation have donated approximately US$90m to support housing, small businesses, financial health and other local needs, with employees volunteering more than 235,000 hours state-wide.

Speaking in an interview with CNBC at the opening of the campus, Charlie said that while “the coasts are extremely important for lots of reasons both in terms of size of the economies and the talent,” the company’s future depends on being nationally grounded.

“The only way you really have an understanding of what this country is, what it can be, who lives here, who can add value to us, it’s helpful to be places other than the coasts,” Charlie said.

In a separate interview with Fortune, Charlie discussed the company’s long-term growth strategy, noting that lifting the asset cap that restricted deposits and securities to US$1.95tn could pave the way for renewed expansion.

“The goal is to win that back and a whole lot more,” he said.

CNBC also reported that in recent earnings, Wells Fargo raised its return on tangible common equity (ROTCE) targets by 17–18% over the medium term - more than double what it was in the fourth quarter of 2020.

But the data centers powering the AI boom suck up so much energy, so fast, it's increasingly jacking up prices for nearby ordinary residents.
The dynamic unfolds like this, as narrated by Axios national energy correspondent Amy Harder: AI = data = energy.
Energy is so central to data centers that their capacity is measured — and companies are billed — based on power consumption.
The projected price of future power capacity in America's largest grid has jumped more than 1,000% in just two years, due largely to the energy demand of AI centers.","America faces an economy-shaping energy jam: We've never needed more of it more urgently to meet rising consumer and business demand.

Why it matters: We produce and export more energy than at any point in history. But the data centers powering the AI boom suck up so much energy, so fast, it's increasingly jacking up prices for nearby ordinary residents.

The big picture: This dynamic — surging demand and finite supply — is playing out in community after community. It creates a difficult tension for President Trump, who wants both to accelerate AI and slow energy spikes for consumers.

Campaigning in a barn in Pennsylvania last year, Trump said: ""Your energy bill, within 12 months, will be cut in half. ... We have more energy under our feet than any other country. I call it liquid gold.""

Yet the AI frenzy is juicing demand for energy-hungry data centers, which have raised wholesale electricity prices for tens of thousands of cities, towns and suburbs around the U.S. — from the classic heartland hub of Columbus, Ohio, to the Northern Virginia sprawl known as Data Center Alley.

And the data center boom is only beginning. In an executive order this summer, Trump said that as part of conjuring ""a golden age for American manufacturing and technological dominance,"" his administration will accelerate federal permitting of data center infrastructure, ""including high‑voltage transmission lines and other equipment.""

The dynamic unfolds like this, as narrated by Axios national energy correspondent Amy Harder:

AI = data = energy. Energy is so central to data centers that their capacity is measured — and companies are billed — based on power consumption.

The data centers promise jobs and economic growth. So state and local officials solicit them eagerly, sometimes making tax break deals that are drawing increasing skepticism and opposition from Oregon to Pennsylvania.

The AI companies or others racing to serve them pay top dollar for the land, and promise additional benefits to nearby communities to build there.

But they require awesome amounts of energy to power and cool the football-field-size facilities. Oftentimes, this means they can easily outbid consumers for the finite energy supplies.

That's a big — and increasingly controversial — reason why consumer electricity prices have risen an average of 6.5% over the past year across the U.S.

The average masks big discrepancies between and even within states. Specific communities where data centers are most prolific face the brunt, including Maryland and Virginia.

Over five years, wholesale electricity costs have risen as much as 267% in areas near U.S. data hubs, a Bloomberg analysis found last month.

Reality check: It's not just data centers. Lots of complicated factors fuel power prices, including system maintenance and increased reliance on electricity for a range of things like cars.

A ""Bring Your Own Power"" boom has some tech companies building their own power plants to fuel data centers, resulting in ""an energy Wild West that is reshaping American power,"" the Wall Street Journal reports.

Friction point: Alongside higher prices, opposition to data centers — a rare bipartisan issue — is popping up in campaigns and legislatures from coast to coast. It's a ""populist backlash that cuts across party lines,"" as Fortune put it.

Multiple proposals for data centers in the Richmond, Virginia, region have been rejected or withdrawn in recent months, Axios reported this week.

And power capacity is an area where China is lapping the U.S.: China boasts that it produced more terawatt hours of electricity last year than the U.S., EU and India combined.

What's next: Electricity costs are almost certain to climb in the years ahead for densely populated areas of the mid-Atlantic and Midwest. The projected price of future power capacity in America's largest grid has jumped more than 1,000% in just two years, due largely to the energy demand of AI centers.

An AP-NORC poll out this week found that electricity bills are already a ""major"" source of stress for 36% of U.S. adults.

The bottom line: America no doubt holds the possibility for a domestic energy golden age — but not if consumers foot the bill. Add energy to the list of AI topics that could soon be make-or-break political issues.

Many applied technology and skilled trades industries are experiencing a severe shortage of qualified workers. With the construction of the Applied Technology Education Center (ATEC), Hudson Valley Community College will further help bolster a strong workforce pipeline to benefit both students and the companies who seek to hire them.

Empire State Development President, CEO and Commissioner Hope Knight said, “Governor Hochul’s strategic investments in workforce development are building the infrastructure to ensure that New York State has the skilled workers to meet the needs of growing industries with good-paying jobs. This state-of-the-art center at Hudson Valley Community College represents the latest step in our efforts and will provide training for high-demand jobs that will grow the state’s talent pipeline and strengthen our economy.”

New York State Department of Labor Commissioner Roberta Reardon said, “I thank Governor Hochul for continuing to support workforce development efforts that help New Yorkers secure great paying, in-demand careers of tomorrow. The new Applied Technology Education Center will play a pivotal role in feeding a critical workforce pipeline in the region that will help keep our economy moving forward.”

SUNY Chancellor John B. King Jr. said, “From the recent opening of the STEM Education Center in Malta to the future Applied Technology Education Center, Hudson Valley Community College is a leader in workforce development in the Capital Region. Our nation and state depend on skilled workers to maintain a thriving economy, and now, thanks to the $40 million investment secured by Governor Hochul, Hudson Valley Community College will expand to provide even more opportunities for graduates to succeed in these in-demand careers.”

The SUNY Board of Trustees said, “Thanks to the strong support of Governor Hochul and state leaders, community colleges throughout the state are able to provide a world class education for New Yorkers to unleash their full potential. We are proud to support our community colleges in this essential effort, and we thank Governor Hochul for this investment in Hudson Valley Community College for it to be even better equipped to train the workforce of tomorrow.”

Hudson Valley Community College President Michael Brophy said, “We are deeply grateful to Governor Kathy Hochul, SUNY Chancellor John King, Empire State Development and all of our state and local leaders for their historic investment and recognizing the importance of the Applied Technology Education Center (ATEC) to our students, workforce and economy. ATEC will train the next generation of applied technology and skilled trades workers to support industry expansion and New York State’s economic growth. It will also create greater opportunities for our dedicated faculty to support student learning and connect with under-resourced communities and teach the skills they need to fill the industry gaps with well-paid, family sustaining careers.”

ATEC will include specialized labs and classrooms with the latest tools, equipment, and technology to meet modern industry needs. The new building will replace aging structures on campus: Williams Hall, built in 1967, and Cogan Hall, built in 1984.

The college will begin construction this spring. In addition to the $40 million announced today, the campus received investment from the federal Economic Development Administration, Rensselaer County, and private sector partners and alumni donors.

Once completed, ATEC will enable Hudson Valley Community College to:

Increase applied technology/skilled trades program enrollment by 200 percent

Train up to 5,000 skilled technicians over the next decade

Expand existing programs and establish new ones to support emerging industries

Offer advanced certifications and non-credit workforce training programs to current industry professionals

Attract technical companies seeking a highly skilled workforce and industry resources

Hudson Valley Community College is a partner in the Center for Economic Growth’s (CEG) consortium for the One Network for Regional Advanced Manufacturing Partnerships (ON-RAMP) program - one of three newly designated ON-RAMP centers eligible to receive up to $40 million in funding. The college’s new 125,000 sq. ft. Applied Technology Education Center (ATEC) will serve as a satellite training location for skilled trades education and career training when construction is complete in 2027. At ATEC, the college will support and grow workforce training programs, launch new industry-based training, assist in recruitment, grow apprenticeship and pre-apprenticeship opportunities, connect students with wrap-around services, and develop and inform curriculum.

Today’s announcement complements Governor Hochul’s SUNY/CUNY Reconnect Program. Launched following passage of the FY26 Enacted Budget, SUNY and CUNY Reconnect now makes it possible for eligible adult students, ages 25-55, to pursue degrees in high-demand fields for free at all SUNY and CUNY community colleges. The response has been overwhelmingly positive with over 16,500 adult learners applying throughout the State.

Senator Charles Schumer said, “This is a tremendous investment by Governor Hochul and New York State, and I want to applaud Hudson Valley Community College as they embark on the construction of the Applied Technology Education Center – ATEC building. This facility is going to turbocharge our regional workforce development of skilled trades from construction to automotive to our burgeoning semiconductor industry and more. Last year, I secured $4 million from the Economic Development Administration for this project, and I cannot wait to see it being used to train the next generation of Capital Region workers.”

Senator Kirsten Gillibrand said, “This is a tremendous investment in Hudson Valley’s future. This funding will help ensure that HVCC students have the skills and resources needed to secure high-quality, good-paying jobs in high-demand fields. I am proud to deliver funding to our state’s community colleges every year and will continue to fight to create pathways to high-quality jobs.”

Representative Paul Tonko said, “Hudson Valley Community College continues to lead the charge in preparing Capital Region students for high-demand careers in growing local industries like renewable energy, semiconductor manufacturing, and automotive technology. For years, I’ve been proud to help deliver federal support for HVCC’s efforts — including through my ongoing efforts to secure $2 million in federal funding through the Community Project Funding process for the construction of a new Autonomous and Electric Vehicle Lab at the Applied Technology Education Center. Now, I’m thrilled to celebrate this groundbreaking investment in the ATEC program that underscores our shared commitment to creating opportunity for our students, bolstering our high-tech workforce pipeline, and strengthening the economic future of our region.”

State Senator Jake Ashby said, “This state investment is the culmination of years of bipartisan advocacy in the Senate and Assembly, the innovative vision of Hudson Valley's leadership team and the steadfast support of County Executive McLaughlin and SUNY officials. This is truly transformational. ATEC will create accessible, affordable pathways to rewarding careers in high-demand fields. It will ensure the Capital Region has the well-trained workforce we need to cement our position as a national leader in cutting edge manufacturing. It will generate billions of dollars in excellent wages, private sector investment and residual economic impact. I couldn't be more supportive of this program, and I'm grateful that the administration understands its importance.”

Assemblymember John T. McDonald III said, “Thank you to Governor Kathy Hochul for this significant investment in Hudson Valley Community College’s Applied Technology Education Center (ATEC). ATEC will be a state-of-the-art training center to address the significant need for employees who are trained in the skilled trades. We need to build this skill set in a new generation of workers and ATEC will not only address the growing demand but also will be on the cutting edge of technology and practices to ensure that those who complete the program have experience at the highest level of their fields. ATEC will create significant employment opportunities directly, but it will also lead to economic development and growth. I am a proud supporter of ATEC and appreciate the support of all of the partners who came together to bring this project to life.”

Capital Region Chamber and the Center for Economic Growth President and CEO Mark Eagan said, “Governor Hochul and New York State’s leaders have made a wise investment in ATEC that will yield a new generation of skilled workers to fill high-demand jobs and spur growth for years to come. On behalf of the thousands of businesses and organizations that make the Capital Region a more vibrant place to live and work, I share my great appreciation with the governor and Hudson Valley Community College for their vision and plan to enhance education and job training in the applied technologies and skilled trades fields. ATEC will allow the college to upskill the current workforce, expand current programming, create new short-term training options, and recruit new talent to industries essential to our business growth and economic infrastructure.”",https://www.governor.ny.gov/sites/default/files/styles/cover_image_660x400_/public/2025-10/hvcc_applied_tech_ed_center.jpg?h=69cabffc&itok=dFrSbWN7,N,,2025-10-23 12:23:16.935687

OTHER U.S. REGIONS

Texas first commercial produced water Li plant under construction

Select Water Solutions, Inc.

Select Water Solutions and Mariana Minerals broke ground on Texas’s first commercial produced water lithium extraction facility in Joaquin, Texas. The pioneering project, located in the Haynesville shale region, will leverage Select’s existing water treatment expertise and pipeline infrastructure to source oil and gas waste streams. Mariana Minerals will fund, design, construct, and operate the facility, which is designed to produce up to 3,000 metric tons per year of high-purity lithium salts. This initiative allows Select to monetize its existing assets, generating potential annual cash flow, while supporting the rebuilding of America’s critical minerals supply chain by converting produced water into marketable lithium, with commercial production targeted for the first half of 2027. [MDN: This is great news for American energy. We’d like to remind readers that there are two commercial lithium plants already up and running, sorting out the kinks, in Susquehanna County, PA (see our stories here), meaning we are way ahead of what’s happening in the Texas Haynesville.]

Japan’s JERA to buy US shale gas assets for $1.5 bln

Reuters/Anton Bridge, Kantaro Komiya

Japan’s largest power generator, JERA, is entering the U.S. shale gas market with a $1.5 billion acquisition of natural gas production assets in the Haynesville Shale basin in Louisiana. JERA is buying 100% of the interests in the South Mansfield gas field from pipeline operator Williams and GEP Haynesville II. This strategic move, which marks JERA’s first U.S. production entry, is intended to strengthen its natural gas value chain, which it views as a crucial transitional fuel for decarbonization. The current asset produces over 500 MMcf/d and JERA plans to significantly increase its output. The deal provides JERA with proven reserves and established infrastructure, giving it greater control over its supply chain as Japan anticipates rising power demand, notably from the AI-driven data center boom. [MDN: Welcome to the miracle of U.S. shale, JERA.]

NATIONAL

U.S. natural gas futures slip ahead of storage data

Wall Street Journal

U.S. natural gas futures settle lower in choppy trade ahead of the EIA’s weekly storage report. The supply-demand balance shows a “classic shoulder-season handoff,” with heating demand rising and power-sector use easing, Gelber & Associates said in a note. “The market still looks well supplied into November, but the recent uptick in heating demand and record-high feedgas help cap looseness at the margin.” Tomorrow’s storage report is expected to show an 81 Bcf injection, according to a WSJ survey of analysts, stretching the surplus over the five-year average to 158 Bcf from 154 Bcf the week before. Nymex natural gas for November settled down 0.7% at $3.450/mmBtu. [MDN: The price was down just 2 pennies. We’re still close to $3.50. Life is grand.]

BP, JERA halt US offshore wind activities

Rigzone/Jov Onsat

JERA Co Inc and BP PLC’s offshore wind joint venture, JERA Nex bp, has indefinitely shelved the 2.5-gigawatt Beacon Wind project, its sole U.S. asset, citing an unfavorable environment and “no viable path” to development. The company announced it will close all U.S. operating activities, resulting in all team members leaving in the coming months, though they maintain a belief in the market’s long-term potential. The project’s permitting process had already been paused, and the move follows a presidential memorandum ordering an indefinite halt to new wind leasing and a comprehensive review of existing leases. JERA Nex bp plans to maintain the Beacon lease and wait for a more favorable moment to resume the project, which secured 128,000 acres in federal waters. [MDN: When there’s no taxpayer funding of these boondoggles, they die, as they should. We won’t declare offshore wind dead, yet, but it’s certainly on life support. We say, pull the plug.]

The war on gas stoves is not over – but Trump admin is fighting back

Competitive Enterprise Institute/Ben Lieberman

The Department of Energy (DOE) is rescinding federal grants aimed at changing state and local building codes to discourage the use of natural gas in home appliances, a move lauded by the author as dismantling an unpopular effort to interfere with consumer choices. The article highlights a broader “war on the blue flame,” where climate change activists, partially through provisions in the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), have pursued the total end of residential natural gas use. Past threats of direct regulation, like proposed gas stove bans and efficiency standards, were met with strong public backlash. The IRA provided financial incentives for electric appliances and zero-emissions housing, but recent actions and pending legislation have curtailed much of this spending. The DOE’s rescission of grants for anti-gas building code changes is seen as protecting taxpayer money and energy choice. [MDN: These leftists never give up. They tried to end fossil fuel use via the misnamed IRA. The Trump admin must be (and is) vigilant in rooting out these disgusting programs that try to end gas stoves and other gas use in homes and businesses.]

Kinder Morgan posts higher third-quarter profit on stronger natural gas demand

Reuters/Sumit Saha

U.S. pipeline operator Kinder Morgan reported a slight rise in third-quarter profit to $628 million, primarily boosted by higher volumes of natural gas transported through its pipelines. This increase aligns with the company’s optimistic outlook for the U.S. LNG sector, which is seeing a resurgence after the lift on new export permits. CEO Kim Dang projects a 28 Bcf/d increase in natural gas demand by 2030, driven by LNG export growth, power generation, and Mexican exports. While the natural gas segment thrived, the company’s delivery volumes of refined products and its CO2 segment saw a slight decline due to lower fuel and renewable credit prices. Kinder Morgan’s project backlog remains strong at $9.3 billion. [MDN: Natgas is the future. Those companies, like KM, that are set up to flow natgas are benefiting.]

In practice, ‘net zero’ was exactly how much such pledges were worth

The Empowerment Alliance/Gary Abernathy

The article argues that global “net zero” emissions pledges are unrealistic political “delusions” that would devastate modern economies by requiring the abandonment of reliable energy. Despite commitments from 107 countries, a recent report shows nations plan to produce over twice the amount of fossil fuels consistent with the Paris Agreement’s 1.5°C goal by 2030, with the 20 most polluting countries increasing production. The author celebrates the U.S. shift toward “reliables,” citing President Trump’s withdrawal from the Paris Agreement and state subsidy rollbacks. The piece concludes by refuting climate catastrophe warnings, noting that, contrary to predictions, no hurricane had made landfall in the U.S. through September 2025, marking a ten-year first. [MDN: We love that term. Fossil fuels are “reliables” vs. renewables, which are unreliables.]

INTERNATIONAL

Oil closes higher as oversold signals ease

Bloomberg/Mia Gindis, Omar El Chmouri

Oil prices, with West Texas Intermediate (WTI) settling above $58 and Brent rising toward $63, gained ground after a technical gauge indicated that recent declines were excessive. This upward correction was supported by a US government report revealing a 4.2 million barrel drop in total US petroleum stockpiles, reaching the lowest level since late September and alleviating immediate oversupply fears. Though many traders still anticipate sizable inventory builds soon, this data, which aligned with an industry forecast, helped the market hold its recent gains. Further bullish sentiment came from the potential for a US-India trade deal that could boost demand for non-Russian crude, as well as a new round of EU sanctions against Russia. Despite these short-term boosts, oil remains on track for a third monthly loss due to signs of a global surplus, though the market’s backwardation structure still suggests tight short-term supplies. [MDN: WTI for December delivery rose 1.18% to settle at $58.50 a barrel. Brent for December settlement climbed 2% to settle at $62.59 a barrel. We continue to see the tug to return to the $60s for WTI. It will happen.]

EU adopts new sanctions on Russian energy

Bloomberg/Jorge Valero

The European Union adopted its 19th package of sanctions against Russia, aiming to cripple Moscow’s ability to finance its war in Ukraine. A central feature is the ban on Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) imports, effective from 2027. The measures, adopted after being stalled by Austria, Hungary, and Slovakia, also include tightening transaction bans on major Russian oil companies and sanctioning 117 “shadow fleet” vessels used for evasion. Furthermore, the EU is targeting 45 entities worldwide, including 12 firms in China and Hong Kong, for their roles in sanctions circumvention. Other restrictions involve a full transaction ban on five Russian banks and prohibiting reinsurance for used Russian aircraft and vessels, reflecting a continued push alongside the US to intensify economic pressure. [MDN: Good for the EU. But, as we typically say (especially with respect to a “ban” on LNG imports from Russia), we’ll believe it when we see it. Our prediction is that there will soon be a ceasefire, followed by some kind of deal, and all of this will be forgotten and the mentally lethargic EU will never fully ban Russian energy imports. Those imports are cheap and much closer than alternatives.]

Halliburton is branching into data-center power supplies as frack demand stagnates

EnergyNow.com

Halliburton Co., the world’s largest fracker, is diversifying into the booming artificial intelligence sector by generating power for data centers through a new partnership with VoltaGrid LLC. This strategic venture, initially focused on the Middle East, will supply turbines, engines, and proprietary technology to data-center developers. The move comes as demand for oilfield fracking slows due to slumping oil prices, a looming global supply glut, and reduced client spending in North America. The announcement, alongside strong third-quarter earnings, caused Halliburton’s stock to surge, with analysts citing the AI-power venture as a major catalyst. CEO Jeff Miller underscored the “unprecedented” demand for AI power driving the company’s diversification, which follows similar steps by competitors. [MDN: Everyone is getting in on the AI space.

Flannery carried the bill in the legislature earlier this year, but it didn’t move out of a House committee.
Rep. John Blanton, R-Salyersville, filed a similar bill during the 2024 legislative session, while the late Louisville Democratic Rep. Charles Miller first introduced the legislation in 2022.
Mike Buckentin, CEO of Bowling Green-based nonprofit Metals Innovation Initiative, told the committee that recent investments have been made in the metals industry, particularly in Kentucky.
“Kentucky is doing great, not just in manufacturing overall, but specifically in metals,” Buckentin said.","A Kentucky Republican plans to refile a bill next year to encourage the use of metals manufactured in the U.S. in state and local government construction projects.

Rep. Patrick Flannery, R-Olive Hill, presented the Kentucky Buy American Act to the legislature’s Interim Joint Committee on Economic Development and Workforce Investment Thursday morning, flanked by metal industry leaders and workers who support the legislation.

Flannery carried the bill in the legislature earlier this year, but it didn’t move out of a House committee. Rep. John Blanton, R-Salyersville, filed a similar bill during the 2024 legislative session, while the late Louisville Democratic Rep. Charles Miller first introduced the legislation in 2022.

“Really, what I want to do is make sure we can get something across the finish line that makes these products in America again, so we can use these and get people back to work,” Flannery told the committee Thursday.

The 2025 version of the bill would have mandated contracts for construction or maintenance of public buildings or public works projects, like roads, sewers and streets, include provisions that any of the iron, steel, aluminum or any of the other manufactured goods used as a primary component be manufactured in the U.S.

This year’s version also allowed governments to waive the Buy American requirement if it would increase the project’s cost by 10% or more. A local impact statement prepared by the Legislative Research Commission predicted the legislation would have a moderate to significant financial impact on local governments by driving up construction costs in possible several ways. No fiscal note is attached to the bill on the legislature’s site.

At the federal level, former President Joe Biden and President Donald Trump have supported buying American policies.

Chad Conley, a rapid response coordinator for United Steelworkers District 8, told the committee that the bill is “an opportunity to revitalize American manufacturing” by ensuring that public works projects in Kentucky utilize metals made in the U.S. At present, state agencies typically award contracts to the lowest bidder, “allowing foreign producers to undercut U.S. prices and win awards,” he said.

“State preference laws like this one can change that practice to require governments to accept a bid that might be marginally higher than the lowest bid with the knowledge that money spent will be circulated back into the American economy,” Conley added.

Mike Buckentin, CEO of Bowling Green-based nonprofit Metals Innovation Initiative, told the committee that recent investments have been made in the metals industry, particularly in Kentucky. In 2023, Nucor Steel opened a steel mill in Brandenburg, adding jobs to the Meade County community.

“Kentucky is doing great, not just in manufacturing overall, but specifically in metals,” Buckentin said. “We continue to grow, we continue to invest and we’re one of the leaders in the nation right now in metals and in manufacturing.”

Some members of the committee expressed support for the proposal. Rep. Al Gentry, D-Louisville, said that lawmakers must “be careful how we construct this.”

Kentuckians paid millions in electricity costs for a steel mill. The utility says it was justified.

“I’ve always said that one of the most important things in the jobs we do as legislators is we have to create an environment where businesses want to invest in the state and can operate and at the same time create good quality jobs, because putting people to work with good quality jobs is really one of the most important things we can do,” Gentry said.

At the end of the discussion, co-chair of the committee, Sen. Phillip Wheeler, R-Pikeville, called the proposal “a great concept.”

“For at least the last 30 or 40 years, some of the uniparty people in Washington have really caused some damage to our national security and the United States by shipping a lot of these industries overseas,” Wheeler said. “We need to work on getting them back here in the United States.”

Flannery told his colleagues that he is open to making changes to the legislation before the 2026 legislative session.

Effective Monday, October 20, 2025, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) issued furlough notices to its largest group of employees to date. Since the start of the shutdown on October 1, the agency has operated on reduced staff using carryover funds that bridged the October 1 funding deadline. Initially, ten days into the shutdown, EPA began a phased furlough approach, affecting just the first wave of a relatively small share of employees.

Impacts

Staffing

This latest round will affect most career staff, including some career leaders. As a result, a skeleton crew of senior political appointees, top career leadership, and attorneys will maintain operations by the agency. If the agency fully implements its shutdown contingency plan, nearly 90 percent of its workforce would be furloughed.

Regulations & Rulemaking

Work on regulations and rulemaking will slow as the agency concentrates on essential functions—protecting human health, responding to emergencies (including Superfund actions posing imminent risks), supporting law enforcement and disaster response, and safeguarding EPA property. In the case of Superfund special accounts, it is possible work that is funded by a special account can continue, but EPA has not been consistent on this in the past so stakeholders should check with EPA.

Programs

During the shutdown, EPA will not issue new grants, permits, or regulations, and civil enforcement inspections without imminent threats will be paused. Certain programs funded by fees or dedicated revenues—such as those tied to the Superfund tax, Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA), and Pesticide Registration Improvement Act (PRIA)—can continue in limited form. However, these resources could be at risk if unallocated federal funds are redirected to support military pay.

What You Should Do

State and local programs can also be affected with work slowed down or altogether stopped in certain cases. Awareness of whether a state project will be impacted as the shutdown progresses can help you prioritize your work with a state or local agency.",https://jdsupra-static.s3.amazonaws.com/profile-images/og.15869_0756.jpg,N,,2025-10-23 13:04:44.182221

Illinois: More than $600 million invested at the Belvidere Assembly Plant, anticipated to create around 3,300 new jobs. The company’s position on Belvidere was explored in this Illinois story published in Site Selection in March.

Ohio: With an investment of nearly $400 million, assembly of an all-new midsize truck, previously allocated to the Belvidere plant, plans to move to the Toledo Assembly Complex, where it will join the Jeep Wrangler and Jeep Gladiator. The production shift could create more than 900 jobs.”

Michigan: Stellantis will invest nearly $100 million to retool the Warren Truck Assembly Plant for the production of an all-new range-extended EV and internal combustion engine large SUV, adding more than 900 jobs. The company also expects to invest $130 million to prepare the Detroit Assembly Complex – Jefferson for production of the next-generation Dodge Durango.

Indiana: Stellantis confirmed its January announcement to make additional investments in several of its Kokomo facilities to produce the all-new four-cylinder engine – the GMET4 EVO – beginning in 2026. “The company plans to invest more than $100 million and to add more than 100 jobs to ensure that the U.S. will be the manufacturing home of this strategic powertrain.” A September 2021 Site Selection story chronicled how Duke Energy played a role in an expansion at that facility set in motion before the Stellantis name was adopted.

California and Colorado top the rankings in a new report from the Alliance for Automotive Innovation that shows the market share of EVs in every state as of the second quarter of 2025. Yes, that means before the elimination of federal consumer EV tax credits on September 30. A total of 155 different vehicle models sold during the quarter. Michigan and North Carolina showed the largest market share gains.

“In the second quarter of 2025, automakers sold 385,075 electric vehicles (EVs, including battery, plug-in hybrid, and fuel cell electric vehicles) in the United States, representing 9.46 percent of overall light-duty vehicle sales,” the report states. It was a decrease of 9,000 sales from the first quarter, “the first time in the modern EV era (since 2020) that the second quarter EV market share declined from the first quarter.” However, the report notes, once the tax incentive’s elimination was signed into law at the start of Q3, national sales data showed a noticeable uptick as consumers rushed to purchase EVs while the credit was still available.”

A news release from commercial real estate services provider Economos DeWolf informed us last week that Economos DeWolf associate Matt Economos recently joined dozens of paddlers in the 10th annual Ben Carlson Foundation Memorial Paddle. “Covering 30 miles across the Pacific, the event raised more than $400,000 to support ocean safety, scholarships and community initiatives in honor of fallen Newport Beach lifeguard Ben Carlson,” who died 11 years ago while rescuing a swimmer in distress.

As we often say in local government, the best ideas are the ones we borrow from another community and adapt to meet our own needs. Climate Week was an opportunity not only to learn about successes and challenges in addressing climate change from local leaders across the country, but also to share how a small city like Athens, Ohio (pop. 23,849), is leading with innovative solutions of our own.

For example, in 2017, the city adopted a Sustainability Action Plan that included the development of local and sustainably-generated energy as a component. Athens has since become the first community in Ohio to earn SolSmart Platinum designation, a major achievement in the recognition of our work to streamline permitting and inspection, grow our local solar energy generation, reduce costs and educate and engage the community about the benefits of solar energy.

It all comes down to housing, and Athens is focused on increasing owner-occupied housing, as well as making homes more affordable through lower energy costs. In 2014, Athens became a charter member of a regional partnership with neighboring communities on community choice aggregation: by locking in energy rates, we help buffer residents from higher utility prices. This helps keep people in their homes by lowering their energy bills and making them more affordable.

In 2020, the city passed a resolution declaring a climate emergency, which guides our local action and demonstrates buy-in across city departments and from the community, making other projects like a successful ballot initiative (76 percent affirmative vote) for a carbon fee to fund municipal solar projects and a federal grant application with regional jurisdictions to deploy EV chargers possible.

As local leaders navigate uncertainty regarding the future of our programs and federal funding, it is important that U.S. local governments have a seat at the table with the global community addressing climate change.

Showcasing Best Practices from Cities, Towns and Villages

Throughout Climate Week, NLC showcased not only our tools, resources and technical assistance, but also brought communities together to discuss their resilience journeys. NLC convened a roundtable discussion where local leaders from across the country shared their challenges and successes with building resilience against wildfires, extreme heat, flooding and drought. The event also celebrated the launch of NLC and ICF’s new resource, Building Community Resilience to Wildfires: A Toolkit for Local Leaders.

Stories of success included investing in defensible space, providing community resources for wildfire preparation and building awareness with community members on the health impact of wildfire smoke. One of the biggest challenges identified, however, was how to better move community members and infrastructure out of harms’ way with care. Local leaders urged one another to explore alternatives in managed retreat that would enhance the cost effectiveness of resilience investments while addressing and centering community concerns.

NLC showcased the Cities for Smart Surfaces program and resources such as Elevating Complete Streets Policies with Green Infrastructure and the Smart Surfaces Policy Tracker. A panel, “From Insight to Ordinance: Data-Driven Policy & Nature-Based Solutions for Urban Climate Resilience,” helped cities utilize data-driven approaches to transform city surfaces.

A National Stage for NLC’s Federal Advocacy Action Agenda

Local leaders are first responders when it comes to preparing in advance of extreme weather and natural disasters, as well as in the immediate response and recovery. Local governments are seeing the impacts every day on their communities, residents and businesses — from extreme heat, flooding, drought, wildfires, strong storms and more. As problem solvers, local leaders are dedicated to mitigating these risks and protecting the health, safety and welfare of the community.

With changes and uncertainty around federal funding availability for municipalities to improve their water, energy and transportation infrastructure, local leaders are seeking new partners and innovative financing solutions to continue projects important to their community. Additionally, federal policy changes away from efforts to reduce emissions, invest in clean energy and strengthen infrastructure hamper local leaders’ efforts to implement their own sustainability or climate action plans.

What’s Next?

In November, world leaders will gather in Belém, Brazil for COP30, which is an important milestone for global climate action. Coming 10 years after the Paris Climate Agreement, it is the deadline for governments to submit updated plans for meeting their Paris Agreement obligations.

Local leaders, including NLC President, Mayor Steve Patterson of Athens, Ohio, will also gather in Rio de Janeiro for the C40 meeting before COP to mark 20 years of decisive leadership in tackling the climate crisis. NLC’s participation serves as a timely moment to elevate the critical role of cities, towns and villages to help influence the United Nations negotiations, ensuring local leadership is front and center.",https://www.nlc.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/GettyImages-1407721466-1.jpg,N,,2025-10-23 17:20:27.466685

In response, Doha has threatened to curtail LNG supplies to the European Union if it faces financial penalties for noncompliance.
What matters now for the European Union is laying solid foundations, while placating its indispensable suppliers.","Europe is adopting key environmental measures with extraterritorial reach—from the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) to the methane emission reduction regulation (MERR) in the energy sector and the Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive (CSDDD). For the first time, these rules could directly impact the business of the world’s largest gas and liquefied natural gas (LNG) producers, notably QatarEnergy and multiple U.S. companies. While Qatar is most concerned about regulatory scrutiny requiring it to identify and address human-rights risks, U.S. natural gas players are more anxious about the methane regulation, which could stymie LNG sales to Europe.

Yet, Brussels in 2025 is showing signs of pragmatism. The European Union is softening some of its most rigid sustainability requirements through its new Omnibus simplification package, meant to reduce corporate sustainability reporting burden. Also, energy ministers of the EU member states agreed at the October 20 council meeting to fully phase out Russian gas and oil imports under the REPowerEU plan and the bloc’s nineteenthpackage of sanctions—an opportunity to test how this goal aligns with the timeline of the methane regulation and broader energy-transition ambitions.

The EU Softens Its Stance to Remain Competitive

War on its borders and industrial decline have brought pragmatism back. The European Union can no longer afford policies that drive up energy costs, push companies abroad, or alienate key suppliers. Europe will need non-Russian gas imports for longer to sustain its economy. EU gas imports fell by 18 percent between 2021 and 2024, but the composition has changed dramatically: Norway’s share rose from 24 percent to 33 percent, and U.S. LNG from 6 percent to 17 percent, while Russia’s share collapsed from 45 percent to 19 percent. Qatar’s share also dropped from 6 percent to 4 percent.

The shift will become even more pronounced this year, as Russian pipeline gas via Ukraine has disappeared entirely. Also, the European Union has effectively decided to end its dependence on Russian gas by January 1, 2026, while accommodating a two-year transition period for existing contracts. A full prohibition will take effect by January 1, 2028, under which Bulgaria will terminate transit of Russian gas to Slovakia and Hungary, and imports of Russian LNG will be completely phased out. This will deprive the Kremlin of revenues funding the war in Ukraine. Russia’s pipeline deliveries to the European Union are projected to plunge from 140 billion cubic meters (bcm) in 2021 to about 16 bcm in 2025—and to zero by 2028. As of 2025, only Hungary and Slovakia still import Russian gas via TurkStream, while only five EU countries continue to purchase Russian LNG (Belgium, France, the Netherlands, Portugal, and Spain per SynMax data).

To remain competitive, Europe must produce and attract affordable energy, vital not only for its industries but also for its fast-growing digital economy. Electricity demand from data centers alone is expected to surge by 70 percent by 2030. Gas prices in Europe remain roughly twice their pre-Covid-19 levels, weakening its industrial base. As noted in Mario Draghi’s report, Europe’s long-term path to energy independence lies in accelerating renewables, grids, and nuclear, but in the foreseeable future, it will remain one of the world’s largest buyers of U.S. LNG. Europe’s U.S. LNG imports have reached an all-time high this year, up 52 percent from 2024. Pragmatism means recognizing that U.S. LNG is an asset; Europe simply doesn’t have many other options.

The ambitious EU methane rules adopted in June 2024 sit uneasily with the spirit of the new energy-focused U.S.-EU trade deal, under which the bloc pledges to purchase around $750 billion in U.S. energy products over the next three years. Both sides will likely show goodwill to negotiate irritants such as the regulation’s scope and execution to preserve the deal’s intent. The European Union has already agreed to introduce “additional flexibilities” to CBAM and address nontariff barriers that could restrict bilateral trade.

Technical realities are also tempering the implementation of methane regulations. Obstacles remain in agreeing on the scope of data collection (e.g., which parts of the gas and LNG value chain), on harmonizing standards and verifications, and on how to measure progress, while ensuring comparability across geographies.

The United States Pulls Back on Federal Methane Policies, but LNG Companies Press Ahead

While the Trump administration wants to delay until 2034 the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program, most U.S. gas producers and LNG exporters will likely continue with voluntary methane-reduction initiatives and data reporting to ensure that their gas remains trusted by consumers overseas. This approach will resonate beyond EU climate goals, as shown by the Coalition for LNG Emission Abatement towards Net-zero, a public-private partnership supported by key LNG trading countries, including Japan and South Korea. U.S. companies recognize that their infrastructure and trade cycles are much longer than the political election cycle. Their LNG projects will last for more than two decades, and they cannot afford to lose markets because their gas was not deemed green enough from the absence of data reporting. However, a voluntary program could open the door to cheating or selective self-reporting.

Several companies at home will continue to invest efforts, capital, and technology to ensure that their projects have emission reductions, or even elimination, at the core of their marketing strategies. For instance, NextDecade’s Rio Grande LNG pledges to use net-zero power and responsibly sourced gas, while Venture Global’s Plaquemines LNG and Calcasieu Pass 2 LNG projects are developing carbon capture and storage (CCS) at their Louisiana facilities. Projects that deploy CCS will be able to qualify for a federal tax incentive known as Section 45Q and one day could get credits for “abated carbon.” Meanwhile, Cheniere Energy targets its two U.S. Gulf Coast liquefaction plants to start maintaining by 2027 the methane emission intensity level that is consistent with the Gold Standard under the United Nations Oil and Gas Methane Partnership 2.0

There is still a lack of harmonized standards and third-party verification in the United States and abroad, but we have already seen a flurry of innovations in this space. MiQ, a nonprofit in methane emission certification, has already established tracking tools for lower-methane-intensity natural gas. Some companies are experimenting with the “book and claim” system, allowing buyers to claim the environmental attributes of cleaner fuels. There are also companies developing a blockchain-based “trace-and-claim” approach to enhance transparency and take the global differentiated gas market to the next level. Advanced measurement-based practices —including sensors, satellites, drones, and optical imaging—will also strengthen monitoring, measurement, reporting, and verification (MMRV) and leak detection and repair.

U.S. gas companies remain adamant that EU methane rules should not disadvantage U.S. gas relative to Russian, Norwegian, Algerian, Qatari, or other supplies and that common-sense solutions must be found. The U.S. shale-to-LNG model is unique: There is no single state-owned company overseeing the entire value chain, but rather multiple private actors at the production, processing, transportation, and liquefaction stages. Moreover, methane intensity varies across basins, pipeline distances, and even waterborne shipping routes, which adds complexity to uniform standards and compliance with EU requirements.

Expected Relaxation of Key EU Emission Regulations

Transatlantic Relations Will Take Priority Over Methane Rules

MERR establishes a ramp-up period with defined reduction targets for gas importers, set to take full effect by 2027. However, the European Commission recognizes that it must clarify these targets to ensure the rule’s implementation and enforcement are realistic. There are no global MMRV standards, and Brussels has yet to define before January 1, 2027, how to set any country- or producer-level equivalences to EU rules.

The Transatlantic dialogue on methane will be important to watch, as the rule was not designed with an understanding of the complex structure of the U.S. natural gas market. U.S. Secretary of Energy Chris Wright has pressured Brussels last month to delay its implementation and make the rule more U.S.-friendly. Interestingly, Qatar has not publicly objected to this particular EU rule—though Doha has threatened the European Union over other environmental regulations (see below). That may be because QatarEnergy, as a fully integrated gas company, has complete visibility across its value chain, sourcing feedgas from a single origin—the North Field—which makes methane monitoring and quantification far simpler than in the fragmented U.S. model.

EU member states are now responsible for monitoring the reporting and enforcing compliance, meaning the rule’s impact will vary depending on the quality of the national implementation. At least nine countries are already behind schedule in establishing competent authorities and received formal notices from the Commission in July for “failing to appoint and notify a competent authority.”

CSDDD Will Be Reduced in Scope and Obligations

The European Union is pursuing a simplification drive, known as Omnibus, across the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD), CSDDD, the EU taxonomy, CBAM, and investment rules, to refocus on competitiveness and respond to international pressures. If passed, the measure would confine companies’ reporting obligations to tier 1 suppliers, easing scrutiny of complex global supply chains and lowering the risk of financial penalties. It would also push back the first reporting year to July 2028. The European Union has sought to reassure Washington and international companies with a conciliatory message, pledging not to impose “undue restrictions” on transatlantic trade. However, environmental advocates argue that the Commission is now going too far toward deregulation, narrowing the scope of its rules and weakening core obligations.

One of the latest draft proposals would limit the CSDDD’s reach to companies with at least 5,000 employees and €1.50 billion ($1.75 billion) in turnover. U.S. LNG exporters such as Cheniere would still fall under the directive because of their turnover, even though it employs only around 1,700 people, and would therefore be required to identify and mitigate social and environmental risks across every stage of its supply chain.

QatarEnergy, meanwhile, is particularly uneasy about this heightened scrutiny, as it faces growing pressure to address human-rights risks alongside environmental ones. Forced labor and abuse of foreign workers in Qatar are well-documented and drew even more scrutiny after the 2022 FIFA World Cup. In response, Doha has threatened to curtail LNG supplies to the European Union if it faces financial penalties for noncompliance. But these threats may well be a bluff. Qatar’s attention is firmly fixed on Asia, which remains the prize market, and Doha may gladly cede some European market share to U.S. exporters to avoid direct economic confrontation. Yet, by the end of the decade, Qatar could find itself in a more vulnerable position, facing a global LNG glut that may push it to flood the European market with surplus volumes.

CBAM Won’t Be Expanded to LNG Anytime Soon

The EU CBAM, designed to shield European industry from “carbon leakage,” could also become a powerful tool to decarbonize globally, but it might be ahead of its time. The mechanism is scheduled to take full effect in January 2026, imposing financial obligations on imports of cement, iron and steel, aluminum, fertilizers, electricity, and hydrogen. These sectors will face a charge equivalent to the EU carbon price (which ranged between €70–€90 per ton of carbon dioxide in 2024–2025), minus any carbon taxes paid in the country of origin.

Such pricing could squeeze profit margins for steelmakers in Turkey, India, Russia, and China, as well as aluminum exporters in the Gulf. While Qatar’s steel exports will be directly impacted by this levy, Doha is pursuing a dual approach, threatening cuts while also exploring decarbonization measures to stay competitive.

Before the end of the year, the European Commission will assess the potential expansion of CBAM to other sectors, including downstream goods such as plastics, chemicals, and refined metals. It will also examine transition support for exporters of these products, with a legislative proposal expected in early 2026.

If CBAM were to include LNG in the coming years, the United States, Qatar, and other gas suppliers to the European Union would need to explore new compliance strategies, such as participation in carbon markets. However, given Europe’s structural dependence on LNG imports, the sector is unlikely to be included in the near term. The commission acknowledges that the mechanism will evolve, adapting to both economic realities and the international context.

Conclusion

Even if many of the European Union’s emission and sustainability rules are watered down, the preparation work and learning curve invested in designing these policies won’t be lost. The current geoeconomic context demands pragmatism and prioritizes energy security, but the wheel will turn again. Countries and companies that maintain their methane-reduction initiatives, invest in carbon-removal technologies, and promote responsibly sourced gas will be best positioned for the next cycle of investment and exports that will reward low-carbon attributes.

The European Union will likely prioritize its bilateral relations with key LNG partners—Qatar and the United States—over regulatory rigidity. Once the rules are implemented and enforced, the level of ambition can always be raised later; it does not need to start at full strength from the outset. What matters now for the European Union is laying solid foundations, while placating its indispensable suppliers.

When the shutdown ends, EPA will triage its workload, prioritizing public-health and statutory-deadline matters before lower-risk filings.","As the federal government endures another prolonged shutdown, uncertainty is rippling through every agency, with the impact clearly visible at the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). With only a fraction of staff on duty and most routine operations halted, the chemical and pesticide regulatory landscape faces a new round of challenges in both the Office of Pollution Prevention and Toxics (OPPT) and the Office of Pesticide Programs (OPP).

EPA's September 29, 2025, contingency plan officially took effect at the start of the shutdown. The shutdown has affected 89 percent of the Agency's employees, with only those 1,734 employees deemed ""essential"" to protect life, property, or national security retained. That means most rulemaking, permitting, and scientific work has ground to a halt. Exceptions include:

Emergency response and environmental monitoring tied to imminent threats;

Superfund cleanups that, if paused, would endanger public health;

Information Technology (IT) and facility security; and

Select projects funded by unexpired or fee-based appropriations, such as the Pesticide Registration Improvement Act of 2022 (PRIA 5) pesticide reviews, Superfund Tax-funded activities, and certain Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA) or Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) initiatives.

For companies that rely on predictable regulatory timelines, these exceptions matter — but they also highlight how uneven the shutdown's impact will be.

EPA's ongoing implementation of the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) is among the most directly affected programs. Progress on most risk evaluations and prioritization activities — which require cross-office collaboration and public engagement — are effectively paused. This includes work on preparing in final draft risk evaluations and internal review of the Agency's proposed TSCA ""framework rule"" update, released shortly before the shutdown.

The New Chemicals Program is also expected to slow significantly. While the Agency may process a limited number of submissions, most premanufacture notices (PMN), significant new use notices (SNUN), and microbial commercial activity notices (MCAN) will remain in queue until operations resume. Applicants should anticipate extended review periods and potential post-shutdown backlogs.

The pesticide program is also affected, although some work is continuing from funds available from the fee-schedule for pesticide submissions (required fees collected by PRIA 5). The PRIA 5 funds allow staff working on those submissions to continue even after any ""carryover"" funds, from earlier appropriations, have been exhausted. The carryover funds were available to support Agency work for the first days of the shutdown; OPP staff working on submissions are allowed to meet with submitters, but meetings about ""policy"" matters are subject to the shutdown. As residual funds are depleted, EPA has signaled its intent to reduce its workforce by issuing notices of Reduction in Force (RIF) to approximately 20 to 30 employees in its waste office. RIF notices generally take about 60 days to execute, although the Administration has previously discussed the idea of invoking an exemption that would allow them to fire employees within 30 days for separate RIF plans. It is likely that such actions will be met with legal challenges.

Other impacts across EPA likely will include:

PFAS and Fees Rules: Ongoing rulemakings — such as the final per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) reporting rule, the PFAS maximum contaminant level (MCL) implementation guidance, and the TSCA fees rule — are likely to face delays in clearance and publication.

Enforcement and Inspections: Routine inspections are paused, though emergency enforcement actions may proceed. Regulated entities can expect a surge of inspection activity once normal operations resume.

Permitting and State Coordination: State and Tribal programs that rely on EPA approval (e.g., air quality State Implementation Plans (SIP), water total maximum daily loads (TMDL), delegated hazardous waste permits) could experience cascading delays if federal staff are unavailable to review submissions.

Pesticide companies, chemical manufacturers, processors, and importers should prepare for delays, deferrals, and shifting compliance milestones. Companies awaiting new chemical determinations or rulemakings tied to market access should build additional lead-time into internal planning. Practical steps to take include:

1. Planning for slippage. Add flexibility to internal project timelines, especially where EPA sign-off is a gating step.

2. Using downtime strategically. Refine new chemical submissions, test plans, and exposure assessments now — so materials are ready when reviews restart.

3. Monitoring program-specific updates. Fee-funded programs like PRIA 5 may keep moving, even as TSCA work stalls.

4. Expecting an uneven restart. When the shutdown ends, EPA will triage its workload, prioritizing public-health and statutory-deadline matters before lower-risk filings.

However long this shutdown lasts, its effects will linger. EPA faces significant challenges with staffing shortages even in normal times. A multi-week pause could cascade into months of delayed decisions, postponed rulemakings, and additional strain on overextended staff in both OPPT and OPP.Deadlines for program actions may likely be delayed by more than a simple ""one for one"" delay — a one month shutdown may set back program deliverables by a much longer timeframe, as has been the case in past shutdowns.

For regulated entities, the key is transparency and preparation: stay in communication with EPA contacts where possible, document outreach attempts, and maintain flexibility on compliance planning. Whether Congress resolves the funding impasse in days or weeks, the pesticide and chemical sectors should brace for another reminder of just how deeply dependent regulatory predictability is on government continuity.

On Oct. 9, Citizens Energy Group and its partners celebrated the completion of the DigIndy project, an underground tunnel system in Indianapolis, Indiana. The project aims to divert billions of gallons of wastewater annually from Hoosier rivers and streams, and fulfills plans to address nearly all combined sewer overflows in Central Indiana.

“DigIndy stands as one of the most ambitious infrastructure projects in Indiana’s environmental history,” said Clint Woods, commissioner of the Indiana Department of Environmental Management. “Its completion marks a major milestone in our long-term, best-in-the-country efforts to protect Hoosier waterways and safeguard public health.”

DigIndy, comprising 28 miles of tunnels, was completed after a 14-year construction process and will bolster Indiana’s already significant progress in reducing sewage overflow events in Indiana’s waterways. A combined sewage overflow (CSO) is a utility wastewater discharge that occurs when rainfall or snowmelt exceeds the system’s capacity, causing it to be overwhelmed and discharge untreated sewage into rivers and streams, potentially posing a threat to human health and the environment. In 2008, more than 35 billion gallons of untreated sewage were released from CSO events across Indiana. By 2024, that figure dropped to 10.2 billion gallons, a 71.3% reduction.

The DigIndy program includes:

Deep Rock Tunnel Connector: 39,362 lf of tunnel; 3 CSO connecting structures/deaeration chambers and adits.

Eagle Creek Tunnel: 9,175 lf of tunnel (added as a change order to the Deep Rock Tunnel Connector project); one CSO connecting structure/plunge drop.

White River Tunnel: 30,628 lf of tunnel; 2 bifurcations; 7 CSO connecting structures/deaeration chambers and adits.

Pleasant Run Tunnel: 41,472 lf of tunnel; eight CSO connecting structures/deaeration chambers and adits.

All tunnels were built using the same 20-ft, 2-in. OD refurbished Robbins hard-rock tunnel boring machine, originally manufactured in 1980, reconfigured for the Indianapolis geology. The tunnels are lined using Everest forms with a 1-ft thick cast-in-place concrete lining for a finished diameter of 18 ft.

Beginning February 2026, the automaker will offer one year of free home charging through a partnership with energy supplier Vattenfall. The program grants customers up to 5,150 kWh of fossil-free electricity, roughly 25,000 kilometers (15,500 miles) of driving, when they sign a home energy contract and use Volvo’s smart-charging app.

The initiative is designed to simplify ownership and ease early charging costs, especially for first-time EV buyers. Alex Castro Pérez, Volvo’s Vice President of Energy Solutions, described it as “a way to create real value for our customers while helping accelerate the transition toward a smarter, greener society.”

Expanding the Energy Ecosystem

The free-charging offer isn’t just an incentive, it’s a blueprint for Volvo’s broader energy strategy. The company plans to expand the initiative globally after its Swedish debut, building regional partnerships to integrate EVs more directly with home and grid energy systems.

Volvo’s long-term goal is to link its vehicles to bi-directional charging capability, allowing upcoming models like the EX90 to power homes or return energy to the grid during peak hours. The move reflects the same thinking that led to major milestones, underscoring the brand’s lead in electrified mobility.

Built on a Proven Foundation

This initiative also highlights how Volvo’s modular engineering underpins everything it does. The company’s SPA (Scalable Product Architecture) platform, which supports both combustion and electric drivetrains, remains one of its greatest technical achievements. SPA has been used in over four million vehicles and continues to set the stage for Volvo’s fully electric future.

At the same time, the brand continues refining its current lineup with stylish, feature-rich updates such as the new Volvo XC90 Black-edition, ensuring that traditional luxury and new-age technology evolve hand in hand.

Why It Matters

Offering free home charging for a year may seem like a small gesture, but it represents a significant step toward removing one of the biggest barriers to EV adoption, that being convenience. By addressing charging at the household level, Volvo strengthens the customer experience while demonstrating its leadership in energy innovation.

The program fits perfectly within Volvo’s mission to become a fully electric brand by 2030, a goal that depends as much on infrastructure and integration as on vehicle design. If the Swedish pilot succeeds, the company could soon bring the same model to other European markets, and eventually to North America.

With this initiative, Volvo is not just selling electric cars, it’s creating an ecosystem where every charge, every kilometer, and every connection contributes to a cleaner, more intelligent energy future.",https://media.zenfs.com/en/autoblog_arena_articles_145/4c1e9743c628c2240eda7130901c1f16,N,,2025-10-23 13:19:38.935250

Months after Delfin Midstream hired Siemens Energy to reserve manufacturing capacity for four SGT-750 gas turbine mechanical drive packages and agreed to an early works program with Samsung Heavy Industries and Black & Veatch to further detail FLNG vessel design specifications as the basis for the lump-sum turn-key engineering, procurement, construction, and integration (EPCI) contract, the company has entered into a letter of award with SHI as the exclusive EPCI contractor for the first FLNG.

Dudley Poston, Delfin’s CEO, highlighted: “We are very pleased with the commercial and financing workstreams closing in for an FID on the Delfin LNG project. With this LOA we further strengthen our construction pathway, not just for the first but also the second and third FLNG vessels.

“Finally, we are excited that the Delfin project can foster increased cooperation in trade, energy and shipbuilding between the Republic of Korea and the USA.”

The firm explains that it is entitled to the exclusive rights to Samsung Heavy Industries’ dock for the construction of the first FLNG. This LOA enables the due to agree to begin an early engagement scope of work, mobilize project teams, de-risk the overall project schedule, and prepare for imminent execution.

After securing the manufacturing capacity for the FLNG vessel’s gas turbines from Siemens Energy, Delfin has significantly progressed both its debt and equity financing to pave the way toward the final investment decision (FID) in November 2025 for this U.S. energy infrastructure project offshore Louisiana.

With the progress toward the FID for the first FLNG in mind, the companies have set their cap on strengthening their partnership before the second and third FLNG vessels for the project, agreeing to a dock reservation scheme for the second unit following FID for the first one.

While this is expected to enable Delfin to take the FID in early 2026 for the second FLNG, the two players plan to jointly develop strategic business and trade opportunities for the third one, including shipbuilding cooperation.

The U.S. firm’s brownfield deepwater port requires minimal additional infrastructure investment to support up to three floating LNG vessels producing up to 13.2 million tonnes of LNG annually.

The company claims that its project has the potential to be the first LNG export deepwater port facility in the United States. Delfin also bought the UTOS pipeline, said to be the largest natural gas pipeline in the Gulf of America (Gulf of Mexico).

The firm’s LNG project already received a deepwater port license from the Maritime Administration (MARAD) and approval from the Department of Energy for long-term exports of LNG to countries that do not have a free trade agreement (FTA) with the United States.

Two 10-MW battery projects in Virginia announced this week could be part of a wave of new storage deployments in the PJM Interconnection following reforms to its surplus interconnection rules and mounting pressure over capacity prices.

Patterson Enterprises intends to build two 10-MW, four-hour lithium iron phosphate battery projects in A&N Electric Cooperative’s service territory in eastern Virginia with financing from Climate First Bank, the companies said Wednesday. The bank provided $32 million in financing for the projects, according to Chris Cucci, the bank’s chief strategy officer.

Cucci said in an interview Climate First Bank is considering financing two other 10-MW storage projects in A&N’s territory. In part, interest in battery storage in the Delaware-Maryland-Virginia region is driven by data center growth, he added.

“If we can put more of these battery storage projects in place … we avoid the need to set up peaker plants, which are typically pretty inefficient,” Cucci said.

PJM lags behind other parts of the country, particularly California and Texas, when it comes to energy storage, federal data shows. At the start of 2024, PJM had 376.1 MW/378.1 MWh of storage, while the California Independent System Operator had 8.1 GW/27.1 GWh, and the Electric Reliability Council of Texas had 3.8 GW/5.6 GWh, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration’s most recent report on battery storage market trends.

A recent report by the Brattle Group, commissioned by the U.S. Energy Storage Coalition, concluded PJM needs to add 43 GW of storage by 2045 to ensure reliability and mitigate cost increases.

The market differences are partly driven by PJM’s relative lack of renewable energy penetration, according to Maria Scheller, a vice president at ICF International, a consulting firm. Storage resources receive significant value during “duck curve” periods when generation needs to come online to replace fading solar generation at the end of the day, Scheller said.

Also, until recently, PJM had relatively restrictive rules that limited storage penetration in its markets, according to Scheller. But key changes adopted earlier this year could open the door for increased storage development at a time when the grid operator is tight on power supplies, she added.

In February, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission approved changes to the PJM’s surplus interconnection rules governing the use of underused interconnection capacity at existing power plants. The grid operator’s previous rules effectively prevented battery storage from being used in cases where there was available interconnection capacity, according to clean energy trade groups.

They estimate the reform could open up 26 GW of interconnection capacity for new resources at a time when PJM is desperate to bring new capacity online. The operator’s capacity auctions set record high prices two years in a row, and the issue of cost has become a very public and political conflict with some governors threatening to pull their states out of the market.

In response to capacity constraints, PJM launched a fast-track interconnection review that selected 51 projects totaling 11.8 GW, dominated by gas. But it also includes about 2.3 GW of storage projects that could be online much sooner, Scheller said, in addition to about 4 GW of storage projects that have interconnection agreements.

“In total, we have 7 GW of storage that can materialize very quickly and be meaningful for the next two [capacity] auction periods in PJM,” Scheller said.

Some states in PJM’s territory, including New Jersey, Maryland and Virginia, have also adopted storage capacity goals that could add momentum, she added.

The New Jersey Bureau of Public Utilities in June approved a plan to procure at least 1 GW of storage in two auctions as part of the state’s goal of having 2 GW of storage by 2030.

Maryland on Oct. 14 started a solicitation for 800 MW of storage as part of a plan to add 1.6 GW in the state.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/3WVjVyDtZdcLjX7OtENhd1rJykVxwLEE-mnU7F_0LVQ/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9EYW52aWxsZV9WQV9CRVNTXzFfTGlnaHRzaGlmdF9FbmVyZ3kuanBn.webp,N,,2025-10-23 12:23:44.012182

The automaker's driver-assistance software is becoming more robust, and Musk claims it's almost good enough to take the training wheels off.

By the end of the year, Tesla believes it will be able to remove the safety driver from its car.

Tesla says its Full Self-Driving software is finally growing up. But much like a teenager with a learner's permit, the software isn't quite ready to be left unsupervised—yet.

That's set to change by the end of the year, or so Elon Musk claimed on Wednesday.

During Tesla's quarterly earnings, the CEO promised that its Robotaxi fleet in Austin will have its safety drivers removed by the end of the year, barring any roadblocks from regulators. It also plans to expand its service to between 8 and 10 metro areas.

“It depends on various regulatory approvals,” said Musk. “You can actually see most of our regulatory applications online, because they’re public information. We expect to be operating in Nevada, Florida and Arizona by the end of the year.”

Tesla is currently operating in Austin, Texas and the Bay Area near San Francisco, California. It also seemingly plans to launch in Illinois and Colorado, as suggested by job postings last week.

So far, Tesla's Robotaxi fleet has logged 250,000 miles in Texas and over a million miles in California. FSD Supervised—the version that anyone with a Tesla can get today today for $8,000—has amassed a whopping 6 billion miles driven to-date, which is an ocean of data that Tesla has been training on. That being said, it's still not enough for Musk to go full-gas on calling for the removal of safety drivers.

The CEO says that it ""makes sense"" to keep the safety driver in the front seat for at least a little while.

""I think even if the regulators weren't making us do it [...] it make sense to have a safety driver or occupant in the car,"" said Musk during the call. He added that Tesla would use safety drivers for ""maybe 3 months"" when it enters a new market to make sure there are not area-specific challenges, then pull out the drivers and let the cars putter around on their own.

Musk also made a rather out-of-pocket conservative remark about the current customer-facing software: early releases aren't for everyone.

""We need time to smooth the rough edges,"" he admitted.

He cautioned that brand new major releases of FSD prioritize tech advancements and safety over comfort. The means waiting for an incremental release like FSD F14.2.1 or later (the most advanced version available today is 14.1.3) before updating if comfort is a big deal. But if you want the latest and greatest today, you owners can still enabled ""Advanced"" software updates in their cars, giving them access to the more experimental versions.

New and cool, or stable and safe. Everyone gets to choose.

Speaking of new, Musk says that Tesla is also planning to bring reasoning to a future release of its new FSD version 14 software. This will enable the car to make more complicated decisions based on the world around it, like deciding where it should look for parking after it drops a driver off at the front door of a store. If the parking lot is crowded, for example, the car might choose to look for a spot in the back of the lot rather than right up front.

The real test is whether or not folks can text and drive—or at least that's what Musk says. The car isn't there yet, but the driver assistance software seems to be advancing rapidly. Maybe not quite the HAL 9000 of 2025, but it's getting there.

For now, Musk says he remains confident that FSD will eventually be safer than a human driver without anybody behind the wheel. Surprisingly, he didn't put an exact timeline on this metric, but the context around it paints the bigger picture: the geofenced rollout could soon begin. Until then, Tesla's customer version of FSD will require alert human supervsion at all times.",https://cdn.motor1.com/images/mgl/G3eMRE/s1/tesla-autopilot-graphic.jpg,N,,2025-10-23 13:19:42.778518

Takemura, Canary Media, Sarah Shemkus",,,,,https://mainemorningstar.com/2025/10/23/new-england-says-goodbye-to-coal-as-merrimack-station-powers-down/,"Granite Shore Power, Merrimack Station’s owner, officially ceased operations on Sept. 12.
“Coal has been challenged in New England for twenty years,” said Dan Dolan, president of the New England Power Generators Association.
Merrimack Station accounted for just 0.22 percent of the region’s electricity generation in 2024, according to ISO New England.
In addition to litigation, Merrimack Station has been a flashpoint for protests for years.
Granite Shore Power credited the Inflation Reduction Act for helping make its renewable-energy plans financially feasible.","The towering smokestacks of New England’s last coal-fired power plant have gone quiet. Merrimack Station in Bow, New Hampshire, shut down in September, years ahead of its scheduled closure, marking the end of coal-fired energy production in the region.

Merrimack Station had supplied electricity to the region since the 1960s. But as coal’s financial viability waned and environmental pressures mounted, the era of coal power production in New England may now be officially over. In the coming years, on-site solar and battery storage could take coal’s place at the site.

Granite Shore Power, Merrimack Station’s owner, officially ceased operations on Sept. 12. A 2024 settlement between the company, the Conservation Law Foundation, the Sierra Club and the Environmental Protection Agency over alleged Clean Water Act violations had required the facility to close by 2028. The early retirement underscores how coal has become economically untenable in the region.

“Coal has been challenged in New England for twenty years,” said Dan Dolan, president of the New England Power Generators Association. “The market no longer sustains and justifies these types of facilities.”

The station’s 438-megawatt output has steadily declined over the past two decades. Once operating at 70 to 80 percent capacity in the early 2000s, Merrimack has failed to exceed 8 percent in the past six years, running only during periods of peak electricity demand.

Older, larger coal plants like Merrimack Station, despite running only during peak periods, take a long time to power up, Dolan explained. More flexible, faster-starting natural gas “peaker” plants have now taken their place.

ISO New England, the nonprofit organization that operates the region’s electricity grid and oversees the wholesale power market, explained that it dispatches the cheapest sources first and most often—meaning coal plants like Merrimack were called upon less frequently as more affordable options became available.

Across New England, coal use fell by more than 90 percent between 2007 and 2017, displaced by cheaper natural gas and renewable power.

Entering the first New England winter without coal, the impact on the grid will be minimal. Merrimack Station accounted for just 0.22 percent of the region’s electricity generation in 2024, according to ISO New England. That shortfall can be replaced by renewables, natural gas and power imports from neighboring states.

The shutdown marks the end of a long, contentious chapter in environmental activism. In addition to litigation, Merrimack Station has been a flashpoint for protests for years.

The No Coal No Gas campaign, spearheaded by 350 New Hampshire and the Climate Disobedience Center, began in 2019 with the goal of shutting down the station. Activists staged a series of civil disobedience actions, including attempts to “liberate” coal before combustion, blockading shipments, and even occupying the station’s smokestack. Over the years, the campaign has resulted in over a hundred arrests and drawn national attention to New England’s lingering dependence on fossil fuels.

“We’re very excited,” said Rebecca Beaulieu of 350 New Hampshire. In 2023, Merrimack Station failed an emissions test that found particulate matter levels 70 percent above federal limits, along with elevated mercury and nitrogen oxide, and for every hour the plant operated, it emitted more carbon dioxide than the average American does in 26 years. “Knowing the plant will never power up again, even for an hour, is a huge relief,” she said.

While the closure brings uncertainty for Merrimack Station employees, many of whom have been transferred to other Granite Shore Power sites, both activists and the utility hope that the station’s next phase will present new job and economic opportunities for New Hampshire.

“The historic agreement with the EPA paves the way for first-of-their-kind ‘Renewable Energy Parks’ in the state,” Granite Shore Power said in a statement last year. Both Merrimack Station and Schiller Station—another Granite Shore Power facility that ended coal operations in 2020 —are slated to be converted into renewable energy and battery storage sites. The company says roughly 400 acres of land and existing grid infrastructure will make the transition possible.

Granite Shore Power credited the Inflation Reduction Act for helping make its renewable-energy plans financially feasible. But with the Trump administration moving to roll back renewable-energy incentives, the policy environment for such projects has grown uncertain.

Just weeks after Merrimack Station shuttered, the administration announced that the Department of Energy would invest $625 million in coal-related projects aimed at reviving the industry. Federal officials have not commented on the plant’s closure.

As Granite Shore Power enters a new era of coal free energy production, the No Coal No Gas campaign is turning towards oil- and gas-fired peaker plants that operate during peak demand times, including two kerosene turbines at the Merrimack Station site.

“These inefficient oil and gas facilities receive monthly ratepayer subsidies, but sit idle most of the year,” the campaign said in a statement. “When they are called to operate at times of high electricity demand, they do so with extra-high pollution at extra-high costs.”",https://mainemorningstar.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Merrimack-Station-2048x1365.jpg,N,,2025-10-23 13:04:52.924217

The city is attracting international associations who seek more than just a venue and seek a blend of industry leadership, cultural richness and academic excellence.

A city of strengths: science, climate and community health

Wellington’s appeal lies in its alignment with sectors of global importance. With three universities – Te Herenga Waka-Victoria University of Wellington, Massey University and the University of Otago’s Wellington campus – the city is a hub for research and innovation across science, technology, environment and health.

Over the next eight months, Wellington will host a series of international conferences that reflect these strengths. The Pacific Rim International Conference on Artificial Intelligence will bring together leading AI researchers and technologists, tapping into Wellington’s growing data science and digital innovation ecosystem. The Climate and Cryosphere Conference will convene climate scientists, policymakers and environmental leaders in a city known for its commitment to sustainability and climate action. The WONCA World Rural Health Conference will spotlight rural and community health, supported by Wellington’s academic institutions and healthcare networks.

These events are not just aligned with Wellington’s expertise – they are actively shaped by it. Business Events Wellington works closely with local academics, researchers and institutions to ensure that conferences are embedded in the city’s knowledge economy. This collaboration enhances content, fosters partnerships and creates opportunities for lasting impact.

Tākina: a venue designed for legacy

At the heart of Wellington’s conference offering is Tākina, the city’s newest and largest convention centre. Opened in mid-2023, Tākina is a striking architectural presence in the cultural precinct, directly opposite Te Papa Tongarewa, New Zealand’s national museum and within walking distance to 4,000 hotel rooms. Designed with flexibility and sustainability in mind, Tākina offers over 10,000sqm of conference and exhibition space across two levels. But what truly sets it apart is its cultural integration.

Tākina, the name bestowed on Wellington’s convention and exhibition centre by local tribe (iwi) Taranaki Whānui, means “to invoke, to summon, to connect, to bring forth” in te reo Māori. This name was chosen to reflect both the practical purpose of the centre – to gather people and ideas – and Wellington’s unique elemental force: the wind. Just as the wind moves energy, knowledge and new perspectives across Te Whanganui-a-Tara (Wellington Harbour), Tākina symbolises a place where innovation, culture and discovery are brought together. The name is a powerful reminder of the centre’s role as a gathering place that celebrates the city’s dynamic spirit, honours its Māori heritage and helps to carry ideas far beyond its walls.

This commitment to connection and cultural depth is further evident in Tākina’s newly developed Tikanga guide, a resource created to help conference organisers respectfully and meaningfully incorporate Māori culture into their events. Developed in consultation with the local iwi, the document outlines protocols such as whakatau (welcoming ceremonies), the use of te reo Māori and engagement with Māori values and perspectives. For international associations, this offers a unique opportunity to enrich their conference experience with indigenous knowledge and cultural depth. It’s not just about adding a ceremonial element; it’s about embedding a worldview that prioritises connection, care and stewardship.

Reflecting this ethos of care extends into Tākina’s environmental design and operation. The centre proudly holds New Zealand’s first 5-Star Green Star Design certification for a convention centre. It incorporates advanced features like rainwater harvesting, enhanced thermal insulation and demand-controlled air conditioning to optimise energy use. Tākina’s central city location encourages eco-friendly travel options such as public transport, walking and cycling, aligning with Wellington’s commitment to sustainability. Additionally, the venue works closely with local suppliers who prioritise sustainable and socially responsible practices, ensuring every event supports both cultural and environmental stewardship.

Indigenous Māori culture: a living worldview

Indigenous Māori culture is a living, breathing part of New Zealand’s identity and found nowhere else in the world. It offers a perspective that is both ancient and deeply relevant to today’s global challenges. Concepts such as kaitiakitanga (guardianship of the environment), whanaungatanga (relationships and connection) and manaakitanga (hospitality, generosity and respect) resonate strongly in sectors like climate science, health and community development.

Incorporating Māori values into conferences isn’t just symbolic – it’s transformative. Delegates leave with a broader worldview and the introduction of unique perspectives supports genuine cultural exchange and forward-thinking leadership at your event.

Support for organisers

Business Events Wellington provides support services to help deliver high-quality events, including financial and in-kind assistance. This support is tailored to help international associations deliver events that align with Wellington’s strategic sectors. The team works closely with organisers from the earliest stages, helping to connect with local experts and ensure that every aspect of the event is optimised.

The New York City Employment and Training Coalition (NYCETC) and The Green Launchpad recently announced the NYC Energy Efficiency Workforce Coalition. Workforce development is critically important for supporting clean energy and energy efficiency jobs.

Even though at the moment, the social media sphere and news appear to be nearly dominated by politics and rancor, there are people in America who go to work five days a week to make our buildings, transportation, and energy systems more efficient and resilient. They do the boots-on-the-ground work; they do it whether the politics are favorable or unfavorable. They also do it regardless if they get media recognition or not.

Once when I was visiting a national park, there was a bunch of guys working on doing controlled burns in a forested area. I stopped to ask if I could take their picture; they said yes. They also say no one ever asks to take their pictures. These kinds of workers are the guys and gals who do the work, in the field, in the streets, in the offices, in the buildings, out in the parks … they do the work.

They need support to develop their skills and competencies as we all move toward more clean energy and sustainability.

Angela N. Son, Founder of the Green Launchpad, answered some questions for CleanTechnica.

About how many energy efficiency workers are there in NYS and NYC right now?

Across New York State, the clean energy industry is already a major employer, with more than 132,000 workers in the energy efficiency sector alone, according to a 2024 NYSERDA report. In New York City, the impact is even more concentrated: the city’s Green Economy Action Plan identifies approximately 66,000 jobs directly in energy efficiency, representing half of all clean energy jobs in the five boroughs. Energy efficiency is the largest employer in the city’s green economy, offering tangible, local career opportunities right now.

What are the gaps in the local workforce?

The central challenge is a systemic disconnect between employers and workforce training providers, which creates several downstream problems. First, there is a lack of coordination across government agencies, community organizations, and colleges, which often operate in silos. This results in a fragmented system without clear sequencing or scaffolding of training, making it difficult for workers to move from entry-level roles to specialized, higher-wage positions. Second, there is a persistent mismatch with industry needs. The energy efficiency sector is evolving rapidly due to emerging technologies, such as advanced heat pumps, and new local laws like Local Law 97. Training programs often struggle to keep pace, producing graduates whose skills don’t always align with what employers need today. A tighter feedback loop between industry and educators is essential. The EE Workforce Coalition was created specifically to address this problem, serving as the coordinating body that ensures workforce training leads directly to quality jobs.

Are there training programs for local people who want to work in energy efficiency?

Yes. New York City has a robust ecosystem of training providers preparing residents for clean energy careers. The issue isn’t a lack of programs, but rather a lack of connection and coordination among them. The EE Workforce Coalition’s work focuses on building that bridge, linking the supply side (training providers) with the demand side (employers) to create direct pipelines from classrooms to careers.

About how many new energy efficiency workers are needed?

The sector is already growing steadily, but this growth could accelerate dramatically as the city and state continue advancing their ambitious clean energy agendas through new laws and enforcement. With mandates like Local Law 97 requiring tens of thousands of buildings to be retrofitted, the potential demand for skilled labor is enormous. Over the next decade, New York will need thousands of new energy efficiency workers to meet its climate goals. Consistent policy implementation will unlock a surge of private investment and job creation, and the workforce must be ready to meet that demand.

What are some of the overarching goals for energy efficiency in NYC?

New York City’s energy efficiency efforts are guided by broad mandates such as the state’s Climate Leadership and Community Protection Act (CLCPA) and the city’s Local Law 97. The state’s “New Efficiency: New York” (NENY) policy offers a clear, actionable roadmap for the next three years, directing state and utility efforts toward three priority areas: comprehensive weatherization (the building envelope), HVAC and heat pump installation (electrification), and smart building controls and management. The NENY framework ensures that public and private investments are strategically focused where they can have the greatest impact on emissions reduction and affordability.

How will energy efficiency help NYC with climate resilience?

Energy efficiency is our first and most practical line of defense against the impacts of climate change. During extreme heat waves, efficient buildings draw less power from the grid, helping prevent blackouts. Well-insulated buildings also maintain safe indoor temperatures for longer periods during power outages, providing passive survivability that protects vulnerable residents. Most importantly, energy efficiency is the foundation of decarbonization; it makes full building electrification both feasible and affordable.",https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/ChatGPT-Image-Oct-23-2025-08_44_51-AM-800x533.png,N,,2025-10-23 11:23:20.404452

We cannot control what other nations do, but we can control what we choose to build – and we are building Canada strong.

Canada’s new government is moving decisively to build major nation-building projects that create high-paying careers, reduce emissions, and grow our economy.

To that end, the government launched the Major Projects Office to cut red tape and fast-track major nation-building projects. Last month, the Prime Minister, Mark Carney, announced the first wave of projects referred to the Major Projects Office for review. One of these projects is the Darlington New Nuclear Project (DNNP) in Bowmanville, Ontario – a catalyst for new jobs, industrial growth, and our clean-energy future that will put Canada at the forefront of global nuclear innovation.

Today, the Prime Minister announced that the Canada Growth Fund will invest $2 billion to support the construction and operation of the four small modular reactors (SMRs) at the DNNP. This project will make Canada the first G7 country to bring SMR technology online and drive $500 million annually into Ontario’s nuclear supply chain. Once complete, Darlington’s first of four SMRs will provide reliable, affordable, clean power to 300,000 homes, while sustaining 3,700 jobs annually, including 18,000 during construction, over the next 65 years.

Prime Minister Carney was joined by the Premier of Ontario, Doug Ford, who announced that the Government of Ontario will invest $1 billion in this project through the Building Ontario Fund. Ontario Power Generation remains the majority owner and operator of the DNNP, with the Canada Growth Fund and the Building Ontario Fund acquiring meaningful minority stakes in the project, representing 15% and 7.5% ownership, respectively.

This investment will strengthen Ontario’s power grid and represents the kind of nation-building projects that defines Canada’s new economic approach. Together, the Government of Canada and the Government of Ontario are demonstrating Canada’s ability to meet the highest standards in developing world-class assets efficiently, cost-effectively, and competitively.

By unleashing private investment, advancing energy security, and strengthening the industrial base that will power the clean-energy transition, we are building Canada strong.

Quick facts

The DNNP will be the first grid-scale SMR in the G7.

Earlier this year, the Government of Ontario approved Ontario Power Generation to move forward with construction of its first of four rate-regulated SMRs as part of this project.

At its full potential of four SMRs, the DNNP will provide 1,200 megawatts of clean, reliable electricity – enough to power about 1.2 million homes (more than the number of households in the Greater Toronto Area) – while reducing carbon emissions by an average of up to 2.3 million tonnes annually between 2029 and 2050.

As part of its mission, the Major Projects Office:

collaborates with key partners – including project proponents, Indigenous Peoples, investors, and all levels of government – to facilitate the development of major projects that will benefit Canada.

works to identify and advance nation-building projects, including through the Building Canada Act.

acts as a single window for project proponents into the federal regulatory process to simplify and accelerate project approvals.

The Canada Growth Fund was established in 2022 to ensure Canada continues to be a leading destination for investment and to drive innovation across new and traditional sectors of Canada’s industrial base. To date, it has built a diverse and impactful portfolio – with 16 portfolio companies representing a total commitment of $4.75 billion.

The Canada Growth Fund is a $15 billion arm’s length public investment vehicle launched by the federal government to attract private capital and invest in Canadian projects and businesses. It makes strategic investments to help Canada meet the following national economic and climate policy goals:

Reduce emissions and achieve Canada’s climate targets.

Accelerate the deployment of key technologies, such as clean electricity.

Scale-up companies that will create jobs and drive productivity and clean growth across new and traditional sectors of Canada’s industrial base.

Encourage the retention of intellectual property in Canada.

Capitalise on Canada’s abundance of natural resources and strengthen critical supply chains to secure Canada’s future economic and environmental well-being.

NEW DELHI: They may have been slow to start, but adoption of electrics has started to pick up in the country with the contribution of green cars to total sales nearly doubling over the past one year – albeit on a lower base. Not only this, at 91,726 units, the first six months of fiscal 2025-26 have seen sales of electrics cover nearly 86% of what was sold in the full year of FY25 (around 1.07 lakh units), indicating the growth in adoption of EVs by customers. With this, the share of electrics in total PV sales has now moved to around the 5% mark against the 2.6% recorded at the end of FY25. The first half of FY26 has seen the sales of electrics grow by 108% to 91,726 units against 44,172 units in the same period of the previous year, according to numbers provided by Federation of Automobile Dealers Associations (FADA). This number was led by strong performance by JSW MG Motor, Tata Motors, and others such as BMW and Mahindra & Mahindra. JSW MG’s Windsor SUV has seen one of the fastest scale-ups for an EV as the model crossed 50,000 units in just one year of its launch. Anurag Mehrotra, MD of JSW MG Motor, said the share of EVs to the company’s sales is 80% as it witnesses strong traction across segments. “EVs are expected to cross 7% industry market share by this year-end. Together, EVs and hybrids are likely to hit 30% share in a decade.” Shailesh Chandra, MD & CEO of Tata Motors Passenger Vehicles, said EVs have also played a strong part in the company’s healthy performance during the just-ended festive season. “Our EV portfolio continued its upward trajectory with over 10,000 units retailed in the 30-day window from Navratri to Diwali. This is up 37%. In fact, the second quarter of this fiscal has seen our EVs grow by 59% yoy on a total volume of 25,000 units. The share of EVs at the end of Q2 stands at 17% to overall sales.” The demand for green cars has been equally strong when it comes to luxury. BMW and Mercedes-Benz have seen strong adoption of electrics, prompting the brands to launch more green cars. Hardeep S Brar, President & CEO of BMW India, said the group recorded the highest EV sales between Jan to Sept 2025. “A total of 2,509 electric BMWs and MINIs were delivered, with a growth of 246% y-o-y. BMW iX1 long wheelbase is the highest-selling electric car, followed by the flagship i7. The share of EVs in total sales further increased to 21%... By 2030, this is further expected to increase to 30%,” Brar said. Santosh Iyer, MD&CEO of Mercedes-Benz India, said EVs are a key element in the company’s decarbonisation roadmap. “Our top-end battery electrics drive our strategy with the locally-produced EQS SUV recording its highest sales ever, accelerating our EV penetration to 8% of total volumes. The company has seen a 10% growth in EV sales in the second quarter of this fiscal.” With top mainstream players such as Maruti and Hyundai expected to launch locally-made EVs from next year, the industry expects the share of greens to go up exponentially.

“We just have to know where to find them.”","At Aurora Energy Research’s NYC forum this week, analyst Julia Hoos said the quiet part out loud: Once the effects of solar and wind tax credits being phased out take hold and the renewable building boom stalls, “there is a real fear that [the renewable energy industry is] standing in front of a cliff in about 2028 or 2030.”

President Trump’s so-called One Big Beautiful Bill Act “has reversed the momentum that the Inflation Reduction Act injected into the energy transition,” Hoos, the head of USA East research at Aurora, told the audience on Tuesday. “But we also have to contextualize that we’re starting from a place of momentum like we’ve never had before.”

Thus, her prediction is that renewables will continue to be built in the US and that “those projects are going to benefit from higher revenues that can offset their higher costs.” But the most successful renewable projects will be strategic in their placement and benefit to the grid.

“Profitability is going to be less of a given,” Hoos said. “That increases the importance of understanding how much additional renewables or batteries a particular market can absorb.”

Batteries and VPPs can help particular markets make and use extra clean power, but once a location is saturated with renewables and storage, Hoos suggested investors need to “pivot geographies and technologies.”

“Batteries are exceptionally well-positioned over the next couple of years to take advantage of the new opportunities from load growth,” Hoos said. “However, the economics do change. Given how long it takes to build projects in the US right now, successful investment means speeding to where the puck is going and preparing for the aftermath.”

Woodside announces Louisiana LNG partnership with Williams

édité le 23/10/2025 - Plus de news de ""Woodside Energy"" - Voir la fiche entreprise de ""Woodside Energy""

Woodside has simultaneously signed and closed a transaction with Williams, a world-class leader in US natural gas infrastructure, for an integrated investment in Louisiana LNG. The strategic partnership involves the sale by Woodside of a 10% interest in Louisiana LNG LLC (HoldCo) and an 80% interest and operatorship of Driftwood Pipeline LLC (PipelineCo) to Williams for a purchase price of US$250 million at the effective date of 1 January 2025. The total proceeds received are $378 million including proportionate capital reimbursement since the effective date.

The transaction represents the next key stage towards realising Woodside’s strategy for Louisiana LNG. It not only secures capital and offtake commitments but also brings a strong strategic partner with complementary capabilities in US natural gas infrastructure and an existing gas sourcing platform, Sequent Energy Management (Sequent).

Williams will contribute its share of the capital expenditure for the LNG facility and pipeline, of approximately $1.9 billion. As part of the investment in Louisiana LNG, Williams assumes LNG offtake obligations for 10% of produced volumes.

Williams currently operates more than 33,000 miles of pipeline across 24 states in the US and its Sequent platform has a marketing and optimisation footprint of more than 7 Bcf/d. It will utilise its extensive pipeline experience to construct and operate the Line 200 pipeline to the Louisiana LNG Terminal.

Leveraging the established Sequent platform and capabilities, a gas supply team will operationalise and optimise daily gas sourcing and balancing in accordance with Louisiana LNG’s gas procurement strategy. Sequent's proven gas marketing and asset optimisation expertise will support reliable feedgas supply for the benefit of all Louisiana LNG participants.

Woodside CEO Meg O’Neill welcomed Williams to the Louisiana LNG Project.

“We are excited to have Williams join us as a strategic partner in Louisiana LNG given its leadership in US natural gas infrastructure and ability to add value and deliver operational benefits to enhance the project.

“This is Williams’ first investment in LNG and its participation in Louisiana LNG is a testament to the quality of the project.

“The bringing together of Woodside’s proven track record in developing and operating LNG facilities and global marketing, and Williams’ expertise in pipelines and gas sourcing, creates an energy partnership that has the combined capability to realise opportunities for long-term global energy demand.

“With strong LNG contracting momentum from Louisiana LNG and our portfolio, our existing infrastructure partner New York-based Stonepeak, and our key contracting partners including Bechtel, Baker Hughes and Chart, we are on track to deliver first LNG in 2029 and create long-term value for our shareholders.”

President and CEO of Williams Chad Zamarin expressed enthusiasm for the partnership.

“This transaction marks an important step forward in Williams’ wellhead to water strategy – integrating upstream, midstream, marketing and LNG capabilities to deliver the cleanest, most reliable energy to global markets. We look forward to partnering with Woodside, and together, reinforcing and strengthening our collective roles as trusted providers of sustainable energy solutions that meet growing global demand.”

Transaction details

Williams will hold 10% equity in Louisiana LNG LLC (HoldCo), with the remaining 90% of HoldCo currently owned by Woodside.

HoldCo owns 60% equity in Louisiana LNG Infrastructure LLC (InfraCo), with the remainder being owned by Stonepeak.

Williams will hold 80% equity in Driftwood Pipeline LLC (PipelineCo) and manage construction and operations of the Line 200 pipeline. Woodside will own the remaining 20%.

HoldCo will continue to lead the gas procurement strategy and execute agreements greater than 12 months. Leveraging the established Sequent platform and capabilities, a gas supply team will operationalise and optimise daily gas sourcing and balancing in accordance with HoldCo’s gas procurement strategy. Optimisation value created is distributed to HoldCo. The team will be Williams-led and include secondees and oversight from Woodside.

Williams’ total share of LNG production from Louisiana LNG will be 1.6 million tonnes per annum (Mtpa). This LNG production will be supplied to Williams under an LNG SPA for approximately 1.5 Mtpa and Williams will also receive the proportionate benefit (10%) of the Louisiana LNG 1.0 Mtpa SPA previously signed with Uniper.

The effective date of the transaction is 1 January 2025 with completion having occurred simultaneously with execution. The consideration includes a payment of $250 million representing Williams’ contribution to acquisition and project development costs until the effective date. Williams will also reimburse its proportionate share of development costs from 1 January 2025. The total payment received from Williams is $378 million.

Woodside’s total capital expenditure for the Louisiana LNG Project is now expected to be $9.9 billion reduced from $11.8 billion at final investment decision (FID).

HoldCo will remain consolidated in Woodside’s year end accounts. PipelineCo will be deconsolidated and recorded as an equity investment on a go-forward basis. Woodside’s financial advisers are RBC Capital Markets and Evercore, and its legal adviser is Norton Rose Fullbright.

The deal includes a provision to boost output from the assets to 1 billion cu ft daily, JERA also said.

A month ago, Reuters reported, citing unnamed sources, that the Japanese utility was negotiating a shale gas asset acquisition that could fetch $1.7 billion. In separate negotiations, JERA could invest substantial amounts in the Alaska LNG project as part of the trade deal between the United States and Japan that saw the latter pledge to buy $7 billion worth of U.S. energy commodities to reduce its trade surplus.

Japanese companies have been considering investments in the $44-billion Alaska LNG project, but so far they have appeared to be concerned that the costs may be too high, considering the cold weather in Alaska and the scale of the pipelines needed to bring the project on stream.

The Alaska LNG project will have a capacity of 20 million tons of liquefied natural gas annually, to be transported via an 800-mile pipeline to the Gulf of Alaska, from where it will be shipped around the world. The project also involves local supply of natural gas for the state of Alaska.

“The U.S. energy sector is leading the way in the global LNG market and JERA’s investments have lined up accordingly,” John O’Brien, JERA Americas’ chief executive officer, said. “The upstream Haynesville Acquisition is a strategic addition to our asset portfolio, enabling us to advance our unique supply chain expertise while deepening our commitment to America’s energy future.”

In a quiet industrial park in Wilmington, engineers at Cala Systems are reimagining one of the most ordinary appliances in your home: the water heater. But this is not about plumbing. It is about potential.

Cala builds smart, predictive heat pump water heaters that can learn a household's habits and decide when to heat water based on electricity prices, solar production, and even grid forecasts. The system uses refrigerant coils to move heat from the air instead of generating it directly, which makes it far more efficient than a standard electric heater.

Smart water heaters

""Water heaters are a battery for heat and they're in everyone's home,"" said founder Michael Rigney. ""And that's incredibly powerful if we get it right.""

The team said the units can be three to five times more efficient than traditional electric models. They can even coordinate with home solar systems or the electric grid to use energy when it is cleanest and cheapest.

""Our algorithms take in this information as well as electricity prices, home solar production to determine when it is most efficient to heat the water,"" explained Cala software engineer Phil Connaughton. ""It is applied math in motion.""

Rigney said Massachusetts was the natural place to launch the company. With support from local incubators and a growing pool of engineers, the state offers both technical talent and a shared sense of purpose.

""Here in Massachusetts we have the ecosystem to support a company like this,"" said Rigney. ""We have the talent base, we've got amazing engineers, this is the best place to do energy and climate-related hardware in the U.S.""

Growing clean energy economy

Cala's success reflects a much larger effort to grow the state's clean energy economy.

The Massachusetts Clean Energy Center, known as MassCEC, calls it the Climate Tech Corridor, a network of innovation that stretches from the Berkshires to the Cape.

""Greater Boston is a powerhouse of academic institutions and research,"" said MassCEC Senior Director Leslie Nash. ""But then central and western Mass is really the epicenter of manufacturing capacity for the state, and then along our coastlines, we have access to really well known marine industries and offshore wind and marine industries.""

That mix of research, manufacturing, and natural resources forms the foundation of a ten year plan to expand the clean energy economy. The state's new strategy was released in 2024 and aims to support more than 1,300 new climate technology companies in the next decade.

""It really maps out exactly what we are looking to do and how we are going to do it,"" Nash said.

MassCEC leaders say the initiative is about more than just climate goals. It is designed to create high quality jobs, attract private investment, and ensure that every region of the Commonwealth benefits from the transition to clean energy.

""Massachusetts does tough things,"" Nash said. ""We have always done tough things. I think MassCEC is the innovation powerhouse of government. Our job is to accelerate the clean energy and climate economy here for economic growth.""

The Climate Tech Corridor is helping turn ideas into industries and proving that tackling climate change is not only good for the planet.

So far this year, more than $24 billion worth of clean energy projects have been cancelled in the private sector, according to the analysis by E2 and the Clean Economy Tracker.
In addition, the U.S. Department of Energy has cancelled nearly $8 billion worth of projects across 200 projects.
“The loss of these projects isn’t just a setback for clean energy—it’s a setback for America’s workers and competitiveness.
Since federal clean energy tax credits were passed by Congress in August 2022, 65 announced or operational projects have been cancelled, closed, or scaled back, with 42 of them in 2025 alone.","Nearly $1.6 billion worth of large-scale factories and clean energy projects were canceled, closed, and scaled back in September, according to E2’s latest monthly analysis of clean energy projects.

So far this year, more than $24 billion worth of clean energy projects have been cancelled in the private sector, according to the analysis by E2 and the Clean Economy Tracker.

The latest wave of private-sector cancellations affected four battery, storage, and electric vehicle factories in Kansas, Michigan, North Carolina, and Tennessee.

Nearly 3,000 jobs were lost to the cancellations and scale backs in September alone, bringing the total number of jobs lost to abandoned projects in 2025 to nearly 21,000.

In addition, the U.S. Department of Energy has cancelled nearly $8 billion worth of projects across 200 projects. These are not tracked in E2’s analysis of privately funded projects.

Republican districts are losing the most from private-sector cancellations. E2 found that more than $12.4 billion in investments that would have created almost 15,000 jobs have been cancelled in Republican districts so far in 2025. Over $7.5 billion and 5,000 jobs have been lost in Democratic districts.

Last month’s cancellations were led by major automakers scaling back electric vehicle production investments. General Motors downsized two EV production lines in Tennessee and Kansas that impacts about 1,600 workers. In addition, sodium-ion battery startup Natron Energy is ending operations, closing a $40 million battery facility in Michigan that employed 150 workers. The company also cancelled plans to open a future $1.4 billion factory in North Carolina that would have employed 1,000 workers.

“The loss of these projects isn’t just a setback for clean energy—it’s a setback for America’s workers and competitiveness. For every cancelled factory or downsized plant, behind the scenes many more projects are not being announced at all as more capital flees and businesses look overseas to invest instead. That means fewer paychecks, less local investment, and fewer opportunities for U.S. workers to lead in the industries of the future,” Michael Timberlake, communications director at E2, said.

However, businesses in September announced more $542 million in investments for new electric vehicle and solar parts manufacturing facilities, and critical grid infrastructure needed to support AI data center expansion. The projects are expected to create about 985 new permanent jobs.

Through September, 62 percent of all clean energy projects announced since August 2022—along with 73 percent of all jobs and 80 percent of all investments —have been in congressional districts represented by Republicans.

Since federal clean energy tax credits were passed by Congress in August 2022, 65 announced or operational projects have been cancelled, closed, or scaled back, with 42 of them in 2025 alone.

The company owns and operates the White Mesa Mill in Utah, the only conventional uranium processing facility currently operating in the United States, with licensed capacity exceeding eight million pounds of uranium oxide annually.

Proceeds fund a sixfold capacity expansion from 10,000 to 60,000 tonnes per annum of monazite feedstock by late 2026, positioning Energy Fuels as the first domestic commercial producer of heavy rare earth oxides (dysprosium and terbium) critical for defense and clean energy applications.

The capital raise advances three strategic heavy mineral sands projects Donald in Australia, Bahia in Brazil, and Toliara in Madagascar collectively capable of supplying over 33,000 tonnes of monazite annually and reducing dependence on Chinese rare earth supply chains.

Energy Fuels benefits directly from U.S. Department of Energy initiatives including the Strategic Uranium Reserve and federal critical minerals funding programs, while uranium spot prices remain elevated and rare earth import vulnerabilities drive bipartisan policy support.

Introduction: Critical Minerals at a Strategic Inflection Point

The convergence of energy security concerns, defense supply chain vulnerabilities, and clean energy mandates has thrust critical minerals to the forefront of U.S. industrial policy. Within this landscape, Energy Fuels Inc. (NYSE American: UUUU, TSX: EFR) has emerged as a uniquely positioned domestic producer capable of supplying both uranium for nuclear baseload power and rare earth elements essential to electric vehicles, wind turbines, and advanced weapons systems. The company's October 2025 convertible debt issuance represents more than a financing event it marks a strategic pivot from uranium-focused operations to integrated critical minerals production at scale.

Against a backdrop of rising enrichment capacity announcements like Urenco USA's 15 percent expansion by 2027 and regulatory approval for 10 percent enriched uranium production, the nuclear fuel cycle is tightening. Enrichment bottlenecks and fuel service constraints amplify the value of primary uranium production, particularly from low-cost domestic sources. Simultaneously, rare earth supply chain fragility 98 percent of U.S. magnet rare earths are imported, predominantly from China creates strategic imperative and commercial opportunity for vertically integrated North American producers.

Energy Fuels sits at the intersection of these dual imperatives. With the White Mesa Mill as both a uranium processing hub and rare earth separation facility, the company has built infrastructure that would take competitors years and billions to replicate. The $700 million capital infusion accelerates timelines across uranium, rare earth, and heavy mineral sands development, potentially establishing Energy Fuels as the dominant Western supplier of dysprosium and terbium oxides materials with no substitute in high-performance permanent magnets by 2027.

Company Overview: The Only Integrated U.S. Critical Minerals Platform

Energy Fuels operates the White Mesa Mill near Blanding, Utah, a 2,000-acre facility with annual licensed capacity exceeding eight million pounds of uranium oxide. Commissioned in 1980 and acquired by Energy Fuels in stages through 2012, the mill is the sole conventional uranium processing plant operating in the United States following the shutdown of competing facilities over the past two decades. This infrastructure monopoly provides Energy Fuels with structural advantages in permitting timelines, operating leverage, and strategic optionality unavailable to greenfield developers.

The company's uranium asset base includes two producing mines Pinyon Plain in Arizona and the La Sal Complex in Utah with production beginning at both sites in the fourth quarter of 2025. Combined 2025 guidance calls for processing 700,000 to one million pounds of uranium oxide and mining 875,000 to 1.44 million pounds of contained uranium. The development pipeline adds significant scale: Sheep Mountain in Wyoming, Roca Honda in New Mexico, and Bullfrog in Utah collectively hold approximately 70 million pounds of uranium oxide resources with potential annual production of six million pounds. Management targets increasing White Mesa processing rates to two million pounds annually by 2026, driven by low-cost Pinyon Plain ore with projected cash operating costs between $23 and $30 per pound.

Beyond uranium, Energy Fuels has pioneered rare earth oxide production at White Mesa, achieving commercial-scale output of neodymium-praseodymium oxide in 2024 and initiating pilot production of dysprosium and terbium oxides in August 2025. Current Phase 1 capacity processes 10,000 tonnes per annum of monazite concentrate; the planned Phase 2 expansion increases throughput to 60,000 tonnes by late 2026. Phase 3, still conceptual, envisions full vertical integration through metal alloy and magnet production by 2028, creating a complete North American supply chain independent of Chinese processing infrastructure.

The $700 Million Convertible Notes Offering: Capital Structure and Strategic Deployment

On October 3, 2025, Energy Fuels closed an upsized $700 million convertible senior notes offering, including full exercise of underwriters' overallotment options. The notes mature October 15, 2030, carry a 3.00 percent annual coupon payable semi-annually, and convert at approximately $12.00 per share representing a 30 percent premium to the offering price. This pricing reflects investor confidence in the company's growth trajectory while providing Energy Fuels with patient, low-cost capital structured to minimize near-term dilution.

“We are pleased to announce the completion of a significant financing milestone. This strategic capital raise strengthens our balance sheet and enhances our ability to accelerate our rare earth initiatives, including the expansion at our White Mesa Mill and Donald Project in Australia. We believe this outcome represents a clear vote of confidence in our team and strategy.” — Mark Chalmers, President & CEO

The transaction fundamentally resets Energy Fuels' financial profile. Pro forma liquidity increased from approximately $250 million as of June 30, 2025, to roughly $950 million in cash and marketable securities, with no pre-existing corporate debt prior to the notes issuance. This capital cushion exceeds the combined market capitalizations of multiple junior uranium and rare earth developers, providing Energy Fuels with strategic flexibility to pursue opportunistic acquisitions, accelerate development timelines, or weather commodity price volatility without distressed capital raises.

Management allocated proceeds across three priority areas: expanding rare earth separation capacity at White Mesa through Phase 2 and Phase 3 investments; advancing the Donald, Bahia, and Toliara heavy mineral sands projects toward final investment decisions; and strengthening U.S. uranium operations through mine development and working capital. The heavy mineral sands projects are particularly strategic Donald in Australia targets first-phase production of 7,000 tonnes of monazite annually with a final investment decision expected December 2025; Bahia in Brazil is 100 percent owned with resource estimates expected in 2025-2026; and Toliara in Madagascar represents a world-class asset with 26,000 tonnes per annum monazite capacity over a 39-year mine life, pending stability agreements and a 2026 FID target.

Strategic Significance: Rare Earth Supply Chain Sovereignty

The geopolitical dimension of Energy Fuels' rare earth expansion cannot be overstated. China controls approximately 90 percent of global rare earth refining capacity and 98 percent of magnet rare earth supply to the United States, creating acute vulnerabilities in defense, aerospace, and clean energy supply chains. Dysprosium and terbium—the ""heavy"" rare earths Energy Fuels will produce commercially by late 2026—are essential additives in neodymium-iron-boron magnets, improving heat resistance and coercivity for applications in F-35 fighter jet actuators, wind turbine generators, and electric vehicle traction motors. No viable substitutes exist for these materials in high-performance applications.

Energy Fuels' integrated approach—from monazite ore sourcing through oxide separation at White Mesa—bypasses Chinese processing infrastructure entirely. The company's partnership with Astron on the Donald project and development of Toliara provide feedstock diversification beyond U.S. sources, mitigating geopolitical concentration risk while maintaining processing and value-add activities domestically. Phase 2 expansion to 60,000 tonnes per annum monazite throughput positions White Mesa as the largest rare earth separation facility outside China, with capacity sufficient to meet substantial portions of U.S. defense and industrial demand.

The commercial viability of this strategy has improved markedly. Rare earth oxide prices have stabilized following 2022-2023 volatility, with neodymium-praseodymium oxide trading near $50 per kilogram and dysprosium oxide exceeding $350 per kilogram as of mid-2025. More importantly, policy support has crystallized: the U.S. Department of Defense continues awarding contracts for domestic rare earth production, the Inflation Reduction Act provides tax incentives for critical minerals processing, and bipartisan legislation like the CHIPS and Science Act embeds rare earth supply chain development in national security infrastructure planning. Energy Fuels' eligibility for Strategic Uranium Reserve participation and critical minerals funding provides additional revenue visibility and de-risks expansion capital.

Current Activities: Execution Milestones Through 2028

Energy Fuels' operational roadmap for 2025-2028 balances near-term production ramp with medium-term capacity expansion. The fourth quarter of 2025 marks the commencement of Pinyon Plain ore processing at White Mesa, expected to lower uranium cash operating costs to the $23-$30 per pound range—among the lowest in North America. Contracted uranium sales provide revenue visibility with 300,000 pounds scheduled for 2025 delivery escalating to 880,000 pounds in 2026, all to U.S. utility customers under multi-year agreements extending through 2030.

The Phase 2 rare earth expansion feasibility study, expected completion October-November 2025, will detail capital requirements, operating costs, and production timelines for the 60,000 tonne per annum monazite expansion. Commercial production of dysprosium and terbium oxides is targeted for the fourth quarter of 2026, establishing Energy Fuels as the first mover in domestic heavy rare earth supply. Pilot operations initiated August 2025 demonstrate technical feasibility; the Phase 2 expansion scales proven processes rather than pioneering untested separation chemistry.

Parallel advancement of heavy mineral sands projects creates optionality in feedstock sourcing. The Donald joint venture with Astron targets December 2025 for a Phase 1 final investment decision covering 7,000 tonnes annual monazite supply. Bahia resource definition work continues through 2025-2026, with Energy Fuels holding 100 percent ownership and development flexibility. Toliara remains the flagship long-term asset: 26,000 tonnes per annum monazite capacity over 39 years would supply White Mesa at Phase 2-3 scale for decades, though regulatory approvals and stability agreements with the Malagasy government must be secured before a 2026 FID proceeds. The $700 million capital raise de-risks all three projects by eliminating near-term financing constraints.

The Investment Thesis for Energy Fuels

Acquire exposure to the only U.S. uranium mill operator as enrichment capacity constraints and reactor restarts tighten primary supply, targeting $60-$75 per pound uranium pricing scenarios by 2027.

Position for domestic rare earth supply chain development ahead of anticipated Department of Defense procurement contracts and critical minerals stockpiling initiatives expected 2026-2027.

Diversify into integrated critical minerals producers with operational assets rather than development-stage explorers if heavy rare earth oxide prices sustain above $300 per kilogram through 2026.

Monitor White Mesa Phase 2 feasibility study results in Q4 2025 for capital efficiency metrics; target entry if all-in costs remain below $40 per kilogram for separated dysprosium oxide.

Evaluate accumulation strategies following Toliara final investment decision announcement, anticipated mid-2026, which would secure 39-year feedstock visibility and eliminate major development risk.

Consider hedging through paired trades versus Chinese rare earth producers if U.S.-China trade tensions escalate, as Energy Fuels' production growth directly displaces import dependency.

Investor Takeaway: Asymmetric Exposure to Critical Minerals Policy

Energy Fuels' $700 million convertible notes offering transforms the company from a regionally significant uranium producer to a nationally strategic critical minerals platform. The capital raise removes financing uncertainty across rare earth expansion, heavy mineral sands development, and uranium production scaling—historically the primary risks for junior mining companies. With approximately $950 million in liquidity, Energy Fuels possesses financial staying power through commodity cycles and regulatory timelines that competitors cannot match without dilutive equity raises or project delays.

The rare earth expansion represents the company's most significant value driver. Commercial dysprosium and terbium oxide production by late 2026 positions Energy Fuels as the sole Western producer outside Chinese control, creating strategic buyer relationships with defense contractors, automotive OEMs, and wind turbine manufacturers seeking supply chain diversification. Phase 3 concepts extending into metal alloy and magnet production would capture additional margin, though near-term value accrues primarily from oxide separation capacity.

Uranium operations provide cash flow stability and leverage to nuclear policy developments. Urenco USA's enrichment expansion and regulatory approval for 10 percent enriched uranium production highlight tightening fuel cycle capacity—constraints that elevate the strategic value of domestic primary production. Energy Fuuls' contracted sales through 2030 and low-cost Pinyon Plain production buffer downside risk while maintaining upside participation in sustained uranium price strength. The convergence of energy security imperatives, defense supply chain vulnerabilities, and clean energy mandates creates a multi-year tailwind for integrated U.S. critical minerals producers—positioning Energy Fuels among the few publicly traded vehicles capable of delivering diversified exposure to this investment theme.

TL;DR

Energy Fuels closed a $700 million convertible notes offering in October 2025, increasing liquidity to approximately $950 million—the strongest balance sheet in U.S. critical minerals. The capital funds rare earth expansion at the White Mesa Mill (the only operating U.S. uranium facility) to 60,000 tonnes per annum monazite capacity by late 2026, establishing first-mover commercial production of dysprosium and terbium oxides. Proceeds also advance three global heavy mineral sands projects providing long-term feedstock security. With contracted uranium sales through 2030, low-cost production ramping, and direct policy support from DOE programs, Energy Fuels offers integrated exposure to uranium and rare earth supply chain sovereignty as enrichment constraints tighten and Chinese import dependencies drive bipartisan federal action.

“Coal has been challenged in New England for twenty years,” said Dan Dolan, president of the New England Power Generators Association.
Older, larger coal plants like Merrimack Station, despite running only during peak periods, take a long time to power up, Dolan explained.
Merrimack Station accounted for just 0.22 percent of the region’s electricity generation in 2024, according to ISO New England.
Both Merrimack Station and Schiller Station—another Granite Shore Power facility that ended coal operations in 2020 —are slated to be converted into renewable energy and battery storage sites.","The towering smokestacks of New England’s last coal-fired power plant have gone quiet. Merrimack Station in Bow, New Hampshire, shut down in September, years ahead of its scheduled closure, marking the end of coal-fired energy production in the region.

Merrimack Station had supplied electricity to the region since the 1960s. But as coal’s financial viability waned and environmental pressures mounted, the era of coal power production in New England may now be officially over. In the coming years, on-site solar and battery storage could take coal’s place at the site.

Granite Shore Power, Merrimack Station’s owner, officially ceased operations on Sept. 12. A 2024 settlement between the company, the Conservation Law Foundation, the Sierra Club and the Environmental Protection Agency over alleged Clean Water Act violations had required the facility to close by 2028. The early retirement underscores how coal has become economically untenable in the region.

“Coal has been challenged in New England for twenty years,” said Dan Dolan, president of the New England Power Generators Association. “The market no longer sustains and justifies these types of facilities.”

The station’s 438-megawatt output has steadily declined over the past two decades. Once operating at 70 to 80 percent capacity in the early 2000s, Merrimack has failed to exceed 8 percent in the past six years, running only during periods of peak electricity demand.

Older, larger coal plants like Merrimack Station, despite running only during peak periods, take a long time to power up, Dolan explained. More flexible, faster-starting natural gas “peaker” plants have now taken their place.

ISO New England, the nonprofit organization that operates the region’s electricity grid and oversees the wholesale power market, explained that it dispatches the cheapest sources first and most often—meaning coal plants like Merrimack were called upon less frequently as more affordable options became available.

Across New England, coal use fell by more than 90 percent between 2007 and 2017, displaced by cheaper natural gas and renewable power.

Entering the first New England winter without coal, the impact on the grid will be minimal. Merrimack Station accounted for just 0.22 percent of the region’s electricity generation in 2024, according to ISO New England. That shortfall can be replaced by renewables, natural gas and power imports from neighboring states.

The shutdown marks the end of a long, contentious chapter in environmental activism. In addition to litigation, Merrimack Station has been a flashpoint for protests for years.

The No Coal No Gas campaign, spearheaded by 350 New Hampshire and the Climate Disobedience Center, began in 2019 with the goal of shutting down the station. Activists staged a series of civil disobedience actions, including attempts to “liberate” coal before combustion, blockading shipments, and even occupying the station’s smokestack. Over the years, the campaign has resulted in over a hundred arrests and drawn national attention to New England’s lingering dependence on fossil fuels.

“We’re very excited,” said Rebecca Beaulieu of 350 New Hampshire. In 2023, Merrimack Station failed an emissions test that found particulate matter levels 70 percent above federal limits, along with elevated mercury and nitrogen oxide, and for every hour the plant operated, it emitted more carbon dioxide than the average American does in 26 years. “Knowing the plant will never power up again, even for an hour, is a huge relief,” she said.

While the closure brings uncertainty for Merrimack Station employees, many of whom have been transferred to other Granite Shore Power sites, both activists and the utility hope that the station’s next phase will present new job and economic opportunities for New Hampshire.

“The historic agreement with the EPA paves the way for first-of-their-kind ‘Renewable Energy Parks’ in the state,” Granite Shore Power said in a statement last year. Both Merrimack Station and Schiller Station—another Granite Shore Power facility that ended coal operations in 2020 —are slated to be converted into renewable energy and battery storage sites. The company says roughly 400 acres of land and existing grid infrastructure will make the transition possible.

Granite Shore Power credited the Inflation Reduction Act for helping make its renewable-energy plans financially feasible. But with the Trump administration moving to roll back renewable-energy incentives, the policy environment for such projects has grown uncertain.

Just weeks after Merrimack Station shuttered, the administration announced that the Department of Energy would invest $625 million in coal-related projects aimed at reviving the industry. Federal officials have not commented on the plant’s closure.

As Granite Shore Power enters a new era of coal free energy production, the No Coal No Gas campaign is turning towards oil- and gas-fired peaker plants that operate during peak demand times, including two kerosene turbines at the Merrimack Station site.

“These inefficient oil and gas facilities receive monthly ratepayer subsidies, but sit idle most of the year,” the campaign said in a statement. “When they are called to operate at times of high electricity demand, they do so with extra-high pollution at extra-high costs.”",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/s3/files/styles/social_large/s3/articles/feeds-state-100/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/merrimack-station-1024x6821761209688.jpg?h=69f2b9d0&itok=H8L_yvlE,N,,2025-10-23 13:19:34.045689

At the heart of the ENACT Partnership lies a shared conviction: that Nature-based Solutions (NbS) are among humanity’s most powerful tools to jointly address climate change, biodiversity loss, and land degradation. Opening the session, IUCN’s Global Policy Lead on Climate Change, Sandeep Sengupta, underscored how ENACT bridges ambition and implementation, uniting governments and partners to accelerate system-wide climate action grounded in nature.

From Egypt to Germany, leaders echoed the urgency to invest in nature-positive action and strengthen coordination across the Rio Conventions. ENACT Co-Chair Her Excellency Dr Manal Awad Mikhail, Minister of Local Development and Acting Minister of the Environment, Egypt, highlighted the partnership’s origins as a global call to expand NbS and bridge the gap between high-level ambition and on-the-ground results.

Echoing this vision, Co-Chair Oliver Conz of Germany’s Federal Ministry for the Environment, Nature Conservation, Nuclear Safety and Consumer Protection (BMUKN) emphasised that nature remains humanity’s most powerful ally in addressing the interconnected crises of climate and biodiversity. He stressed that the task ahead is not only to scale up solutions grounded in nature, but to act with the urgency these challenges demand — ensuring that NbS are central to both national strategies and global cooperation.

The announcement of Armenia’s entry into ENACT, presented by Ambassador Mher Margaryan, marked another step forward in expanding collective global efforts. With Armenia preparing to host the CBD COP17, the country’s commitment to embedding NbS across national strategies signalled new opportunities for integrated policy action.

Unpacking What Works: Designing NbS for Systemic Change

In a keynote address, Stewart Maginnis, IUCN’s Deputy Director General, called for a “clarion shift” toward transformational change. He emphasised that effective NbS go beyond isolated projects — they require systemic thinking that links policy, finance, and governance with ecological and social integrity.

Maginnis noted that the IUCN Global Standard for NbS provides a vital framework to design and assess solutions that deliver across climate, biodiversity, and sustainable development agendas. The standard, he said, embeds principles such as interconnectedness, equity, and reciprocity between people and nature — essential ingredients for long-term transformation.

Catalysts for Change: Turning Local Lessons into Global Standards

Kerry Max of Global Affairs Canada shared lessons from national programmes such as the 2 Billion Trees Initiative and Cariboo Carbon Solutions, illustrating how large-scale, community-led restoration can generate climate, biodiversity, and social benefits. However, he noted that successful implementation hinges on clear standards, strong data, and sustained capacity building.

Angela Andrade, Former Chair of IUCN’s Commission on Ecosystem Management (CEM), stressed that ecosystem integrity and social justice must remain at the heart of every NbS — with local communities empowered to lead design and stewardship.

Alfredo Redondo, from the High-Level Climate Champions team, highlighted the COP30 Action Agenda as a key vehicle to move from pledges to delivery, mobilising society-wide efforts and aligning global ambition with tangible results on the ground.

From Blue Carbon to Green Cities: Scaling Up for People and Planet

From Japan, Professor Atsuhiro Yoshinaka presented the Yamagawa “Sea Cradle” Blue Carbon Project, demonstrating how locally driven initiatives can align with national frameworks to deliver multiple co-benefits for climate, biodiversity, and livelihoods.

Melissa De Kock of UNEP-WCMC pointed out that to truly scale NbS, we must move beyond the environmental sector and be embedded within national development plans and budgets. She emphasised the importance of rights-based, co-created approaches that ensure long-term impact and social equity.

Urban solutions also took centre stage. Jun Hashimoto from Shimizu Corporation reflected on how corporate green spaces and urban nature can strengthen human–nature reciprocity and improve collective wellbeing.

Closing the round, Liette Vasseur, Chair of IUCN CEM, reiterated that inclusive ecosystem governance — led by communities and Indigenous Peoples — is fundamental to sustaining the gains of NbS.

From Fragmentation to Transformation

As the session concluded, Mr Sengupta reflected that achieving the 2030 goals demands a transformation in how societies design, finance, and govern NbS. ENACT, he affirmed, offers both a political platform and a practical mechanism to operationalise that change.

Looking ahead to COP30, ENACT will launch its NbS Accelerator Pathways Report, a landmark publication outlining actionable steps to scale NbS globally through real-world case studies and systems-based frameworks.",https://iucn.org/sites/default/files/2025-10/enact-event-group-photo.jpg,N,,2025-10-23 10:58:53.773573

​EVANSVILLE, Ind. - Oct. 23, 2025 - As part of a commitment to prioritize customer affordability, CenterPoint Energy today announced an initial series of Community Affordability Actions to support its customers and communities across southwestern Indiana. The effort will target keeping rates near or below the rate of inflation for the next two years, excluding expenses like fuel costs that CenterPoint does not directly control or profit from. This action will help save residential customers approximately $18 per month in avoided costs through 2027. Additional bill adjustments and credits will also start to take effect in November and result in an average net decrease of nearly $3 per month for residential customers by the end of 2025.

""We have clearly heard our customers' concerns about energy affordability. We sincerely apologize for our customers' frustration and are determined to take action. These initial Community Affordability Actions will help keep rate changes near or below the rate of inflation. Going forward, we will continue to engage with our customers, stakeholders, elected officials and community leaders to listen, gather feedback and identify ways to further address concerns and prioritize affordability, while also continuing to prioritize providing reliable power for our customers across southwestern Indiana,"" said Mike Roeder, President of CenterPoint Energy Indiana.

Community Affordability Actions

As part of an effort to balance the importance of customer affordability and the future energy needs of southwestern Indiana, CenterPoint will be engaging directly with customers and community leaders to identify additional actions that can be taken over the coming years to address customer concerns and help keep rates stable. More immediately, the first phase of its affordability actions will include the following:

Two-Year Rates Stability: Starting in the first quarter of 2026, stabilizing electricity bills by keeping any rate change below or near the rate of inflation for the next two years, an action that equates to future savings for residential customers-approximately $18/month of avoided costs through 2027.

Offset October Rate Increase: Reducing bills by nearly $3/month for average residential customers by December 2025 through a combination of bill adjustments and credits, which will offset rate changes that took effect in October.

CenterPoint's commitment to affordability builds on previous actions taken to reduce cost impacts for customers in 2023 and 2025. Those previous affordability actions included:

Voluntarily Reduced Company Profits: Lowered CenterPoint's profits as part of the recent rate case approved by the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission in February 2025.

Voluntarily Eliminated Profits on Older, Retired Power Plant: Eliminated all profits on an older, retired coal plant under recent state legislation, making CenterPoint the only utility in Indiana to take this action and helping to reduce cost impacts on customers by approximately $5/month since June 2023.

No Formal Base Rate Case for 14 Years: Between 2011 and 2023, neither CenterPoint Energy, nor its predecessor companies, filed a formal base rate case to the IURC to request increases in electric base rates in Southwestern Indiana.

Engaging With Customers Around Critical Local Grid Investments

To help address customers' questions concerning the 2025 rate case, and to reassure customers of the importance of the decade-long infrastructure investments made to exclusively benefit communities in southwestern Indiana, CenterPoint will be engaging across multiple channels with customers to highlight the benefit of these key investments. Among the investments that were supported by the recent rate changes were:

Strengthening the Electric Grid: Upgraded 11,000+ poles, transmission towers and structures to ensure reliability (2017-2022); cleared 7,000+ miles of vegetation to reduce storm-related outages (2011-2023); and made other vital infrastructure investments.

Installing Smart Meters: Installed 159,000+ smart meters to improve restoration times and provide customers more information and control over their energy usage (2011-2023).

Building New Generation Sources: Replaced coal-fired generation with secure and diversified generation resources (i.e. natural gas and renewables) to help meet current and future energy demand, which is vital to supporting future job growth in the region.

In total, because of CenterPoint's investments in southwestern Indiana, the average frequency of customer outages decreased by more than 44% from 2011 to 2024. In addition, the company's electric grid automation and reliability efforts have prevented customers from experiencing more than 8 million outage minutes since 2021.

Prioritizing Winter Savings and Energy Efficiency

CenterPoint's affordability actions will also include a community-wide outreach effort and public awareness campaign focused on winter energy savings. The goal of this effort is to raise customer awareness of vital programs and resources throughout the winter months, when global energy markets can impact local fuel pricing and customer bills. CenterPoint's winter savings campaign will begin in October and focus on important energy savings tips and resources, such as home weatherization, that can help reduce energy usage and the bill impact of fluctuations in global fuel prices.

Use of Non-GAAP Measures

As included in this news release, CenterPoint provides guidance based on non-GAAP income and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share. Generally, a non-GAAP financial measure is a numerical measure of a company's historical or future financial performance that excludes or includes amounts that are not normally excluded or included in the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure.

Management evaluates CenterPoint's financial performance in part based on non-GAAP income and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share. Management believes that presenting these non-GAAP financial measures enhances an investor's understanding of CenterPoint's overall financial performance by providing them with an additional meaningful and relevant comparison of current and anticipated future results across periods. The adjustments made in these non-GAAP financial measures exclude items that management believes do not most accurately reflect the Company's fundamental business performance. These excluded items are reflected in the reconciliation tables of this news release, where applicable. CenterPoint's non-GAAP income and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share measures should be considered as a supplement to, and not as a substitute for, or superior to, net income and diluted earnings per share, which respectively are the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures also may be different than non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies.

Non-GAAP EPS guidance excludes:

Earnings or losses from the change in value of CenterPoint's 2.0% Zero-Premium Exchangeable Subordinated Notes due 2029 (""ZENS"") and related securities;

Gains, losses and impacts, including related expenses, associated with mergers and divestitures, such as the divestiture of our Louisiana and Mississippi natural gas LDC businesses and our expected divestiture of our Ohio natural gas LDC business; and

Impacts related to temporary emergency electric energy facilities once they are no longer part of our rate-regulated business.

In providing non-GAAP EPS guidance, CenterPoint does not consider the items noted above and other potential impacts such as changes in accounting standards, impairments, or other unusual items, which could have a material impact on GAAP reported results for the applicable guidance period. The non-GAAP EPS guidance range also considers assumptions for certain significant variables that may impact earnings, such as customer growth and usage including normal weather, throughput, recovery of capital invested, effective tax rates, financing activities and related interest rates, and regulatory and judicial proceedings. To the extent actual results deviate from these assumptions, the non-GAAP EPS guidance range for any particular year may not be met, or the projected annual non-GAAP EPS growth rate may change. CenterPoint is unable to present a quantitative reconciliation of forward-looking non-GAAP diluted earnings per share without unreasonable effort because changes in the value of ZENS and related securities, future impairments, and other unusual items are not estimable and are difficult to predict due to various factors outside of management's control.

CenterPoint Energy launches cold weather communications campaign to help customers address Energy Information Administration forecast of increases in winter gas costs

​INDIANAPOLIS - Oct. 15, 2025 - Today, as part of its commitment to supporting its customers in its Indiana North natural gas service territory, CenterPoint Energy is launching a customer communication campaign encouraging eligible customers to take advantage of a series of support programs, including energy efficiency and bill assistance resources ahead of this winter heating season.

CenterPoint, as well as other Indiana natural gas utilities, is taking action in response to nationwide industry forecasts, including the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) annual Winter Heating Outlook , that indicate that gas customers across the Midwest will see higher residential bills compared to last year, as a result of rising fuel costs. The campaign, which will include social media and direct outreach to customers, is aimed at helping customers plan and prepare for the potential impact of rising fuel costs nationwide.

While the agency anticipates stable year-over-year pricing nationally, the EIA projects higher gas prices in the Midwest due to higher expenditures.

""Given seasonal forecasts, including EIA's, of an increase to the cost of natural gas, we are concerned about the potential for rising fuel prices to impact our customers' bills this winter. While CenterPoint doesn't control the price of natural gas or determine how fuel costs impact customer bills, we are committed to supporting our customers, especially those who may need help paying their energy bill. We encourage all those who may have difficulty paying their bill to plan ahead and take advantage of our customer support programs and energy-saving resources during the winter heating season,"" said Mike Roeder, CenterPoint's Senior Vice President, External Affairs.

Financial Assistance and Customer Support Programs

CenterPoint encourages customers to take advantage of payment assistance options and energy-saving programs to help manage their winter bills, including:

Customer Assistance Fund (CAF): Direct bill support is available to eligible Indiana customers who may be facing financial challenges. Administered in partnership with The Salvation Army Indiana Division and supported by CenterPoint, the CAF features an easy and accessible application process. More information is available at CenterPointEnergy.com/CAF.

Energy Assistance Program (EAP): Income-eligible customers can apply through their local community action agency or online at eap.ihcda.in.gov or call 1-800-872-0371 to find their nearest agency.

Universal Service Program (USP): Customers who apply and qualify for EAP are automatically enrolled for additional bill reductions.

Summary of Key Facts

Utilities are not permitted to mark up the cost of natural gas. Natural gas is a commodity traded in a national, deregulated market, where prices fluctuate daily with supply and demand.

CenterPoint does not control or profit from the cost of natural gas. CenterPoint purchases natural gas on behalf of its customers and then passes those costs on to customers through the gas cost adjustment, which is listed on the bill as ""Gas Cost Charge."" Only gas costs actually incurred and approved by the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission are recovered from customers. Natural gas costs are calculated separately from electric bills.

Industry forecasts, including the Energy Information Administration (EIA) annual Winter Heating Outlook point to higher residential bills this year compared to last.

Due to the forecasted increase in natural gas commodity prices, CenterPoint estimates the average residential household could expect to pay an average of approximately $112 per month over the five-month heating season (November-March), compared to approximately $105 per month last year - an increase of approximately 6% due to the price of natural gas. Actual bills vary with home size and age, number of gas appliances, thermostat settings, insulation and weather.

Natural gas remains one of the most affordable heating sources for most customers in Indiana. In fact, CenterPoint natural gas customers in the utility's Indiana North territory who heated their homes with natural gas last year saved up to $920 compared to those who heated their homes with propane and up to $369 to $1,205 compared to those who heated with an electric heat pump or electric furnace, respectively.

CenterPoint Energy's Indiana North territory delivers natural gas to approximately 634,000 customers in Adams, Allen, Bartholomew, Blackford, Boone, Clark, Clay, Clinton, Decatur, Delaware, Fayette, Floyd, Fountain, Grant, Greene, Hamilton, Hancock, Hendricks, Henry, Huntington, Jackson, Jay, Jefferson, Johnson, Lawrence, Madison, Marion, Martin, Miami, Monroe, Montgomery, Morgan, Orange, Owen, Parke, Putnam, Randolph, Rush, Shelby, Tippecanoe, Tipton, Vermillion, Vigo, Wabash, Warren, Wayne, Wells and White counties.

CenterPoint, as well as other Indiana natural gas utilities, is taking action in response to nationwide industry forecasts, including the U.S Energy Information Administration (EIA) annual Winter Heating Outlook , that indicate that gas customers across the Midwest will see higher residential bills compared to last year, as a result of rising fuel costs. The campaign, which will include social media and direct outreach to customers, is aimed at helping customers plan and prepare for the potential impact of rising fuel costs nationwide.

While the agency anticipates stable year-over-year pricing nationally, the EIA projects higher gas prices in the Midwest due to higher expenditures.

""Given seasonal forecasts, including EIA's, of an increase to the cost of natural gas we are concerned about the potential for rising fuel prices to impact our customers' bills this winter. While CenterPoint doesn't control the price of natural gas or determine how fuel costs impact customer bills, we are committed to supporting our customers, especially those who may need help paying their energy bill. We encourage all those who may have difficulty paying their bill to plan ahead and take advantage of our customer support programs and energy-saving resources during the winter heating season,"" said Mike Roeder, CenterPoint's Senior Vice President, External Affairs.

Summary of Key Facts

Utilities are not permitted to mark up the cost of natural gas. Natural gas is a commodity traded in a national, deregulated market, where prices fluctuate daily with supply and demand.

CenterPoint does not control or profit from the cost of natural gas. CenterPoint purchases natural gas on behalf of its customers and then passes those costs on to customers through the gas cost adjustment, which is listed on the bill as ""Gas Cost Charge."" Only gas costs actually incurred and approved by the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission are recovered from customers. Natural gas costs are calculated separately from electric bills.

Industry forecasts, including the Energy Information Administration (EIA) annual Winter Heating Outlook point to higher residential bills this year compared to last.

Due to the forecasted increase in natural gas commodity prices, CenterPoint estimates the average residential household could expect to pay an average of approximately $141 per month over the five-month heating season (November-March), compared to approximately $127 per month last year - an increase of approximately 10% due to the price of natural gas. Actual bills vary with home size and age, number of gas appliances, thermostat settings, insulation and weather.

Natural gas continues to be one of the most affordable heating sources for most customers in Indiana. In fact, CenterPoint gas customers in the utility's Indiana South territory who heated their homes with natural gas last year saved up to $704, compared to those who heated their homes with propane.

CenterPoint Energy's Indiana South territory delivers natural gas to approximately 115,000 customers in Daviess, Gibson, Knox, Martin, Pike, Posey, Spencer, Vanderburgh and Warrick counties.

Financial Assistance and Customer Support Programs

CenterPoint encourages customers to take advantage of payment assistance options and energy-saving programs to help manage their winter bills, including:

Choice Program: Through CenterPoint's natural gas Choice Program, customers can choose a natural gas supplier that's right for them. Competing suppliers offer more pricing options for consumers, such as locking in a fixed rate, which allows them to comparison shop for energy the way they do for other products and services. Customers who do not choose a third-party supplier are served by one of five default Standard Choice Offer suppliers at a variable rate. Visit CenterPointEnergy.com/Choice for a list of suppliers and up-to-date prices.

Home Energy Assistance Program (HEAP): State and federal utility assistance dollars are available for income-eligible customers. Households must fall at or below 175 percent of federal poverty guidelines to apply. Visit development.ohio.gov or call (800) 282-0880 to learn more.

HEAP Winter Crisis Program: The HEAP Winter Crisis Program provides assistance once per heating season to eligible households that are disconnected or are threatened with disconnection. Households must fall at or below 175 percent of federal poverty guidelines to apply. Visit development.ohio.gov or call (800) 282-0880 to learn more.

Percentage of Income Payment Plan Plus (PIPP Plus): PIPP Plus calls for a qualified household to pay 5 percent of its monthly income for gas service throughout the year. To be eligible for the PIPP Plus program, a customer must receive his or her primary or secondary heat source from a company regulated by the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio, must have a total household income which is at or below 175 percent of the federal poverty level and must apply for all energy assistance programs for which he or she is eligible.

Summary of Key Facts

CenterPoint is not a natural gas supplier. The customer's natural gas supplier and corresponding price per unit of gas can significantly influence bill amounts. Customers can choose a fixed price that won't fluctuate over the winter months. Since natural gas represents nearly half of customers' bills during the winter months, now could be a good time for customers to explore supplier pricing options.

Industry forecasts, including the Energy Information Administration (EIA) annual Winter Heating Outlook point to higher residential bills this year compared to last.

The average CenterPoint customer paid $112 per month for natural gas service during the 2024-2025 heating season for a five-month total (November - March) of approximately $558. Actual bills vary with home size and age, number of gas appliances, thermostat settings, insulation and weather.

Natural gas continues to be one of the most affordable heating sources for most customers in Ohio. In fact, CenterPoint Ohio gas customers who heated their homes with natural gas last year saved up to $942 compared to those who heated their homes with propane and up to $324 to $2,418 compared to those who heated with an electric heat pump or electric furnace, respectively.

CenterPoint Energy's Ohio natural gas service territory delivers natural gas to approximately 330,000 customers in all or portions of Auglaize, Champaign, Clark, Clinton, Darke, Fayette, Greene, Highland, Logan, Madison, Miami, Montgomery, Pickaway, Preble, Shelby and Warren counties.

Energy secretary Ed Miliband said: “Wales is essential to the clean energy revolution that this government is delivering.
Thanks to this government’s commitment to clean energy a generation of young people in our industrial heartlands can have well-paid secure jobs, from plumbers to electricians and welders.
New initiatives include technical colleges, veteran and ex-offender training schemes, and an expanded “energy skills passport” to help oil and gas workers move into renewables.
The plan also introduces stronger employment protections and a new Fair Work Charter to guarantee fair pay and workplace rights across the clean energy sector.","The UK government will publish its first comprehensive national plan to train the next generation of clean energy workers, with employment across the sector expected to double to 860,000 by 2030.

The plan aims to ensure new roles are high quality and well paid, with Wales forecast to benefit from up to 20,000 clean energy jobs by the end of the decade—an increase of around 15,000 since 2023.

Skills in demand include electricians, bricklayers, plumbers, engineers and metal workers, with carbon capture and offshore wind set to be the largest employers.

As part of the initiative, Pembrokeshire will be one of three regions—alongside Cheshire and Lincolnshire—to pilot a £2.5m skills programme to fund new training centres, courses and career advisers for local communities.

Energy secretary Ed Miliband said: “Wales is essential to the clean energy revolution that this government is delivering. Communities across Wales have long been calling out for a new generation of good industrial jobs. The clean energy jobs boom can answer that call – and today we publish a landmark national plan to make it happen.”

“Our plans will help create an economy in which there is no need to leave your hometown just to find a decent job. Thanks to this government’s commitment to clean energy a generation of young people in our industrial heartlands can have well-paid secure jobs, from plumbers to electricians and welders.

“This is a pro-worker, pro-jobs, pro-union agenda that will deliver the national renewal our country needs.”

Welsh secretary Jo Stevens said: “Wales’s growing clean energy industry is delivering the well-paid, highly skilled jobs of the future. Projects right across the country from Pembrokeshire to Flintshire are creating opportunities for hundreds of our young people and will help drive regional growth as well as accelerating our drive towards lower bills and energy security.”

Welsh government skills minister Jack Sargeant added: “Our ambition is to ensure today’s young people will have the skills needed to work the jobs of tomorrow, helping us embed the industries and services of the future in our communities.”

The UK’s clean energy mission has already generated over £50bn in private investment since last July. Key projects include the HyNet carbon capture and storage scheme, expected to create 2,800 direct jobs across North Wales, Cheshire and Flintshire, and the Mona offshore wind farm off North Wales, set to provide 3,500 roles over its lifetime.

New initiatives include technical colleges, veteran and ex-offender training schemes, and an expanded “energy skills passport” to help oil and gas workers move into renewables.

“It’s critical for decision makers to understand that the proposed Canadys gas plant would negatively impact air quality and increase healthcare costs for South Carolina residents,” said Robby Maynor, SELC climate campaign associate.
“This report projects which areas would experience the most pollution, and how far the pollution would travel.” READ MORE | ""Residents invited to paddle Edisto River, discuss Canadys gas plant environmental impacts.""
Researchers concluded that the proposed plant would add to the health and economic burden already facing vulnerable communities near Canadys.
“The Canadys plant would increase the concentration of PM2.5 in Colleton County and cause adverse health impacts with real economic costs,” the report states.","A newly released report by Harvard University’s Dominici Lab, commissioned by the Southern Environmental Law Center, finds that Dominion Energy and Santee Cooper’s proposed 2,200-megawatt methane gas plant in Canadys could expose more than 2 million people to harmful air pollution and lead to millions in health-related costs each year.

Researchers estimate the plant would emit at least 164.3 tons of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) annually, a pollutant linked to heart attacks, strokes, and premature death even at low exposure levels. According to the report, Colleton County and surrounding areas would face the greatest concentration of pollution, though the effects could spread as far as Georgia and Florida.

“Even with conservative estimates, the projected health impacts from this methane gas plant are concerning,” said Kate Mixson, a senior attorney with the SELC. “These findings reinforce our call for a more transparent public process that considers the voices and health of nearby communities.”

The Harvard analysis found that over 7,700 residents in Colleton County would be exposed to PM2.5 levels greater than 0.1 micrograms per cubic meter, a threshold associated with measurable increases in mortality risk.

The study also determined that the burden of pollution would fall disproportionately on Black and lower-income residents. About 32% of people living in the most impacted census tracts are Black, compared to 26% statewide, and median property values in those areas are less than half the national average.

Using federal EPA models, researchers calculated that the plant could result in up to $28 million in annual health care costs, increasing to $36 million by 2040 due to inflation. Those costs stem from increases in respiratory and cardiovascular illnesses tied to PM2.5 exposure.

“It’s critical for decision makers to understand that the proposed Canadys gas plant would negatively impact air quality and increase healthcare costs for South Carolina residents,” said Robby Maynor, SELC climate campaign associate. “This report projects which areas would experience the most pollution, and how far the pollution would travel.”

Fine particulate matter, or PM2.5, is created through fossil fuel combustion. The report stresses that no level of exposure is safe and that advanced filtering technologies can reduce but not eliminate emissions.

Researchers concluded that the proposed plant would add to the health and economic burden already facing vulnerable communities near Canadys.

“The Canadys plant would increase the concentration of PM2.5 in Colleton County and cause adverse health impacts with real economic costs,” the report states.

The industrial throughput in its Houston Electric segment has risen over 11% year-to-date.

“The Greater Houston area is experiencing strong economic momentum, supported by one of the most diverse sets of growth drivers in the sector. It is not dependent on any single industry, and the impact is already visible,” said CenterPoint CEO Jason Wells.

U.S. public power utilities are spending more to handle surging demand as Big Tech builds data centers to run artificial intelligence technologies.

CenterPoint which provides electricity and natural gas to more than 7 million customers across Indiana, Louisiana, Minnesota, Mississippi, Ohio and Texas unveiled its $65 billion, 10-year capital investment plan last month.

The Houston, Texas-based company reported adjusted earnings of 50 cents per share for the three months ended September 30, above analysts’ estimate of 44 cents per share, according to data compiled by LSEG.

CenterPoint said the results were aided by $0.07 per share from growth and regulatory recovery and $0.12 per share from reduced operations and maintenance costs.

Regulatory recovery refers to the costs the state regulator allows utilities to recoup through higher rates for customers.

These gains were partially offset by $0.04 per share of higher interest expenses.

""SOSA represents the caliber of bankable, cash-flow generating assets that Asset Vault was designed to capture,"" said Chris Leary, Head of Infra Equity, OIC. ""Energy Vault's proven ability to execute on projects with strong fundamentals and long-term revenue visibility reinforces why we're committed to supporting their growth as they build a portfolio of owned and operated energy storage assets that deliver predictable returns.""

The SOSA project benefits from fully secured site control, clean title, and completed environmental and interconnection milestones, ensuring a streamlined path to construction. The offtake structure is expected to be underwritten by an investment-grade counterparty, and is expected to deliver bankable, frontloaded revenue streams, enhancing returns and de-risking project cash flows.

The BESS will leverage Energy Vault's third-generation B-VAULT™ AC product, enabling Energy Vault to deliver the system quickly and at low cost while also providing higher levels of system availability in the ERCOT region. The company's global B-VAULT™ portfolio now exceeds 2 GWh of deployed or contracted systems, spanning Europe, North America, and Asia, and is complemented by Energy Vault's gravity and hydrogen storage platforms for multi-duration energy applications.

Asset Vault creates a vertically integrated ecosystem that captures value across the entire energy storage lifecycle, combining Energy Vault's proven operational expertise with long-term asset ownership to generate predictable, recurring cash flows. Under Asset Vault, Energy Vault self-performs engineering, procurement, construction (EPC), and long-term service agreements for projects, creating multiple cash flow streams while maintaining the flexibility to optimize returns through strategic capital deployment. In addition to the SOSA BESS, current U.S. projects managed under the Asset Vault platform include the 57 MW/114 MWh Cross Trails BESS as well as the 8.5 MW/293 MWh Calistoga Resiliency Center, a hybrid energy storage system combining clean hydrogen with battery cells.

Nato members have pledged to spend 3.5% of GDP on their armed forces, weapons and other “core” items of defence spending, plus a further 1.5% on “critical infrastructure”, such as civil preparedness.
There is growing awareness among senior military figures of the potential impacts of the climate crisis, but it is not clear whether heads of government are prioritising the issue.
Many countries are cutting back spending on overseas aid, including helping poorer countries afflicted by the climate crisis, even while expanding their defence budgets.
This includes spending 3.5% on our military and 1.5% building our country’s resilience to threats.","Investment in renewable energy should be counted under defence expenditure, says a group of retired senior military personnel, because the climate crisis represents a threat to national security.

They have called for increased spending on low-carbon power as a way of making the UK and other European countries more resilient to threats from Russia and other potential aggressors.

Nato members have pledged to spend 3.5% of GDP on their armed forces, weapons and other “core” items of defence spending, plus a further 1.5% on “critical infrastructure”, such as civil preparedness.

Low-carbon energy should be included in the 1.5% pledge, the group of military experts argued in a letter to European heads of government seen by the Guardian.

“We must end our dependence on foreign oil and gas,” they wrote. “A reliance on fossil fuels makes our countries less secure. It leaves us susceptible to huge price spikes during times of conflict – as we saw when Russia invaded Ukraine.”

They added: “To help unlock the investments needed to achieve energy sovereignty, and ensure we stop handing over billions of dollars a year to the Kremlin, we urge you to push for spending on renewable and low-carbon energy to be counted as part of the Nato 1.5% target.”

Retired Lt Gen Richard Nugee, one of the signatories of the letter, told the Guardian that investing in renewable energy was more secure than seeking more gas supplies, as some have urged, because wind turbines, solar panels and other forms of renewable energy are more dispersed and thus less vulnerable to attack.

“To have a strong military deterrence, we need a resilient homeland,” he said. “If we want to build a resilient country, low-carbon energy is a very important component.”

V Adm Ben Bekkering, a former senior Royal Netherlands Navy officer and currently partner of the International Military Council on Climate and Security, said governments must take a broader view of threats. “We need to find ways to look at security from a wider perspective than just the military,” he said. “By finding ways to increase our military, economic and ecological sustainability, we stand a chance [against aggression].”

The other signatories include: Tom Middendorp, former chief of defence of the Netherlands; Air Marshal Sir Graham Stacey, former chief of staff of Nato Allied Command Transformation; R Adm Neil Morisetti, former senior Royal Navy officer and now professor of climate and resource security at University College London; retired Brig John Deverell, former UK director of defence diplomacy; and retired Lt Gen Richard Wardlaw, chair of the Centre for Economic Security and former chief of defence logistics in the UK Strategic Command.

There is growing awareness among senior military figures of the potential impacts of the climate crisis, but it is not clear whether heads of government are prioritising the issue. Downing Street earlier this month suppressed publication of a major report by the Joint Intelligence Committee that warned the UK would be at risk if large ecosystems overseas, such as the Amazon, were to collapse.

Many countries are cutting back spending on overseas aid, including helping poorer countries afflicted by the climate crisis, even while expanding their defence budgets. But several senior experts have said that governments should consider putting more money into overseas climate finance, in their own interests, and that they should finance this from their national security budgets.

Gareth Redmond-King, head of the international programme at the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit thinktank, said: “Clean energy is the route to net zero – the only solution we have to halting climate change and avoiding ever worsening impacts. And clean energy offers greater national security, if we want to end our reliance on authoritarian states that control so much of the world’s fossil fuels, at least one of whose wars have driven up household energy prices so much in recent years.”

A UK government spokesperson said: “We have made a historic commitment to spend 5% of GDP on national security. This includes spending 3.5% on our military and 1.5% building our country’s resilience to threats. By delivering our clean energy superpower mission we are getting the UK off the rollercoaster of fossil fuel prices and on to clean, homegrown power – protecting consumers, creating jobs and tackling the climate crisis.”","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b500e0e981f89bfbe37cd9b31571ee2608d1628e/758_0_3735_2988/master/3735.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=b4d2d1df08bfc19c61e90f92867fb306",N,,2025-10-23 10:25:35.975392

As soon as the shutdown began, coal-fired power plants started producing about 15% to 20% more particle pollution.
To determine whether coal-fired power plants continued to obey the rules even when environmental inspectors were furloughed and not watching, we examined data on emissions of more than 200 coal-fired power plants across the country.
Those gases, unlike particulate matter, are continuously monitored by sensors inside coal plants’ smokestacks, even when the federal government is not operating.
That means the coal plants weren’t polluting more just because they were being asked to produce more electricity.","When the U.S. government shut down in late 2018, it furloughed nearly 600 Environmental Protection Agency pollution inspectors for more than a month. Those workers had to stop their work of monitoring and inspecting industrial sites for pollution, and stopped enforcing environmental-protection laws, including the Clean Air Act.

My colleagues and I analyzed six years’ worth of air quality levels, emissions measurements, power production data and weather reports for more than 200 coal-fired power plants around the country. We found that the coal plants’ operators appeared to take advantage of the lapse in enforcement of environmental regulations.

As soon as the shutdown began, coal-fired power plants started producing about 15% to 20% more particle pollution. And as soon as the government reopened and inspections resumed, pollution levels dropped.

Particulate matter is dangerous

The longest federal government shutdown in U.S. history up until that time began on Dec. 22, 2018, and lasted until Jan. 25, 2019. During that period, about 95% of EPA employees were furloughed, including nearly all the agency’s pollution inspectors, who keep track of whether industrial sites like coal-fired power plants follow rules meant to limit air pollution.

Among those rules are strict limits on a type of pollution called particulate matter, which is sometimes called PM2.5 and PM10. These microscopic particles are smaller than the width of a human hair. When inhaled, they can travel deep into the lungs and even get into the bloodstream. Even short-term exposure to particulates increases the risk of asthma, heart disease and premature death.

To determine whether coal-fired power plants continued to obey the rules even when environmental inspectors were furloughed and not watching, we examined data on emissions of more than 200 coal-fired power plants across the country. We looked at satellite data from NASA that provides a reliable indicator of particulate pollution in the atmosphere. We also looked at the amounts of several types of chemicals recorded directly from smokestacks and sent to the EPA.

We looked at each plant’s daily emissions before, during and after the 2018-2019 shutdown, and compared them with the plants’ emissions on the same calendar days in the five previous years, when EPA inspectors were not furloughed.

Pollution rose and fell with the shutdown

We found that as soon as the EPA furlough began in 2018, particulate emissions within 1.8 miles (3 kilometers) around the coal-fired power plants rose, according to the NASA data.

The data indicated that, on average, particulate matter during the 2018 and 2019 shutdown was 15% to 20% higher than it had been during the same period in the preceding five years.

And once the EPA inspectors returned to work, the plants’ average particulate pollution dropped back to its pre-shutdown level.

We also found that two other common air pollutants from coal-fired power plants, sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides, did not increase during the furlough period. Those gases, unlike particulate matter, are continuously monitored by sensors inside coal plants’ smokestacks, even when the federal government is not operating. Particulate emissions, however, are not continuously monitored: Enforcement of those emissions standards relies on the manual collection of samples from monitors and on-site inspections, both of which halted during the shutdown.

The pattern was clear: When the EPA stopped watching, coal plants increased pollution. And once inspections resumed, emissions dropped back to normal.

Considering various explanations

To confirm that the increase in particulate pollution during the shutdown was due to the lack of inspections and not because of some other factors such as weather fluctuations, we tested a range of alternative explanations and found that they did not fit the data we had collected.

For example, weather records showed that wind, humidity and temperature at and around the coal plants during the shutdown were all within the same ranges as they had been over the previous five years. So the increased particulate pollution during the shutdown was not due to different weather conditions.

Electricity demand – how much power the plants were generating – was also typical, and did not increase significantly during the shutdown. That means the coal plants weren’t polluting more just because they were being asked to produce more electricity.

Our analysis also revealed that the coal plants didn’t shift which particular boilers were operating to less efficient ones that would have produced more particulates. So the increase in pollution during the shutdown wasn’t due to just using different equipment to generate electricity.

The emissions data we collected also included carbon dioxide emissions, which gave us insight into what the coal plants were burning. With similar weather conditions and amounts of electricity generated, different types of coal emit different amounts of carbon dioxide. So if we had found carbon dioxide emissions changed, it could have signaled that the plants had changed to burning another type of coal, which could emit more particulate matter – but we did not. This showed us that the increase in particulate emissions was not from changing the specific types of coal being burned to generate electricity.

All of these tests helped us determine that the spike in particulate matter pollution was unique to the 2018–2019 EPA furlough.

Spewing particulate matter

All of this analysis led us to one final question: Was it, in fact, possible for coal-fired power plants to quickly increase – and then decrease – the amount of particulate matter they emit? The answer is yes. Emissions-control technology does indeed allow that to happen.

Power plants control their particulate emissions with a device called an electrostatic precipitator, which uses static electricity to collect particles from smoke and exhaust before it exits the smokestack. Those devices use electricity to run, which costs money, even for a power plant. Turning them off when the plants are being monitored risks incurring heavy fines. But when oversight disappeared, the power plants could save money by turning those devices off or reducing their operation, with less risk of being caught and fined.

Our findings indicate that air pollution regulations are only as effective as their enforcement, which had already been decreasing before the 2018 shutdown. Between 2007 and 2018, EPA’s enforcement staff declined by more than 20%, and the number of inspections dropped by one-third.",https://images.theconversation.com/files/696996/original/file-20251017-56-1lt5fc.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&rect=0%2C480%2C5759%2C2879&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop,N,,2025-10-23 09:17:34.894387

,IRA Tax Credits,2025-10-23 12:33:15+00:00,www.mondaq.com,Energy Tax Credit Update: The Hunt For FEOCtober - Tax Authorities - United States,"Cadwalader,  Wickersham & Taft LLP, Wickersham & Taft LLP",,,,,https://www.mondaq.com/unitedstates/tax-authorities/1695198/energy-tax-credit-update-the-hunt-for-feoctober,"Enacted in August 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act (the ""IRA"") expanded energy tax credits by increasing credit amounts, broadening eligibility beyond wind and solar, and allowing credits to be developed and sold, as outlined here.
The widespread disappointment over its cutbacks to energy tax credits underscores how unusually generous the IRA was compared with prior climate legislation, providing a rare 10-year runway for a multibillion-dollar market to develop in just a few years.
There is also a 10-year recapture tax for the full value of the investment tax credit (""ITC"") for any violation that occurs within 10 years after the project is placed in service.
Because buyers bear this recapture risk under the rules governing credit sales, this will likely make ITCs less attractive than production tax credits (""PTCs""), which are not subject to recapture.
Tax insurance will also play a pivotal role, and we will be watching closely to see how that market responds.","Enacted in August 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act (the ""IRA"") expanded energy tax credits by increasing credit amounts, broadening eligibility beyond wind and solar, and allowing credits to be developed and sold, as outlined here.

Three years later, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (the ""OBBBA"") has reined in that momentum. The widespread disappointment over its cutbacks to energy tax credits underscores how unusually generous the IRA was compared with prior climate legislation, providing a rare 10-year runway for a multibillion-dollar market to develop in just a few years.

The Crux mid-year report shows that deal volume in the first half of 2025 is more than double the total for record-setting 2024. Amid cutbacks to wind and solar, rising demand for electricity and higher prices have pushed an already booming market to diversify further, driving significant deal volume in clean fuels, energy storage, geothermal, and nuclear. Corporate tax liabilities are projected to be lower across the board this year, which could reduce demand for credits and, in turn, lead to lower credit prices and more favorable terms for buyers.

In our last update, available here, we covered the recent guidance that tightened the rules on what it means to ""begin construction"" for purposes of the 12-month safe harbor for wind and solar projects. Now the most significant open item is the long-awaited guidance on the ""foreign entity of concern"" (""FEOC"") limitations that apply to most credit-eligible projects. The IRS missed the August deadline set by Trump's executive order, leaving the market in suspense as it awaits the guidance package.

Here's what we know about the FEOC rules so far: a developer cannot claim a credit if a project has impermissible ties to China, Iran, North Korea, or Russia. These ties go beyond where an entity is organized and disqualify any project that has received ""material assistance"" from a prohibited foreign entity during construction, requiring scrutiny of payments to suppliers, licensing arrangements, debt structures, and even warranty providers. There is also a 10-year recapture tax for the full value of the investment tax credit (""ITC"") for any violation that occurs within 10 years after the project is placed in service. Because buyers bear this recapture risk under the rules governing credit sales, this will likely make ITCs less attractive than production tax credits (""PTCs""), which are not subject to recapture.

Although the rules are only forward-looking (i.e., not retroactive), forthcoming guidance should clarify how to cure a taint from impermissible ties to a prohibited foreign entity, potentially allowing developers to restructure projects to preserve credit eligibility. Guidance should also address whether developers can rely on certifications and de minimis rules when conducting supply chain due diligence.

As we wait for this crucial guidance, the uncertainty and suspense may feel like a spy thriller, but once the FEOC guidance arrives, the market is likely to grow more comfortable with the limitations and deals can move forward on a more predictable plotline. Tax insurance will also play a pivotal role, and we will be watching closely to see how that market responds.

We will continue to monitor developments and provide updates in Brass Tax as the landscape evolves.

What is the Build Public Renewables Act?
At the time, public power advocates were concerned that this so-called “BPRA-Lite” legislation gave too much flexibility to NYPA.
In June 2024, Public Power NY released a report recommending that NYPA build 15 gigawatts of renewables by 2030 – enough to power 12 million households.
Public power advocates oppose the new nuclear power plant, calling it a distraction from the renewable goals signed into law.","In the fight for a just transition to renewable energy in the United States, New Yorkers achieved two major legislative wins in 2019 and 2023. Today, the realization of that landmark legislation hinges on whether the Democratic governor will uphold those legislative commitments – or yield to a resurgent Trump administration and the escalating energy demands of AI data centers.

During the peak of the youth-led climate movement in 2019, New York was one of seven states (and Puerto Rico) to set 100% clean energy goals. The aggressive 2019 legislation, titled The Climate Leadership and Community Protection Act, mandated that New York achieve 70% renewable energy by 2030 and 100% emission-free energy by 2040.

But the legislation offered little “how to” for doing so. In late 2019, community organizers, environmental justice groups, and Democratic state assemblymembers came together to form the Public Power NY coalition to advocate for their plan: the Build Public Renewables Act.

What is the Build Public Renewables Act?

The BPRA took advantage of a unique entity in New York: the New York Power Authority, a public utility company founded in 1931 by then-Governor Franklin D. Roosevelt. The utility built two major dams on the Canadian border which still supply a fifth of New York’s power today. FDR believed public utilities would serve as a check against for-profit monopolies on energy resources and provide cheaper electricity for New Yorkers.

The BPRA authorized NYPA to build and own new renewable energy and battery storage projects in order to meet New York’s 2019 climate goals. The legislation also included a program for low-income New Yorkers to receive clean energy credits, required new projects to be built with union labor, and mandated the closure of New York City’s peaker plants – high-emission fossil fuel plants known for polluting Black and Brown neighborhoods when energy demands peak in the summer months. In many ways, the BPRA was a state-level Green New Deal.

“Thanks to FDR’s vision and the fighting spirit of New Yorkers, we have the tools in place to launch a new era of public power that serves all people – not just wealthy investors,” State Senator Julia Salazar and Assemblymember Sarahana Shrestha wrote in 2024. “Through NYPA, we can build a truly green New York, with 100% renewable energy, plentiful union jobs, lower bills and cleaner, healthier air.”

Public Power NY spent four years campaigning for the passage of the BPRA. They organized statewide orientation sessions and rallies to help New Yorkers understand how for-profit utilities affect their cities. Con Edison, for example, was charging the second-highest residential rates in the country while paying $1.4 million in annual dues to trade associates like the American Gas Association, which lobbies against renewables and for a deregulated energy market.

In response to public pressure, Governor Kathy Hochul incorporated the BPRA into the 2023-2024 state budget – with one critical difference. Under the original BPRA, NYPA was not only empowered to build out renewables: it mandated that NYPA evaluate the private market’s progress toward the 2019 goals and build clean energy projects if the market was not on track to meet those goals. Under the 2023-2024 state budget legislation which passed, NYPA is mandated to evaluate progress toward the 2019 goals – but it is not legally required to contribute progress when the private market fails.

At the time, public power advocates were concerned that this so-called “BPRA-Lite” legislation gave too much flexibility to NYPA.

“In my opinion, her version is designed to fail,” Shrestha told Prospect in 2023.

The current status of public power in New York

Renewables generate about a third of New York’s current energy production – over of half of which comes from the hydropower plants built by NYPA decades ago. Between 2017 and 2024, the share of renewables in New York increased by less than one percent.

In June 2024, Public Power NY released a report recommending that NYPA build 15 gigawatts of renewables by 2030 – enough to power 12 million households. When a draft plan released in October 2024 proposed a set of projects only worth 3.5 gigawatts, the campaign collected 5,300 public comments demanding the full 15 gigawatts.

In response to public pressure, NYPA released an updated plan in July 2025 with 17 more solar arrays and 3 wind turbine projects – bringing the total proposed energy capacity to 7 gigawatts.

“Our priority is to build at least 15 GW of public renewables by 2030 in order to cut pollution from racist peaker plants, lower New Yorkers’ energy bills, create green union jobs, and get back on track to our climate goals,” Michael Paulson, co-chair of Public Power NY and associate director of Sane Energy Project, told me via email last week. “15 gigawatts will deliver 25,000 union jobs, a five-year faster phaseout of the state’s most polluting plants, and at least twice the total energy bill discounts as the current plan. There is no excuse not to do this.”

The legally binding 2030 goal of 70% renewables isn’t the only time-crunch New York faces. The BPRA was the legislative tool needed to take advantage of the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, which offered tax credits and other incentives for building renewables. But the IRA was one of the first items President Trump targeted with executive orders on his first day back in office.

The end of IRA clean energy tax credits came under H.R. 1, the so-called “Big Beautiful Bill,” which Trump signed into law in July 2025. Under this legislation, clean energy projects can only qualify for the IRA tax credits if they start construction before July 2026 or come into service by the end of 2027.

“Trump’s attacks on renewable energy, including the dismantling of the Inflation Reduction Act, is all the more reason that an ambitious buildout of public power is the critical boost New York needs,” Assemblymember Shrestha told me via email last week. “NYPA is well-positioned to ambitiously build projects before the IRA provisions sunset.”

A spokesperson from NYPA told me last week that they are “aggressively pursuing” renewables despite the federal challenges. At the U.S. Climate Alliance roundtable in September, Governor Kathy Hochul announced she would grant $200 million from the state budget for NYPA to build renewables while keeping prices low for ratepayers.

However, in early August, Governor Hochul admitted that New York was unlikely to meet the 2019 climate goals, citing economic challenges. Despite the possibility of missing legally binding state targets, the governor has recently approved and advocated for alternative energy projects, including a revived gas pipeline and an upstate one-gigawatt nuclear plant.

Competing visions for New York’s energy

In early August, Governor Hochul came under fire by over 100 climate groups for reviving the Northeast Supply Enhancement project, a gas pipeline previously rejected by New York regulators.

While the governor denies any deal was made, the White House said Hochul “caved” to Trump’s demand for the NESE pipeline in exchange for lifting a stop-work order the administration had placed on a New York offshore wind project.

Several protests have been held across New York opposing the revived pipeline project.

The NESE pipeline was not the only project discussed by Trump and Hochul. The governor told Bloomberg TV she also sought Trump’s help in streamlining approvals for nuclear energy.

In June, Governor Hochul announced she was directing NYPA to build a one-gigawatt advanced nuclear power plant in upstate New York. Under state law, nuclear is not considered renewable; the new nuclear plant will not contribute to the 2019 goal of 70% renewables by 2030.

During a NYPA board meeting in July, Senior Vice President Alexis Harley said that nuclear energy will help New York meet increased energy demands from new data centers powering artificial intelligence. Hochul has been supportive of developing upstate New York into a tech center similar to Silicon Valley.

Across the country, the high power demands of new AI data centers are preventing fossil fuel power plants from retiring. A typical AI data center consumes as much electricity as 100,000 households and uses billions of gallons of water to cool its computers.

“The cherry on top, of course, is that [nuclear] is aligned with the priorities of the federal administration,” Harley said during the board meeting.

Public power advocates oppose the new nuclear power plant, calling it a distraction from the renewable goals signed into law.

“Instead of embracing public power, Kathy Hochul is pushing an energy plan written by tech billionaires, gas utility CEOs, and Donald Trump,” Paulson told me via email. “She is publicly calling for an economy built around energy-guzzling, job-killing AI data centers, and fast tracking the Williams NESE Pipeline, which may as well be called the Trump-Hochul pipeline, all of which make energy even less affordable for New Yorkers.”

The Public Power NY coalition continues to push for NYPA for a full 15 gigawatts of renewables by 2030. In late September, six members of Congress, including Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, wrote a letter to NYPA’s Chief Executive Officer Justin Driscoll in support of the demand for 15 gigawatts.

Earthjustice also filed a lawsuit in March on behalf of several climate groups accusing Governor Hochul and the New York Department of Environmental Conservation of failing to introduce climate regulations that were due in January 2024.

“The failure of Governor Hochul and DEC to follow the clear mandates of our climate law has real consequences for New Yorkers — more storms and other severe weather, more pollution and a less livable future,” said Bob Cohen, the policy and research director at Citizen Action of New York. “The time for action is now.”

While the Trump administration, Governor Hochul, and the Public Power NY coalition clearly have different visions for New York’s energy future, New York legally committed to a future with renewable energy in 2019. With NYPA and the BPRA legislation that passed via the 2023-2024 state budget, New York has the tools to achieve this legal mandate via a just transition – and become an example for other states which set clean energy goals.

Whether it does so may depend on Governor Hochul’s willingness to focus on the public power New Yorkers fought for and stand up to the Trump administration.",https://www.counterpunch.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/fre-sonneveld-q6n8nIrDQHE-unsplash-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-10-23 10:25:40.126588

According to the company, Williams will contribute its share of the capital expenditure for the LNG facility and pipeline of approximately $1.9 billion and assume LNG offtake obligations for 10% of produced volumes.

Chad Zamarin, President and CEO of Williams, underlined. “This transaction marks an important step forward in Williams’ wellhead to water strategy – integrating upstream, midstream, marketing and LNG capabilities to deliver the cleanest, most reliable energy to global markets.”

The firm currently operates more than 33,000 miles of pipeline across 24 states in the U.S., and its existing gas sourcing platform, Sequent Energy Management (Sequent), has a marketing and optimization footprint of over 7 bcf/d.

With total received proceeds of $378 million, including proportionate capital reimbursement since the effective date, this transaction is perceived to represent the next key stage toward realizing the Australian firm’s strategy for the project, securing capital and offtake commitments alongside a strong strategic partner with complementary capabilities in U.S. natural gas infrastructure and the Sequent platform.

Meg O’Neill, Woodside’s CEO, commented: “We are excited to have Williams join us as a strategic partner in Louisiana LNG given its leadership in U.S. natural gas infrastructure and ability to add value and deliver operational benefits to enhance the project. This is Williams’ first investment in LNG and its participation in Louisiana LNG is a testament to the quality of the project.

“The bringing together of Woodside’s proven track record in developing and operating LNG facilities and global marketing, and Williams’ expertise in pipelines and gas sourcing, creates an energy partnership that has the combined capability to realise opportunities for long-term global energy demand.”

This player is anticipated to utilize its pipeline experience to construct and operate the Line 200 pipeline to the Louisiana LNG terminal. A gas supply team will operationalize and optimize daily gas sourcing and balancing in line with Louisiana LNG’s gas procurement strategy, leveraging the established Sequent platform and capabilities to support reliable feedgas supply for the benefit of all Louisiana LNG participants.

“With strong LNG contracting momentum from Louisiana LNG and our portfolio, our existing infrastructure partner New York-based Stonepeak, and our key contracting partners including Bechtel, Baker Hughes and Chart, we are on track to deliver first LNG in 2029 and create long-term value for our shareholders,” explained O’Neill.

Williams’ total share of LNG production from Louisiana LNG will be 1.6 million tonnes per annum (mtpa) supplied to the firm under an LNG sale and purchase agreement (SPA) for approximately 1.5 mtpa, with the firm receiving the proportionate benefit of the Louisiana LNG’s 1 mtpa SPA previously signed with Uniper.

The company faces multiple cost pressures. For instance, tariffs imposed by the Trump administration on auto parts imports cost Tesla more than $400 million this quarter, and operating expenses rose 50%, driven by AI and R&D initiatives, stock-based compensation, and planned capital expenditures expected to increase substantially in 2026. Automotive regulatory credit income fell to $417 million, down from $739 million a year ago. Tesla reported a gross margin of 18%, slightly above estimates, while its automotive margin excluding regulatory credits was 15.4%.

To address potential demand declines, Tesla introduced lower-cost “Standard” variants of the Model Y and Model 3 earlier this month, cutting prices by $5,000 to $5,500. However, analysts caution that the strategy could compress margins, as cost reductions may not fully offset the lower selling prices.

Looking ahead, Tesla remains on track to begin volume production of its Cybercab robotaxi, Semi truck, and Megapack 3 battery system in 2026. The company’s energy business showed strength, with storage deployments increasing 81% in the quarter. Production of the humanoid robot Optimus is also expected to start toward the end of 2026.

By Akash Sriram and Abhirup Roy

(Reuters) -Tesla reported record third-quarter revenue that beat Wall Street estimates on Wednesday, driven by the highest quarterly sales of its electric vehicles as U.S. buyers rushed to lock in a key tax credit ahead of its expiry last month.

However, Tesla's profit failed to live up to analysts' expectations, in part due to tariff and research costs, as well as a drop in income from regulatory credits that are expected to continue to fade away with recent legislation passed by the Trump administration.

Tesla's $1.45 trillion valuation largely reflects investor bets on CEO Elon Musk's pivot to robotics and AI, but vehicle sales remain key to the financial stability of the company while those products are being developed. Shares of the Austin, Texas-based company were down 4% in extended trading.

Demand for Tesla's vehicles and those of its rivals is also expected to drop through the rest of the year without the tax credits that have been a key driver of EV sales.

Apart from the removal of tax credits and the waning sales of regulatory credits that traditional automakers bought to make up for their polluting vehicles, Tesla is also grappling with tariffs imposed by the Trump administration on auto-parts imports, which Chief Financial Officer Vaibhav Taneja said cost Tesla more than $400 million in the quarter.

The EV maker also reported a 50% rise in operating expenses driven by AI and other research and development projects, an increase in stock-based compensation, and on an earnings conference call, Taneja said capital expenditures would rise substantially in 2026.

""Tesla dished out just the right amount of good and bad news to both appease its fans while also providing enough evidence for its critics,"" Camelthorn Investments adviser Shawn Campbell told Reuters. ""This earnings report isn't going to change anyone's mind on Tesla.""

To combat a demand drop, Tesla introduced lower-cost ""Standard"" variants of Model Y and Model 3 vehicles earlier this month, stripping out a myriad of premium and basic features and lowering prices by about $5,000 to $5,500.

While Tesla hopes the cheaper variants will drive higher volumes, analysts warn the move will squeeze margins as thousands of dollars of cost cuts per vehicle may not fully compensate for lower selling prices.

Tesla said it was on track to start volume production of its Cybercab robotaxi, Semi truck and Megapack 3 battery in 2026. Tesla's energy business also showed strength, including an 81% increase in storage deployment in the quarter, and its robot plans are advancing, with production of humanoid bot Optimus hopefully starting toward the end of 2026, Musk said.

The electric vehicle maker reported total revenue of $28.1 billion for the third quarter ended September 30, compared with analysts' average estimate of $26.37 billion, according to data compiled by LSEG.

Profit per share in the third quarter was 50 cents, below analysts' estimates of 55 cents.

Automotive regulatory credits, once a key driver of profit, fell to $417 million in the quarter from $739 million a year ago and $435 million in the second quarter.

Tesla reported gross margin of 18%, compared with estimates of 17.5%. Its closely watched automotive gross margin, excluding regulatory credits, was 15.4%, compared with an average estimate of 15.6%, according to 19 analysts polled by Visible Alpha.

Tesla did not provide a full-year forecast for production, but Musk said Tesla could expand production, given his confidence in self-driving software. Asked whether increasing production would require offering incentives and squeezing profit margins, Musk forecast ""nutty"" demand for the self-driving Cybercab and said margins would not be sacrificed.

Tesla launched a limited rollout of its self-driving ""robotaxi"" service in Austin, Texas earlier this year. Musk also said he expected robotaxis to operate without safety drivers in large parts of Austin this year and that robotaxis would be operating in eight to ten metropolitan areas by the end of the year as well. In July, he had predicted Tesla robotaxis to serve about half the U.S. population by year end.

Wall Street expects Tesla's deliveries in 2025 to fall 8.5% due to the expiry of the tax credit, reliance on older models and rising competition. CEO Musk's embrace of right-wing politics has also alienated some potential buyers.

But many investors are deeply confident in Musk. Nancy Tengler, CEO and chief investment officer of Tesla shareholder Laffer Tengler Investments, said she was bullish on the next three to five years. ""I'm less concerned about the next quarter,"" she said. ""It's messy, it's hard, it's trial-and-error, it's try again. But this is a CEO who is determined. And I think what we've seen historically is that he will get it done""

""Moreover, the solar system can serve as an emergency power source during disasters.""","The electric vehicle sector is at a turning point as solar integration technology advances, with innovations emerging that could transform how EVs draw power for everyday mobility.

Nissan's latest technological development, presented as a prototype at Japan Mobility Show 2025, demonstrates how automotive manufacturers are exploring renewable energy solutions that could reduce dependency on traditional charging infrastructure.

The Japanese automaker has fitted its Sakura model with an integrated solar power generation system, marking what could be an important step in EV energy autonomy.

On LinkedIn, Nissan says: ""Harnessing the power of the sun to go further. A lot further.

""With a special roof-mounted solar system, this prototype Nissan Sakura EV's driving range potential just got levelled up."".

Solar technology meets EV engineering

The Ao-Solar Extender system is an in-house development initiative aimed at addressing two key challenges in EV adoption: charging convenience and grid independence.

Nissan selected the Sakura, Japan's top-selling EV, as the platform for this solar integration technology.

According to Nissan's development team, the system could generate sufficient solar electricity to support up to 3,000km (1,800 miles) of annual driving.

This capability suggests that for certain usage patterns, solar energy could supplement or replace conventional charging methods.

Strategic innovation framework

The solar integration concept aligns with the second pillar of Nissan's Re:Nissan strategy, which the company describes as ""a renewed commitment to delivering innovative products and mobility solutions that enhance customer experience"".

Nissan explains: ""Integrating solar technology into the Sakura exemplifies Nissan's commitment to innovative, sustainable mobility solutions that resonate within Japan's highly competitive Kei segment.

""This initiative not only reinforces Nissan’s leadership in environmentally conscious innovation but also highlights how the company is actively shaping the future of EV ownership with practical, eco-friendly technologies.""

Usage pattern analysis

The Sakura has achieved best-selling EV status in Japan for three consecutive years, with popularity driven by its suitability for daily driving ranges and compact dimensions suited to urban environments.

Nissan says: ""With the installation of the Ao-Solar Extender, the development team hopes that users can further reduce reliance on charging infrastructure.

""Analysis of driving data from Sakura owners shows that many primarily travel short distances for errands and school runs, suggesting that solar-generated power could nearly eliminate the need for grid-based charging for a significant portion of owners.

""Moreover, the solar system can serve as an emergency power source during disasters.""

This dual-purpose functionality positions the technology as both a mobility innovation and a resilience tool for emergency situations, expanding its value proposition beyond conventional transport applications",https://assets.bizclikmedia.net/1200/c393111d6609f5d764c13917c1a5f54b:a5e43e3a3ae61495701fbcf992f44ebf/251022-01-a4-09497-source.jpg.jpg,N,,2025-10-23 08:00:01.762292

The energy center represents the next step in Alliant’s commitment to providing safe, reliable and cost-effective energy for Marshall County residents, he said.
Supervisors also approved three conditional use permits for other wind energy projects.
While the county has not received any negative comments regarding the evaluation towers, Kelley added they did receive two regarding overall wind energy within Marshall County.
Jackson Frehley with Scout Clean Energy said work began on the wind energy project in January, and the company has received the strongest interest from landowners than any other Scout project in the Midwest.","Energy was the root of four agenda items at the Marshall County Board of Supervisors regular Wednesday meeting.

The supervisors approved writing a letter of support for the proposed Bobcat Energy Center. Chris Braye with Alliant Energy presented the request for the letter. The energy center represents the next step in Alliant’s commitment to providing safe, reliable and cost-effective energy for Marshall County residents, he said.

Alliant is continuing to invest in a balanced mix of renewable and traditional energy sources to meet the customer demand and support economic growth.

“Once operational the Bobcat Energy Center will support greater reliability and resilience by allowing us to respond quickly to changes in demand and complement our investment in renewable resources and battery storage,” Braye said. “With fast startup times between five and 30 minutes, the facility will run only during peak periods of demand and while the Marshalltown Generating Station runs consistently to deliver energy to our customers.”

Both the Bobcat center and the station are key to Alliant’s balanced strategy to meet demand and pave the way for a strong, resilient energy future, he added.

Supervisor Carol Hibbs asked if she understood correctly that the project had been submitted to the Iowa Utilities Commission (IUC), and what sort of timeline is in place. Braye told her she was correct and added the typical timeline for the IUC to approve is anywhere from six to 12 months.

“LIke you stated, that process has already been started,” he said. “I do believe that early estimations of completion for the project are looking at [quarter] three, [quarter] four of 2029.”

Hibbs said the board of supervisors are enthusiastically supporting the project.

Supervisors also approved three conditional use permits for other wind energy projects. Representatives were present from Scout Clean Energy and MidAmerican Energy to answer any questions.

Zoning Administrator Tyler Kelley, participating virtually, gave a brief overview of the project for two permits, which request temporary meteorological evaluation towers by Saint Anthony as part of Scout Clean Energy’s wind study for the wind energy project. While the county has not received any negative comments regarding the evaluation towers, Kelley added they did receive two regarding overall wind energy within Marshall County.

Jackson Frehley with Scout Clean Energy said work began on the wind energy project in January, and the company has received the strongest interest from landowners than any other Scout project in the Midwest.

“We have signed 35 leases, totaling 11,000 acres, and these are all in various states of being processed by the county recorder,” he said. “It usually takes two to three years to get to that kind of acreage. Overall, this project will probably sign close to 30,000.”

The temporary evaluation towers are designed to measure wind speed, so Scout can ensure the wind speed is what they estimate it to be.

“We hope to install them sometime between Thanksgiving and Christmas,” Frehley said. “We’re looking at putting up two towers. We’ve sited them in areas that are best to resource, but are also set significantly back from any houses in the area. All of these are at least 2,000 feet away from any exterior walls of the homes.”

He added the temporary towers will be up for at least two years, but Scout might leave them up until construction starts.

Frehley said Scout plans to connect to a not-yet-built MidAmerican transmission line coming to Marshall County in 2032. He added MidAmerican has not requested bids for the line project yet, but wind energy takes an average of eight years to build, so such actions need to start early.

“So, we are looking at the earliest this project could finish construction is 2032, depending on the final size, it will be somewhere between $1 million to $3 million per year for the county in tax revenue, and $2 million to $4 million per year for the landowners,” he said. “At this point, still incredibly early – just year one of seven to eight years for construction.”

Another energy permit approved by the supervisors is for an aircraft detection lighting system (ALDS) tower in the new Vienna Wind Energy project.

“It will keep the lights off unless an aircraft approaches,” he said. “I think this will take some of the complaints we have received about the flashing lights away, and it will be a good addition to this project.”

Mid-American Energy Project Developer Jill Ingraham said it would turn lights on when low-flying aircraft get within three nautical miles of one of the Vienna turbines. The lights will be turned off when the aircraft leaves the area. She said if the ALDS tower does go down, all of the lights in the Vienna project will turn back on. They hope to have it completed by the end of 2025.

The most popular gas-fueled vehicles in Colorado continue to be the Ford F-series pickups and the Subaru Crosstrek.","Coloradans rushed to capture expiring federal tax credits in the last three months, pushing the clean-car portion of new sales to a record 32.4% and buying a higher ratio of electric vehicles and plug-in hybrids than any other state, according to dealer statistics.

The EV and plug-in hybrid EV share of new car sales jumped sharply from 24.2% in the second quarter and surpassed the single-quarter record share of 31.5% at the end of 2024. Consumers crowded EV dealers to take advantage of a $7,500 federal subsidy taken at the cash register, before it expired Sept. 30 as a result of new Trump administration and congressional energy policies.

In July, August and September this year, full-battery EVs made up 26.4% of Colorado new car sales, and plug-in hybrids took 6% of sales; both categories are considered clean energy cars under federal and state rules. A third category of important but less-efficient new car, hybrids like the Toyota RAV4 Hybrid or Subaru Forester Hybrid, made up 12.6% of sales in the third quarter, down slightly from the previous quarter.

“Coloradans and the free market are saying loud and clear that affordable, clean and efficient electric vehicles are here to stay. Colorado leads the nation in electric vehicles and these clean, quiet, fun cars are saving Coloradans money while improving air quality. We look forward to building on this important work to give Coloradans more vehicle choices,” Gov. Jared Polis said in a statement accompanying the stats.

While Colorado’s auto dealers predicted in their quarterly report that fourth quarter EV sales will drop with loss of the generous federal credit, state officials will try to keep the party going with a boosted local incentive. For the remainder of 2025, all Colorado buyers get $3,500 state tax credit off the top for a new EV costing up to $80,000, and $2,500 more if the price is under $35,000. (The $3,500 credit will fall to $750 on Jan. 1, but the extra $2,500 for cheaper EVs will stay in place.)

Starting in November, Colorado is also raising the stakes in its cash-for-clunkers program, called Vehicle Exchange Colorado. Consumers at 80% or below of their area median income can turn in a gas-fueled vehicle that failed an emissions test or is 12 years or older, and receive $9,000 toward a new EV, up from $6,000. An income-qualified buyer of a used EV turning in an old car would receive $6,000, up from $4,000. All those offers are available for leases, as well.

Colorado’s 32.4% share for EVs and plug-in hybrids combined in the third quarter pushed it ahead of perennials California, Oregon and Washington, and at the top of all 21 states reporting quarterly sales registrations. The national average for combined clean-car sales was only 12.6%.

From the October 2025 Issue

As organizations and operators continue to prioritize sustainability and resilience, the conversation around fleet electrification is gaining momentum. While the shift to electric vehicles (EVs) is often framed around environmental benefits, it also opens the door to smarter energy strategies to enhance operations and reduce costs.

According to the State of Sustainable Fleets brief from TRC Companies, more than $13.5 billion in state and local funding remains available for zero-emission (ZE) and near-zero-emission (NZE) vehicle projects. As the adoption of electric vehicle (EV) fleets accelerates, so does the need for microgrids (solar, battery, generators) to accelerate their scale-up of charging needs for their fleet.

Microgrids comprised of solar, battery, and/or generators can help lower long term operating costs, increase resiliency, solve near-term utility timelines, and lower carbon impact. Many fleets are already using temporary to permanent on site generation to convert stored or utility fuel, such as natural gas, diesel, or propane into electricity.

Therefore, it is essential for facility professionals to understand the advantages and challenges of integrating EV charging solutions with on-site power generation and storage. This includes analyzing environmental impacts, regulatory and policy considerations, cost savings, operational efficiencies, and other key factors.

Incentives, Regulations, And Policy Considerations Drive Adoption

Understanding and navigating regulatory and policy frameworks is essential for the effective implementation of EV charging solutions with power generation capabilities. According to the U.S. Department of Energy, there are still government incentives, such as rebates and subsidies, to significantly lower costs, making these technologies more cost effective to fleet operators.

Compliance with industry standards and regulations is critical to ensuring that infrastructure remains safe, reliable, and efficient. For facilities managers, staying informed about evolving policies is essential —not only for seamless system integration and operation—but also to maintain legal compliance and avoid potential penalties. By leveraging available incentives and upholding strict regulatory adherence, companies can accelerate the adoption of sustainable technologies while advancing broader environmental goals.

Amped Up Cost Savings

One of the most compelling reasons for fleet-owning companies to adopt EVs is the potential for cost savings. Electric vehicles typically have lower fuel and maintenance costs compared to traditional internal combustion engine vehicles. Charging solutions with power generation capabilities can further reduce operational expenses by leveraging local and renewable energy, thereby decreasing reliance on grid electricity and lowering energy costs. These value savings are especially evident in Class 1-4 cars, trucks, and buses where the purchase premium is much lower compared to their gas or diesel alternatives.

Smarter Charging For Operational Efficiency

EV charging solutions offer advanced features that improve fleet management and operational efficiency. Real-time monitoring and data analytics enable companies to optimize charging schedules, track vehicle performance, and better manage energy consumption. These capabilities ensure that fleets are always ready for deployment, minimizing downtime and maximizing productivity.

Enhancing User Experience

Adopting EV charging solutions with integrated power generation enhances convenience and elevates the overall experience for fleet drivers. These systems offer faster charging times than traditional charging stations, as well as strategically placed stations that reduce wait times and boost efficiency. Drivers can benefit from features like real-time updates and mobile app integration, which allow them to locate available chargers, monitor charging progress, and receive notifications when their vehicle is ready.

Using renewable energy sources ensures a reliable and environmentally friendly charging experience. Organizations can significantly improve the overall experience for their drivers, fostering a more productive and positive operational environment with the prioritization of user-friendly features and accessibility.

On-Site Generation For Power Reliability

For many fleet-owning companies, reliable access to electricity is not guaranteed. Local grids may be insufficient or prone to outages, making EV charging inconsistent. On-site generation addresses these issues by providing fleets with dependable power at the point of need. By separating EV fleet power from the local grid, on-site generation solutions offer a way to scale electrification strategies without being limited by utility infrastructure. For facility executives, this means gaining control over energy reliability and costs while advancing environmental performance.

In addition, the integration of renewable energy sources into EV charging infrastructure can be a game-changer for fleet-owning companies. Solar panels, fuel cells, wind turbines, and renewable fuel generators can be installed at charging stations to generate clean energy on-site to reduce dependence on grid electricity, while offering a sustainable and cost-effective energy solution.

Vehicle-To-Grid Technology And Giving Back

Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) technology allows for bidirectional charging, enabling EVs to not only draw power from the grid but also supply energy back to it. This capability supports grid stability and can be particularly beneficial during peak demand periods. In many states, fleet-owning companies can participate in energy markets, selling excess power generated by their EVs back to the grid, creating an additional revenue stream.

Infrastructure Upgrades Via Performance Solutions

Facilities managers are at the forefront of the transition to EV charging solutions. Their expertise in infrastructure management and maintenance is important to the successful implementation of these technologies. Companies that have successfully adopted EV charging solutions with power generation capabilities have done so through planning by facilities managers.

In some cases, they have worked with the solutions consultants and providers. For example, a leading logistics company integrated solar panels with EV charging stations at its distribution centers, achieving significant energy savings and reducing its carbon footprint. Another example is a pupil transportation agency that implemented V2G technology, allowing its electric school buses to supply power back to the grid during off-peak hours.

The adoption of EV charging solutions sometimes necessitates upgrades to existing facilities. Upgrades may include electrical system enhancements, site modifications, installation of charging stations, and integration of renewable energy sources. Such upgrades can literally pay for themselves via Performance Solutions programs.

Managing Risks While Powering Up Convenience For Fleet Drivers

Enhancing the security and reliability of EV charging infrastructure and power generation systems is paramount for large fleet-owning companies. Implementing robust cybersecurity measures is essential to protect against potential threats and vulnerabilities. Regular maintenance and monitoring of the charging stations and power generation equipment help prevent unexpected failures and downtime.

Additionally, having contingency plans in place for power outages or system malfunctions ensures that operations can continue smoothly without significant disruptions. Companies safeguard their investments and maintain the efficiency and reliability of their fleet operations by proactively addressing these risks.

The integration of EV charging solutions with power generation capabilities offers significant benefits for large fleet-owning companies. From environmental impact and cost savings to operational efficiency and energy resilience, these technologies are transforming the transportation landscape. As the industry continues to evolve, companies will benefit by staying informed and proactive, embracing the future of sustainable fleet management.

Environmental deregulation and disinvestment by the Trump administration has rocked market expectations for EV sales.
Gavin Newsom had previously vowed to restore a state program that provided up to $7,500 to buy clean cars, if Trump terminated federal tax credits.
But car dealers will learn more about how self-sufficient they can be in the coming months.","Californians purchased a record number of zero-emission and plug-in hybrid vehicles in the third quarter of 2025, seizing their final opportunity to claim federal tax incentives before they were eliminated under President Trump’s sweeping budget cuts.

California residents bought more than 124,700 zero-emission vehicles or plug-in hybrids from July 1 to Sept. 30, marking the highest quarterly sales of clean vehicles since the state began tracking those numbers in 2008, according to the California Energy Commission. Electric vehicles and long-range hybrids made up 29% of new car sales statewide, capturing the largest quarterly market share in that 17-year span.

Consumers rushed to dealerships to take advantage of expiring, Biden-era tax credits, which offered up to $7,500 toward buying or leasing new zero-emission or hybrid vehicles. The incentives were vital in making EVs more affordable, given their batteries had primarily been made with expensive rare earth minerals, adding to sticker prices compared to gas-powered vehicles.

Now, for the first time in more than a decade, EVs must compete with their gas-powered cars without government-funded discounts. Although EV model lineups have expanded and prices have become more competitive, they remain $5,000 to 10,000 more expensive than comparable gas models, raising concerns about whether California will maintain momentum on its clean car goals.

“Most of the major brands that our dealers represent have one or more EVs that are available today — and many more in the pipeline,” said Brian Maas, president of the California New Car Dealers Assn., which represents over 1,200 franchised new-car dealers statewide. “So EVs are here to stay. The question is, at what sales level?”

The top-five counties with the highest share of EV sales were all in the Bay Area. Santa Clara, where nearly 47% of vehicle sales were zero-emission or hybrids, led the way. EV sales were also high in Orange and Los Angeles counties, accounting for nearly 36% and 31% of total car sales in the quarter, respectively.

Tesla remained California’s top-selling EV car brand by far.

But its third-quarter sales this year fell by nearly 7% compared to the same period in 2024. The big winners seem to have been Honda and Volkswagen, whose zero-emission sales in California more than doubled year-over-year; Audi wasn’t too far behind, with sales increasing 90%.

Ford also did well, posting record national sales of its electrified Mustang Mach-E and F-150 Lightning — more than 15% of which were sold in California.

Maas said he anticipated “gangbuster” third-quarter sales with the impending demise federal tax credit, which allowed for a markdown of over 10% on most EV models. But many of these were “pulling-forward” sales — purchases by consumers who would have bought later, if not for the expiration of the federal incentives.

Many American car companies, including Ford and General Motors, have reported they are forecasting future declines in EV sales, citing federal policy changes.

Maas is among a chorus of industry experts who tend to agree.

“I think any economist expects there to be a dropoff,” he said. “It’s unclear how far that dropoff is going to be. Dealers have been trying to figure out what’s the natural level of EV sales without credits, and they’re trying to align their inventory to reflect that.”

Jessie Dosanjh, president of California Automotive Retailing Group, operates 20 dealerships in Northern California that sell numerous brands, including Chevrolet, Nissan, Acura, Toyota, Infinity, Ford and Hyundai. In August and September, Dosanjh said, dealership floors were more crowded than usual with customers seeking EVs. He advised his employees to inform customers, if they ever considered buying an EV or hybrid, they had a limited window to get the best price.

“It is absolutely a significant amount of money, especially when you look at the leases,” Dosanjh said. “It’s a couple hundred dollars [a month], on average.”

Even with the record quarterly sales, this year’s overall sales still slightly lag behind 2024.

A flurry of tariff announcements, mixed economic forecasts and political backlash against Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk contributed to slumping EV sales in the first half of the year, according to experts.

Environmental deregulation and disinvestment by the Trump administration has rocked market expectations for EV sales.

In addition to ending the federal tax credits, the Trump administration and federal lawmakers chose to not reauthorize a law that gave EV drivers nationally the privilege of driving alone in carpool lane, a popular perk to avoid congested highways. Trump also signed a law revoking federal waivers that allowed California to require automakers to sell increasing percentage of zero-emission vehicles to dealerships statewide, starting with 35% all new vehicles sales in 2026.

The regulatory changes has left dealers rethinking the makeup of the vehicles on their lots.

“If I were a betting person, I would say that EV demand will drop off several percentage points,” Dosanjh said. “To what extent, I don’t know. I don’t think that those consumers will necessarily not buy a car. I think they’ll see a shift to more hybrid vehicles that provide some of the benefits, as far as range and savings. And I also see consumers considering perhaps cheaper internal combustion engine vehicles.”

Gov. Gavin Newsom had previously vowed to restore a state program that provided up to $7,500 to buy clean cars, if Trump terminated federal tax credits. However, while taking questions from reporters at a Sept. 19 bill signing ceremony, Newsom walked back that commitment.

“We can’t make up for federal vandalism of those tax credits,” Newsom said. “But we can continue to make the unprecedented investments in infrastructure, which we’re doing.”

The governor’s press office did not respond to a request for comment on his change in stance.

California Atty. Gen. Rob Bonta is suing the federal government to reinstate California’s zero-emission vehicle regulations. Meanwhile, state regulators are soliciting ideas for new ways to encourage EV adoption.

The good news is that the state’s innovative policy and environmentally minded residents have already made a lasting mark on the industry, said Adrian Martinez, director of the Right to Zero campaign at Earthjustice, a San Francisco-based environmental nonprofit.

California’s clean air policy is already largely responsible for pushing automakers to incorporate nearly 150 EV models into their lineups, a far cry from the 20 designs on the market in 2012. The state is nearing 2.5 million zero-emission and long-range hybrid vehicles sold since 2008, a testament to the demand for cleaner cars, Martinez said.

“There’s a lot of kind of gloom and doom out there, mainly because we’re seeing efforts at the federal level to put anchors on our electric vehicle industry in this country,” Martinez said. “But there’s been a lot of money and effort and time spent to develop electric vehicle markets. And it’d be crazy for these companies to just bow down to these federal pressures and stop selling these cars which consumers want.”

Maas, the president of the California car dealership association, largely agreed. EVs have become a fixture in California. But car dealers will learn more about how self-sufficient they can be in the coming months.

“I think the long-term future is EVs will continue to sell well, especially in a state like California,” he said, “but perhaps not as well as some had originally hoped.”",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/7993c3a/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5533x2905+0+392/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F0a%2Fde%2Fb79ef3b443dfbb2e352cbb489ca3%2Fgettyimages-2212053678.jpg,N,,2025-10-23 07:58:38.124760

SNIPEF said the announcement rightly celebrates the professional trades who will install, maintain and decommission the low-carbon systems that make clean energy possible in homes and businesses.

However, the Federation cautioned that affordability must remain central to the green transition. The call comes after the Tony Blair Institute for Global Change urged the Government to reconsider its target to decarbonise the electricity system by 2030, warning that the rush to build new renewable capacity could push up energy costs and strain supply chains. The Institute argued that clean power must be affordable power if it is to deliver both economic growth and public support.

Fiona Hodgson, Chief Executive of SNIPEF, said: “We fully support the Government’s ambition to build a cleaner, more secure energy future and we are pleased that this announcement recognises the vital contribution of plumbers and heating engineers.

“Too often, the focus is on infrastructure and large projects, when in fact it is our skilled tradespeople who bring these technologies to life in people’s homes and communities.

“Our recent letter to the Secretary of State for Energy Security and Net Zero, Rt Hon Ed Miliband MP, raised the same concern now being discussed by the Tony Blair Institute. Electricity prices remain disproportionately high compared with gas, which discourages households from switching to low-carbon heating. The green transition is essential, but it must not add to cost-of-living pressures or undermine consumer confidence.”

SNIPEF said it stands ready to work with the Department for Energy Security and Net Zero to create a clear pathway that addresses price imbalances, supports skills and training, and ensures that the transition to clean energy remains both affordable and achievable for households across the UK.

“This is a moment to bring policy ambition and practical delivery together,” Hodgson added. “Our members are the professionals who will make clean heating work on the ground.

“You just keep adding satellites, and the spot keeps getting brighter.” Mr. Nowack downplayed the concerns of conservationists and astronomers.
“So you can operate a very large constellation of these satellites without bothering people, without blinding folks,” Mr. Nowack said.
Mr. Nowack said his satellites would be placed into low earth orbit on rockets launched by Elon Musk’s SpaceX, where Mr. Nowack previously worked.
Mr. Nowack said that would reduce the need to burn more fossil fuels to produce electricity.","Thousands of mirrors orbiting the Earth could soon light up the night sky if a California startup wins U.S. permission to launch an experimental satellite that would beam sunlight onto solar farms at night.

Reflect Orbital filed an application this year with the Federal Communications Commission seeking approval to launch a demonstration satellite next year that would test the concept of using mirrors to reflect the sun onto the Earth after dark.

The company plans to eventually build a “constellation” of thousands of space mirrors that would deliver sunlight on demand to solar farms and anywhere else that wants to buy some rays.

Reflect Orbital CEO Ben Nowack said the company has received 260,000 applications from entities worldwide interested in using its technology. He said the solar rays could enable nighttime construction projects, help grow food, illuminate dark cities and brighten places such as Scandinavia that stay mostly dark during the winter.

Customers could order a ray of sunshine on an app.

“We are putting a joystick on the sun,” he told the World Governments Summit earlier this year. “If it’s dark out, you can now get sunlight.”

The company’s plan has raised concerns among conservation groups and astronomers.

Lighting up the night sky could disrupt bird migration and alter the behavior of nocturnal wildlife, including bats, turtles, frogs and moths, scientists have warned.

Astronomers fear increased nighttime brightness would degrade observations, obscure large portions of the sky and make it impossible to detect faint celestial objects.

The satellite-mounted mirrors would reflect a spot of sunlight 3 miles in diameter, nearly 8 square miles or more than 5 acres.

The beam of light would shine at four to five times the brightness of the moon.

“Needless to say, this is of extreme concern,” Michael DiMario, astroimaging chair for the Amateur Astronomers Association of Princeton University, wrote in the association’s newsletter. “We need to fight this as well as gather others in this fight.”

Environmental and scientific concerns about the technology are competing with efforts by green energy advocates who want to ramp up renewable energy production and eliminate fossil fuels.

Solar power in the U.S. energy grid grew by more than 25% last year but produced only 7% of the nation’s electrical generation, said the Energy Information Administration. Fossil fuels comprised 58%, and nuclear power plants generated 18%.

Solar energy’s main handicaps are darkness and cloud cover, which render it an intermittent source of energy that requires backup generation from natural gas, coal and nuclear.

Mr. Nowack said a constellation of mirrors circling in low earth orbit would increase solar output significantly by beaming sunlight to 8-square-mile circles where existing solar farms are idling in the dark.

“You want to get enough energy to match full-noon power,” he said. “You just keep adding satellites, and the spot keeps getting brighter.”

Mr. Nowack downplayed the concerns of conservationists and astronomers. He said the beam of reflected sunlight would illuminate only the 8-square-mile spot and nothing beyond it. The mirrors would be tilted away from the sun to avoid illuminating places that don’t need sunlight at night, he said.

“So you can operate a very large constellation of these satellites without bothering people, without blinding folks,” Mr. Nowack said. “We can light up one spot and not another spot.”

The technology may sound like science fiction, but it is backed by Sequoia Capital and Starship Ventures, which have invested $20 million into the company.

Mr. Nowack said his satellites would be placed into low earth orbit on rockets launched by Elon Musk’s SpaceX, where Mr. Nowack previously worked.

The company has already made inroads into the U.S. government.

In May, Reflect Orbital won a $1.25 million Air Force contract to “create and provide innovative capabilities” to strengthen the national defense.

Reflect Orbital officials did not respond to an inquiry from The Washington Times about the Air Force project.

If the company wins FCC approval to launch its first satellite-mounted mirror, it plans to deploy the equipment in April and use it to test redirected sunlight beams on ground targets.

The company intends to expand to 4,000 satellite-mounted mirrors by 2030.

Fiona Hodgson, chief executive of SNIPEF, said: “We fully support the government’s ambition to build a cleaner, more secure energy future and we are pleased that this announcement recognises the vital contribution of plumbers and heating engineers.

“Too often, the focus is on infrastructure and large projects, when in fact it is our skilled tradespeople who bring these technologies to life in people’s homes and communities.

“Our recent letter to the Secretary of State for Energy Security and Net Zero, Rt Hon Ed Miliband MP, raised the same concern now being discussed by the Tony Blair Institute. Electricity prices remain disproportionately high compared with gas, which discourages households from switching to low-carbon heating. The green transition is essential, but it must not add to cost-of-living pressures or undermine consumer confidence.”

SNIPEF said it stands ready to work with the Department for Energy Security and Net Zero to create a clear pathway that addresses price imbalances, supports skills and training, and ensures that the transition to clean energy remains both affordable and achievable for households across the UK.

“This is a moment to bring policy ambition and practical delivery together,” Hodgson added. “Our members are the professionals who will make clean heating work on the ground. With the right support and a fair approach to costs, the UK can deliver both a green transition and a just one.”",https://www.scottishconstructionnow.com/storage/ae88402f2c0c02ed6e2a3985419ad8c59b628aef.jpg,N,,2025-10-23 10:26:01.288747

AES plans to file the plan on Oct. 31 to get approval from the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission.

AES Indiana is planning what kind of energy sources it will add over roughly the next 15 years, and the Indianapolis utility company has a backup plan in case large-load data centers move into its coverage area.

Without data center development, AES would lean on battery storage and gas reciprocating engines to fuel energy demand until 2040. But if data centers build in the utility's densely-populated swath of Central Indiana, AES would add gas plants to the plan — a move environmentalists say backtracks on the utility's previous strides toward using clean energy.

Every three years, Indiana utilities are required to submit a resource plan to address from where they will source energy over the next several years and how much energy they will add to capacity. AES plans to file the company's Integrated Resource Plan to the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission on Oct. 31, company spokesperson Mallory Duncan said.

With more than 520,000 customers, AES mostly serves energy users in Marion County, as well some residential and business customers in two narrow slivers of land, one extending from Indianapolis northwest into Boone County and another winding southwest through Morgan County, according to an Indiana Energy Association service map.

AES ran 16 models to map out energy needs, costs and possible constraints in Central Indiana, including scenarios ranging from no data centers to a high data center load. AES then ran seven additional models, including three designed to analyze the so-far-unknown effects data centers could have on energy demands in the area.

Following nearly a year of stakeholder meetings and feedback, AES landed on two preferred energy blueprints: one if no data centers enter their territory and another to fall back on if a large data center gets built and signs a contract with AES.

What AES preferred plans look like

AES's initial Integrated Resourced Plan assumes there will be no data centers.

Under the plan, AES would add 100 MW in battery storage capacity and 108 MW from gas reciprocating engines by 2040, pending any future plans that would necessitate different energy generation decisions.

If data centers enter the picture, the plan looks wildly different. AES would still look to add 108 MW in gas engines, but the company would then install 860 MW of battery storage power to power the campuses, more than eight times the capacity without data centers. This assumes the utility sees a demand of about 1,500 MW to supply data centers.

AES would also look to add two gas plants, each supplying at least 700 MW of power.

The possibility of more gas plants concerns environmental advocates.

Megan Anderson, senior campaign representative at the Sierra Club, criticized AES' reliance on natural gas plants to power data centers instead of renewable options like wind or solar. Gas plants produce greenhouse gas emissions that are known to contribute to climate change.

""Instead of prioritizing clean energy sources that will cut costs for customers, these plans grossly fail to address climate and the urgency for us to meet our energy needs in a reliable, affordable way,"" Anderson's statement said in part. ""We don’t want our utility building a massive gas plant to power Big Tech’s data centers, and we certainly don’t want to pay for it.""

AES officials said they do not want plans to rest on the possibility of data centers. If the utility plans for large customers that do not materialize, energy rates would be more expensive than if AES Indiana simply did nothing to plan for data centers, said Patrick McGuire, senior director of commercial and resource planning, in an Oct. 22 session with stakeholders.

Power resources have long been a sticking point for data center opponents and consumer advocates who argue the massive structures will sap energy and lead to higher electric bills for residential consumers. Currently, no data center operators have signed an agreement with AES for power, and any future data center would need to go through a future regulatory process, several AES executives stressed during the multi-hour session.

However, AES announced a request for proposals in May seeking contractors to build two gas plants in its service area.

Data center builders eyeing Central Indiana

Even though no data centers have signed binding contracts to request power in or near Indianapolis, some see it as only a matter of time. State leaders have welcomed data center operators with open arms. Would-be data center developers in Indiana find abundant land, cheaper energy and hefty tax incentives to help jumpstart projects.

An IndyStar investigation published in June found that anticipated energy needs for just nine data centers accounted for more than half of Indiana utilities’ electricity capacity in 2023, based on public information, including data compiled by the U.S. Energy Information Administration and Citizen's Action Coalition.

At least one major name is exploring data center sites in the AES coverage area.

On Oct. 21, the day before AES' final stakeholders meeting for its resource plan, Google revealed itself to be the tech titan behind a sprawling data center development that recently received rezoning approval in Morgan County. AES would service the 390-acre Morgan County project near the small town of Monrovia.

As AES charts its future, reports indicate the utility could soon undergo a sale to Blackrock, a private equity company. AES said it does not comment on market rumors.","https://www.indystar.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/05/22/PIND/83781473007-jim-irsay-05212025-gh-002.jpg?crop=3989,2245,x0,y239&width=3200&height=1801&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-10-23 05:58:24.496956

“The Cummins X15N is a game-changer,” said Chad Lindholm, Senior Vice President at Clean Energy. “Providing equivalent power and torque as its diesel equivalent, yet allowing fleets to claim significant carbon and NOx emission reductions with a fuel that is priced at a big discount to diesel.”

After its launch, the demo truck will tour major freight corridors across the U.S., including California, Texas, Arizona, Illinois, Ohio, Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Florida.
