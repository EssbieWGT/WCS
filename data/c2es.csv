As we all know, Donald Trump is not a fan of electric vehicles. In fact, overall, the Fossil Fuel Party does not want people leaving the gas pump behind and driving electric cars. So, it was also no surprise to those who pay attention to these things that Donald Trump and the Fossil Fuel Party have come into power and decided to remove the EV tax credit, remove the used EV tax credit, and attack the federal government’s and California’s requirements that automaker cut CO2 pollution and fossil fuel use over time.

Of course, these changes haven’t yet been implemented, because it takes time to change this kind of thing. However, the changes are coming soon, and automakers are indicating that they are already changing their plans and expectations accordingly.

Tesla — Rough Quarters Coming

CNBC has rounded up a handful of statements from automakers related to these matters. Starting with the big dog, Tesla, Elon Musk said on the July 23 conference call for shareholders that due to the loss of US incentives, Tesla was in a “weird transition period.” But weird isn’t bad, right? Especially when you helped get the guy in the White House elected. “Does that mean like we could have a few rough quarters? Yeah, we probably could have a few rough quarters,” Musk added. Oh, okay, so that sounds bad. And with Musk’s normally extreme optimism, projecting a few rough quarters is really not a good sign. (Though, apparently, all is fine thanks to robots and AI, as Tesla stock is up 8.14% in the past month.)

Tesla is planning to bring a more affordable model to market, but CFO Vaibhav Taneja added that the ramp-up of that model is now expected to be slower due to the tax credits going away. He also noted that Tesla would be getting less revenue from selling regulatory credits. That’s thanks to the Trump administration deciding that automakers don’t need to reduce their pollution.

Rivian — Robbed

Tesla rose up in good part from selling regulatory credits to traditional automakers. Rivian has been counting on that approach a bit as well, but it’s getting its knees whacked in that regard. “Rivian does not expect to earn any revenue from regulatory tax credits for the rest of 2025, CFO Claire McDonough told analysts during its Tuesday call. As a result, the EV maker brought its outlook for regulatory credit sales down to $160 million for the rest of 2025, from its prior outlook of $300 million.” Furthermore, that means it will not achieve positive cash flow temporarily (let’s hope temporarily).

Ford — Changing Plans

Ford has had to change model plans, money dedicated to EVs, and consumer expectations as a result of the Trump policy changes. “On the company’s July 30 call with analysts, Farley said Ford has had to change its EV spending and capital allocation “pretty massively” as a result of softer U.S. regulations, including by moving out launches and canceling some products,” CNBC writes.

“CFO Sherry House added that as a result of tax credits going away, Ford could possibly pull back some of its EV production from the U.S. into other areas, such as leaning more heavily on Europe or moving into internal combustion engine products.”

Sounds good, right? Only if you’re an oil company or oil-soaked investor (or have been effectively brainwashed by the oil lobby).

GM — EV Slowdown

Unsurprisingly, another big American legacy automaker expects EV uptake to slow down as a result of the policy changes — after a short-term increase in demand from people rushing to buy EVs before the tax credits go away.

“CFO Paul Jacobson said on the company’s July 22 earnings call that General Motors is anticipating headwinds to EV profitability as a result of the government removing incentives.”

The project, expected to roll out in 2027, aims to make electric vehicles more affordable while strengthening US-based manufacturing.

This comes alongside $3.00 billion already allocated for a battery park in Michigan, bringing the total planned investment to $5.00 billion.

The combined initiatives will create or secure nearly 4,000 jobs, according to the company, and mark a key step in Ford’s strategy to compete in a rapidly changing EV market.

$5 billion investment spans Kentucky and Michigan

The Louisville investment will focus on producing the upcoming electric pickup, while the Michigan battery park will manufacture lithium iron phosphate (LFP) batteries for Ford’s new EV range.

These batteries will be assembled in the US rather than imported from China. Ford confirmed that the Louisville facility will “secure” around 2,200 jobs, though retooling for EV production will mean employing about 600 fewer workers than at present.

As of April 2024, the plant had over 3,000 employees. The investment will also cover upgrades to assembly lines, enhanced automation systems, and training programmes to equip workers with skills required for electric vehicle production.

Affordable EV positioned for competitive market

The electric pickup’s $30,000 starting price is roughly equivalent to the cost of the original Model T when adjusted for inflation.

Ford executives had previewed the project as its next “Model T moment” during the company’s recent earnings call.

The company aims to address rising competition from Chinese manufacturers like BYD, as well as global startups and technology firms entering the automotive sector.

The production strategy is designed to allow flexibility in scaling output as demand for affordable EVs increases, a critical factor as more consumers shift away from petrol-powered vehicles.

EV launch aligns with shifting US policy

Ford’s announcement comes as EV manufacturers face policy changes under President Donald Trump’s administration, including the planned end of EV tax credits after 30 September.

The company says the move reflects its need to adapt to both regulatory shifts and evolving global market conditions.

Analysts note that the pricing and production approach could help Ford maintain competitiveness in the absence of federal incentives, particularly in cost-sensitive market segments.

Job growth beyond Louisville

While the Louisville project will result in a smaller on-site workforce after retooling, Ford says it is expanding employment in other areas.

Since the recession, the company has reportedly added 13,000 jobs in the US.

CEO Jim Farley reiterated that Ford intends to continue growing its workforce as part of its broader strategy for EV and technology adoption.

New roles are expected to be created in battery manufacturing, EV engineering, and software development, with a focus on long-term domestic supply chain resilience.",https://s.tradingview.com/static/images/illustrations/news-story.jpg,N,,2025-08-12 00:58:20.512131

If you listen closely in Louisville, you can almost hear the echo of a Model T-era plant whistle, only now it’s digital, modular, and plugged into the future. Ford is putting roughly $5 billion into a new Universal EV Platform and a reinvented Universal EV Production System to bring a family of affordable electric vehicles to market. The first: a midsize, four-door electric pickup, assembled at Louisville Assembly Plant with a targeted starting price of about $30,000 and deliveries planned for 2027.

Why does this car matter right now?

Because affordability still decides the EV game. Ford’s Universal EV Platform trims complexity, about 20% fewer parts and a shorter, lighter wiring harness, while using prismatic lithium iron phosphate (LFP) batteries that are cobalt- and nickel-free. That cocktail should lower costs and improve durability. The structural battery pack forms the floor, dropping the center of gravity for a quieter ride and better handling, and unlocking more interior space.

The production side matters just as much. A century after Ford invented the moving line, the company is replacing the “one long conveyor” with an “assembly tree”: front, rear, and structural battery sub-assemblies built in parallel, then married at the end. Fewer stations, fewer fasteners, and a neater kit of parts should speed things up and improve ergonomics for line workers.

How does it compare to rivals?

Ford isn’t naming direct rivals yet, but the size and mission land between compact city EVs and full-size electric pickups. Think practical daily driver first, with useful truck capability. Ford says the truck will offer more passenger space than the latest Toyota RAV4, plus a frunk and a proper bed for locked, out-of-sight gear, handy if your weekend kit includes boards, bikes, or dog crates.

Performance will lean “quick enough to be fun”, Ford targets 0–60 mph comparable to Mustang EcoBoost. Pair that with over-the-air updates and a zonal electrical architecture, and the pitch is a mainstream EV that keeps getting better. Pricing, “about $30,000” to start, is the headline advantage if Ford hits it.

Who is this for, and who should skip it?

Buyers who should look closely: families and commuters who want an EV that acts like a daily driver first and a weekend truck second; small-business owners who value low running costs; and first-time EV shoppers wary of six-figure sticker shock. The structural LFP pack promises durability and value, and the bed-plus-frunk combo solves the “where do I put everything?” problem.

Buyers who might wait heavy haulers and long-distance towers may prefer larger, high-capacity trucks; speed purists may want a dedicated performance model. Trims, range, battery sizes, and charge times are still to come, so anyone with a specific spec sheet in mind will want to hold for the full reveal and EPA figures.

What’s the long-term significance?

This is as much a factory story as a vehicle story. Ford plans about $2 billion to transform the Louisville Assembly Plant and another $3 billion at BlueOval Battery Park in Michigan, where those prismatic LFP cells will be built. That’s nearly 4,000 direct jobs created or secured across the two projects and a stronger U.S. supply chain for critical components.

Manufacturing-wise, the “assembly tree” is designed to cut stations and shave build time by double digits, with some of that efficiency reinvested into in-house work and quality. If it scales, other models can ride the same platform, cars, trucks, and crossovers, meaning the pickup is the opening chapter, not the whole book.

Trims, pricing, and specs (what we know now)

Model: Midsize four-door electric pickup (name TBA)

Assembly: Louisville Assembly Plant (U.S. and export markets)

Launch timing: 2027

Targeted starting price: About $30,000

Battery: Prismatic LFP, structural pack (U.S.-assembled cells planned at Blue Oval Battery Park Michigan)

Performance target: 0–60 mph comparable to Mustang EcoBoost

Interior/cargo: More passenger space than 2025 Toyota RAV4, plus frunk and bed

Trims, ranges, charging, and tow ratings: To be announced

Safety ratings and government data

NHTSA and IIHS ratings will post closer to launch. As always, shoppers can review crash-test results and award criteria directly from the source once the vehicle is tested: NHTSA’s 5-Star Safety Ratings and IIHS crashworthiness and crash-avoidance protocols.

Bottom line: If Ford lands the price, the packaging, and the pace on its new line, this could be the moment the EV conversation shifts from “someday” to “sign me up.” It’s a big bet on American workers, cleaner chemistry, and a simpler way to build cars people can actually afford.",https://www.wane.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/21/2025/08/Blue-Oval-City_04.jpg?w=1280,N,,2025-08-11 23:58:52.246329

The attorney representing Horizon 30 asked for the case to be dismissed, stating the mine ceased operations Saturday.
He presented the judge with a sworn affidavit from Horizon 30 saying they would cease operations.
The judge granted the preliminary injunction, ordering Horizon 30 to stop mining at the site immediately.","POPLAR, N.C. — A mining operation in Mitchell County is grinding to a halt, after a judge ordered a preliminary injunction in Superior Court in Boone on Monday morning.

According to state officials, the Carter Mine site off N.C. 197 in Poplar was being mined by Horizon 30 LLC since January without a valid permit.

Poplar residents, like Cindy Bedell, were elated when they heard the news.

“It is such a relief, such a relief,” Bedell said. “Because we, you know, they [Horizon 30] were applying for three or more years.”

Leo Sharp of Poplar, who was in the courtroom Monday, says he took drone footage of the mining operation Aug. 1 showing how active the mine site was. He hoped the judge would tell them to cease operations on Monday.

Spectrum News 1 has not been able to independently verify this video.

Since January, the North Carolina Department of Environmental Quality says Horizon 30 has been operating an unpermitted mine in the small community.

It's a situation that Bedell says has been unbearable.

“It's been 30 dump trucks a day for 10 months,” she said. “Dust flying through the air.”

It’s an area that was hit hard by Hurricane Helene. Residents say the floodwaters rose more than 20 feet from the Nolichucky River, destroying the road and the railroad in parts along N.C. 197.

While residents knew CSX was working in the area, they say the mining operation seems to have operated under the radar with all the other construction for a while.

“When we found out that they were doing this illegally, it was just unfathomable,” Bedell said.

During the court hearing, an attorney for the state told the judge representatives from DEQ went to inspect the mine and told the operators they needed to file for a permit.

State records show a permit was submitted, but investigators say it was never completed.

The state’s attorney argued DEQ informed Horizon 30 multiple times they needed to stop mining until the permit was approved. But the company reportedly kept mining anyway.

The attorney representing Horizon 30 asked for the case to be dismissed, stating the mine ceased operations Saturday. He presented the judge with a sworn affidavit from Horizon 30 saying they would cease operations.

However, the state’s attorney still asked for an injunction to be filed, arguing that Horizon 30 could not be trusted due to a pattern of not following proper protocols.

The judge granted the preliminary injunction, ordering Horizon 30 to stop mining at the site immediately. The company also must submit a reclamation plan in 30 days.

Residents like Alan Wilson say the injunction means a lot to the Poplar community.

“It's such a relief to know that they're going to be regulating this thing and not going to let them get off scot-free,” Wilson said.

It's a small victory as their community continues to heal following Helene.

“I think this is beginning to help us even further,"" Wilson said. ""It's not just us. It's all of western North Carolina. We're struggling, you know, from the storm, and we need some help. But this is a step in the right direction.”

The judge has set another court date for Sept. 23 in Bakersville to make sure that Horizon 30 has ceased operations and that it has submitted a plan for reclamation of the area.",https://s7d2.scene7.com/is/image/TWCNews/poplar_mine_trucks_nc,N,,2025-08-11 23:01:37.335347

WASHINGTON, DC, August 8, 2025 — The Department of Energy and Environment (DOEE) is excited to announce the opening of a new electric vehicle (EV) charging station in Ward 7. The new station has fast charging capacity and is accessible to the public 24/7. This project was funded by a grant that DOEE received from the U.S. Department of Transportation Federal Highway Administration’s Electric Vehicle Charger Reliability and Accessibility Accelerator Program.

The project, in partnership with Transco Inc., replaced the out-of-service charging station at 3355a Benning Rd NE, and adds four DC fast charging ports, as well as triples the speed of vehicle charging compared to the previous output. The charging station is easily accessed along the heavily travelled Benning Road and is conveniently located for drivers on I-295. It is also adjacent to amenities including a convenience store, a riverfront park, trails, and a Capital Bikeshare station.

By adding new EV charging capacity, the project helps support a goal of the District’s Transportation Electrification Roadmap for 25% of DC-registered vehicles to be EVs by 2030.

""This project is important in helping the District meet its Transportation Electrification Roadmap goals especially those that call for more equitable and accessible charging options for District residents,” said DOEE Director Richard Jackson. “We are proud to support a project that moves us one step closer to a cleaner, healthier, more sustainable District of Columbia.”

To complete this project, DOEE worked with Pepco to utilize funds approved by the Public Service Commission of the District of Columbia to install much of the EV make-ready infrastructure.

The EV Charger Reliability and Accessibility Accelerator Program awarded approximately $148.8 million in grant funding to 24 applicants to repair or replace broken or non-operational electric vehicle charging ports to improve the reliability of existing charging infrastructure. The 24 awards are located in 19 States and the District of Columbia, and were awarded to 14 State Departments of Transportation and 10 local entities.",,N,,2025-08-11 23:02:57.500356

As we celebrate this important anniversary, I remain committed to championing renewable fuels every single day and pushing for policies like nationwide, year-round E15,” said Rep. Budzinski.

“Over the past two decades, the Renewable Fuels Standard has played a critical role in strengthening our nation’s economy, solidifying our energy independence and supporting our rural communities,” said Rep. Craig. “The RFS has enabled Minnesota’s farmers and producers to contribute to the all-of-the-above energy policy America needs, while helping to lower prices for consumers at the pump. It’s common-sense programs like this one that help our state, and our country stay ahead.”

“A strong Renewable Fuel Standard is vital to a vibrant agricultural economy and the success of Iowa biofuels. For twenty years, this American energy initiative has supported Iowa farmers, biofuels producers, and our rural communities by ensuring that Iowa ethanol, biodiesel, and other advanced biofuels are blended into our nation’s fuel supply. The RFS also helps reduce our dependence on foreign oil, lowers gas prices for families, and incentivizes rural energy production. Representing hardworking farmers and biofuels producers, I will always advocate for a strong Renewable Fuel Standard that invests in rural Iowa, supports the production of homegrown Iowa biofuels, and stands with our farmers and agricultural communities,” said Rep. Feenstra.

“Twenty years ago, the Renewable Fuel Standard ignited economic growth across our rural communities, as biofuel plants brought jobs and support for hardworking farmers. Today, American biofuels deliver cleaner, more affordable fuel to millions worldwide. Simply put: biofuels have proven their stay as a new cornerstone of innovation for our nation’s rural economies,” said Rep. Flood.

“For 20 years, the Renewable Fuel Standard has strengthened America’s energy security, lowered costs at the pump, and delivered real markets for Iowa’s farmers,” said Rep. Nunn. “It’s proof that homegrown energy can power our economy and support rural communities at the same time.”

“The RFS supports a growing domestic energy sector which provides more affordable fuel options and complementary markets for agricultural commodities. American biofuels and agriculture producers are leaders in innovation, and I am proud of the progress they have made over the past 20 years to maximize the value of every kernel of corn while producing more with less. As a co-chair of the Biofuels Caucus, I join in celebrating this anniversary of the RFS as we work to continue empowering American producers, retailers, and consumers through sound federal policy,” said Rep. Smith

Support from Industry

“The 20th anniversary of the Renewable Fuels Standard is more than just a milestone for policy—it’s personal for farmers like me. The increased demand for ethanol created by the RFS helped open a door for me to come back to our family farm, raise my kids here, and build a future rooted in rural Ohio. It’s driven investment in our community, strengthened markets for our corn, and allowed my family and many others to keep doing what we love. The RFS hasn’t just fueled our cars, it’s fueled opportunity, growth, and resilience across the country.” — Tyler Drewes, President of the Ohio Corn & Wheat Growers Association

“The Renewable Fuel Standard’s establishment 20 years ago helped soybean oil go from a byproduct to a main driver of demand for America’s farmers in the form of biodiesel, renewable diesel, and sustainable aviation fuel. Soy-based biofuels support the rural economy by providing over 107,000 jobs nationwide and contributing $42.4 billion to the U.S. economy. This kind of economic impact would not be possible without the RFS. As part of the RFS, the U.S. EPA recently proposed new renewable volume obligations that represent another significant step forward in protecting American energy independence.” — Rusty Goebel, Ohio soybean farmer and Ohio Soybean Association President

“As the Renewable Fuel Standard marks its 20th anniversary, we reflect on a landmark program that has strengthened America’s energy security while delivering significant benefits to American agriculture. Over the past two decades, the RFS has spurred demand for domestically grown oilseeds, encouraged investment in U.S. processing facilities, and supported the growth of advanced biofuels. By ensuring more of our soybeans are crushed here, the program adds value domestically and creates new opportunities for U.S. farmers and rural communities. NOPA remains committed to working with policymakers to ensure the RFS continues to advance American agriculture and our nation’s energy future.” — Devin Mogler, President and CEO, National Oilseed Processors Association

“For 20 years, the Renewable Fuels Standard has strengthened American farmers, manufacturing, and energy security. Today, our domestic biofuel industry supports hundreds of thousands of good jobs across the American Heartland. Our farmers know that they have access to a key market and help fuel our cars and trucks. ADM appreciates the work of Congressman Miller, Senator Ricketts and all the cosponsors for recognizing the 20th Anniversary of this important policy. We remain committed to the continued growth and success of our domestic biofuel industry.” — Nick Smith, President, North America Energy and Biofuels, ADM

“The RFS has created new grain markets and supported rural communities, all while lowering costs at the pump. As the bioethanol industry increased from less than one to over ten percent of the nation’s fuel supply, farm income nearly tripled, and land values more than doubled. Looking ahead, expanding biofuels in the U.S. will strengthen the nation’s energy security and deliver lasting benefits to America’s farmers and rural communities.” — Joshua Shields, POET Senior Vice President of Corporate Affairs

“Over the past two decades, the Renewable Fuel Standard has delivered tremendous benefits for our nation-reducing dependence on foreign oil, lowering fuel costs for consumers, creating hundreds of thousands of jobs across rural America, and strengthening the agricultural economy. It has spurred market competition and expanded choices at the pump for drivers nationwide. We’re thrilled to see Congress commemorating this milestone with a strong bipartisan resolution, and we applaud Senator Pete Ricketts, Representative Max Miller, and the many lawmakers who joined in honoring one of the most successful and forward-looking energy policies in U.S. history.” — Geoff Cooper, Renewable Fuels Association President and CEO

The Environmental Protection Agency said Friday it will no longer recognize its federal labor unions and that all collective bargaining agreements are terminated, effective immediately.

EPA’s announcement makes it the second known agency in a week to cancel collective bargaining for agency employees, following a similar announcement at the Department of Veterans Affairs two days earlier.

The affected unions are the American Federation of Government Employees, the National Association of Government Employees, the Engineers and Scientists of California and the National Association of Independent Labor. Union leaders from those labor organizations received an email from EPA’s Office of Mission Support Friday afternoon.

“You are receiving this email because you are a union point of contact or have reported the use of official time in the recent past,” the email, obtained by Federal News Network, reads. “EPA’s contracts with AFGE, NAGE R4, NAGE Narraganset, ESC and NAIL are hereby terminated.”

In the email, EPA told the union leaders that they are expected to “perform 100% agency business while on agency duty time,” and that work on behalf of the union would only be allowed outside scheduled work hours. The agency said it would not be approving any official time past Aug. 9, and that it would be reclaiming any office space that union members were using.

“More details on the reacquisition of space will come from local management officials,” EPA wrote.

EPA also said effective immediately, grievance procedures under collective bargaining agreements are no longer in effect.

VA says it’s ended most collective bargaining agreements

AFGE Local 238, which represents more than 8,000 EPA employees, blasted the agency’s decision to cancel the contracts, calling it unlawful.

“The Trump administration and EPA’s unlawful and authoritarian move to unilaterally strip EPA workers of their collective bargaining agreement and workplace rights is nothing short of an assault on our democracy, the rule of law, and the lives of working people in America,” AFGE Council 238 President Justin Chen said in a statement Friday evening. “AFGE Council 238 is united in our fight to defend our rights, our agency’s mission, and to protect the future of our country and planet. We will see the administration in court.”

An EPA spokesperson said in a statement to Federal News Network that the agency “is working to diligently implement President [Donald] Trump’s executive orders with respect to AFGE, including ‘Exclusions from Federal Labor-Management Relations Programs,’ in compliance with the law.”

Trump issued an executive order in March citing “national security” as justification for suspending collective bargaining agreements at more than 40 federal agencies and offices. Those included the EPA, the Food and Drug Administration and the Federal Emergency Management Agency, among others with more obvious ties to national security.

The VA on Wednesday similarly said it was terminating the vast majority of its contracts with federal unions, effectively ending collective bargaining for more than 370,000 federal employees. Roughly 4,000 VA employees in police, firefighter and security positions are the only agency personnel who will maintain collective bargaining rights.

The union contract terminations come after the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals last week granted the Trump administration’s request to stay a lower court’s preliminary injunction. In effect, the appeals court decision allowed agencies to move forward with implementing Trump’s March executive order to cancel union contracts at a majority of federal agencies, using the narrow legal provision that lets the president suspend collective bargaining for national security reasons.

Federal unions quickly sued the Trump administration over the anti-union executive order. They maintain that Trump’s order was a form of retaliation for the labor organizations’ First Amendment protected speech. That claim was based, in part, on a White House fact sheet that said Trump signed the order because unions were “hostile” toward his policies.

The appeals court, however, determined that based on the language of the executive order itself, the president likely would have terminated the union contracts anyway, even if the federal unions’ constitutionally protected speech wasn’t an issue.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/AdobeStock_299759371_Editorial_Use_Only-2048x1365.jpeg,N,,2025-08-11 23:01:28.992516

Transmission planners are forecasting an 8.2% increase in U.S. electricity demand over the next five years, after 20 years of annual demand growth remaining below 1%.
Due to the instability that solar and wind generators can cause to the grid, FERC approved new standards to increase grid reliability.
Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory: Data center electricity usage was 176 TWh in 2023 (4.4% of total U.S. electricity).
Rising electricity demand from data centers and electrification strained PJM’s recent capacity auction, signaling a reliability crisis, per outgoing FERC Chairman Mark Christie.","According to Mark Christie, outgoing Chairman of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), the grid reliability crisis is here as the recent capacity auction of the PJM Interconnection, the nation’s largest grid operator, failed to meet the minimum reserve margin required to ensure reliable service for the first time ever. Christie emphasized the need to bring the new generation online quickly, urging policymakers and industry to accelerate permitting processes and market reforms that incentivize capacity additions.

Electricity demand has soared as artificial intelligence (AI) and data centers, along with increased electrification, have grown. Transmission planners are forecasting an 8.2% increase in U.S. electricity demand over the next five years, after 20 years of annual demand growth remaining below 1%. Electricity output has grown by 4% during the first 6 months of this year, with strong growth from solar and wind power.

Utility-supplied electric production from January to the end of June was 2,188 terawatt-hours (TWh), the highest ever for this period. Solar output grew by 32% over the past year, and wind production reached a record, growing by 6% for the first 4 months of this year over the same period last year. From January to June, fossil fuels produced 55% of the nation’s electricity, down from 56%, with nuclear power and renewable energy, including hydropower, producing the rest. Due to higher natural gas prices, gas generators produced 4% less electricity than for the same period last year, and coal generators produced 17% more. Coal generated 16% of the nation’s electricity, which is the highest level for the first half of this year since 2022.

Due to the instability that solar and wind generators can cause to the grid, FERC approved new standards to increase grid reliability. The standards, which were developed by the North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC), specifically target “inverter-based resources” (IBRs) — technologies such as solar and wind that rely on power electronics rather than traditional spinning technology. Solar and wind generators are not able to respond to voltage and frequency disturbances on the grid, as was experienced by the blackout in Spain and Portugal in May. The new FERC rules require IBRs to remain connected to the grid during these disturbances to prevent sudden losses of power that could destabilize the electric system.

More Utility Infrastructure Means Higher Electricity Prices

U.S. power companies are charging more to cover investment in upgrading the grid and supporting increased demand from data centers, electric vehicles, and other electrification pushed by the Biden administration. The average electricity rate in June of 2025 was 6.7% higher than the rate in the same month in 2024, resulting in residential electricity prices rising more than twice as fast as the overall consumer price inflation in the United States during that time period. Edison Electric Institute expects utilities to need to invest around $203 billion each year in 2025 and 2026, more than any year since 2000.

Utilities want tech companies to pay more to connect their new data centers to the power grid, as the cost of new power infrastructure needed to serve data-center demand could further raise rates for other customers. Utilities particularly want assurances from tech companies that they will pay for surplus costs if forecasted AI demand results in more power lines and plants than U.S. data centers ultimately need.

Dominion Energy, operating in Virginia, which has the most data centers in the world, proposed a series of measures that would require data-center developers to commit to longer-term electricity contracts and agree to pay for certain amounts of power — even if they use less. Last year, Dominion received requests from data-center developers that would require 40 gigawatts of electricity. In the early days of data-center development in Virginia, data centers required between 10 megawatts and 20 megawatts of electricity, which has now grown to at least 300 megawatts. Dominion estimated that it will have to invest more than $40 billion in the state over the next five years.

Tech companies indicate that Dominion has gone too far in shifting risk onto them. These companies say they want to pay their fair share of power costs, but do not want to pay substantially more because they see the investments as benefiting other customers.

Utilities in other states, Kansas, Missouri, and Texas, are debating who should pay for the new infrastructure. Ohio recently became one of the first states to require companies to pay more of the costs associated with connecting data centers to the grid after receiving requests for more than 50 times the amount of power used by its existing data-center customers.

Analysis

The demand for electricity in the U.S. due to AI, particularly from data centers, is projected to grow significantly by 2030.

McKinsey & Company: McKinsey estimates global demand could grow 19–22% annually from 2023 to 2030, reaching 171–219 gigawatts (GW), or up to 298 GW in a high-growth scenario. This compares to 60 GW today, potentially requiring double the capacity built since 2000 in a fraction of the time to avoid shortages.

Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory: Data center electricity usage was 176 TWh in 2023 (4.4% of total U.S. electricity). It is projected to double or triple by 2028, reaching 325–580 TWh (6.7–12% of total US electricity). AI applications are a significant driver of this growth.

International Energy Agency: U.S. data centers are expected to account for nearly half of the growth in electricity demand by the end of the decade, with a 130% increase in data center power consumption from 2024 to 2030, largely due to AI models like ChatGPT and Gemini.

Electric Power Research Institute: Data centers are projected to consume 4.6% to 9.1% of US electricity by 2030, up from 4% today, with AI queries requiring about 10 times the electricity of traditional internet searches.

Bank of America Institute: Predicts overall US electricity demand to grow by 2.5% annually over the next decade (compared to 0.5% in the past decade), with AI-driven data centers as a key contributor.

Rising electricity demand from data centers and electrification strained PJM’s recent capacity auction, signaling a reliability crisis, per outgoing FERC Chairman Mark Christie. FERC approved standards for wind and solar generators to stay connected during grid disturbances, enhancing stability as inverter-based power grows. However, expanding utility infrastructure is driving up electricity prices, with utilities pushing data centers to bear more investment risk. Tech companies resist, arguing they should only pay their fair share, highlighting the urgent need for more low-cost generation.",https://www.instituteforenergyresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/bigstock-A-major-power-grid-26017607-1024x683.jpg,N,,2025-08-11 21:00:21.925461

Ford said Monday it will invest $5 billion into a new assembly line and battery production to build EVs, including for a new, unnamed model that Ford says will be the most affordable electric pickup truck on the market. Ford said this announcement will add or “secure” 4,000 US jobs.

“We took inspiration from the Model T – the universal car that changed the world,” Doug Field, Ford’s chief EV digital and design officer, said Monday. “We think today will be a turning point for Ford Motor Company and the auto industry.”

Ford says about $2 billion of the investment will secure 2,200 hourly jobs at its Louisville assembly plant to build the company’s next generation of electric vehicles. However, Ford said the conversion at the plant from gas powered SUVs to electric vehicle will require about 600 fewer jobs than it currently needs, at least partly because the new assembly line will be more efficient. Ford may also produce fewer cars.

When asked about the job loss on CNBC Monday, Ford CEO Jim Farley suggested that some workers could be moved to the Kentucky Truck plant, Ford’s largest factory that is also in Louisville. He also said Ford would be adding additional EV models to the Louisville Assembly plant.

“So the 2,200 (jobs) is just the beginning,” he said. “By the way, we’re adding 1,700 new jobs up in Michigan that don’t exist today. The 600 people here will have plenty to do.”

The other jobs and investment will be directed to that Michigan battery plant, whose investment has actually been in the works since 2023.

Ford is the latest company to announce a large investment in US operations as it faces steep tariffs on imports and demands by the Trump administration to shift manufacturing back to the United States. Ford already builds more cars in America than any automaker. But the company said Monday it does not plan to shift production of one of its electric models, the Ford Mustang Mach-E, from a plant in Cuautitlan, Mexico.

Ford’s announcement also introduced a new battery design, which will be smaller and lighter than its previous versions. The new battery will allow the company to price a new EV pickup at $30,000, making it one of the most affordable available. By comparison, the Ford F-150 Lightning pickup has a starting price of about $55,000. The new line will be up and running in 2027, the company said Monday.

But the Trump administration has cut federal government support for electric vehicles by doing away with tax credits to help buyers, as well as rolling back emissions regulations put in place by the Biden administration.

And Ford is currently losing money on its EVs. While its EV revenue nearly tripled in the first half of this year compared to a year ago, it still lost $2.2 billion in the EV segment during the same time period.

Ford said the most significant change will be a different design for its assembly line, which has basically been in a straight line since its founder Henry Ford started the first auto assembly line in 1913.

The automaker said its new assembly line will be a tree layout rather than a straight line, with several lines feeding vehicle parts into one another. Ford said the new design will lower costs while making production faster and less difficult for workers on the line.

The public comment period on the U.S. EPA’s proposed rule to set 2027 and 2027 Renewable Fuel Standard renewable volume obligations (RVOs) and revise RFS regulations closed Aug. 8. Biofuel groups have largely expressed support for the proposal but also outlined several ways to improve the rulemaking.

The EPA released the proposed rule on June 13. A public hearing was held in July.

The agency has proposed to set the total 2026 RVO at 24.02 billion renewable identification numbers (RINs), a nearly 8% increase when compared to the 2025 RVO. The proposed 2027 RVO is 24.46 billion RINs, up nearly 2% when compared to the previous year.

The proposed targets include an implied 15 billion gallon per year mandate for conventional biofuel, a category primarily met with corn ethanol. In addition, the proposed 2026 and 2027 RVOs for biomass-based diesel and advanced biofuel would represent a significant increase over the 2025 mandates.

As part of the rulemaking, the EPA has proposed to reduce the 2025 cellulosic RVO from 1.38 billion RINs to 1.19 billion RINs and set the 2026 and 2027cellolosic RVOs at only 1.3 billion and 1.36 billion, respectively.

In addition to setting 2026 and 2027 RVOs, the proposed rule also includes a variety of provisions that would fundamentally alter the RFS program. This includes provisions aimed at boosting domestic biofuel production by limiting the ability for imported fuels and feedstocks to participate in the RFS. Specifically, the EPA is proposing to modify the value of a RIN based on whether the biofuel is derived from domestic or foreign sources. Under the proposed regulations, foreign biofuels and feedstocks would only generate 50% of the RIN value relative to domestic biofuels and feedstocks.

To ensure renewable fuel producers are generating the appropriate number of RINs, the EPA is proposing that all domestic renewable fuel producers be required to keep records of feedstock purchases and transfers that identify the point of origin for each feedstock and report that information to the EPA.

The proposed rule also aims to eliminate electricity, or eRINs, from the RFS. The EPA has taken steps in recent years to roll electricity into the RFS program, but, to date, has failed to approve a single eRIN pathway. The proposed rule aims to remove the definition of “renewable electricity” from RFS regulations along with the regulations associated with generating eRINs. If finalized, the proposed action will ensure that no RINs are generated in the future for electricity used in motor vehicles, according to EPA.

Clean Fuels Alliance America submitted comments supporting the EPA’s proposed RVOs for biomass-based diesel and advanced biofuel, and encouraged the agency to swiftly finalize the RVO proportion of the rulemaking. “The proposal is a welcome signal to U.S. farmers and biofuel producers, and we are ready to meet these higher volumes with domestically produced fuel,” Clean Fuels wrote in its comments. “We ask that the final rule sustain the volumes as proposed to ensure that our capacity is fully utilized. These volumes are readily achievable, based on current domestic production and investments that have been made.”

Kurt Kovarik, Clean Fuels’ vice president of federal affairs, added, “Domestic production of biodiesel and renewable diesel doubled since 2020 and continues to grow. The industry supplied more than 5 billion gallons of biodiesel, renewable diesel and SAF to the U.S. market in 2024, and we are poised to deliver more in 2026. Clean fuel production is essential to farm security, supporting 10 percent of the value of every bushel of U.S. soybeans.”

“EPA is proposing many changes to the program and expressing the RVO in RIN-gallons rather than physical gallons,” Kovarik continued. “We ask that EPA follow through on its intent to support our industry’s investments in domestic fuel production by maintaining robust volumes even if some parts of the proposal are not finalized. We also urge EPA to ensure that the step-change in volumes is not eroded by small refinery exemptions.”

The Renewable Fuels Association expressed strong support for the proposed RVOs, but also recommended slight modifications to the EPA’s plan to prioritize American-made renewable fuels over import-based fuels.

“We strongly support EPA’s proposed RVOs and, specifically, the implied conventional renewable fuel volumes of 15 billion gallons for both 2026 and 2027,” wrote Geoff Cooper, president and CEO of the RFA. “This will provide the ethanol industry with room for growth as gasoline blends containing 15 percent ethanol (E15) continue to gain momentum in the marketplace. Expanding the use of domestically produced renewable fuels like ethanol is key to achieving President Trump’s vision for lower fuel prices, a stronger agriculture industry, and American energy dominance.”

RFA’s comments voice support for EPA’s goal of prioritizing domestic renewable fuels and feedstocks over imported renewable fuels and feedstocks. However, the association believes certain modifications are needed to EPA’s proposed approach to better reflect market complexities in the wake of other recent policy developments, such as the Trump administration’s tariff implementation, modifications of renewable fuel tax credits under the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, and the significant increase in the proposed RVO for biomass-based diesel.

“In the wake of these policy changes, we encourage EPA to consider refocusing potential RIN adjustments more narrowly on imports of finished renewable fuel from countries outside of the United States, Canada, and Mexico, as well as fuels made from certain imported feedstocks (sourced from certain countries of origin) that pose the greatest risk to the integrity of the RFS program,” Cooper wrote. The comments also point out that since corn and sorghum imports are virtually non-existent, EPA’s proposed “feedstock point of origin” tracking requirements are impractical and completely unnecessary for certain renewable fuels like grain-based ethanol.

In addition, while RFA strongly supports EPA’s commitment to reallocating obligated renewable fuel blending volumes lost to small refinery exemptions, Cooper urged EPA to maintain a high standard for determining whether small refineries are truly experiencing “disproportionate economic hardship” (DEH).

“To honor the clear intent and market-forcing purpose of the Clean Air Act’s RFS program, the Agency should maintain a rigorous analytical approach and a high standard of proof for small refiners to demonstrate DEH,” Cooper wrote. “SRE petitioners claiming DEH should be required to provide specific, verifiable data and evidence showing that 1) compliance with the RFS is a central cause of economic difficulty that rises to a level of ‘hardship’, 2) they are truly unable to obtain RINs ‘ratably’ at the same prices as their competitors, and 3) they are somehow unable to pass along their RIN costs in the price of refined products sold to wholesale customers.”

The American Coalition for Ethanol also commended the EPA’s proposed RVOs, but suggested a few targeted changes to the provisions regarding American-made fuels.

“ACE supports EPA proposing the highest RVOs to date, including more than 24 billion gallons of total renewable fuel for 2026 and 2027,” stated Brian Jennings, CEO of ACE, in written comments. “We applaud EPA for proposing to significantly increase advanced biofuel levels, so those gallons are not displacing corn ethanol in the conventional biofuel pool.”

ACE also commends EPA’s proposal to keep RVOs whole even if small refinery exemptions (SREs) are granted for 2026 and 2027, and strongly supports a new “import RIN reduction” to favor American-made fuels.

“This step aligns with the RFS goals of making the U.S. more energy secure and boosting the American rural economy,” Jennings wrote.

Specifically, ACE urged the EPA to consider setting the implied target for conventional biofuels at higher than 15 billion gallons, and recognize higher projected use of E15 and E85.

Similarly, Growth Energy called on EPA to swiftly finalize the proposed RVOs while protecting against the impact of small refinery exemptions (SREs). “The Trump administration has laid out an ambitious course that will unlock new investment, increase U.S. energy production, and provide reliable markets for our farmers,” said Emily Skor, CEO of Growth Energy. “We urge EPA to stand strong on the president’s vision and swiftly finalize the proposed volumes. At the same time, we recognize that a minority of refiners continue to demand special exemptions that would destroy the very demand this proposal is intended to deliver. The EPA has indicated that they intend to fully account for any lost gallons from 2026 and 2027 exemptions. Maintaining that approach will send a clear signal that producers and farmers can count on this EPA to ensure the promised volumes actually reach the marketplace.”

Growth Energy also urged the EPA to continue to grow the RFS to help drive further investment in E15 and E85; limit SREs to small refineries that can fully demonstrate disproportionate economic hardship; finalize the proposal on E15 labeling and infrastructure; finalize the proposal to incentivize homegrown fuels and feedstocks; and approve pending pathways and registrations to help grow opportunities for cellulosic biofuels for corn and sorghum kernel fiber, aviation fuel and carbon capture.

The RNG Coalition called the proposal a “step backwards” with regards to the proposed cellulosic RVOs and criticized the EPA’s plan to remove electricity from the RFS program. “We need EPA to do its job and follow Congress’s directives to increase market demand for more renewable fuel,” wrote Johannes Escudero, founder and CEO of the RNG Coalition. “EPA appears to recognize that there is more than enough supply of RNG and more than enough production capacity to meet the 2025 cellulosic biofuel volume requirement as well as to meet higher volumes in 2026 and 2027. But, instead of establishing market-forcing volumes based on the statutory factors listed by Congress, EPA appears to have changed course, taking a step backwards - limiting the cellulosic biofuel category based on its estimates of demand. We urge EPA to follow the statute and Congressional intent and to return to its growth rate methodology that would establish cellulosic biofuel volume requirements of at least 1.5 billion gallons for 2026 and at least 1.86 billion gallons for 2027.

“The proposal also ignores the regulatory restrictions impacting RIN generation, despite there being more than sufficient available RNG supply,” Escudero continued. “In proposing to remove renewable electricity from the RFS, EPA is missing a significant opportunity to continue to grow the cellulosic biofuel category and facilitate compliance. EPA should expand the pathways for biogas-derived fuels, not restrict them. We urge EPA to work with the RNG industry to approve new pathways for fuels using RNG as a feedstock. One that can deliver fuel into the market almost immediately is a pathway for generating D3 RINs for refiners that utilize RNG to produce hydrogen used in the hydro-treating process.”

The automaker confirmed that the production of a full-size electric pickup, initially planned for 2027 at its BlueOval City plant in Tennessee, has been moved to 2028. Similarly, the rollout of the next-generation E-Transit electric van at its Ohio facility will also be delayed from 2026 to 2028.

The company said in a statement that both the F-150 Lightning and E-Transit ""continue to meet today’s customer needs,"" and that it “will be nimble in adjusting our product launch timing to meet market needs and customer demand while targeting improved profitability.”

The decision reflects a broader strategic shift driven by market signals and global competitive pressures, especially from Chinese automakers. These competitors have introduced lower-cost electric vehicles, intensifying pricing pressure on US and European manufacturers.

“The pure EV market in the United States seems to us very clear: small vehicles used for commuting and around town,” said CEO Jim Farley during a recent earnings call. He emphasized Ford’s focus on developing a new platform for smaller EVs optimized for urban use and price sensitivity.

This is not the first time Ford has adjusted its electric vehicle roadmap. In 2024, the company canceled plans for a three-row electric SUV, with Farley noting at the time that large EVs were no longer central to Ford’s development priorities. The company is also preparing to unveil further EV strategy details and model updates at an event scheduled for Aug. 11 in Kentucky.

Three major automakers—Nissan, Toyota, and Honda—have delayed or canceled key EV plans amid the approaching end of US tax credits for electric vehicles. Congress passed legislation ending the US$7,500 credit for new EVs and the US$4,000 credit for used ones as of Sep. 30, prompting industry-wide adjustments. Nissan postponed two electric crossovers at its Mississippi plant by nearly a year, though it still plans to produce them.

Toyota delayed its three-row electric SUV and shifted production to Kentucky, while Honda canceled a large electric SUV once planned for 2027.

Across various industries, including healthcare, packaging, agriculture, textiles, automotive, construction, and more, approximately 96 percent of manufactured goods originate from chemicals industry products. This $4.7 trillion industry currently produces 719 million tons of products annually. That’s about the same weight as almost 2,000 Empire State Buildings being produced every year, and still, the chemicals industry is projected to expand production by up to 46 percent by 2050.

The sector stands at a crossroads; chemicals are not only essential for today’s products, but also for the technologies of the future. The outputs of chemical manufacturing support more than 75 percent of emissions reduction technologies, including ethylene vinyl acetate in solar panels, refrigerants in heat pumps, batteries in electric vehicles, and lubricants for wind turbines. However, it is also one of the world’s most emissions-intensive industries, responsible for approximately 4 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions. In addition to the climate impact, a growing body of research links the extraction and refining of petrochemicals with disproportionate rates of cancer, reproductive harms, respiratory ailments, and other public health crises in frontline communities around the world. The rising overconsumption of plastics, driven largely by single-use packaging and fast fashion, negatively affects human health and safety at both the global level and the individual level; plastics pollution amplifies the consequences of all nine planetary boundaries, and disruptive pollutants like microplastics and “forever chemicals” have been found from the middle of the arctic to the inside of the human brain.

Rapidly decoupling fossil fuels from the global chemicals sector is imperative to preventing the worst consequences of climate change and improving global human health. However, in the United States alone, over 50 percent of the emissions reductions needed in this sector depend on innovative technologies that are still in the early stages of development. The decisions made today will influence not only the trajectory of this sector but also every downstream industry reliant on chemical inputs for decades to come.

The chemicals sector faces a dual emissions challenge, as it is dependent on fossil fuels for both production feedstock and energy. This dependence makes reducing emissions complex but also opens the door to breakthroughs in circular feedstocks, electrified processes, and modular manufacturing. A tightening regulatory landscape (e.g., proposed EU restrictions on toxic substances and single-use plastics, the future inclusion of chemicals in the EU Cross Border Adjustment Mechanism [CBAM], and California’s extended producer responsibility law on plastics used in packaging) and global volatility for low-emissions feedstocks make it clear that early movers will gain a long-term competitive edge. This presents a rare window for high-impact investment and partnership; whether the goal is market leadership, climate impact, or resilience building, now is the time to act.

Today’s chemical innovation landscape

The chemicals innovation ecosystem remains undercapitalized relative to its climate impact potential. Over the past five years, only 3 percent of climate tech venture capital investment has gone towards chemicals and plastics. Similarly, defossilized chemicals and catalysts received approximately $7 billion in investment in 2022, which is only 3 percent of the global annual capital expenditure in the chemicals industry.

Reaching net-zero emissions in the chemicals sector requires innovation across the value chain. Third Derivative and RMI recently launched the inaugural Industrial Innovation Cohorts to support groundbreaking startups in the cement, steel, and chemicals sectors. Through the process of developing robust technical investment theses, the team categorized three types of innovation that are needed to reach net-zero emissions across heavy industry, including the chemicals sector:

Make Less: Innovations to reduce demand for virgin feedstocks through materials substitution, recycling, upcycling, and increasing efficiency in supply chains and material use — in addition to non-technology efforts like reducing overconsumption and overproduction.

Make Better: Reducing emissions in existing processes through direct electrification, materials feedstock innovations, and process efficiency.

Make New: Disruptive technologies and novel processes to fundamentally change how materials are produced, with low or zero emissions from the start.

Make Less: Scaling the circular economy

Plastics circularity is a critical innovation frontier for reducing demand for virgin plastics and for mitigating emissions from products’ end-of-life. Startups in this space are advancing technologies such as molecular or chemical recycling (e.g., depolymerization), bio-based polymers, lignocellulosic fibers as substitutes for fossil fuel-derived thermoplastics, and reusable packaging. These innovations aim to displace virgin fossil-based plastics and reduce waste-related pollution, aligning with rising consumer and regulatory pressures. The current technology readiness levels of bio-based thermoplastic substitutes and chemical recycling technologies, such as depolymerization and solvent extraction, range from lab to demonstration scale.

Despite their promise, these solutions face challenges such as high capital costs for scaling new feedstock aggregation infrastructure, feedstock contamination that impacts the feasibility of chemical recycling and bio-based production, and the performance gap between mechanical recycling-derived plastics and traditional plastics. Tereform is tackling some of these challenges with a proprietary chemical recycling process, which uses oxygen and bio-based solvents to break down complex, contaminated streams of synthetic textile waste into pure monomers. Durability and material performance are key metrics for customers, so chemical recycling solutions like these that return materials to monomers and preserve the quality of plastics are gaining traction.

Additional opportunities for innovation include upstream design for reuse and infrastructure for local recycling, with a focus on modular systems and digital traceability for recycled content. Other upstream solutions, such as building infrastructure to aggregate, sort, and clean feedstocks, can be critical enablers of circular technologies.

Make Better: Improving existing processes

Process and energy efficiency innovations are key to addressing today’s highly energy-intensive production methods. For example, Third Derivative analysis shows that 90 percent to 95 percent of liquid separation operations for petrochemicals are carried out using thermal-based distillation technology, which represents 40 percent of the energy used in a typical chemical plant. Via Separations is reducing energy use through membrane separation as an alternative to distillation. Via’s electrified filtration process uses a graphene oxide membrane to deliver up to 90 percent energy savings. Further high-impact opportunities in this area include retrofitting incumbent systems or high-temperature batch processes, both of which have significant emissions reduction potential.

Incumbent producers are already deploying many existing energy efficiency technologies, with $3.4 billion invested in efficiency in 2022. Newer innovations such as heat pumps, thermal battery storage, electrified steam cracking, membrane-based separations, low-temperature distillation, and artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML) for process optimization also offer compelling economics, with some solutions showing internal rates of return above 10 percent. In many cases, these technologies can be retrofitted into existing chemical production facilities. Incumbents and original equipment manufacturers are leading the charge in developing efficiency solutions by partnering with national labs for research innovation. For example, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory partnered with incumbent TotalEnergies and the startup Twelve in 2022 to develop a new catalyst that improves the energy efficiency of electrochemical ethylene production by 15 percent.

The key challenge for many of these solutions is access to low-cost and reliable clean energy, which can be partially mitigated by securing long-term power purchase agreements or co-locating new facilities with renewable energy installations. Some solutions, such as membrane technologies or electric steam crackers, can be bottlenecked by lengthy capital planning cycles despite compelling returns, as extensive retrofits in existing facilities often require aligning the installation with planned shutdowns. Modular retrofit solutions and as-a-service business models can help chemical plants deploy new technology with lower capital expenses and shorter deal cycles.

Make New: Reimagining the future

At the heart of decoupling the chemicals sector from fossil fuels lies innovations in defossilized chemical production, meaning production that does not rely on fossil fuels for feedstocks or energy. This includes replacing fossil-derived feedstocks with low-emission sources of carbon, biomass, and green hydrogen, as well as new reactor designs and novel catalyst development. Technologies such as electrochemical and thermochemical CO₂ conversion and bio-based platform chemicals offer a radical rethinking of the chemicals value chain by transforming captured climate pollution into valuable chemical feedstocks. In the near term, methanol-to-olefins is a promising and lower-risk opportunity for defossilized chemical production. This technology is currently available at a commercial scale utilizing fossil fuel-derived methanol. Emerging green methanol can serve as a drop-in replacement for fossil sources, significantly reducing the emissions of the end product.

Carbon conversion technologies are gaining significant traction in the pursuit of defossilized chemical production. Oxylus Energy, PuriFire Energy, and Aerleum are producing e-methanol and other chemicals from CO₂, water, and renewable electricity. CERT Systems is initially targeting plastics with a single-step CO₂-to-ethylene process. Rubi Laboratories is utilizing enzymes to convert captured carbon into pure cellulose pulp, which is then spun into textiles using existing methods, thereby reducing emissions in the fashion industry.

Bloom Biorenewables is taking a different approach to carbon conversion. Rather than working directly with the greenhouse gas, Bloom’s assisted aldehyde fractionation process converts biomass (which naturally sequesters CO₂ during its lifespan) into cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin. These feedstocks can be utilized in a variety of applications across cosmetics, plastics, adhesives, and more.

Novel catalyst solutions to improve reactions are another key innovation area for defossilized chemicals. Cascade Bio offers a coating to stabilize enzymes for industrial biocatalysis, increasing productivity and reducing costs through their cell-free approach. Dunia Innovations is accelerating R&D for new materials and catalysts with AI- and robotics-powered platforms, which enable a fully autonomous laboratory to run continuous electrochemical experiments for novel catalyst discovery.

Defossilized chemical production holds the highest potential for emissions reduction compared to conventional pathways, with the possibility of achieving near-zero emissions. However, progress is constrained by limited feedstock availability, lack of existing infrastructure, long commercialization timelines, and the high total cost of ownership (often four to six times higher than that of incumbents on a dollar-per-ton basis, largely due to the cost of electricity. Driving down the cost of electricity, via electrolyzer efficiency and access to cheaper renewable power, will be integral to scaling these technologies. Modular, decentralized systems that can co-locate with feedstock sources, such as the modular electrochemistry reactors developed by Mattiq, address this need.

While defossilized production is the most active innovation space in the chemicals sector, significant systemic gaps still exist in intermediates like aromatics and the enabling infrastructure for feedstock transport and aggregation.

In addition to the technologies in these three categories, several types of cross-cutting enablers can accelerate commercial deployment and de-risk investment in chemicals innovations. Digital solutions like AI/ML can accelerate catalyst discovery, optimize reactor designs, simulate new chemical reactions, and enable predictive maintenance to improve equipment reliability. Some companies are pursuing flexible business models that include both one-time equipment sales, which have higher upfront costs to the customer, and as-a-service offerings, which spread costs over time, to expand their commercial pipeline to meet a variety of customer preferences. Across the entire innovation landscape, certifications for low-carbon products help customers validate sustainability claims and, in some cases, pursue incentives designed to drive market adoption.

Industrial innovation insights

Through the process of sourcing, conducting diligence on, and onboarding this cohort of startups, Third Derivative identified several common commercialization challenges across the innovation landscape that startups are addressing creatively.

Customer willingness to pay varies: Consumer brands tend to show more flexibility on green premiums, while commodity buyers remain cost sensitive. In industries like textiles and cosmetics, environmentally conscious luxury brands have the margin to pay a premium to help startups scale production while gaining early access to low-carbon products. This has proven vital to bringing new technologies down the cost curve, enabling them to break into the commodity market. For example, Patagonia and Reformation are apparel brands that have strong sustainability platforms; these first movers are helping to commercialize Rubi Laboratories’ CO₂-derived textiles.

With commercial agreements, startups can face “the chicken or the egg” dilemma: Customers and investors require de-risked technology, but de-risking requires commercial traction. Some startups are navigating these dynamics through creative options, such as prepurchase agreements to guarantee revenue, as-a-service business models to reduce capital expenses and shorten deal cycles, and joint venture production models to reduce capital burden, share risk, and gain credibility by partnering with incumbents. For example, Hexion, a global leader in adhesives, is partnering with Bloom Biorenewables to commercialize Bloom’s renewable bio-adhesive.

Access to long-term contracts for feedstocks and product offtake is a bottleneck: Key renewable inputs such as carbon, hydrogen, and biomass are currently supply-constrained and expensive (e.g., the cost of clean hydrogen is around $6.50/kg today, which is two to three times more expensive than fossil-derived hydrogen, but is expected to come down to about $2.30/kg by 2050). Securing long-term offtake agreements for end products is seen as essential to de-risk business models and attract additional capital. While policy levers can incentivize long-term contracts through regulations, subsidies, and tax incentives, there is currently uncertainty around much of the US federal policy infrastructure. Startups that were previously pursuing federal US incentives are now exploring alternative non-dilutive funding sources, such as state-level incentives, the EU Innovation Fund, or Canada’s Clean Growth Hub.

Climate investing is down, and heavy industry is feeling the impact: After record-shattering investment levels in 2023, global investment in clean industry fell nearly 60 percent in 2024. Amid a challenging fundraising climate, non-dilutive capital has proven critical to advancing research and development, deploying pilots, and unlocking commercial traction. Philanthropic capital and government grants can fill crucial gaps for early-stage technologies where risk is high, but impact potential is significant, enabling follow-on funding from the private sector. For example, the Colorado Office of Economic Development & International Trade awarded a catalytic grant to Tereform through its Advanced Industries Accelerator Program. That same office offers an Advanced Industries Investment Tax Credit to incentivize follow-on investments in Colorado advanced industries businesses, thereby increasing the impact of the awarded grant funding.

Investing in innovation

To unlock the next wave of climate-aligned innovation in the chemicals sector, investors and corporations must take a proactive and strategic approach. Founders need partners with extensive networks who understand the complexity of scaling hard tech in an incumbent-driven sector to help bring breakthrough solutions to market. Several key considerations can help startups optimize their value proposition and enable investors and corporates to increase their impact.

Certifications from reputable standards bodies such as ISO, SCS, and ISCC build credibility: Low-carbon product certifications are increasingly vital for validating emissions reductions, enabling access to premium markets, and securing offtake agreements, particularly in chemical markets with strict procurement standards or evolving regulatory mandates (e.g:, varying regulations across states in the United States on restricted dyes and chemical additives in textile manufacturing). However, conducting in-depth life cycle analyses to obtain these certifications requires time, money, and expertise that many startups lack in-house. Providing startups with dedicated funding for these efforts and connecting them with technical experts can accelerate certification.

Regional adaptability is vital: Startups are developing localized strategies that match or can adapt to feedstock availability, policy environments, and infrastructure readiness. Technologies with clear demand signals for low-emission chemical products and a path to commercialization that aligns with regulatory shifts (e.g., CBAM in the EU) are well-positioned to scale. Rapidly growing economies and industries in Asia and the Middle East provide immense market opportunities in the coming decades. Many countries in these regions have both strong net-zero commitments and established or emerging carbon pricing and/or emissions trading schemes, making them particularly well suited to support homegrown innovation and serve as a landing spot for US companies seeking more favorable markets.

Strategic partnerships with incumbents are a critical accelerator: Startups benefit from access to existing infrastructure and operational expertise, while incumbents can experiment with new solutions without the time and expense of launching or expanding an in-house research and development team. The venture capital arms of large corporations can play a key role in facilitating joint development agreements or pilot programs at production plants, helping startups meet critical technical validation milestones. Early adoption of new technologies allows incumbents to future-proof themselves, enabling them to remain competitive in new markets and shifting regulatory landscapes.",https://rmi.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/57dbdf59-2988-4dc8-a77b-510a22f225f3.jpeg,N,,2025-08-11 22:00:13.368095

The RFS was first established by the Energy Policy Act of 2005, which was signed by President George W. Bush on Aug. 8, 2025.
Sen. Pete Ricketts, R-Neb., and Rep. Max Miller, R-Ohio, on Aug. 1 introduced resolutions commemorating the success of the RFS.
More than 10 percent of U.S. fuel supplies now come from renewable sources like ethanol, representing billions of gallons in savings.
As part of a drive toward U.S. energy dominance, the U.S. EPA recently proposed to set biofuel blending at the highest volume in the history of the program.","The U.S. renewable fuels industry on Aug. 8 celebrated the 20th anniversary of the Renewable Fuel Standard. Federal lawmakers also marked the occasion with resolutions introduced in the House and Senate earlier this month.

The RFS was first established by the Energy Policy Act of 2005, which was signed by President George W. Bush on Aug. 8, 2025. The program was later expanded by the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007, also signed by Bush on Dec. 19., 2007.

Sen. Pete Ricketts, R-Neb., and Rep. Max Miller, R-Ohio, on Aug. 1 introduced resolutions commemorating the success of the RFS. The resolutions honor the RFS “as a milestone in America’s commitment to strengthening energy security, supporting rural communities, growing the economy, and improving environmental performance.” It further “recognizes the positive impacts of the RFS on United States energy policy, the agricultural sector, and the environment over the past 2 decades.”

The Renewable Fuels Association recently published a report highlighting the positive impacts of the RFS, noting the program has lowered gas prices, enhanced domestic energy security, supported the farm economy and helped the air and environment. “Over the past two decades, the Renewable Fuel Standard has delivered tremendous benefits for our nation—reducing dependence on foreign oil, lowering fuel costs for consumers, creating hundreds of thousands of jobs across rural America, and strengthening the agricultural economy,” said Geoff Cooper, president and CEO of the RFS. “It has spurred market competition and expanded choices at the pump for drivers nationwide. We’re thrilled to see Congress commemorating this milestone with a strong bipartisan resolution, and we applaud Senator Pete Ricketts, Representative Max Miller, and the many lawmakers who joined in honoring one of the most successful and forward-looking energy policies in U.S. history.”

Growth Energy noted that U.S. biorefineries have produced more than 250 billion gallons of ethanol since the RFS was first established in 2005. Over the same time period, U.S. ethanol plants have purchased 92.7 billion bushels of corn, driving more than $425 billion of revenue for American farmers. “The RFS is the foundation of America’s bioeconomy,” said Emily Skor, CEO of Growth Energy. “It supports hundreds of thousands of rural jobs and has shielded an entire generation of drivers from volatility in global oil markets. More than 10 percent of U.S. fuel supplies now come from renewable sources like ethanol, representing billions of gallons in savings. And it’s still fueling growth. As part of a drive toward U.S. energy dominance, the U.S. EPA recently proposed to set biofuel blending at the highest volume in the history of the program. Those numbers aren’t yet final, and the EPA still needs to address petitions from refiners seeking to skirt the RFS, but if we remain on a growth trajectory, the benefits to American motorists and farmers are overwhelming.”

Clean Fuels Alliance America applauded the congressional resolutions and highlighted the impact of the program on the U.S. biobased diesel industry. “Clean Fuels thanks Senator Pete Ricketts and Representative Max Miller and their colleagues for honoring the Renewable Fuel Standard’s foundational role in strengthening America’s energy and farm security,” said Kurt Kovarik, vice president of federal affairs at Clean Fuels. “Under the RFS over the last twenty years, U.S. biodiesel and renewable diesel production has grown from a few hundred million gallons to 5 billion gallons, meeting 9 percent of the nation’s on-road diesel demand. Biodiesel and renewable diesel production is vital for America’s economy, supporting $42.4 billion in economic opportunity. It is essential to America’s farmers, supporting 10 percent of the value of every soybean grown in the United States. With robust RFS volumes proposed for the coming years, the benefits keep growing.”",https://bbi-strapi.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/archived/biomassmagazine/posts/web/2017/07/RFSNew_14998913260613.jpg,N,,2025-08-11 20:02:46.519625

The parcel in question is currently occupied by Dominion’s retired Chesterfield Power Station, a coal plant, as well as two operating natural gas turbines.
Dominion projects it will run less than 40% of the time, mostly during demand peaks driven by air conditioning and heating during hot and cold weather.
SELC and other groups assert that Dominion is planning too heavily around power plants that contribute to planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions.
This new stage of debate over the gas plant comes as President Donald Trump’s administration seeks to undermine climate science and revoke emissions controls instituted under former President Joe Biden.","Dozens of Central Virginia residents and environmentalists, most clad in bright red T-shirts, turned out to a state briefing on Dominion Energy’s proposed Chesterfield Energy Reliability Center last Thursday at the SpringHill Suites in Chester.

The briefing was held on the eve of opening the state Department of Environmental Quality’s public comment period on the facility.

“This plant is dirty and expensive. No two ways about it,” Rachel James, a Southern Environmental Law Center attorney, said at a press conference before DEQ’s briefing.

Dominion spokesperson Jeremy Slayton said the company’s modeling shows it needs new natural gas generation to meet skyrocketing demand.

“Power demand in Virginia is growing at an unprecedented pace,” Slayton told VPM News. “By the late 2030s, our customers will use twice as much power as they do today.”

CERC would be built adjacent to the Dutch Gap Conservation Area. The parcel in question is currently occupied by Dominion’s retired Chesterfield Power Station, a coal plant, as well as two operating natural gas turbines.

As a “peaker” plant, CERC would be designed to quickly start and stop generating up to 1,000 megawatts of electricity according to demand. Dominion projects it will run less than 40% of the time, mostly during demand peaks driven by air conditioning and heating during hot and cold weather.

The public debate on the plant has already been contentious, with local activists outraged at Chesterfield County’s decision to avoid holding public hearings on the issue by declaring Dominion’s existing special use permit on the land sufficient for the new plant.

Environmental groups have also challenged Dominion’s long-term plans, arguing they rely too heavily on fossil fuels despite the Virginia Clean Economy Act requiring the company to retire its carbon-emitting generation by 2045.

“This plant would spew out several harmful contaminants, including fine particulate matter, which is one of the most deadly air pollutants,” said James.

SELC and other groups assert that Dominion is planning too heavily around power plants that contribute to planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions. They argue third-party modeling shows that the company can plan for more battery storage and demand-side management — things that reduce demand, like energy efficiency programs — in place of natural gas generation.

Thursday’s briefing served as an opportunity for the public to ask state regulators questions about the project.

Alison Sinclair, an environmental specialist at DEQ, fielded questions about how the agency drafts its air pollution permits, models pollutant impacts and determines site suitability.

She said DEQ had made a preliminary determination through modeling that the facility would not result in the surrounding area falling out of compliance with federal Clean Air Act requirements. A draft permit published Aug. 8 included real-time monitoring requirements both inside smokestacks and in the surrounding area.

Many of the commenters questioned whether DEQ’s ambient air quality monitoring plan for the proposed facility would be sufficient to understand real-time health impacts on the surrounding communities.

This new stage of debate over the gas plant comes as President Donald Trump’s administration seeks to undermine climate science and revoke emissions controls instituted under former President Joe Biden.

Despite changes at the federal level, James, the SELC attorney, said she is confident that Virginia law is strong in supporting renewable development and challenging polluting energy sources: “Our state laws govern here, and we find that they're pretty strong and in support of what we're what we're advocating for.”

When asked about how Virginia sets air quality standards, Sinclair said DEQ defers to the federal Environmental Protection Agency by adopting their standards for airborne pollutants like PM2.5 — particulate matter roughly one-twentieth the size of the width of a human hair.

There is an active push to change how National Ambient Air Quality Standards — limits on common air pollutants with significant impacts on human health, such as sulfur dioxide, carbon monoxide and particulate matter — are set.

In a June hearing of the US House Committee on Energy and Commerce’s environment subcommittee, Chair Morgan Griffith (R–9th) said recent changes to the NAAQS have diminishing public health returns and significant adverse impacts to industry — including new federal PM2.5 standards adopted by Virginia in 2024.

“We need to begin a modernization effort by examining draft legislative proposals to reform the out-of-date NAAQS process,” Griffith said in his opening statement. “Overly restrictive air regulations have curtailed some domestic investment in semiconductor plants and data centers, which in turn could jeopardize America’s ability to compete in the global artificial intelligence race.”

CERC isn’t the only energy project Dominion has in the pipeline. The utility is nearing first power delivery from its 2.6-gigawatt offshore wind project, and the company said it has the third-largest solar fleet of any individual utility in the US.

It’s also building up its gas and battery storage infrastructure. In May, grid operator PJM Interconnection approved 51 projects through its Reliability Resource Initiative, an effort to quickly approve select projects that can add more energy to the grid by 2031.

Dominion received preliminary approval for 14 projects that would add 508 MW of generation from its own sources to its transmission system. Most of those come from “uprates,” projects that increase the generating capacity at existing power plants.

The company is also slated to connect an additional 4,587 MW of generation from other power producers to its transmission system through RRI, including from new natural gas plants and battery storage facilities. All of those projects are subject to local and state approvals.

“We’re factoring in all of these different types of resources … to make sure we keep the lights on for our customers because at the end of the day, that’s what our customers count on,” said Slayton, the Dominion spokesperson.

DEQ is accepting public comment until Oct. 8. Comments can be emailed to AirDivision1@deq.virginia.gov, or mailed to DEQ’s Piedmont Regional Office (4949 Cox Road, Glen Allen, VA 23060). The agency will hold another public meeting at 5 p.m. on Sept. 8 at the SpringHill Suites (12301 Redwater Creek Road, Chester 23831).

The project needs approval from the State Corporation Commission as well; SCC is taking comments on its website and will hold a hearing on the case Tuesday, Aug. 19.

Chesterfield residents have organized against the proposal, which would replace a retired coal plant, for years now — they had no luck with county leadership, who avoided local public hearings on the issue.

And Dominion’s got plans to upgrade or expand 17 existing gas plants — plus another new one — recently given initial approval by PJM Interconnection, the regional grid operator.",https://assets.vpm.org/dims4/default/2cb3835/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4308x2262+0+3/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fk1-prod-vpm.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fe2%2F47%2F2c57f8694fc2b9abd6af457063d2%2Fimage.png,N,,2025-08-11 20:02:33.852412

Cecelia Smith-Schoenwalder reports for U.S. News & World Report.

In short:

The Trump administration and Congress repealed three major waivers under the Clean Air Act that allowed California to set tougher vehicle and truck emission standards than what was required under federal law.

Gov. Gavin Newsom has ordered agencies to develop new actions to promote affordable zero-emission vehicles without relying on federal approval.

Experts warn the policy shift could slow U.S. electric vehicle growth, ceding market leadership to China, and worsen air pollution in California, which has some of the nation’s worst air quality.

Key quote:

“The governor and the legislature should understand that their people need to breathe clean air, and that auto pollution is the worst contributor to the polluted air in California.”

— Dan Becker, director of the Safe Climate Transport Campaign at the Center for Biological Diversity

Why this matters:

Air pollution remains one of the most persistent environmental health threats in the United States, contributing to asthma, heart disease, lung cancer, and premature deaths. California’s geography and heavy traffic make it particularly vulnerable, trapping pollutants in valleys and urban basins. Vehicle emissions are a leading source of smog-forming chemicals and fine particles, which disproportionately harm low-income communities located near highways and freight corridors. Rolling back state-level emission standards could prolong exposure to these pollutants, increasing the public health burden and straining healthcare systems.

2025 Conference: Changing for a Changing Climate

The 2020s have brought a lot of change to Oregon’s energy landscape. From customer affordability to growing energy demands, the challenges we faced at the start of the decade are much different than today. Oregon is now five years out from meeting its 2030 climate goals for both electric and gas utilities. As we work toward a cleaner energy system, we must reflect on the progress we’ve already made and face the mounting challenges of the next half-decade.

Afternoon Breakout Panel - Powering Careers: Workforce Development for a Clean Energy Transition

Oregon has set ambitious goals for creating and sustaining meaningful living wage jobs and promoting workforce equity. For Oregon to develop our clean energy sector, we must also have a robust and diverse workforce. We can meet and exceed our energy goals by building opportunities for new jobs that support renewable energy, energy efficiency, and whole-home repairs. These employment opportunities support not just our emission reduction goals, but also how our communities can thrive in a just transition.

This conversation will connect to the real-world, tangible examples of the opportunities to expand our green economy. And we will discuss challenges that arise when there is not a robust workforce available. By looking across the energy industry, we will explore what an equitable green workforce is capable of.

Moderator: Ryan Tran, Economist

The EPA is currently in a court battle with several nonprofits over whether the EPA can rescind obligated funding for other programs in the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund.","The Environmental Protection Agency announced it’s cancelling $93 million already allocated for solar energy projects for low-income Arkansas and Mississippi communities. The cuts come after Republicans’ One Big Beautiful Bill cut the funding source for the program.

Called “Solar for All,” the program created during the Biden Administration aimed to send $7 billion to make solar energy accessible for low-income households and communities across the country.

Hope Enterprise Corporation, a community development financial institution for low-income and under-resourced residents in the South, was in charge of implementing the funding in Arkansas and Mississippi. The organization hired people to help implement the program, and as recently as August 4, Hope Enterprise Corporation was holding meetings on how to apply for funding.

But on August 8, Hope Enterprise received notice from the EPA that the government “has made the decision to terminate the SFA [Solar for All] program and existing grants”

“Hope Enterprise Corporation received notice from the Environmental Protection Agency of the decision to terminate funding for the Solar for All program. We are reviewing the communication to determine our next steps. Regrettably, termination of the program would end funding to support projects lowering energy costs for up to 10,500 households,” Ed Sivak, president of Hope Enterprise Corporation, said Monday. It was unclear if they would put up a legal challenge.

EPA chief Lee Zeldin said on X that the Trump EPA would be ending the Solar for All program for good, arguing the agency no longer has the authority or funds to implement it after the One Big Beautiful Bill was passed. Earlier this year, climate funding for projects in Arkansas were frozen then unfrozen in the chaotic early months of the second Trump presidency. But at the time, Solar for All was not being terminated by the Trump EPA, according to a report from Energy and Environment News by Politico.

Now whether the Trump administration will be able to cancel Solar for All will likely be decided in the courts, because the Solar for All funding has already been obligated to the receiving nonprofits and governments that will be implementing the program. Obligated funding means the organizations have legally binding contracts with the federal government to receive the funds and spend it in accordance with the programs. In an August 6 frequently asked questions document, Hope Enterprise Corporation wrote that their “grant remains legally obligated, and we remain committed to helping families save on their energy bills.”

Attorneys with public interest law group Lawyers for Good Government is looking to work with Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund awardees to sue the Trump Administration over the move.

Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill, which extended sweeping tax cuts and made dramatic cuts to the social safety net, only rescinded the unobligated balance of the $27 billion appropriated in the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund. According to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, only $19 million of the entire Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund remained unobligated.

Zeldin has previously said that around $3 billion of the $27 billion obligated funding from the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund has flowed to the nonprofit and government awardees. The EPA is currently in a court battle with several nonprofits over whether the EPA can rescind obligated funding for other programs in the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund. The funding is effectively frozen in place as the court battle plays out.",https://arktimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Image-2.jpeg,N,,2025-08-11 20:02:51.320989

That’s a little more than half of the $54,780 starting MSRP of Ford’s sole EV pickup today, the F-150 Lightning.
“LFP” is short for “lithium iron phosphate,” a battery technology that has begun to displace nickel cobalt manganese (NMC) batteries in an increasing number of EVs.
In Ford’s new “assembly tree,” a vehicle will start with an LFP battery assembly that serves as the car or truck’s core structure, with the front and back of the vehicle being built on separate lines and then attached to that core.
Only a small fraction of US EV batteries have needed replacing since EVs became a mass-market option in the States starting in 2010.","Barely a month after President Trump signed the budget-reconciliation bill that will make electric vehicles more expensive by killing off tax credits for them, along with those for many other clean-energy purchases, Ford has announced a plan to make EVs cheaper.

The automaker's “Universal EV” project, outlined in a press release and post from Ford President and CEO Jim Farley, should yield a family of vehicles starting with a midsized electric pickup truck that Ford plans to ship in 2027 at a price starting at roughly $30,000. That’s a little more than half of the $54,780 starting MSRP of Ford’s sole EV pickup today, the F-150 Lightning.

“Ford is going to deliver what no other automaker has been able to: a family of affordable, adaptable electric vehicles that offer multiple body styles for work and play—including for export—and whose LFP batteries will be assembled in America, not imported from China,” Farley says.

“LFP” is short for “lithium iron phosphate,” a battery technology that has begun to displace nickel cobalt manganese (NMC) batteries in an increasing number of EVs. Ford notes LFP’s cost, space, weight, and durability advantages as well as its lack of cobalt and nickel–two minerals largely imported from countries with seriously iffy labor rights and environmental protection.

Ford’s announcement does not, however, mention LFP’s lower fire risk relative to NMC (already less of a hazard in EVs than in gas-powered cars) or reduced cold-weather performance (which other manufacturers say they’ve addressed with design changes like battery warmers).

In Ford’s new “assembly tree,” a vehicle will start with an LFP battery assembly that serves as the car or truck’s core structure, with the front and back of the vehicle being built on separate lines and then attached to that core.

Ford cites a variety of improvements made possible by that process: “The platform reduces parts by 20% versus a typical vehicle, with 25% fewer fasteners, 40% fewer workstations dock-to-dock in the plant and 15% faster assembly time.”

Having a battery double as a core part of a car’s structure would seem to make it difficult to replace, but LFP’s longer lifespan may make that a non-issue in practice. A February Washington Post story quoted Scott Moura, an environmental engineering professor at the University of California at Berkeley, estimating that LFP batteries would offer two to three times the 1,000 charge cycles of NMC batteries, good for 200,000 or so miles. Only a small fraction of US EV batteries have needed replacing since EVs became a mass-market option in the States starting in 2010.

Farley says the company aims to deliver the new EV pickup built on this platform at “a target starting MSRP at about $30,000, roughly the same as the Model T when adjusted for inflation.”

Reality check on that price projection: Ford launched the F-150 Lightning with an MSRP of just under $40,000, then jacked up the price multiple times to respond to supply-chain issues, high demand, and other complications.

Ford will build this at an existing factory in Louisville, where it will invest $2 billion to rebuild that plant, with some financial support from Kentucky’s state government. In Ford's press release, Gov. Andy Beshear (D) says this project “boosts Kentucky’s position at the center of EV-related innovation and solidifies Louisville Assembly Plant as an important part of Ford’s future.”

Ford plans to spend another $3 billion on upgrading its BlueOval Battery Park in Marshall, Michigan, to build these LFP batteries at scale.

In an interview with Wired, Farley shared other details about the project, such as how Ford hired Tesla veterans Doug Field (who also led Apple’s since-scrapped electric-vehicle project) and Alan Clarke in recent years to lead the skunkworks project that developed this platform.

In the piece, Farley says their expertise will let Ford compete directly with such Chinese manufacturers as BYD: “Turns out, Doug and Alan and the team built a propulsion system that was like Apollo 13, managed down to the watt so that our battery could be so much smaller than BYD's.”

Farley has more direct acquaintance with China’s booming EV industry than many other people in the US auto industry. During an appearance on the Everything Electric’s Fully Charged podcast in October, he told host Robert Llewellyn that he’d had a Xiaomi SU7 sedan specially imported from Shanghai and was impressed by the results: “I’ve been driving it for six months now, and I don’t want to give it up.”",https://i.pcmag.com/imagery/articles/07cozsNwBxHW4NBugJNdRsa-1.fit_lim.size_1200x630.v1754939306.jpg,N,,2025-08-11 20:02:10.041081

“For years, U.S. industries—including the automotive supply chain—have relied on foreign sources like China for critical minerals,” Savage said.
In addition to a pipeline of raw materials, the arrangement also advances industries that recover and refine critical minerals.
Sadowsky said the global trading environment has fostered reliance on domestic sourcing and “has highlighted the need for the efficient recovery and refinement of critical minerals.”","Dive Brief:

Lucid Group has launched an initiative meant to accelerate the development of critical mineral resources for domestic electric vehicle battery manufacturers and tier 1 suppliers, the company announced July 23.

The Minerals for National Automotive Competitiveness Collaboration (MINAC), which the EV maker formed in partnership with critical mineral producers and refiners, has a goal of identifying and resolving barriers to strengthen domestic supply chains as well as grow EV adoption, according to the release.

“Domestic supply chains strengthen manufacturing resilience, fortify sustainable supply chains, and accelerate job growth,” Marc Winterhoff, Interim CEO of Lucid, said in the release.

Dive Insight:

The group’s formation aligns with President Donald Trump’s executive order issued March 20 to increase American mineral production, according to a statement from Alaska Energy Metals, one of MINAC’s founding members. Other participating companies include Electric Metals USA, Graphite One and RecycLiCo.

Alaska Energy Metals is developing a large-scale mining operation in Alaska for nickel, which is a key raw material for the production of lithium-ion batteries for electric vehicles.

AEMC President and CEO Gregory Beischer in a statement said that Alaska plays a key role in advancing American critical mineral production. Through MINAC, he hopes it will open access to the state’s critical minerals to the rest of the country.

In addition to nickel, manganese is another raw material required for battery production, Electric Metals USA CEO Brian Savage said in a statement. The company is developing the Emily manganese mining operation in Minnesota and aims to become a major domestic producer of high-purity manganese.

Savage said joining the effort coincides with his company’s goal of increasing availability of manganese in the domestic supply chain.

“For years, U.S. industries—including the automotive supply chain—have relied on foreign sources like China for critical minerals,” Savage said. “Our efforts support U.S. policy goals as demand grows for non-Chinese critical materials.”

Graphite One CEO Anthony Huston, whose company announced a graphite supply deal with Lucid in June, said in a statement that the coalition’s formation is a critical step toward creating a fully U.S.-based supply chain.

In addition to a pipeline of raw materials, the arrangement also advances industries that recover and refine critical minerals. Richard Sadowsky, CEO of RecycLiCo, in a statement said that his company is ready to validate and scale its hydrometallurgical technology.

Sadowsky said the global trading environment has fostered reliance on domestic sourcing and “has highlighted the need for the efficient recovery and refinement of critical minerals.”",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/TsiAm1V1HxMwWvCkUfZiphz_TIeOilcWnHSarnPtTjM/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9MdWNpZF92ZWhpY2xlc184LjEuMjUuanBn.webp,N,,2025-08-11 22:01:34.970642

And Bob Broderdorf, who became Jeep brand CEO in February, is obviously happy to turn the page.
Jeep brand CEO Bob Broderdorf speaking with journalists last week in Detroit.
We got you.” As for Jeep sales, well, the tide hasn’t turned that quickly.","Regime change atop Stellantis is breathing new life into US brands, particularly Jeep. “The brand no longer has a pricing problem,” said Jeep CEO Bob Broderdorf.

This year, an all-new hybrid Jeep Cherokee will arrive, along with the updated Grand Wagoneer and Grand Cherokee and the Recon, Jeep’s first trail-rated battery-electric SUV.

Expect “bigger powertrains, more ICE variants” and bigger tires. The Hemi-powered Wrangler 392, which was being phased out this year, will be back for the foreseeable future.

Carlos Tavares resigned as Stellantis CEO eight months ago, and what has happened since—at least in North America—has been nothing short of scrapping most of his controversial agenda.

His call for deep cost cutting and ending production of the Hemi V8, pushing hard for electric vehicles, and starving certain brands of new product made enemies among dealers and at regional headquarters in Auburn Hills, Michigan.

Jeep in particular suffered as Tavares pushed for higher prices for the brand’s popular SUVs, and the sales results took a downturn.

But Stellantis has a new CEO, Antonio Filosa, and his arrival less than two months ago has provided a shot in the arm across the brands formerly associated with the Chrysler collective. The Hemi is returning, Tim Kuniskis came out of retirement to run Ram, and Dodge is restoring some of its internal-combustion muscle cars.

And Bob Broderdorf, who became Jeep brand CEO in February, is obviously happy to turn the page. “We’ve set out to right some of the wrongs of our past,” he told journalists gathered in Detroit for a Jeep business update last week.

He focused immediately on pricing and explained how it’s been realigned to emphasize value. “I encourage any customer who was shopping for a Jeep vehicle a year ago, nine months ago, to come back and see how aggressive our pricing is,” Broderdorf said.

Every Jeep Has Been Repriced

“The brand no longer has a pricing problem. Literally, every single Jeep that we make has been repriced, except for the Wrangler, which will be addressed in the ‘26 model year right around the corner.”

New management has allowed time to “recalibrate and reset the foundations of this brand,” and that includes a $3 billion investment in Jeep.

“This year alone, Jeep has made more than 40 distinct product actions, half of which are already in the market,” Broderdorf said.

Jeep brand CEO Bob Broderdorf speaking with journalists last week in Detroit.

By the end of 2025, an all-new hybrid Jeep Cherokee will arrive, along with the updated Grand Wagoneer and Grand Cherokee and the Recon, Jeep’s first trail-rated battery-electric SUV, to be available worldwide.

Broderdorf said Jeep will introduce seven vehicles globally in the next seven months, including the Compass in Europe, Commander in the Middle East, and the Avenger in South America. While the current Compass remains on sale in the US, the next-generation model for North America has been delayed.

Playing up Jeep’s rugged DNA, Broderdorf said brand enthusiasts “will see us return to our roots. Wrangler and Gladiator will become more personal, more customizable. We’re going to have more fun.”

That means unlocking customization options, new colors, and new features with engine variants.

Wrangler 392 Stays in Lineup

“Why can’t you get a Wrangler with matching body color fender flares in Mojito green? You should be able to do that,” he said. “We’re going to give some more customization back to the customer where it belongs.”

And expect “bigger powertrains, more ICE variants” and bigger tires to overcome obstacles on the trail. The popular Hemi-powered Wrangler 392, which was being phased out this year, will be back for the foreseeable future.

“With all that love, how could we 86 the V8?” Broderdorf said. “Jeep fans, don't worry, the 6.4-liter Hemi V8 will have a home at Jeep. We will extend the availability of the 392 on Wrangler, and in fact, we will tap the power and performance of the Hemi across Jeep products, as new projects are already under way.”

He promised more powertrain options in the future and more horsepower and specifically mentioned Gladiator, which currently has a 285-hp Pentastar V6. Whether Jeep plans to wring out more juice from the Pentastar or add a Hemi is unclear, based on Broderdorf’s comments.

“So, Wrangler and Gladiator fans, and Hemi fans in general, don’t worry. We got you.”

As for Jeep sales, well, the tide hasn’t turned that quickly. Although Broderdorf claimed 4% growth in first-half US deliveries, the automaker’s own sales data shows a 5% decline, although 1% growth in just the second quarter.

Growing sales in the first half were the Compass (54,834 units), Wrangler (85,613), Gladiator (25,400), and the all-electric Wagoneer S (6,263). But losing sales in the first half was Grand Cherokee (99,668), and the biggest losers—each down at least 54%—were Wagoneer (13,616) and Grand Wagoneer (3,156).

Visiting Ford's Louisville Assembly Plant (LAP) on Monday, Ford President & CEO Jim Farley revealed the automaker's plan to build a new affordable, all-electric vehicle at LAP.

It'll be a mid-size pickup truck set to launch in 2027, with a starting price tag of $30,000.

""We're doing so many new things... I can't tell you with 100% uncertainty that this will all go just right. It is a bet. There is risk,"" Farley said in front of thousands of LAP workers.

It comes as demand for EVs has slowed and those popular tax credits for consumers are going away soon because of President Trump's Big Beautiful Bill.

Ford believes the key for a competitive and profitable ""universal electric vehicle"" model is to completely change how they build these vehicles.

Ford is radically changing the traditional assembly line, calling this version a tree formation to make the whole process quicker and more cost effective, using automation and AI.

""Well, that's why we did all the innovation,"" Farley told WHAS11, when asked how they'll keep the price around $30,000. ""30% less parts, 40% less time and assembly -- it's just a radical approach. It was required to keep the vehicle.""

LAP is set to close later this year for several months in order to retool the inside of the facility to accommodate the production of the new EV pickup.

To save on costs, Ford is also planning to use smaller, lithium iron phosphate (LFP) prismatic batteries which will be made at a plant in Michigan, set to receive $3 billion in investment through this same initiative.

Ford says this investment secures the jobs of 2,200 hourly workers at LAP. There are nearly 3,000 of them right now, raising the question, will they all keep their jobs moving forward?

""It'll definitely reduce the number of employees when it comes to building the vehicle,"" said Todd Dunn, President of the Louisville chapter of the UAW.

Dunn says layoffs will likely depend on the volume of future EV production. Ford is also offering buyouts to some LAP workers ahead of this shift.

""We have plenty of jobs for everyone,"" Farley guaranteed, when pressed about whether jobs will be cut.

Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear told WHAS11 that with the number of Ford operations across Kentucky, ""There are going to be lots of opportunities for each and all of these workers.""

Penny Rowe has worked at LAP for 26 years. She says change is good, and if this new system means less of a physical toll taken on workers’ bodies, that’s a win.

“I hope it changes the morale, you know, because everybody's been sitting back trying to figure out what we're getting, if we're getting anything,"" Rowe told reporters.

Farley joined other auto executives and Kentucky leaders to introduce the new Ford Universal EV Production System and Ford Universal EV Platform at LAP to ""prepare for its next generation of EVs.""

The Ford Universal EV Production System is supposed to simplify production and ease operations within LAP, while the Ford Universal Electric Vehicle Platform will allow for a family of affordable vehicles that are electric and are “truly software-defined,” according to Ford officials.

""The automotive industry in America is at a crossroads, we're at a crossroads about new technology and about new competition from everywhere,"" Farley said in front of the crowd at LAP.

“The Trump administration and EPA’s unlawful and authoritarian move to unilaterally strip EPA workers of their collective bargaining agreement and workplace rights is nothing short of an assault on our democracy, the rule of law, and the lives of working people in America,” AFGE Council 238 President Justin Chen said.

“When you strip the rights of EPA workers, you weaken the EPA’s ability to do its job and ensure Americans can drink clean water and breathe clean air – and that’s exactly what Trump, [EPA Administrator Lee] Zeldin, and their billionaire supporters want,” Chen said.

EPA’s action follows a similar move by the Department of Veterans Affairs to revoke its negotiated contracts with AFGE and other labor unions – and other agencies are expected to follow suit.

Both EPA and the VA cited Executive Order 14251 as the grounds for terminating our master collective bargaining agreements. But AFGE and other labor unions are challenging the executive order in court, and the administration’s own guidance from the Office of Personnel Management instructs agencies “not to terminate any CBAs until the conclusion of litigation.” Administration officials also have stated in court recently that union contracts were not being terminated.

“Make no mistake, this move isn’t about government efficiency or national security. It’s about silencing workers and clearing the way for more deregulation so corporate polluters can have free reign. These are the same industries that bankrolled Trump’s campaign and now stand to profit while Americans pay the price with their health and with our environment,” Chen said.

U.S. electricity demand is expected to grow by almost 16% over the next 5 years, a massive increase from the 2001 and 2024 period, when the U.S. electricity consumption grew 0.5% annually.
A NERA analysis found that customers in some states may see their energy bills rise as much as 30% by 2029.
Purposefully levying higher electricity bills on every consumer by investing in outdated energy sources with higher costs, while systematically undermining the cheaper alternatives, is a scam.
Americans everywhere just got scammed on their electricity bills.","At a campaign rally in August 2024, then-candidate President Donald Trump promised that “under my administration, we will be slashing energy and electricity prices by half within 12 months.”

But six months into President Trump’s second term, he signed the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA), which thoroughly and systematically undermines future clean energy projects and risks hundreds of billions in investments that have already been made in the sector. With this, energy and electricity prices are going to explode.

The bill significantly rolls back clean energy tax credits expanded under the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), which supported energy sources needed to meet growing demand while helping Americans save on their energy bills. Before this bill, the IRA was set to grow the U.S. economy by $1.9 trillion, create 13.7 million jobs over ten years, and add $846 billion to household income. The new law, which targets energy sources like solar PV and wind that were poised to meet demand, is coupled with a national energy strategy that demands investment in nonrenewable energy sources that are actually more expensive for consumers. Americans’ electricity bills will reflect this double punch.

The bill imposes particularly harsh credit phaseouts on solar and wind projects and implements new rules about the origin of material components across the clean technology sector. It directly targets a booming industry that would help the U.S. meet its growing electricity needs. Without them, the U.S. will not be prepared for increasing demand.

Between January and April of this year, 96% of new utility-scale electricity generating capacity was from solar and wind, and a January report predicted that solar would drive U.S. power generation over the next two years. If the Administration and Congressional Republicans had allowed pre-existing funding and investments in renewables to come to fruition, we would be far more prepared to meet exploding electricity demand.

U.S. electricity demand is expected to grow by almost 16% over the next 5 years, a massive increase from the 2001 and 2024 period, when the U.S. electricity consumption grew 0.5% annually. Increasing demand is driven by growth in large data centers used to power artificial intelligence, reshoring of industry, and broad-based electrification.

Even without the new law, residential electricity rates were set to rise 15% to 40% by 2030 and double by 2050. When demand rises, so do electricity prices as more expensive generation sources are turned on to meet the increased load, a cost that is passed to consumers. The grid needs to be adding an estimated 80 GW of capacity annually over the next 20 years to meet demand, but the new law is already set to kill 81 gigawatts of potential new generation capacity through 2033. Through the rapid phaseout of IRA tax credits, the bill will impact electricity customers in every state. A NERA analysis found that customers in some states may see their energy bills rise as much as 30% by 2029.

The evidence is clear: phasing out credits that have already supported clean and cheap electricity generation will raise customer utility bills, on top of the increase in bills already expected from growing demand.

The White House plans to meet growing demand by doubling down on fossil fuels. The National Energy Dominance Council, which was formed this year, includes oil, gas, pipeline, mining, critical minerals, electric grid, and coal experts, but no solar experts. They plan to keep aging fossil-fueled power plants online past scheduled closures, even when grid operators, utilities, and state public utility commissions disagree. Fossil-fueled generation has higher operating and maintenance costs, which utilities will shift to consumers. This is already happening in Montana, where utility NorthWestern Energy increased consumer electricity rates by $204 a year without review in order to cover costs largely related to the construction of a new natural gas plant.

Energy will need to come from somewhere, and solar PV and wind are the cheapest options for new generation. They also have lower operating costs than fossil fuel alternatives, but the Republican energy agenda excludes these sources.

The people who will pay for this new energy strategy are Americans just trying to keep their lights on, literally. Purposefully levying higher electricity bills on every consumer by investing in outdated energy sources with higher costs, while systematically undermining the cheaper alternatives, is a scam.

Get up to $4,000 for a qualifying pre-owned EV if you’re a married couple filing jointly and make less than $150,000 or $75,000 for single filers.

You can also get a discount of up to $7,500 on a leased EV directly from an auto dealer that claims the Commercial Clean Vehicle Credit and passes the savings on to you.

You can get up to $1,000 back when you install qualifying EV charging equipment on a property that meets requirements. The credit is available until June 30, 2026.

Home Energy Upgrades

The Energy-Efficient Home Improvement Credit (25C) offers tax incentives for energy audits, heat pumps, insulation, and more. It expires on December 31, 2025. The project must be complete by then! Previously, a filer could claim this benefit every year, but now is your last chance.

You could use this credit to get an energy audit of your home to identify the most effective places to upgrade your home.

Purchase and install a qualifying heat pump for space heating/cooling or a heat pump water heater to get up to $2,000 off your federal taxes.

Upgrade insulation or better sealing windows and/or exterior doors and get an additional $1,200 back on your taxes.

You can also use the Residential Clean Energy Credit (25D) to get up to 30% of the project for rooftop solar, home battery storage, geothermal heat pumps, etc., back on your taxes.

Key highlights:

Stricter foreign entity requirements and sourcing rules — The OBBBA imposes stricter requirements for foreign entity and sourcing, especially targeting Chinese involvement, which significantly impacts clean energy project eligibility for tax credits.

New compliance requirements for buyers — Developers and tax credit buyers must carefully comply with new documentation, supply chain, and ownership requirements to avoid disqualification or recapture of credits.

Early planning is essential — Accelerated deadlines for wind and solar projects, along with ongoing uncertainty about compliance standards, make early and thorough planning essential for success.

The One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA), which passed in early July, represents a major shift from the industrial and energy policies set out in 2022’s Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). For example, the OBBBA makes significant changes to the tax credits available for eligible clean energy components and facilities, while increasing support for fossil fuels.

The legislation also introduced tougher foreign entities of concern (FEOC) requirements that, while also applicable to Russia, North Korea, and Iran, will primarily restrict the participation in the US clean energy sector (whether as owner, investor, lender, or supplier) by companies owned or controlled by the Chinese government or its citizens and residents. These restrictions present significant challenges for developers given China’s dominance in the clean energy supply chain.

OBBBA’s changes to clean energy credits

The OBBBA introduces several important revisions to federal clean energy tax credits, which, as part of the IRA, had been reshaping the landscape for developers and investors in the clean energy sector. The OBBBA’s revisions include:

Stricter FEOC requirements — Clean energy tax credits are not available to any project owned by a specified foreign entity (SFE) or a foreign-influenced entity (FIE), over which an SFE has effective control, or, in some cases, that receives material assistance from an SFE or FIE. The material assistance requirement is intended to limit sourcing of equipment, components, and critical minerals from China and applies to credits under Sections 45X, 45Y, and 48E of the IRA.

Accelerated deadlines for project credit qualification — The OBBBA shortened the deadlines for several types of clean energy projects, but especially for wind and solar projects, which must begin construction by July 4, 2026, or failing that, be placed in service by December 31, 2027. These tight deadlines — coupled with potential changes to the requirements for beginning construction that are expected after an executive order issued on July 7, 2025 — raised significant planning issues for project developers and investors in the US clean energy sector.

No changes in other areas of clean energy — The tax credits for other clean energy technologies — such as battery storage, geothermal, and nuclear — were largely left unchanged. But these projects are also subject to the more stringent FEOC regulations.

You can find more information on the OBBA from Thomson Reuters Practical Law here

Continuation of key IRA innovations

The IRA introduced two new provisions that have had a material impact on clean energy project development. Bonus credits increased the amount of tax credit available to qualifying projects by 10% or 20%. This includes an energy community bonus for locating a project in communities affected by coal mine or coal plant closures.

The other was the ability to sell tax credits to unrelated parties for cash (known as transferability), which gave project owners a new and less expensive method to monetize their clean energy tax credits than traditional tax equity.

The OBBBA didn’t alter the bonus credits and producers of clean energy projects can still qualify for bonus credits if they fulfill certain conditions. It did, however, extend the energy community bonus to advanced nuclear energy facilities located in certain communities.

Transferability remains, but with FEOC restrictions. Projects subject to the new FEOC restrictions are disqualified from receiving tax credits, potentially limiting the supply of tax credits in the market. The new material assistance requirements also add a layer of complexity that buyers of tax credits subject to these requirements must consider.

You can read more on transferability under the IRA from Thomson Reuters Practical Law here

Guidance for project developers

Going forward, project developers will need to navigate complex new laws and regulations regarding FEOCs and what it means to begin construction for wind and solar projects. To avoid credit disqualification and manage compliance risk, project developers should keep detailed records to demonstrate compliance with the FEOC ownership and establish effective control requirements.

Project developers also should audit their supply contracts and carefully track the source and costs of their equipment and other inputs to ensure compliance with applicable material-assistance caps. Similarly, they need to insert robust FEOC provisions in their supply, operation & maintenance, and construction agreements to ensure continued compliance with these requirements.

Regarding their wind and solar projects, project developers need to check their project development pipelines to determine whether they can meet the new deadlines. Unfortunately, developers are in a tough spot at the moment because they are not able to determine with any certainty the activities that may be sufficient to meet this requirement until the new guidance around beginning construction is issued. In the interim, developers should make sure that any actions they take toward construction are meaningful and not intended to manipulate this requirement, although there is no guarantee that action will prove sufficient.

Guidance for tax credit buyers

Buyers of tax credits must take action — such as conducting more extensive due diligence — to ensure the purchased credits are not disqualified or, in certain cases, recaptured, and that the credits deliver on the intended financial benefit. Buyers also should obtain detailed documentation from tax credit sellers to verify there is no direct or indirect ownership or effective control by FEOCs and to confirm that the project or component underlying the credit has not received material assistance from FEOCs in excess of the permitted caps.

Tax credit buyers should also consider inserting FEOC-specific provisions in their tax credit transfer agreements, including:

adding specific representations around FEOC compliance, sourcing of materials, and eligibility under the OBBBA;

expanding the seller’s indemnification provisions to include losses incurred if the purchased credits are later disallowed due to FEOC or sourcing violations; and

requiring sellers to promptly notify them of any changes in the sellers’ FEOC status or supply chain arrangements that could affect credit eligibility. More expansive tax credit insurance policies may also be obtained to mitigate the additional risks the FEOC restrictions present.

Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear and Ford CEO Jim Farley announced Monday morning a nearly $2 billion commitment to the manufacturing process at the Louisville Assembly Plant for a new electric mid-size pickup truck.

It’s the third-largest economic development project in Kentucky history. It adds no new jobs, but officials say it secures the 2,200 current jobs at the plant.

The Kentucky Economic Development Finance Authority on Monday also approved an additional project to the current Kentucky Jobs Retention Act that could give Ford up to $550 million in tax incentives that span the company’s overall $5.55 billion investments in Kentucky. The incentives come with a job target requirement of 12,000 over the terms of the agreement.

“This announcement not only represents one of the largest investments on record in our state, it also boosts Kentucky’s position at the center of EV-related innovation and solidifies Louisville Assembly Plant as an important part of Ford’s future,” Beshear said in a statement. “Ford and Kentucky have been a tremendous team for more than 100 years, and that partnership has never been stronger than it is today.”

The announcement comes after the Trump administration recently pushed or signed into law federal legislation that ends tax credits of up to $7,500 on Sept. 30 for buying electric vehicles. Trump also froze funding for building high-speed electric vehicle chargers across the country and ended a credit to businesses and individuals for installing chargers.

In Louisville, Ford plans to spend $1.9 billion on new equipment and technology to modernize the plant, which includes a new production platform the company says is a major manufacturing breakthrough.

The new, low-cost, scalable electric vehicle platform should be ready by the second quarter of 2027, officials said.

“We are grateful to the Kentucky Economic Development Finance Authority for its support as we build upon Ford’s proud legacy of investment in Kentucky,” said Tony Reinhart, Ford director of state and local government affairs. “We look forward to assembling another signature Ford vehicle in Kentucky to serve customers across the U.S. and beyond.”

According to an independent analysis by the Boston Consulting Group, Ford supports about 120,000 direct and indirect jobs across Kentucky and contributes more than $11.8 billion to the state’s gross domestic product, including more than 48,000 jobs in the Louisville region.",https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/thecentersquare.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/5/6d/56dedfe7-e576-4192-9faf-9175c6418781/686d65b537439.image.jpg,N,,2025-08-11 23:02:37.160891

Interior Secretary Doug Burgum ordered a review of permits that allow wind companies to incidentally harm eagles and suggested possible criminal prosecutions.

At the same time, the administration has rolled back parts of the Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act, the Endangered Species Act, and the Migratory Bird Treaty Act, often benefiting fossil fuel producers.

Federal data shows wind power kills far fewer birds than oil pits, power lines, buildings, or domestic cats, and scientists warn climate change poses the greater long-term threat to birds.

Key quote:

“All of the concern for eagles is concentrated solely on wind right now.”

— Sarah Krakoff, professor of environmental law, University of Colorado, Boulder

Why this matters:

Bald eagles are one of the most visible symbols of American wildlife, and their rebound from near extinction is often cited as a major conservation success. But their survival remains tied to environmental safeguards that limit industrial impacts, from toxic lead to habitat destruction. Energy policy decisions that selectively enforce wildlife protections can skew public perception about the real sources of harm and shift the regulatory burden away from larger threats. If political battles over energy sources obscure scientific evidence, wildlife protections risk becoming tools of partisan agendas rather than consistent safeguards for species survival.

In short:

Wesley Ingwersen’s U.S. Environmentally-Extended Input-Output, or USEEIO, model — a top federal dataset used by companies to calculate supply chain emissions — will remain public but will no longer be updated by the EPA.

Ingwersen, suspended for joining an open letter accusing the administration of undermining EPA’s mission, is leaving for Stanford University, where a consortium will keep the database free and updated.

Critics warn that moving such research to the private sector could reduce credibility, while some companies rely on the data to comply with upcoming European Union and California reporting rules.

Key quote:

“Moving data to the private sector with private motivations such as profit, power, market share or competitive advantage makes the data less trustworthy and therefore less valuable.”

— Paul Anastas, former EPA assistant administrator for research and development

Why this matters:

Reliable greenhouse gas emissions data underpins corporate climate reporting, environmental regulation, and public understanding of the carbon footprint of goods and services. When such information is left to private stewardship, transparency can be harder to guarantee and trust can erode — especially when profit or competitive advantage enters the equation. Losing government-backed updates could create gaps in how accurately companies measure and reduce pollution, particularly as jurisdictions like California and the European Union expand mandatory reporting.

In short:

Gov. Josh Stein urged DHS Secretary Kristi L. Noem to release $115 million in Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) public assistance grants for about 100 projects, including debris removal, wastewater repairs, and bridge reconstruction.

FEMA has provided $1.36 billion in aid since Helene, but a new DHS policy requiring Noem’s personal approval for expenses over $100,000 has slowed disbursements, with FEMA’s monthly aid to North Carolina dropping from $40 million to $6.5 million.

Rural counties have spent millions from their own budgets, expecting rapid federal reimbursement, but now face financial strain that threatens basic services like paying first responders and maintaining waste collection.

Key quote:

“Cash-strapped local governments in western North Carolina need this money as soon as possible to keep essential services going, whether that is continuing recovery operations, paying first responders and teachers, or picking up trash.”

— Josh Stein, governor of North Carolina

Why this matters:

When disaster recovery funds are delayed, communities already reeling from storms can face a cascade of new crises. Small and rural towns often front the costs for cleanup, infrastructure repair, and emergency services, betting on timely federal reimbursement. Without it, budgets shrink, services falter, and recovery stalls — sometimes for years. Prolonged gaps in aid also deepen public mistrust in government disaster response, a problem compounded when climate change drives more frequent and severe storms. As hurricane seasons grow longer and more destructive, bottlenecks in disaster funding mean damaged roads, unsafe drinking water, and unstable housing remain part of daily life, with health, safety, and economic stability hanging in the balance.

In short:

The Trump administration ruled that orphaned well cleanup grants are not subject to the Endangered Species Act or National Historic Preservation Act, removing a step states had previously been required to take.

Legal experts question the decision’s basis, warning states could face lawsuits if federally funded projects harm endangered species without protective permits.

States with large numbers of abandoned wells, including Texas and Pennsylvania, welcomed the change, citing faster work and fewer administrative delays.

Key quote:

“Starting a reckless race to plug oil and gas wells at the expense of endangered species and historic sites only adds insult to injury. A better approach is making sure these companies pay to quickly and responsibly clean up the messes they created so Americans don’t get stuck with the bill.”

— Hollin Kretzmann, senior attorney at the Center for Biological Diversity

Why this matters:

Orphaned oil and gas wells are a major source of methane emissions, leaking a potent greenhouse gas linked to climate change. They can also contaminate groundwater and soil, posing long-term health and environmental risks to surrounding communities. Removing environmental and historic preservation reviews may allow faster plugging, but it also reduces oversight intended to protect wildlife habitats and cultural landmarks. With hundreds of thousands of wells already documented — and potentially a million more undiscovered — the scale of the cleanup effort is vast. Decisions about how to balance speed with safeguards will shape not only climate and conservation outcomes, but also the financial and legal liabilities borne by states and taxpayers.

In short:

Dominion says the Chesterfield Energy Reliability Center is essential to meet peak power demands, with energy use in Virginia projected to double by the late 2030s.

Environmental advocates argue the project violates the spirit of the Virginia Clean Economy Act and should be replaced with solar, wind, and battery storage.

DEQ’s analysis shows emissions would be lower than the coal plant it replaces, but residents say any additional pollution threatens recent air quality gains.

Key quote:

“This plant is dirty and expensive. No two ways about it. Burning methane is bad for our health.”

— Rachel James, attorney for the Southern Environmental Law Center

Why this matters:

Peaker plants, designed to run during extreme heat or cold, can be major sources of short-term but intense air pollution, releasing fine particulate matter and other contaminants linked to respiratory and cardiovascular disease. Building them in or near low-income communities and communities of color raises environmental justice concerns, as these neighborhoods often face higher baseline pollution and poorer health outcomes. While natural gas produces fewer emissions than coal, methane — the main component — has potent climate-warming effects. The debate over Chesterfield reflects a larger national tension: balancing rapidly rising electricity demand with climate goals, and deciding whether short-term reliability should be met with fossil fuels or accelerated investment in renewables and storage.

In short:

The Bureau of Land Management proposes rescinding safeguards for key Arctic habitats, opening 82% of the 23-million-acre reserve to oil and gas development.

Alaska Native leaders say the rollback disregards decades of work to protect areas critical for wildlife and subsistence, warning of worsening health and environmental damage.

Scientists cite threats to caribou migration, polar bear denning, and permafrost stability, along with long-term oil production timelines stretching into the 2050s and beyond.

Key quote:

“To have all the work we’ve done for the last two decades, trying to create important special areas with their unique biological features demonstrated by science, disregarded to allow full-force development is crazy to consider.”

— Rosemary Ahtuangaruak, activist and former mayor of Nuiqsut, Alaska

Why this matters:

The Alaskan Arctic is warming nearly four times faster than the global average, making it one of the most climate-sensitive regions on the planet. The National Petroleum Reserve–Alaska serves as a critical habitat for migratory birds, caribou, and polar bears, while also supporting subsistence traditions that sustain Indigenous communities. Expanding oil drilling here could lock in fossil fuel production for decades, increasing greenhouse gas emissions well past the period when scientists say reductions are needed to avert catastrophic climate impacts. Industrialization also threatens permafrost integrity, which, once thawed, releases vast amounts of carbon and destabilizes land and infrastructure.

In short:

The Trump administration and Congress repealed three major waivers under the Clean Air Act that allowed California to set tougher vehicle and truck emission standards than what was required under federal law.

Gov. Gavin Newsom has ordered agencies to develop new actions to promote affordable zero-emission vehicles without relying on federal approval.

Experts warn the policy shift could slow U.S. electric vehicle growth, ceding market leadership to China, and worsen air pollution in California, which has some of the nation’s worst air quality.

Key quote:

“The governor and the legislature should understand that their people need to breathe clean air, and that auto pollution is the worst contributor to the polluted air in California.”

— Dan Becker, director of the Safe Climate Transport Campaign at the Center for Biological Diversity

Why this matters:

Air pollution remains one of the most persistent environmental health threats in the United States, contributing to asthma, heart disease, lung cancer, and premature deaths. California’s geography and heavy traffic make it particularly vulnerable, trapping pollutants in valleys and urban basins. Vehicle emissions are a leading source of smog-forming chemicals and fine particles, which disproportionately harm low-income communities located near highways and freight corridors. Rolling back state-level emission standards could prolong exposure to these pollutants, increasing the public health burden and straining healthcare systems. The stakes extend beyond California, as its clean vehicle policies have historically set the pace for national standards and influenced global markets.

NBAA recently joined with three other associations to voice the business aviation community’s strong support for comments submitted by the Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) Coalition on proposed revisions to U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) renewable fuels standards and policies to enhance production, investment and market opportunities for SAF in the U.S.

In an Aug. 8 letter to EPA Secretary Lee Zeldin, stakeholders emphasized the need to prioritize SAF development pathways and production as part of the agency’s Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) Program Standards for 2026 and 2027 and in other related programs.

“The business aviation sector is an incubator for American innovation, securing U.S. global aviation leadership while propelling industry commitment to improved efficiency,” the letter stated. “The business aviation industry has continually invested in the development of innovative products, procedures, and policies, including development and proliferation of [SAF].”

Stewart D’Leon, CAM, NBAA director of environmental and technical operations, cited the groups’ support to “correct the structural disadvantage” between production of renewable jet fuel and renewable diesel. The EPA has proposed assigning both fuels a renewable identification number equivalence of 1.6 to incentivize greater production capacity for SAF.

“This is another mechanism by which our industry can signal to producers that we want more SAF,” he added. “It places these opportunities on the same playing field.”

With new SAF production facilities due to come online soon, signatories also encouraged the EPA and the Trump administration to stimulate additional, private sector investment in renewable fuels production; embrace additional feedstocks, consistent with the Section 45Z Clean Fuel Production Credit; and removing bureaucratic barriers to incentivize domestic SAF production.

“SAF is an American innovation benefiting U.S. farmers, fuel producers, and communities across the nation,” the letter continued. “American innovators in our private sector have developed novel ways to convert crops, plants, biomass, captured gases, waste, and even recycled cooking oil into jet fuel. Combining conventional jet fuel with SAF allows America’s aviation industry to meet growing demand, enhance domestic energy security, and create market opportunities for American industries.”

The letter further supports the SAF Coalition’s recommendations to create pathways for renewable jet fuel derived from corn ethanol and renewable biomass, biogenic gases and other gases of non-biological origin, and other measures to stimulate SAF production.

“This letter demonstrates how the entire aviation community has come together to support this technology,” D’Leon added. “These suggestions are another avenue toward helping to mainstream this fuel and to achieve our industry’s goal of net-zero carbon emissions by 2050.”

IRVINE, Calif, Aug. 11, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Following a preview of its exterior design earlier this spring, the MY2027 Karma Amaris will be fully-revealed including its interior cabin during Monterey Car Week at The Quail, A Motorsports Gathering, on Friday, August 15; and Sunday, August 17, when Amaris will grace the famed Concept Lawn at the 74th Pebble Beach Concours d'Elegance.

As the world's first Hybrid EREV performance luxury coupé, Amaris fully delivers the exceptional driving dynamics and sheer speed promised by its purposeful stance and dramatic proportions. Packing 708 horsepower and 676 ft. lbs. torque, Amaris will launch from 0-60mph in less than 3.5 seconds, continuing-on to an electronically governed top speed of 165mph. Its Hybrid EREV powertrain consists of two electric motors driving the rear wheels, powered by a 41.5 kw/H battery which is maintained by a 4-Cylinder turbocharged ICE generator. This Hybrid EREV powertrain delivers over 100 miles of electric-only driving range, and over 400 miles of combined driving range (electric and ICE).

Amaris begins production in Q4/2026, and will be priced from approximately $200,000USD.

""Amaris delivers all the joys and indulgences of a thoroughbred performance coupe – staggering pace, exuberant style and opulent interior appointments – balanced with an ultra-low emissions Hybrid EREV powertrain which offers the freedom to refuel with gasoline or recharge with electricity, whichever is more convenient,"" says Marques McCammon, President and Chief Executive, Karma Automotive. ""Amaris delivers pure desire paired with eco-conscious driving like no other vehicle in the world.""

The powerful yet timelessly elegant carbon fiber and aluminum body of the Amaris, specified for Monterey Car Week in Solar Blaze Red paintwork, features the latest evolution of the Comet Line design language first established with the upcoming Karma Kaveya super-coupe. With Amaris, the Comet Line originates in the sculpted cowl aft of the nose, continuing rearward in an arc across the sides of the hood, descending rearward to amplify the wide, aggressive rear track. 22"" Constellation wheels, crafted in forged aluminum, fully-establish the purposeful, fluid stance of the Amaris. The voluptuous clamshell hood – incorporating Karma's Target Lighting signature – creates a seamless transition and visual flow to the front fenders. The Backslash design element punctuates the space between the front wheels and the ""swan doors,"" which gracefully pivot upwards to dramatic effect. Its sleek rear glass profile concludes with an aero pass-through spoiler that reduces aerodynamic drag while creating rear axle downforce for increased stability at high speeds. The Americana-inspired side exhaust further signals performance and capability.

Inside, the cabin of the Amaris is specified in Crimson Orbit leather and suede, with carbon fiber and piano black accents. Like the Kaveya super-coupe, Amaris features an electro-chromatically adjustable full glass roof; and ""orbits"" which visually define the driver and passenger environments. Amaris is shown in its 2-seater configuration, with its rear compartment sculpted to accommodate travel bags.

Carbon fiber adorns the doors, center console and rear support brace, creating the visual effect of an exposed carbon fiber monocoque with floating leather and suede panels. The door panel forms are drawn forward, descending from shoulder height towards the footwells, creating a sense of speed and acceleration. This same dynamic effect applies to the center console, which houses the gear selector and—concealed beneath a hinged leather ignition cover to further heighten anticipation for the driving experience ahead—the ""Start"" button.

Following Karma Automotive's ""reductionary"" approach, non-essential features remain hidden until called upon, including the co-pilot's display which illuminates once the passenger is seated; and cupholders that are concealed by the wireless phone charger until it is retracted with a gentle touch. The interior environment also hides atmospheric lighting that can be adjusted by the user, or changes according to the drive mode selected.

Our new zonal electric architecture unlocks capabilities the industry has never seen. This isn’t a strippeddown, oldschool vehicle.”

Ford will not be relying on a traditional assembly line to built the electric vehicle truck, but instead has established its Ford Universal EV Production System or what it refers to as an ""assembly tree,"" consisting of ""three sub-assemblies run down their own lines simultaneously and then join together.""

Through this approach Ford said that their electric vehicles could be produced at a rate 40% faster than other vehicles.

“We have all lived through far too many ‘good college tries’ by Detroit automakers to make affordable vehicles that ends up with idled plants, layoffs and uncertainty. So, this had to be a strong, sustainable and profitable business,"" Farley said. ""From Day 1, we knew there was no incremental path to success. We empowered a tiny skunkworks team three time zones away from Detroit. We tore up the moving assembly line concept and designed a better one. And we found a path to be the first automaker to make prismatic LFP batteries in the U.S.”

Key excerpts from the letter:

“The Committee is concerned about reports that California, and other jurisdictions who have adopted California standards for which waivers of preemption have been granted, are enforcing preempted vehicle emission regulations in violation of the Clean Air Act.”

“The Committee has been made aware that CARB staff is denying auto manufacturers approval to bring vehicles to market unless the manufacturers agree to comply with the preempted regulations.”

Background:

On June 12, 2025, President Trump signed three resolutions of disapproval under the Congressional Review Act. H.J. Res. 87, H.J. Res. 88, and H.J. Res 89, which collectively disapproved California’s waiver of preemption allowing the state to impose emission standards that effectively ban the sale of new gas-powered vehicles. The CRA’s passed Congress with bipartisan support.

The Clean Air Act clearly bans states from issuing their own emission standards unless EPA grants a waiver of federal preemption. Because the EPA’s waivers have been disapproved under the CRA, the California EV mandates are not allowed under the Clean Air Act.

Despite three Congressional Review Act (CRA) resolutions being signed into law this year that block California from implementing vehicle standards that ban the sale of gas-powered cars and trucks through its Advanced Clean Cars (ACC) II regulations, Advanced Clean Trucks (ACT) regulations, and Omnibus Low NOx programs (the Omnibus) regulations, Committee staff have learned that California and other states are continuing to implement the preempted rules. Specifically, following formal disapproval of previously granted waivers due to the CRAs, California is reportedly refusing to certify automobiles that don’t meet the now-preempted standards, contrary to federal law, i.e., the Clean Air Act.",https://d1dth6e84htgma.cloudfront.net/ENERGY_AND_COMMERCE_SQUARE_LOGO_a093c47e5f.png,N,,2025-08-11 19:00:55.071822

The road ahead may be bumpy, but the destination—a stronger, self-sufficient U.S. auto sector—is worth the journey.","The U.S. auto industry is at a crossroads, reshaped by President Trump's aggressive tariff policies and a global supply chain in flux. While the 25% tariffs on imported vehicles and parts—enacted under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act—have sparked short-term volatility, they are catalyzing a strategic shift toward domestic production, supply chain resilience, and long-term investment opportunities. For investors, this is not just a policy experiment; it's a blueprint for reindustrialization.

The Tariff Framework: A Calculated Push for Reshoring

On March 26, 2025, Trump's Proclamation 10908 formalized a two-tiered approach: a 25% tariff on imported vehicles and parts, paired with an “import adjustment offset” to reward domestic production. This offset, which allows manufacturers to reduce duties based on the Manufacturer's Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) of U.S.-assembled vehicles, is a masterstroke. By linking tariff relief to domestic output, the policy incentivizes automakers to shift production to the U.S., even as it penalizes reliance on foreign components.

For example, the 3.75% offset in the first year (2025–2026) effectively subsidizes domestic assembly by offsetting 15% of MSRP-linked parts costs. This creates a financial incentive to localize supply chains, particularly for critical components like batteries and semiconductors. The result? A surge in reshoring commitments, such as Hyundai's $21 billion Georgia Metaplant, which aims to produce 750,000 electric vehicles annually by 2028.

Supply Chain Reconfigurations: Winners and Losers

The tariffs have forced automakers to reevaluate global sourcing strategies. While companies like General Motors and Ford face billions in added costs, the crisis has also accelerated opportunities in resilient sectors:

Steel and Aluminum Producers:

Domestic steelmakers like Nucor (NUE) and U.S. Steel (X) are thriving under the 50% tariff on foreign steel (25% for the UK). These firms are seeing increased demand as automakers prioritize local sourcing to avoid penalties.

USMCA-Compliant Supply Chains:

Companies such as Magna International (MGA) and Lear Corporation (LEA) are restructuring to meet U.S. content requirements under the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA). This positions them to dominate a tariff-protected market, with Magna's recent $1.2 billion investment in Michigan battery plants a case in point.

Critical Minerals and Tech Reshoring:

Tesla (TSLA) and others are accelerating domestic battery production, leveraging the Inflation Reduction Act's (IRA) tax credits. Tesla's $5 billion investment in a Nevada Gigafactory expansion, announced in June 2025, underscores the synergy between Trump's tariffs and the IRA's incentives.

Logistics and Digitalization: The New Frontiers

The tariffs have also created a surge in demand for agile logistics solutions. Companies like J.B. Hunt (JBT) and C.H. Robinson (CHRN) are capitalizing on nearshoring trends, while digitalization leaders such as DHL (DHLGY) are investing in AI-driven supply chain analytics. These firms are helping automakers navigate complex tariff regimes and optimize inventory management.

Strategic Investment Advice

For investors, the key is to balance short-term risks with long-term gains. Here's how to position your portfolio:

Long-Term Bets:

Steel and Aluminum Producers: NUE and X offer exposure to a sector directly benefiting from import barriers.

USMCA-Compliant Suppliers: MGA and LEA are well-positioned to capture market share as automakers prioritize compliance.

Critical Minerals: TSLA and Albemarle (ALB) are leading the charge in battery innovation, supported by IRA incentives.

Hedging Strategies:

Auto Manufacturers: Use options or ETFs like the iShares U.S. Auto Manufacturers ETF (IYM) to mitigate margin pressures from rising steel costs.

Logistics Providers: CHRN and JBT are strong candidates for diversification, given their role in managing reshoring logistics.

Digitalization Plays:

Invest in companies like DHLGY, which are integrating AI and blockchain to enhance supply chain transparency and efficiency.

Conclusion: A Resilient Future

Trump's tariffs are not just a policy tool—they're a catalyst for structural change. While the immediate costs are significant, the long-term benefits of a more resilient, domestically anchored auto industry are undeniable. For investors, this is a moment to align with the forces of reshoring, digitalization, and strategic resilience.

An overarching goal is to get data center developers to put their money where their mouth is.","HARRISBURG, Pa. — Amid rising electric bills, states are under pressure to insulate regular household and business ratepayers from the costs of feeding Big Tech’s energy-hungry data centers.

It’s not clear that any state has a solution and the actual effect of data centers on electricity bills is difficult to pin down. Some critics question whether states have the spine to take a hard line against tech behemoths like Microsoft, Google, Amazon and Meta.

But more than a dozen states have begun taking steps as data centers drive a rapid build-out of power plants and transmission lines.

That has meant pressuring the nation’s biggest power grid operator to clamp down on price increases, studying the effect of data centers on electricity bills or pushing data center owners to pay a larger share of local transmission costs.

Rising power bills are “something legislators have been hearing a lot about. It’s something we’ve been hearing a lot about. More people are speaking out at the public utility commission in the past year than I’ve ever seen before,” said Charlotte Shuff of the Oregon Citizens’ Utility Board, a consumer advocacy group. “There’s a massive outcry.”

Not the typical electric customer

Some data centers could require more electricity than cities the size of Pittsburgh, Cleveland or New Orleans, and make huge factories look tiny by comparison. That’s pushing policymakers to rethink a system that, historically, has spread transmission costs among classes of consumers that are proportional to electricity use.

“A lot of this infrastructure, billions of dollars of it, is being built just for a few customers and a few facilities and these happen to be the wealthiest companies in the world,” said Ari Peskoe, who directs the Electricity Law Initiative at Harvard University. “I think some of the fundamental assumptions behind all this just kind of breaks down.”

A fix, Peskoe said, is a “can of worms” that pits ratepayer classes against one another.

Some officials downplay the role of data centers in pushing up electric bills.

Tricia Pridemore, who sits on Georgia’s Public Service Commission and is president of the National Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners, pointed to an already tightened electricity supply and increasing costs for power lines, utility poles, transformers and generators as utilities replace aging equipment or harden it against extreme weather.

The data centers needed to accommodate the artificial intelligence boom are still in the regulatory planning stages, Pridemore said, and the Data Center Coalition, which represents Big Tech firms and data center developers, has said its members are committed to paying their fair share.

But growing evidence suggests that the electricity bills of some Americans are rising to subsidize the massive energy needs of Big Tech as the U.S. competes in a race against China for artificial intelligence superiority.

Data and analytics firm Wood Mackenzie published a report in recent weeks that suggested 20 proposed or effective specialized rates for data centers in 16 states it studied aren’t nearly enough to cover the cost of a new natural gas power plant.

In other words, unless utilities negotiate higher specialized rates, other ratepayer classes — residential, commercial and industrial — are likely paying for data center power needs.

Meanwhile, Monitoring Analytics, the independent market watchdog for the mid-Atlantic grid, produced research in June showing that 70% — or $9.3 billion — of last year’s increased electricity cost was the result of data center demand.

States are responding

Last year, five governors led by Pennsylvania’s Josh Shapiro began pushing back against power prices set by the mid-Atlantic grid operator, PJM Interconnection, after that amount spiked nearly sevenfold. They warned of customers “paying billions more than is necessary.”

PJM has yet to propose ways to guarantee that data centers pay their freight, but Monitoring Analytics is floating the idea that data centers should be required to procure their own power.

In a filing last month, it said that would avoid a “massive wealth transfer” from average people to tech companies.

At least a dozen states are eyeing ways to make data centers pay higher local transmission costs.

In Oregon, a data center hot spot, lawmakers passed legislation in June ordering state utility regulators to develop new — presumably higher — power rates for data centers.

The Oregon Citizens’ Utility Board says there is clear evidence that costs to serve data centers are being spread across all customers — at a time when some electric bills there are up 50% over the past four years and utilities are disconnecting more people than ever.

New Jersey’s governor signed legislation last month commissioning state utility regulators to study whether ratepayers are being hit with “unreasonable rate increases” to connect data centers and to develop a specialized rate to charge data centers.

In some other states, like Texas and Utah, governors and lawmakers are trying to avoid a supply-and-demand crisis that leaves ratepayers on the hook — or in the dark.

Doubts about states protecting ratepayers

In Indiana, state utility regulators approved a settlement between Indiana Michigan Power Co., Amazon, Google, Microsoft and consumer advocates that set parameters for data center payments for service.

Kerwin Olsen, of the Citizens Action Council of Indiana, a consumer advocacy group, signed the settlement and called it a “pretty good deal” that contained more consumer protections than what state lawmakers passed.

But, he said, state law doesn’t force large power users like data centers to publicly reveal their electric usage, so pinning down whether they’re paying their fair share of transmission costs “will be a challenge.”

In a March report, the Environmental and Energy Law Program at Harvard University questioned the motivation of utilities and regulators to shield ratepayers from footing the cost of electricity for data centers.

Both utilities and states have incentives to attract big customers like data centers, it said.

To do it, utilities — which must get their rates approved by regulators — can offer “special deals to favored customers” like a data center and effectively shift the costs of those discounts to regular ratepayers, the authors wrote. Many state laws can shield disclosure of those rates, they said.

In Pennsylvania, an emerging data center hot spot, the state utility commission is drafting a model rate structure for utilities to consider adopting. An overarching goal is to get data center developers to put their money where their mouth is.

“We’re talking about real transmission upgrades, potentially hundreds of millions of dollars,” commission chairman Stephen DeFrank said. “And that’s what you don’t want the ratepayer to get stuck paying for.”",https://finance-commerce.com/files/2025/08/Electric-Bills.jpg,N,,2025-08-11 18:06:20.006306

This Obama-era legal determination is the foundation of all federal climate regulations under the Clean Air Act (CAA). EPA’s claim that rescinding the Endangerment Finding will save Americans $54 billion annually by eliminating greenhouse gas (GHGs) standards, including electric vehicle mandates, is deeply shortsighted.

Rescinding the Endangerment Finding would:

Overturn virtually all climate regulation, eliminating the legal basis for controlling greenhouse gas emissions from vehicles, power plants, and oil and gas operations—protections that have collectively cut billions of tons of emissions.

Undermine states’ and citizens’ ability to hold polluters accountable, gutting legal safeguards for vulnerable animals, habitats, and communities, and stripping advocates of recourse in courts and federal agencies.

Accelerate biodiversity collapse and degrade the natural systems sustaining wildlife, as habitat loss, shifting climate zones, ocean acidification, and extreme weather push species closer to extinction each year.

According to EPA itself, transportation is the largest single contributor to GHGs in the United States, accounting for 28% of emissions. Globally, transportation accounts for 13.7% of emissions, with 12.1% from roadways.

The EPA’s proposal ignores overwhelming scientific evidence, including that 2024 was the first year with average global temperatures above 1.5°C —the critical limit set by the Paris Agreement to curb climate risks.It also ignores a March 2025 report by the Swiss Federal Institute of Aquatic Science and Technology and the University of Zurich, which confirms climate change as one of the top five human-driven causes of global biodiversity loss across all organisms and ecosystems.

Not to mention, an estimated one million species now face extinction, according to the most comprehensive global assessments. Meanwhile, over 85% of Earth’s wetlands and mangrove forests—vital carbon sinks and biodiversity hotspots—have been lost or severely degraded, worsening climate instability and ecological collapse.

When it comes to speeding up renewable energy deployment, there’s at least one big obstacle that governors have little control over.
About two-thirds of the stock sale will be used to continue financing Sunrise Wind, a 924-megawatt planned offshore wind project off the coast of Long Island, according to Morgan Stanley analysts.
All future lease sales for new offshore wind areas have been canceled.
BP had bought 50% stakes in three Equinor wind projects in 2020, but last year wrote down its investment in the offshore wind sector in the U.S. by over $1 billion.","Those that miss the end-of-year deadline will have another six months, until July 4, 2026, to start construction, but will have to meet complicated sourcing restrictions on materials from China. Any projects that get off the ground after that date will face a severely abbreviated schedule — they’ll have to be completed by the end of 2027 to qualify, an all-but-impossibly short construction timeline.

Adding even more urgency to the time crunch, President Trump has directed the Treasury Department to revise the rules that define what it means to “start construction.” Historically, a developer could start construction simply by purchasing key pieces of equipment. But Trump’s order called for “preventing the artificial acceleration or manipulation of eligibility and by restricting the use of broad safe harbors unless a substantial portion of a subject facility has been built,” an ominous sign for those racing to meet already accelerated deadlines.

While the changes won’t suppress adoption of these technologies entirely, they will slow deployment and make renewable energy more expensive than it otherwise would have been. Some states that have clean energy goals are trying to lock in as much subsidized generation as they can to lessen the blow.

There are two ways states can meet the moment, Justin Backal Balik, the state program director at the nonprofit Evergreen Action, told me. Right now, many are trying to address the immediate crisis by helping to usher shovel-ready projects through regulatory processes. But states should also be thinking about how to make projects more economical after the tax credits expire, Balik said. “Green states can play a role in tilting the scale slightly back in the direction of some of the projects being financially viable,” he said, “even understanding that they’re not going to be able to make up all of the lost ground the incentives provided.”

In the first category, Colorado Governor Jared Polis sent a letter last week to utilities and independent power producers in the state committing to use “all of the Colorado State Government to prioritize deployment of clean energy projects.”

“Getting this right is of critical importance to Colorado ratepayers,” Polis wrote. The nonprofit research group Energy Innovation estimates that household energy expenses in Colorado could be $170 higher in 2030 than they would have been because of OBBB, and $310 higher in 2035. “The goal is to integrate maximal clean energy by securing as much cost-effective electric generation under construction or placed in service as soon as possible, along with any necessary electricity balancing resources and supporting infrastructure,” Polis continued.

As for how he plans to do that, he said the state would work to “eliminate administrative barriers and bottlenecks” for renewable energy, promising faster state reviews for permits. It will also “facilitate the pre-purchase of project equipment,” since purchasing equipment is one of the key steps developers can take to meet the tax credit deadlines.

Other states are looking to quickly secure new contracts for renewable energy. In mid-July, two weeks after the reconciliation bill became law, utility regulators in Maine moved to rapidly procure nearly 1,600 gigawatt-hours of wind and solar — for context, that’s about 13% of the total energy the state currently generates. They gave developers just two weeks to submit proposals, and will prioritize projects sited on agricultural land that has been contaminated with per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, the chemicals known as PFAS. (When asked how many applications had been submitted, the Maine Public Utilities Commission said it doesn't share that information prior to project selection.)

Connecticut’s Department of Energy and Environmental Protection is eyeing a similar move. During a public webinar in late July, the agency said it was considering an accelerated procurement of zero-carbon resources “before the tax increase takes effect.” The office put out a request for information to renewable energy developers the next day to see if there were any projects ready to go that would qualify for the tax credits. Officials also encouraged developers to contact the agency’s concierge permit assistance services if they are worried about getting their permits on time for tax credit eligibility. Katie Dykes, the agency’s commissioner, said during the presentation that the concierge will engage with permit staff to make sure there aren’t incomplete or missing documents and to “ensure smooth and efficient review of projects.”

New York’s energy office is planning to do another round of procurement in September, the outlet New York Focus has reported, although the solicitation is late — it had originally been scheduled for June. The state has more than two dozen projects in the pipeline that are permitted but haven’t yet started construction, according to Focus, and some of them are waiting to secure contracts with the state.

Others are simply held up by the web of approvals New York requires, but better coordination between New York agencies may be in the works. “I assembled my team immediately and we are trying to do everything we can to expedite those [renewable energy projects] that are already in the pipeline to get those the approvals they need to move ahead,” Governor Kathy Hochul said during a rally at the State University of New York’s Niagara campus last week. The state’s energy research and development agency has formed a team “to help commercial projects quickly troubleshoot and advance towards construction,” according to the nonprofit Evergreen Action. (The agency did not respond to a request for more information about the effort.)

States and local governments are also planning to ramp up marketing of the consumer-based credits that are set to expire. Colorado, for example, launched a new “Energy Savings Navigator” tool to help residents identify all of the rebate, tax credit, and energy bill assistance programs they may be eligible for.

Consumers have even less time to act than wind and solar developers. Discounts for new, used, and leased electric vehicles will end in less than two months, on September 30. Homeowners must install solar panels, batteries, heat pumps, and any other clean energy or efficiency upgrades before the end of this year to qualify for tax credits.

Many states offer additional incentives for these technologies, and some are re-tooling their programs to stretch the funding. Connecticut saw a rush of demand for its electric vehicle rebate program, CHEAPR, after the OBBB passed. Officials decided to slash the subsidy from $1,500 to $500 as of August 1, and will re-assess the program in the fall. “The budget that we have for the CHEAPR program is finite,” Dykes said during the July webinar. “We are trying to be good stewards of those dollars in light of the extraordinary demand for EVs, so that after October 1 we have the best chance to be able to provide an enhanced rebate, to lessen the significant drop in the total level of incentives that are available for electric vehicles.”

As far as trying to address the longer-term challenges for renewables, Balik highlighted Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro’s proposal to streamline energy siting decisions by passing them through a new state board. “One of the big things states can do is siting reform because local opposition and lawsuits that drag forever are a big drag on costs,” Balik told me.

A bill that would create a Reliable Energy Siting and Electric Transition Board, or RESET Board, is currently in the Pennsylvania legislature. (New York State took similar steps to establish a renewable siting office to speed up deployment in 2020, though so far it’s still taking an average of three years to permit projects, down from four to five years prior to the office’s establishment.) Connecticut officials also discussed looking at ways to reduce the “soft costs” of permitting and environmental reviews during the July webinar.

Balik added that state green banks can also play a role in helping projects secure more favorable financing. Their capacity to do so will be significantly higher if the courts force the federal government to administer the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund.

When it comes to speeding up renewable energy deployment, there’s at least one big obstacle that governors have little control over. Wind and solar projects need approval from regional transmission operators, the independent bodies that oversee the transmission and distribution of power, to connect to the grid — a notoriously slow process. The lag is especially long in the PJM Interconnection, which governs the grid for 13 mid-Atlantic States, and has generally favored natural gas over renewables. But governors are starting to turn up the pressure on PJM to do better. In mid July, Shapiro and nine other governors demanded PJM give states more of a say in the process by allowing them to propose candidates for two of PJM’s board seats.

“Can we use this moment of crisis to really impress the urgency of getting some of these other things done — like siting reforms, like interconnection queue fixes, that are all part of the economics of projects,” Balik asked. These steps may help, but lengthy federal permitting processes remain a hurdle. While permitting reform is a major bipartisan priority in Congress, as my colleague Matthew Zeitlin wrote recently, a deal that’s good for renewables might require an about-face from the president on wind and solar.

Publicly traded companies do not typically raise money by selling stock, which is more expensive for the company, tending instead to finance specific projects or borrow money.

But the offshore wind business is not any industry.

In normal times, Orsted and other wind developers will conduct “farm-downs,” selling stakes in projects in order to help finance the next ones. Due to “recent material adverse development in the U.S. offshore wind market,” however, the early-morning announcement said, “it is not possible for the company to complete the planned partial divestment and associated non-recourse project financing of its Sunrise Wind offshore wind project on the terms which would provide the required strengthening of Orsted’s capital structure” — a long way of explaining that it can’t find a buyer at an acceptable price. Hence the new equity.

While the market had been expecting Orsted to raise capital in some form, the scale of the raise is about twice what was anticipated, according to Bloomberg’s Javier Blas.

About two-thirds of the stock sale will be used to continue financing Sunrise Wind, a 924-megawatt planned offshore wind project off the coast of Long Island, according to Morgan Stanley analysts. Construction began last summer, just days after Orsted took full ownership of the project by buying out a stake held by the utility Eversource.

Despite all the sound and fury around offshore wind in the United States, the company said in its earnings report, also released Monday, that “we successfully installed the first foundations at Sunrise Wind, following completion of the wind turbine foundation installation at Revolution Wind,” a 704-megawatt project off the coasts of Rhode Island and Connecticut. “Construction of our offshore U.S. assets is progressing as expected and according to plan,” the company said.

But the report also said Orsted took a hit of over a billion Danish kroner in the first half of this year due to tariffs and what it gingerly refers to as “other regulatory changes, particularly affecting the U.S.,” a.k.a. President Donald Trump.

The president and his appointees have been on a regulatory and financial campaign against the wind sector, especially offshore wind, attempting to halt work on another in-construction New York project, Empire Wind, before Governor Kathy Hochul was able to reach a deal to continue. All future lease sales for new offshore wind areas have been canceled.

Even before Trump came back into office, the offshore wind industry in the U.S. had been hammered by high interest rates, which raised the cost of borrowed money necessary to fund projects, and spiraling supply chain costs and project delays, which also increased the need for the more expensive financing.

“Because of the sharp rise in construction costs and interest rates since 2021, all the projects turned out to be value-destructive,” Morningstar analyst Tancrede Fulop wrote in a note about the Orsted share issue. The company took large losses on scuttled projects in the U.S. and already cancelled its dividend and announced a plan to partially divest many other projects in order to shore up its balance sheet and fund future projects.

While the start-and-stop Empire Wind project belongs to Equinor, Orsted’s Scandinavian neighbor (majority-owned by the Norwegian government), Orsted management told analysts on its conference call that “the issues surrounding Empire Wind's stop-work order from April 2025 had negatively impacted financing conditions for Sunrise,” according to Jefferies analyst Ahmed Furman.

Equinor, too, has had to take a bigger share of Empire Wind, buying out the stake held by BP in January of this year. BP had bought 50% stakes in three Equinor wind projects in 2020, but last year wrote down its investment in the offshore wind sector in the U.S. by over $1 billion.

Why could Orsted not simply pull out of Sunrise Wind? “Orsted and our industry are in an extraordinary situation with the adverse market development in the U.S. on top of the past years’ macroeconomic and supply chain challenges,” Rasmus Errboe, who took over as the company’s chief executive earlier this year, said in a statement. “To deliver on our business plan and commitments in this environment, we’ve concluded that a rights issue is the best solution for Orsted and our shareholders.”

The Danish government will maintain its 50.1% stake in the company, putting the small Scandinavian country with its low-boiling trade and territorial conflicts against the Trump administration in direct capitalist conflict with the American president and his least favorite form of electricity generation.

In the immediate wake of the announcement, Jefferies analyst Ahmed Farman wrote to clients that the deal would “obviously de-risk the [balance sheet], but near-term dilution risk seems substantial,” citing the unexpected magnitude of the raise and no sign pointing to new growth. “As a result, we expect the initial stock reaction to be quite negative.”

""Ford is going to deliver what no other automaker has been able to: a family of affordable, adaptable electric vehicles that offer multiple body styles for work and play — including for export — and whose LFP batteries will be assembled in America, not imported from China.” Ford President and CEO Jim Farley said in a statement.

The motor manufacturing company will invest $2 billion in its Louisville Assembly Plant which will generate 2,200 hourly jobs and $3 billion to build a new battery plant located in Michigan.

Ford projects that consumers will be able to purchase a four-door midsize electric vehicle truck which includes a front storage compartment — or ""frunk"" — by 2027. Ford boasts that the electric vehicle will possess a ""lower cost of ownership over five years than a three-year-old use Tesla model, pointing to the use of Lithium iron phosphate prismatic batteries and a 20% reduction in parts compared to a typical vehicle.

“We took inspiration from the Model T – the universal car that changed the world,” said Doug Field, Ford chief EV, digital and design officer. “We assembled a really brilliant collection of minds across Ford and unleashed them to find new solutions to old problems. We applied firstprinciples engineering, pushing to the limits of physics to make it fun to drive and compete on affordability. Our new zonal electric architecture unlocks capabilities the industry has never seen. This isn’t a strippeddown, oldschool vehicle.”

Ford will not be relying on a traditional assembly line to built the electric vehicle truck, but instead has established its Ford Universal EV Production System or what it refers to as an ""assembly tree,"" consisting of ""three sub-assemblies run down their own lines simultaneously and then join together.""

Through this approach Ford said that their electric vehicles could be produced at a rate 40% faster than other vehicles.

“We have all lived through far too many ‘good college tries’ by Detroit automakers to make affordable vehicles that ends up with idled plants, layoffs and uncertainty. So, this had to be a strong, sustainable and profitable business,"" Farley said. ""From Day 1, we knew there was no incremental path to success. We empowered a tiny skunkworks team three time zones away from Detroit. We tore up the moving assembly line concept and designed a better one. And we found a path to be the first automaker to make prismatic LFP batteries in the U.S.”

Data centers to support artificial intelligence software make up much of the unexpected growth in demand.
For years, utilities’ investment model was largely about cleaning up generation with cheap renewables.
“So it’s very challenging to see that materialize as a big source of demand growth over the next five to 10 years.","When companies reported earnings over the past two weeks, the utility sector glimmered. Southern Company boasted $13 billion in new capital expenditures. FirstEnergy Corp.’s estimates for transmission investments surged by as much as 20%. CMS Energy announced real progress on building out power for data centers. Xcel Energy beat analysts’ estimates on strong operational performance.

These second quarter results, the investment bank Jefferies wrote in a note to clients, have the makings of a new “golden age of utilities.”

“It’s a remarkable time for electric utilities,” Chris Seiple, VP of power and renewables at the consultancy Wood Mackenzie, told Latitude Media. “For 20 years, they haven’t had load growth and now, for the first time in a long time, they have load growth. For some of the utilities, they have a lot of load growth.”

As a result, many of these power companies were caught “flat-footed,” forced to “build the plane while flying it,” according to a recent report Seiple authored. Finance chiefs who just a year ago dismissed the idea of major capital expenditures are now scrambling to present ambitious new investment strategies as Wall Street clambers for growth. They face the challenge of constructing enough of the right kinds of generation, all while keeping rates from soaring to levels that trigger a political backlash and correctly predicting just how much power is needed for the future.

Data centers to support artificial intelligence software make up much of the unexpected growth in demand. That’s partly why many of the new server farms are located in Texas, where adding new power generation is relatively easy and cheap compared to more tightly regulated markets, and Virginia, where the federal government’s cybersecurity investments are clustered.

For years, utilities’ investment model was largely about cleaning up generation with cheap renewables. For utilities in deregulated markets, where different companies own the power plants and the distribution lines, that meant signing power purchase agreements with, for example, a wind farm, at costs less than the rates customers were paying. As a result, the primary pressure driving up rates was the cost of building new power lines or upgrading the distribution infrastructure to better deal with extreme weather.

But the need for more 24/7 baseload power to keep data centers running is spurring so much demand for new gas turbines that the backlogged orders at major manufacturers such as GE Vernova and Siemens Energy now stretch into years. That’s good news for other costly generating sources that have struggled to find willing investors in recent years, such nuclear power developers or hydropower owners who want to upgrade older dams — though those technologies in many cases are also years away.

Too much growth?

Last month’s rate hikes in grid systems like the PJM Interconnection, the largest system in the country, are already spurring political pushback, becoming a key campaign issue in the New Jersey gubernatorial race. Charles Hua, the founder of the advocacy group PowerLines that focuses on utility regulators, told Latitude Media that there is “absolutely a risk” that utilities could exhaust the public’s willingness to pay higher rates.

“We’re playing with fire to test the limits of that right now, which is very much happening with a record year of rate increases,” Hua said. “We’re already at two-and-a-half times the amount of rate hikes we had last year, with months to go.”

A vertically integrated utility has an advantage in a regulated, traditional monopoly market such as in Georgia or North Carolina, Seiple said, because they have control over the entire market. That may be why Southern Company, which owns Georgia Power, has been able to respond to the surge in demand by putting up such big investment numbers in the last quarter. But the ability to meet the moment by spending big means a company could be left with stranded assets if the demand forecasts shift again.

“This is a fundamental reshaping of the risk profile,” Seiple said. “The utilities that are going big on this are going to have a very big chunk of revenue tied to one industry. If 10 years from now quantum computing comes along and substantially decreases the energy needed to do the same amount of computing, it could leave a lot of people with stranded investment. Maybe that never occurs, but it’s a real change in the risk profile.”

The risk of overbuilding energy infrastructure is tempered by the fact that non-data center demand is also expected to grow: electrification of buildings and transportation, air conditioning, green hydrogen production and even direct air capture.

But forecast demand growth from electric vehicles remains relatively tiny compared to data centers, air conditioning in the U.S. is already widely used, and the ability of green hydrogen and carbon removal tech to scale is still unclear. And in the nearer-term, Hua said, there definitely is a risk of “overbuilding too quickly,” and causing bills to go up too fast for the public to endure.

There’s no potential shortage of applications for electricity if too many new power plants come online — but the only technologies on the horizon that could use as much power as data centers are still far off from reaching commercial scale.

“The things that could move the needle — green hydrogen and DAC — are very, very, very expensive,” Seiple said. “So it’s very challenging to see that materialize as a big source of demand growth over the next five to 10 years. But on the AI side, with data centers, that’s a lot of risk both that there could be a lot more demand than today and a lot less demand. It could go both ways.”",https://www.latitudemedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Latitude-1920px-32-Image-2025-08-11T164719.024.jpg,N,,2025-08-11 19:01:56.171709

Far from defending the nation and its people from existing and emerging risks, the Trump administration has turned the federal government into a direct threat to clean air and water, public lands, healthy wildlife, productive croplands, and human health.

The administration has slammed U.S. climate progress into reverse, taking at least 40 separate actions that undercut the nation’s ability to understand, confront, and cope with the consequences of a widening crisis from extreme weather that contributed to at least 568 deaths and more than $182 billion in damages in the last year alone.

Just last week, the Trump administration said it would yank a successful program that helps low-income and moderate-income households pay for rooftop solar systems, slashing energy bills for those who are least able to afford them. What possible excuse could there be for making it harder for these families to light, heat, and cool their homes? Oh, right: to help pay for tax cuts that mostly benefit the nation’s wealthiest people.

We’ll pay more for electricity just as demand skyrockets to power energy-guzzling data centers. We’ll have less choice in the kinds of cars we drive, even as the administration’s tariffs drive up sticker prices.

We’ll suffer more lost days at work and school, even premature deaths, as the result of pollution that harms public health. And we’ll pay in worsening climate disasters, which are already inflicting rising costs and mounting dangers on every community in the country.

Rural Americans will pay an especially high price for the administration’s senseless actions to cancel or curtail federal research and direct funding that help make forests less susceptible to wildfires, help farmers improve soil health and water quality, make crops more resistant to heat and drought, and improve pest management and other practices that directly impact a farmer’s livelihood.

Here are just some of the current impacts:

Businesses have canceled, closed, or scaled back more than $22 billion worth of new factories and clean energy projects, with a loss of 16,500 jobs, in red states and blue, as the administration and its allies in Congress have scuttled successful clean energy incentives. It’s part of the administration’s larger campaign to reverse national gains in solar and wind power, electric vehicles, advanced batteries, and the like—the building blocks of a modern economy.

Families are poised to pay more at the gas pump as the administration works to rescind clean car standards that were set to save drivers some $23 billion in fuel costs through 2050 and to avoid burning 70 billion gallons of gasoline.

Dangerous air pollution is set to rise after the administration decided in April to allow nearly 70 coal-fired power plants to skirt commonsense clean air standards and dump more mercury, arsenic, benzene, and carbon pollution into the air we breathe.

Fishermen, homeowners, farmers, policymakers, and others are wondering where they’ll turn to for reliable information to inform important decisions and long-term plans after the Trump administration eviscerated U.S. climate monitoring and research, much of it regarded as the gold standard for climate science worldwide; U.S. influence has been sidelined in international efforts to confront the climate crisis and help shape the rules of the road for a global clean energy market worth a record $2.2 trillion this year. All this at a time when the International Court of Justice ruled that nations have a legal obligation to protect the environment from greenhouse gas emissions and may be held liable for reparations if they fail to act.

Essential protections against the dangers of climate pollution have been jeopardized by the administration’s illegal effort to revoke the 2009 U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) finding that greenhouse gases endanger public health and general well-being.

Three takeaways:

First, slashing commonsense environmental and health protections doesn’t cut costs. Safeguards enforced by the EPA more than pay for themselves, as 6 in 10 Americans understand. EPA standards deliver up to $12.50 in public benefits for every dollar invested in compliance, according to a White House report that the first Trump administration produced. Taking the environmental steward off the beat simply enables fossil fuel companies and others to shift the costs of their pollution onto the public. That runs counter to what we teach every kindergartener: Don’t blame others for the mess you make—clean it up.

Second, in an election dominated by public perceptions about issues like the state of American democracy, the cost of living, and immigration, voters didn’t ask for this unconscionable assault, but someone else did: the billionaire oil and gas donors Trump solicited to bankroll his campaign.

Finally, much of what the administration has proposed runs counter to sound science and the laws that Congress has duly passed to protect the environment and public health. We and others are challenging the administration, in court where necessary, to compel it to stick to the science and follow the law.

OBBBA retains the zero-emission nuclear power production credit for existing nuclear facilities through December 31, 2032. OBBBA, as discussed below, also enacted new “foreign entity of concern” (FEOC) rules, which may limit taxpayers’ access to the credit in certain circumstances.

Termination and Restrictions on Clean Electricity Production Credit (Section 45Y) and Clean Electricity Investment Credit (Section 48E)

OBBBA terminates the clean electricity production credit and the clean electricity investment credit for wind and solar energy property placed in service after December 31, 2027. However, such placed-in-service requirement does not apply to property that begins construction within one year after the enactment of OBBBA (i.e., by July 4, 2026). The credit for technologies other than wind and solar begins to phase out in 2034 as follows: 75% credit for facilities beginning construction during 2034, 50% credit for facilities beginning construction during 2035, and 0% credit for facilities beginning construction after December 31, 2035. Additionally, as discussed below, OBBBA’s FEOC limitations apply to restrict access to the credit in certain circumstances.

Phase-Out and Restrictions on Advanced Manufacturing Production Credit (Section 45X)

OBBBA terminates the advanced manufacturing production credit for wind components produced and sold after December 31, 2027. Additionally, effective for eligible components sold after December 31, 2026, a person will not be treated as having sold an eligible component that is integrated (a primary component) into another eligible component (a secondary component) unless 65% of the direct material cost to produce the secondary component within the same manufacturing facility is attributable to primary components mined, produced, or manufactured in the United States. Additionally, as discussed below, the credit is subject to OBBBA’s FEOC limitations.

Extension and Modification of Clean Fuel Production Credit (Section 45Z)

OBBBA extends the period for which the clean fuel production credit can be claimed by two years, until December 31, 2029. However, with respect to fuel produced after December 31, 2025, OBBBA (1) reduces the credit for sustainable aviation fuel from $1.75/gallon to $1/gallon, (2) limits the credit to fuel that is exclusively derived from a feedstock that was produced or grown in the United States, Mexico, or Canada, and (3) modifies the calculation of the emissions rate, which is used in determining the credit amount. Additionally, as discussed below, the credit is subject to OBBBA’s FEOC limitations.

Restrictions on Carbon Oxide Sequestration Credit (Section 45Q)

While OBBBA does not modify the expiration of the carbon oxide sequestration credit, OBBBA increases the amount of the Section 45Q tax credit for captured carbon oxides used in either enhanced oil or natural gas recovery projects or for other specified commercial purposes from a current rate of $60 per metric ton to $85 per metric ton, the same amount available for captured carbon oxides disposed of in secure geological storage. The increased credit amounts apply to facilities or equipment that are placed in service after July 4, 2025. Additionally, as discussed below, the credit is subject to OBBBA’s FEOC limitations.

Phase-Out of Clean Hydrogen Production Credit (Section 45V)

OBBBA phases out Section 45V early. Under OBBBA, clean hydrogen facilities must begin construction by December 31, 2027, as opposed to December 31, 2032, as previously contemplated under the IRA. However, OBBBA does not apply the FEOC limitations to Section 45V.

Termination of Various Other Credits

OBBBA terminates early various other clean energy tax credits. For vehicles acquired after September 30, 2025, OBBBA terminates Section 30D (Clean Vehicle Credit), Section 25E (Previously Owned Clean Vehicles), and Section 45W (Qualified Commercial Clean Vehicles). Further, for property placed in service and expenditures made, respectively, after December 31, 2025, OBBBA terminates Section 25C (Energy Efficient Home Improvement Credit) and Section 25D (Residential Clean Energy Credit). Additionally, for property placed in service, property beginning construction, and property acquired, respectively, after June 30, 2026, OBBBA terminates Section 30C (Charging/Alternative Fuel Refueling Property), Section 179D (Energy Efficient Commercial Buildings), and Section 45L (New Energy Efficient Homes).

The various changes above may create additional pressure for taxpayers intending to claim energy incentives to accelerate expenditures or begin construction on projects much sooner than originally planned.

Foreign Entity of Concern Rules

OBBBA imposes greater FEOC restrictions on the production of renewable energy in the United States. Under OBBBA, FEOC rules disqualify certain energy projects from access to certain energy tax credits if the project is either owned or controlled by a disqualified foreign entity or person tied to China, Russia, North Korea, or Iran (each a Covered Nation) or if the project receives certain material assistance or supply chain inputs from such foreign entities or persons. Thus, understanding an energy producer’s supply chain and contractual ties to FEOCs is critical to ensuring eligibility for certain energy tax credits.

Key Definitions Under the FEOC Rules

At the heart of the FEOC rules is the concept of the “prohibited foreign entity” (PFE). A PFE is defined as either a “specified foreign entity” (SFE) or a “foreign-influenced entity” (FIE).

Specified Foreign Entity (SFE)

SFEs are defined as any of the following: (1) foreign terrorist organizations designated by the US Secretary of State, (2) specially designated nationals and blocked persons on the US Department of Treasury’s OFAC list, (3) Chinese military companies operating in the United States, (4) entities on the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act list, (5) certain Chinese battery manufacturers identified in the National Defense Authorization Act for FY 2024, (6) the governments of a Covered Nation (or any instrumentality thereof), (7) any entity incorporated (or maintaining a qualified business unit or principal place of business) in a Covered Nation, or (8) a citizen or national of a Covered Nation. In addition, any entity (whether a US entity or otherwise) that is “controlled” (generally meaning more than 50% owned, directly or indirectly) by a legal entity incorporated in a Covered Nation, a national or citizen of a Covered Nation, or a Covered Nation (or instrumentality thereof), is an SFE.

Foreign-Influenced Entity (FIE)

FIEs generally are entities that are determined to be under too much control or influence from an SFE. OBBBA uses two approaches to defining FIEs.

FIE – Statutory Test First, OBBBA statutorily lays out several contractual relationships that will render an entity a FIE: (1) an SFE owns at least 25% of the entity (by vote or value), (2) multiple SFEs together own at least 40% of the entity (by vote or value), (3) at least 15% of the entity’s original issued debt is held by one or more SFEs, or (4) an SFE has the authority —directly or indirectly — to appoint a covered officer, such as a board member or officer.

FIE – Effective Control Test Second, OBBBA introduces a much broader “effective control” test, which provides that if the entity makes a payment to an SFE under a contract or arrangement that gives the SFE (or a related entity) “effective control” over a qualified facility, energy storage technology, or eligible component — including the extraction, processing, or recycling of critical minerals — then such entity is a FIE. OBBBA requires the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to publish guidance on the definition and application of the “effective control” test, and until such point, certain statutory rules apply for purposes of determining effective control.

Material Assistance From a PFE

Material assistance from a PFE is another critical factor that can jeopardize a project’s eligibility for energy tax credits. OBBBA establishes a cost ratio mechanism to measure material assistance with respect to each project: the material assistance cost ratio (MACR). As noted in the chart below, the material assistance rules apply only to clean electricity production credits, clean electricity investment credits, and advanced manufacturing production credits.

For the clean electricity production credit (Section 45Y) and the clean electricity investment credit (Section 48E), the MACR is calculated by taking the total direct costs of all manufactured products and subcomponents incorporated into the facility, subtracting the costs attributable to PFEs, and dividing by the total direct costs. If the MACR is less than certain statutorily set thresholds, the project is deemed to have received material assistance from a PFE. For the advanced manufacturing production credit (Section 45X), only the direct material costs for eligible components are counted for purposes of calculating the MACR, which is calculated in the same manner noted above.

Projects must meet or exceed certain statutorily set MACR thresholds, which vary depending on the technology and the year in which construction begins. For example, some facilities must meet a 40% threshold in 2026, with the requirement rising to 60% or more in later years. The Treasury is required to issue safe harbor tables by December 31, 2026, to help clarify these MACR threshold requirements. Until such point, IRS Notice 2025-08 and supplier certifications can be used by taxpayers to demonstrate compliance with MACR percentage thresholds.

Summary of Tax Credits Limited by FEOC Rules

If a taxpayer meets the definition of a PFE due to its ownership structure or contracts with certain foreign entities, or receives material assistance from a PFE, depending upon the type of tax credit at issue, the taxpayer may not be eligible to claim the credit. The following chart provides an overview of how the FEOC rules limit access to the tax credits discussed above.

As a result of the FEOC rules, any renewable energy project or manufacturing of eligible components will require an extensive FEOC analysis to determine tax credit eligibility. Moreover, strategics, private equity funds, or tax credit syndicators purchasing tax credits under Section 6418 will now need to conduct extensive diligence of the tax credit seller’s capital and organizational structure, and supply-chain structure, to ensure FEOC compliance is satisfied, and credits are properly transferable.

Further Guidance Needed on FEOC Rules

Although Congress attempted to refine the FEOC rules as OBBBA was enacted, there remain significant areas where Treasury and the IRS are expected to provide further guidance. For example, the scope of what constitutes “effective control” in the context of payments to FIEs is not fully defined, and the statute directs the Treasury and the IRS to issue rules to prevent entities from circumventing the restrictions through contracts or other arrangements. Additionally, the material assistance rules require the development of safe harbor tables by December 31, 2026, to clarify the percentage of costs attributable to PFEs. Until then, taxpayers must rely on interim guidance and supplier certifications, which may not address all practical scenarios.

Beginning of Construction Guidance

For many of the energy tax credits discussed in this alert, eligibility to claim such credits will turn on the precise moment a project is considered to have “begun construction.” The IRS, through a series of notices, has long applied two primary tests to determine when a project has begun construction: the five percent safe harbor and the physical work test. Although the details of those tests fall outside the scope of this update, it is important to note that in 2022 the Service confirmed that the analytical framework set out in those notices remains valid when evaluating projects for energy tax credit purposes. In certain parts of OBBBA, Congress formally incorporated the existing IRS beginning of construction notices, but only for the limited purpose of administering the statute’s FEOC provisions.

However, on July 7, 2025, the Trump Administration issued an Executive Order directing the Treasury Department to publish guidance on the “beginning of construction” rules, which would prevent developers from relying on perceived “loopholes” in the current beginning of construction guidance. Because this Executive Order could materially alter how and how quickly projects qualify for the array of federal energy credits discussed herein, sponsors, investors, and other stakeholders should re-examine their beginning of construction strategies and documentation in real time.

Ford’s new EV strategy comes as Chinese automakers are quickly expanding across the globe, offering relatively affordable electric vehicles.
“And this new vehicle built in Louisville, Kentucky, is going to be a much better solution to anything that anyone can buy from China,” he added.","LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) — Ford Motor Co. will invest nearly $2 billion retooling a Kentucky factory to produce electric vehicles that it says will be more affordable, more profitable to build and will outcompete rival models.

The automaker’s top executive unveiled the new EV strategy at Ford’s Louisville Assembly Plant which, after producing gas-powered vehicles for 70 years, will be converted to manufacture electric vehicles.

“In our careers, as automobile people we’re lucky if we get to work on one, maybe two, projects that really change the face of our industry,” CEO Jim Farley told plant workers in Kentucky on Monday. “And I believe today is going to light the match as one of those projects for all of us here.”

The Big Detroit automakers have continued to transition from internal combustion engines to EV technology even as President Donald Trump’s administration unwinds incentives for automakers to go electric. Trump’s massive tax and spending law targets EV incentives, including the imminent removal of a credit that saves buyers up to $7,500 on a new electric car.

Yet Farley and other top executives in the auto industry say that electric vehicles are the future and there is no going back.

The first EV to be produced by the revamped Louisville production process will be a midsize, four-door electric pickup truck in 2027 for domestic and international markets, the company said Monday.

The new electric trucks will feature plenty of interior space to fit five adults and pack enough power to have a targeted 0-60 time as fast as a Mustang EcoBoost but with more downforce, Ford said

The electric trucks will be powered by lower-cost batteries made at a Ford factory in Michigan. The Detroit automaker previously announced a $3 billion investment to build the battery factory.

The automaker sees this as a “Model T moment” for its EV business — a reference to revolutionary changes on the production line led by the company’s founder, Henry Ford, when it began churning out vehicles from a factory more than a century ago. Farley said the changes will upend how electric vehicles are made in the U.S.

“It represents the most radical change on how we design and how we build vehicles at Ford since the Model T,” Farley said.

The company said it will use a universal platform and production system for its EVs, essentially the underpinning of a vehicle that can be applied across a wide range of models.

The Louisville factory — one of two Ford assembly plants in Kentucky’s largest city — will be revamped to cut production costs and make assembly time faster as it’s prepared to churn out electric vehicles.

The result will be “an affordable electric vehicle that we expect to be profitable,” Farley said in an interview with The Associated Press ahead of the announcement. “This is an example of us rejuvenating our U.S. plants with the most modern manufacturing techniques.”

The new platform enables a lineup of affordable vehicles to be produced at scale, Ford said. It will reduce parts by 20% versus a typical vehicle, with 25% fewer fasteners, 40% fewer workstations dock-to-dock in the plant and a 15% faster assembly time, Ford said.

The traditional assembly line will be transformed into an “assembly tree” at the Louisville plant, the company said. Instead of one long conveyor, three subassembly lines will operate simultaneously and then join together, it said.

Other specifications for the midsize electric truck – including its reveal date, starting price, EPA-estimated battery range, battery sizes and charge times — will be announced later, the company said. Farley revealed that the truck will have a targeted starting price of about $30,000.

Ford said its investment in the Louisville plant will secure 2,200 hourly jobs.

Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear said Monday that the automaker’s plans for the Louisville plant will strengthen a more than century-old partnership between Ford and the Bluegrass State.

“This announcement not only represents one of the largest investments on record in our state, it also boosts Kentucky’s position at the center of EV-related innovation and solidifies Louisville Assembly Plant as an important part of Ford’s future,” Beshear said.

Ford said its combined investment of about $5 billion at the Kentucky assembly plant and Michigan battery plant is expected to create or secure nearly 4,000 direct jobs between the two plants while strengthening the domestic supply chain with dozens of new U.S.-based suppliers.

Ford previously forecast weaker earnings growth for this year and further losses in its electric vehicles business as it works to control costs. Model e, Ford’s electric vehicle business, posted a full-year loss of $5.08 billion for 2024 as revenue fell 35% to $3.9 billion.

Ford’s new EV strategy comes as Chinese automakers are quickly expanding across the globe, offering relatively affordable electric vehicles.

“We’re not in a race to build the most electric cars,” Farley told the AP when asked about competition from China. “We’re in a race to have a sustainable electric business that’s profitable, that customers love.

“And this new vehicle built in Louisville, Kentucky, is going to be a much better solution to anything that anyone can buy from China,” he added.

Ford could have opted to launch its EV project overseas to reap lower-cost labor and currency advantages but instead is “taking the fight to our competition” from the plant in Kentucky, Farley said at Monday’s event. But the Ford CEO cautioned that “there are no guarantees” with project.

“We’re doing so many new things I can’t tell you with 100% certainty that this will all go just right,” he said. “It is a bet. There is risk. The automotive industry has a graveyard littered with affordable vehicles that were launched in our country with all good intentions. And they fizzled out with idle plants, laid off workers and red ink. And at Ford ... we set out to break that cycle.”",https://dims.apnews.com/dims4/default/6755b57/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5366x3018+0+280/resize/1440x810!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fassets.apnews.com%2F52%2F8b%2Fc52e45ec91f96edfdd3a7541a301%2Fcb0fadd79f46435aa54c247b3f977595,N,,2025-08-11 19:01:17.382762

RALEIGH, North Carolina – U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has allocated $409.4 million to North Carolina Department of Environmental Quality (NCDEQ) for public water systems to improve local drinking water utility infrastructure so their systems can better withstand natural disasters.

“In February, I visited communities in Asheville to witness firsthand the crucial role drinking water utilities have in responding to natural disasters,” said EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin. “This funding to the North Carolina Department of Environmental Quality will help secure the infrastructure of these systems to ensure EPA can fulfill its core mission to protect human health and the environment.”

“When a natural disaster strikes, local communities need a public water system they can count on,” said EPA Regional Administrator Kevin McOmber. “These funds will help local governments create resilient systems that can better withstand floods, fires and other weather events so the water keeps flowing.”

“Since Hurricane Helene struck last September, repairing Western North Carolina’s damaged infrastructure to be stronger and more reliable in the future has been a key component of all ongoing recovery efforts as Western North Carolina rebuilds,” said U.S. Senator Ted Budd (R-NC). “I am grateful to President Trump and EPA Administrator Zeldin for their efforts to ensure North Carolina receives critical grant funding to restructure and reinforce the quality of our water systems, enabling our recovering communities to build more durable infrastructure. This is a step in the right direction to aid reconstruction efforts and mitigate future natural disasters.”

“As Western North Carolina continues to recover from the devastation of Hurricane Helene, this funding is an important investment in building stronger, more resilient water infrastructure,” said U.S. Senator Thom Tillis (R-NC). “Reliable access to clean drinking water is essential for public health and economic stability as communities recover. I appreciate the EPA’s commitment to supporting our state as we work to rebuild critical infrastructure and make communities whole again.”

“Hurricane Helene severely damaged drinking water systems throughout Western North Carolina and thousands of people were without safe drinking water for weeks,"" said NCDEQ Secretary Reid Wilson. ""These investments will make drinking water systems more resilient to future storms, helping to ensure that communities have uninterrupted access to healthy water.”

“As mayor of Hot Springs, I’ve seen firsthand how storms can disrupt the lives of every person in our small community,” said Town of Hot Springs Mayor Abigail L. Norton. “Clean, safe drinking water is something folks sometimes take for granted until disaster strikes. This funding means our town can protect our water and our people for years to come. We’re grateful to the EPA and NCDEQ for helping Hot Springs build a future where families can feel secure, no matter what nature throws our way.”

“Helene completely destroyed both of the Town of Burnsville's raw water intakes, leaving residents, businesses, schools, medical facilities and government agencies without water,” said Town of Burnsville Mayor Russell Fox. “The town is still running on a temporary pumping system until the primary intake system can be rebuilt. The cost of providing water service to users has increased dramatically since the storm. The need for funding is always an issue but even more so now. We need to strengthen our systems against disasters, and the EPA funding has given us that opportunity. The Town of Burnsville is very grateful.”

“The Town of Old Forts water system was destroyed by Hurricane Helene,” said Town of Old Forts Mayor Pam Snypes. “Fortunately, our citizens were provided water as quickly as possible, but it was provided with Band-aid repairs. Over the last ten months the town has been working to make those repairs more efficient. Repairs are very expensive. The availability of these funds will provide a way to ensure going forward that out water system will be a stable system in the event another disaster occurs.”

Background

These funds are part of the 2025 Supplemental Appropriation for Hurricanes Helene and Milton and the Hawai’i Wildfires, administered by the State Revolving Fund. The funds may be used to improve drinking water treatment, distribute water, improve the source of water supply, replace or construct finished water storage tanks and complete other infrastructure projects needed to protect public health through improved drinking water infrastructure.

,EVs,2025-08-11 21:00:05+00:00,NPR,Ford says it will roll out a cheaper electric pickup truck - NPR,Camila Domonoske,,,,,https://www.npr.org/2025/08/11/nx-s1-5496651/ford-cheap-electric-truck,"That would be not just cheap for an electric vehicle but competitively priced for a truck — period.
The Lightning, a splashy full-size pickup, was an ambitious vehicle when it debuted in 2022, but Ford has never managed to make money on it.
It's a similar story with the Mustang Mach-E. Plans for a big electric SUV spluttered to a stop in 2024.

Chinese automakers are pushing into markets around the world with appealing, competitively-priced electric vehicles.","Ford is making a multibillion-dollar bet on electric vehicles.

At the Louisville Assembly Plant in Kentucky on Monday morning, Ford executives announced that they plan to retool the factory so they can roll out a midsize pickup truck in the $30,000 range within 18 months.

That would be not just cheap for an electric vehicle but competitively priced for a truck — period. Ford's own electric F-150 Lightning and the Chevrolet Silverado EV both start at around $50,000. Among their competitors, the Tesla Cybertruck starts at more than $62,000, and the cheapest Rivian is more than $70,000. On the gas side, meanwhile, the midsize, gas-powered Ford Ranger starts at $35,000.

This isn't the first time Ford has bet big on EVs. The Lightning, a splashy full-size pickup, was an ambitious vehicle when it debuted in 2022, but Ford has never managed to make money on it. It's a similar story with the Mustang Mach-E. Plans for a big electric SUV spluttered to a stop in 2024.

Now Ford is pivoting toward slightly smaller, significantly cheaper EVs — and doing so right as the U.S. EV industry is facing significant headwinds, including the Trump administration's efforts to roll back policies that promote EVs and fight climate change in general.

At Monday's event, Ford executives didn't make the case that the future is clean or green or eco-conscious. Instead, one word ruled the day: affordable.

This has long been the goal for a number of automakers: a truly affordable EV — one that competes with gasoline-powered cars when it comes to the up-front sticker price, without factoring in government subsidies or the savings from not using gasoline. And, no small detail, it has to be profitable for companies too.

Chinese automakers have cracked this code, and Western automakers are painfully aware of the need to catch up. Tesla has been teasing a cheaper vehicle for years, and CEO Elon Musk says it's actually coming this year. Chevrolet is on the verge of bringing back the bargain-priced Chevy Bolt.

And at the $30,000 price point, Ford thinks it can unlock a wide range of buyers who aren't tempted by the pricier EVs available right now. ""It is a radically better proposition for some customers, who charge at home, don't go long distances, less than 300 miles,"" CEO Jim Farley told reporters after the event.

Ford's plan centers on dramatically simplifying the vehicle and breaking it up into three separate pieces, which are built in parallel and then combined together.

It's still aspirational. ""There is risk,"" Farley said. ""The automotive industry has a graveyard littered with affordable vehicles that were launched in our country with all good intentions. And they fizzled out.""

But after canceling its large electric SUV and just recently delaying a next-generation of electric full-size trucks and vans, Ford held this splashy event in Louisville to make it clear it was moving forward — really — with this project.

Political headwinds, global realities

Technically, what Ford announced is not just a single vehicle but a vehicle platform, which will eventually be adapted into a variety of vehicles that are all built the same way. They'll be assembled in Kentucky, with lower-cost lithium iron phosphate batteries from a Ford battery plant in Marshall, Mich. All together, it's a $5 billion investment for Ford.

The Kentucky plant, which currently makes the Ford Escape and Lincoln Corsair, will close for renovations and retooling, and reopen with 2,200 jobs, 600 fewer people than it employs now. (Farley said there will be no layoffs.) The Marshall plant, which had faced an uncertain future, will now be set to open with some 1,700 jobs created.

It might seem like a strange time for a company to boast about a major EV project. President Trump, following through on a campaign promise, has been systematically dismantling the incentives and regulations that pushed automakers to make more EVs. Demand for battery-powered cars has come in lower than carmakers' expectations, and with federal tax credits expiring at the end of September, that trend is expected to slow even more.

But Farley has been clear for years now that having competitively-priced EVs is an existential priority for Ford — and for other automakers.

Chinese automakers are pushing into markets around the world with appealing, competitively-priced electric vehicles. If established global automakers can't compete, they could wind up with a shrinking share of the global car market.

Speaking to reporters after the event on Monday, Farley said that in some aspects of engineering, it's impossible to compete with companies like BYD, the Chinese EV giant. ""Their batteries are going to be cheaper than ours,"" he said. ""They have 120,000 powertrain engineers. We got 1,200."" Left unmentioned: super-fast battery charging, flashy in-vehicle technology and significant government subsidies from the Chinese government.

But, he said, Ford could be more efficient so the car needs less battery than its Chinese competitors do. ""The only way to compete with them is innovation,"" he said. ""And that's what we've done. That's our bet.""

Is it possible?

Farley used the word ""bet"" intentionally, making it clear there is no guarantee of success. Making budget-priced vehicles profitably is a challenge that has defeated Detroit automakers before, and Ford's history with EVs includes a lot of false starts and lost money. In a nod to those past challenges, Ford executives repeatedly said the new vehicle had to be ""sustainable"" — a reference not to the environmental benefits of EVs, but to the need for the car to be sustainable as a business proposition.

And, at risk of understatement, companies don't always make their initial price targets; the F-150 Lightning and the Cybertruck were both first promised to start at $40,000, a price they never actually hit.

Sam Abuelsamid, the vice president of market research at the automotive insights firm Telemetry, said that while there's no guarantee that Ford can pull this off, the new price target is ""plausible.""

""Most of what we know so far about what Ford is doing is not actually entirely new"" for the EV industry, he said. Ford plans on reducing costs and complexity by using a small number of very large die-cast metal pieces for a truck's body, instead of a large number of small pieces; that's an innovation Tesla pioneered. They're going to use the battery as a structural component of the car; Tesla and Chinese manufacturers have been doing that, too. There's a proven track record for these strategies; what's new is for a major legacy brand to implement them together.

The vehicle itself is still rather mysterious. There was no prototype on stage inside the sweltering Louisville Assembly Plant, and no photos on the screen. Instead, Farley stood beside a classic Model T truck as he called the new vehicle a ""Model T"" moment for the company.

And while he made promises about high-tech features and the future, executives also told workers in the plant they could look forward to a more mundane benefit from the $2 billion investment: When the plant reopens next year, Ford VP Bryce Currie told the assembled workers, it would have tempered air — and a much cooler temperature.",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/4764x2680+0+248/resize/1400/quality/100/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F99%2F4a%2Fa3dbd6b849bbb03d29d1c58850eb%2Fap25223592947314.jpg,N,,2025-08-11 18:03:49.889123

The extent to which the Regional Haze Program is dismantled remains a key question that will likely be addressed in the coming months and years of the current administration.","A Landmark Air Quality Initiative

In March 2025, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) announced plans to reconsider the Regional Haze Program, a move that could undo years of progress in improving visibility and air quality in some of America's most cherished natural landscapes.

The Regional Haze Program was established by the EPA in 1999 to address visibility impairment caused by air pollution in America’s national parks and wilderness areas. EPA defines regional haze as a type of visibility reduction resulting from fine particles emitted across broad geographic regions by both natural and human-made sources. While natural sources often include windblown dust, the more common contributors to haze are human-made sources such as motor vehicles, electric utilities, industrial fuel burning, and manufacturing operations. These pollutants not only obscure scenic views but are also associated with seriouspublic health risks, including respiratory illness and cardiovascular problems.

Protecting Iconic Landscapes: How the Program Works

As of 2025, the program encompasses 156 federally designated “Class I” areas, sites granted special protection under the Clean Air Act. Key classifications include regions such as the Grand Canyon, Yosemite, and Glacier National Parks.

To achieve program objectives, states must submit State Implementation Plans (SIPs) that detail their goals for reducing emissions that contribute to haze. These plans are developed collaboratively with federal partners, including the EPA, the National Park Service, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, and the U.S. Forest Service, as well as with tribes and other key stakeholders. Among the program's requirements, states must identify and impose Best Available Retrofit Technology (BART) on specific stationary sources of pollution, such as coal-fired power plants. Technologies like scrubbers are often used to limit the release of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides, both of which contribute heavily to haze formation.

The program has demonstrated measurable improvements. From 2000 to 2021, visibility on the clearest days increased by 32 percent across participating parks and wilderness areas. Additionally, according to EPA estimates, annual emissions of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides decreased by approximately 500,000 tons and 300,000 tons, respectively, from 2007 to 2018. This progress is at least partly due to the program's goals.

Mounting Criticism and Legal Pushback

Even with its measurable successes, the Regional Haze Program has faced criticism, particularly from industry groups and state governments. Opponents of the EPA program argue that compliance with its requirements has imposed a substantial economic burden on manufacturers and other regulated sectors. Other groups, like state entities, have expressed frustration with the program's implementation. More specifically, the program has faced legal challenges over itsinconsistent approval of SIPs across different states. Further, additional concerns have been raised about the program's failure to address the handling of international emissions along border states, which critics claim disincentivize cross-border collaboration.

Deregulation in Motion

In 2025, EPA officials issued a press release addressing their rationale for restructuring the program. AdministratorLee Zeldin stated that the current model imposes “significant costs on power plants and other sectors” and may impact “the supply of affordable energy for American families.” While no data has been provided to substantiate the claimed financial burden on consumers, the EPA positions the restructuring as an effort to allegedly realign the program with congressional intent, modern science, and the air quality improvements already achieved. These actions reflect the current administration's trend toward consequential environmental deregulation.

What’s at Stake

Following the potential rollback of the program, environmental advocates and policy experts warn that weakening the Regional Haze Program could not only undo years of progress but also cause significant economic impacts. Besides the environmental and public health damage caused by increased air pollution, the rollback risks harming the financial stability of localities that rely on tourism. In 2023 alone, the National Park System generated over $55.6 billion in economic output and supported more than 415,000 jobs nationwide. With a decrease in visibility, tourism in these areas may experience a sharp decline. As a result, stripping the program of crucial clean air goals could destabilize local communities that rely on park visitors for economic health.

As the EPA continues to reevaluate these programs, the future of clean air protections in America's natural spaces remains uncertain. The extent to which the Regional Haze Program is dismantled remains a key question that will likely be addressed in the coming months and years of the current administration.",https://www.americanbar.org/content/dam/aba/images/aba-stock/16x9/16x9-pollution-916896750.jpg,N,,2025-08-11 18:04:53.225078

But this year, American manufacturer Rivian is bringing a different kind of power to the party. The company is auctioning a truly unique, one-of-a-kind 2026 Rivian R1S Quad Pebble Beach edition. This special EV combines supercar-level performance with a design inspired by the California coast, and every dollar from its sale will support a global charity.

Underneath the special paint is Rivian's second-generation Quad-Motor platform. This means there is one electric motor for each wheel, giving the vehicle incredible control and power. The system delivers a combined 1,025 horsepower, which allows this family-sized SUV to accelerate from 0 to 60 mph in a mind-bending 2.6 seconds.

The Quad-Motor version of the R1S can complete a quarter-mile drag race in just 10.5 seconds. Those figures are impressive on the road, but Rivian engineered the platform to perform just as well off-road, navigating everything from deep sand to rocky trails.

The exterior is finished in a custom color called ""Monterey Silver."" Rivian says this special paint is applied in a meticulous four-stage process to give it the look of liquid metal, inspired by the soft light over Monterey Bay. The subtle, sophisticated look continues with premium painted cladding and eye-catching ""Laguna Beach Blue"" brake calipers.

The R1S sits on forged 22-inch wheels designed specifically for this edition, featuring a unique three-tone finish. To make sure no one mistakes it for a standard model, it also has custom-etched door sill plates and unique exterior lighting animations.

Inside, the design team went for what they call a ""modern coastal sanctuary."" The cabin features a ""Coastal Canvas"" theme with upholstery made from a material called Adventex, which is designed to be both soft and durable. The interior thoughtfully incorporates sustainable materials, including cork blended textiles and textured wood accents that echo the natural feel of California's Big Sur coastline.

One of the most unique interior features is a gradient finish on the speaker grilles and floor mats. Inspired by a Pacific sunset, the design blends teal blue, vivid red, and golden yellow - the signature colors of the Rivian Adventure Department.

This special R1S was built for a single purpose: to raise money for a good cause. It is scheduled to be sold at the Broad Arrow Auctions event at the Monterey Jet Center on Wednesday, August 13, 2025. The vehicle, listed as Lot 127, will be sold at no reserve, meaning the highest bid will win, regardless of the price. All proceeds from the auction will be donated to TeamWater, a campaign led by creators that is dedicated to providing access to clean drinking water for communities in need around the world.",https://st.arenaev.com/news/25/08/rivian-reveals-one-off-r1s/-828x414/arenaev_000.jpg,N,,2025-08-11 18:03:55.118129

Ford said its investment in the Louisville plant will secure 2,200 hourly jobs.
Ford's new EV strategy comes as Chinese automakers are quickly expanding across the globe, offering relatively affordable electric vehicles.
""And this new vehicle built in Louisville, Kentucky, is going to be a much better solution to anything that anyone can buy from China,"" he added.","LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) — Ford Motor Co. will invest nearly $2 billion retooling a Kentucky factory to produce electric vehicles that it says will be more affordable, more profitable to build and will outcompete rival models.

The automaker's top executive unveiled the new EV strategy at Ford's Louisville Assembly Plant which, after producing gas-powered vehicles for 70 years, will be converted to manufacture electric vehicles.

""In our careers, as automobile people we're lucky if we get to work on one, maybe two, projects that really change the face of our industry,"" CEO Jim Farley told plant workers in Kentucky on Monday. ""And I believe today is going to light the match as one of those projects for all of us here.""

The Big Detroit automakers have continued to transition from internal combustion engines to EV technology even as President Donald Trump's administration unwinds incentives for automakers to go electric. Trump's massive tax and spending law targets EV incentives, including the imminent removal of a credit that saves buyers up to $7,500 on a new electric car.

Yet Farley and other top executives in the auto industry say that electric vehicles are the future and there is no going back.

The first EV to be produced by the revamped Louisville production process will be a midsize, four-door electric pickup truck in 2027 for domestic and international markets, the company said Monday.

The new electric trucks will feature plenty of interior space to fit five adults and pack enough power to have a targeted 0-60 time as fast as a Mustang EcoBoost but with more downforce, Ford said

The electric trucks will be powered by lower-cost batteries made at a Ford factory in Michigan. The Detroit automaker previously announced a $3 billion investment to build the battery factory.

The automaker sees this as a ""Model T moment"" for its EV business — a reference to revolutionary changes on the production line led by the company's founder, Henry Ford, when it began churning out vehicles from a factory more than a century ago. Farley said the changes will upend how electric vehicles are made in the U.S.

""It represents the most radical change on how we design and how we build vehicles at Ford since the Model T,"" Farley said.

The company said it will use a universal platform and production system for its EVs, essentially the underpinning of a vehicle that can be applied across a wide range of models.

The Louisville factory — one of two Ford assembly plants in Kentucky's largest city — will be revamped to cut production costs and make assembly time faster as it's prepared to churn out electric vehicles.

The result will be ""an affordable electric vehicle that we expect to be profitable,"" Farley said in an interview with The Associated Press ahead of the announcement. ""This is an example of us rejuvenating our U.S. plants with the most modern manufacturing techniques.""

The new platform enables a lineup of affordable vehicles to be produced at scale, Ford said. It will reduce parts by 20% versus a typical vehicle, with 25% fewer fasteners, 40% fewer workstations dock-to-dock in the plant and a 15% faster assembly time, Ford said.

The traditional assembly line will be transformed into an ""assembly tree"" at the Louisville plant, the company said. Instead of one long conveyor, three subassembly lines will operate simultaneously and then join together, it said.

Other specifications for the midsize electric truck – including its reveal date, starting price, EPA-estimated battery range, battery sizes and charge times — will be announced later, the company said. Farley revealed that the truck will have a targeted starting price of about $30,000.

Ford said its investment in the Louisville plant will secure 2,200 hourly jobs.

Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear said Monday that the automaker's plans for the Louisville plant will strengthen a more than century-old partnership between Ford and the Bluegrass State.

""This announcement not only represents one of the largest investments on record in our state, it also boosts Kentucky's position at the center of EV-related innovation and solidifies Louisville Assembly Plant as an important part of Ford's future,"" Beshear said.

Ford said its combined investment of about $5 billion at the Kentucky assembly plant and Michigan battery plant is expected to create or secure nearly 4,000 direct jobs between the two plants while strengthening the domestic supply chain with dozens of new U.S.-based suppliers.

Ford previously forecast weaker earnings growth for this year and further losses in its electric vehicles business as it works to control costs. Model e, Ford's electric vehicle business, posted a full-year loss of $5.08 billion for 2024 as revenue fell 35% to $3.9 billion.

Ford's new EV strategy comes as Chinese automakers are quickly expanding across the globe, offering relatively affordable electric vehicles.

""We're not in a race to build the most electric cars,"" Farley told the AP when asked about competition from China. ""We're in a race to have a sustainable electric business that's profitable, that customers love.

""And this new vehicle built in Louisville, Kentucky, is going to be a much better solution to anything that anyone can buy from China,"" he added.

Ford could have opted to launch its EV project overseas to reap lower-cost labor and currency advantages but instead is ""taking the fight to our competition"" from the plant in Kentucky, Farley said at Monday's event. But the Ford CEO cautioned that ""there are no guarantees"" with project.",https://ewscripps.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/506129d/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5366x2817+0+380/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fewscripps-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F4e%2Ff5%2F5122cbd04594a616ce34e76e8ee3%2Fford-electric-vehicles-25223591456551.jpg,N,,2025-08-11 19:01:22.732928

The Environmental Protection Agency last week unveiled a proposal to rescind its 2009 ""endangerment finding""—the scientific conclusion that carbon dioxide poses a threat to human health. Without that finding, the EPA would lose its ability to limit planet-heating pollution from vehicles, power plants, and oil wells, despite the overwhelming scientific consensus that ""a swift reduction in these emissions is needed to avert catastrophic global warming."" The Trump administration's argument for rescinding is ""a medley of strained legal and scientific arguments,"" said Jody Freeman in the Los Angeles Times. It attacks the scientific basis for the finding, ""calling it unreliable"" based on a report ""by five hand-picked scientists known for their outlier views,"" and then ""claims that regulating greenhouse gases simply costs too much and accomplishes too little.""

The EPA is simply looking to ""undo what Congress never gave the agency the authority to do,"" said The Wall Street Journal in an editorial. The Clean Air Act authorizes the agency only to control pollutants that directly harm human health, like ozone, particulate matter, and sulfur dioxide. But higher atmospheric levels of greenhouse gases ""won't make you sick,"" and their climate effects depend on ""sundry variables"" like cloud cover, which the EPA can't regulate. Democrats will likely sue to block the proposal when it becomes final, and ""that would make the administration's day."" Current Chief Justice John Roberts wrote the dissent in the 2007 case that paved the way for the endangerment finding—calling material loss from carbon emissions ""pure conjecture""—and the rest of the court's conservative majority likely shares that opinion.

And the more Zeldin and Trump undo climate progress, the higher that cost will rise. ""That trillion dollars gets less significant by the hour.""",https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/FB9UEycVmBN7Ye5XKMoB2b.jpg,N,,2025-08-11 18:04:57.142070

This work is under a memorandum of understanding (MOU) that was signed earlier this year. Oklo and Lightbridge are jointly assessing the feasibility of commercial-scale fuel fabrication within Oklo’s planned fuel manufacturing infrastructure. Consistent with the objectives of the MOU, this initiative aims to accelerate the commercialization of advanced nuclear fuels through joint fuel fabrication and research and development, including manufacturing fuel using repurposed plutonium from legacy materials.

This announcement follows a series of executive orders issued by the White House in May 2025 that prioritize the acceleration of U.S. nuclear energy deployment. Among the directives was a call for the Secretary of Energy to establish a program to process surplus plutonium and make it available for advanced reactor fuel.

The proposed co-located facility would support the production of advanced fuels for both fast reactors and light water reactors, reinforcing both companies’ commitment to U.S. leadership in advanced nuclear fuel manufacturing and recycling. The collaboration underscores a shared vision for strengthening domestic energy security, supporting advanced reactor deployment, improving the performance of existing light water reactors, and enhancing the resilience of the nuclear fuel supply chain.

“We’re building the infrastructure to help fuel new nuclear development and deployment,” said Jacob DeWitte, Co-Founder and CEO of Oklo. “This collaboration supports our efforts to bolster near- and mid-term advanced reactor fuel supplies with legacy materials such as down-blended uranium and repurposed plutonium. It directly aligns with strong federal direction supporting domestic fuel independence.”

In addition to commercial fuel production, the co-located site would serve as a joint R&D hub for advanced fuel development. These capabilities align with emerging federal policy and represent a critical step toward building a robust commercial supply chain for next-generation nuclear technologies.

“This joint effort reflects a shared vision for a modern nuclear fuel cycle—one that supports both existing and advanced reactors and strengthens America’s energy resilience,” said Seth Grae, President and CEO of Lightbridge Corporation. “Together, we’re working toward a new era of U.S.-led nuclear innovation.”

About Oklo Inc.: Oklo Inc. is developing fast fission power plants to deliver clean, reliable, and affordable energy at scale, establishing a domestic supply chain for critical radioisotopes, and advancing nuclear fuel recycling to convert nuclear waste into clean energy. Oklo was the first to receive a site use permit from the U.S. Department of Energy for a commercial advanced fission plant, was awarded fuel from Idaho National Laboratory, and submitted the first custom combined license application for an advanced reactor to the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission. Oklo is also developing advanced fuel recycling technologies in collaboration with the U.S. Department of Energy and national laboratories.

But even though India's fast-growing economy is the fifth largest globally, India's energy importers may have far less room to maneuver than they might appear.

Tight corporate operating margins, cost-sensitive consumer markets, binding long-term import contracts and slowing economic growth all limit India's ability to spend big on U.S. oil, LNG, coal and refined products over the near term.

At the same time, India's location at the base of Asia means it is far closer to other major energy product exporters than it is to the United States, which would trigger sharply higher shipping costs if it were to switch to U.S.-origin products.

No doubt some Indian corporations will be cajoled into pledging major U.S. purchases and investments during upcoming trade negotiations, which may boost sentiment in Washington, D.C.

But U.S. exporters of oil, gas, coal and fuels that are hoping for massive, viable and binding purchase commitments by Indian buyers are likely to be left disappointed.

Tough Spot

It's not just its import needs that India has to worry about.

The United States is by far India's largest export market, and has accounted for nearly 20% of all Indian exports in recent years, according to International Monetary Fund (IMF) data.

In 2024, the value of India's exports to the United States was just over $80 billion, while its imports from the U.S. totalled just under $45 billion.

As the U.S. is more than twice as large as India's next largest export market - the United Arab Emirates - it will be nearly impossible for the country to replace lost U.S. consumers with other buyers.

That means that trade negotiators will remain committed to healing trade ties with Washington as quickly as possible, and will be looking at every possible means of reducing the trade imbalance.

Cut-Price Crude

The rapid rise in India's purchases of Russian crude oil since mid-2022 has been a sore point for the U.S. and Europe, and has been a focal point during the recent trade talks.

Average monthly crude oil flows from Russia to India jumped from around 3.2 million barrels a month between 2018 and 2021 to 50 million barrels a month since mid-2022, data from Kpler shows.

That more than 15-fold surge in Russian oil purchases by India provided Moscow with critical import earnings while it grappled with the fallout from its war in Ukraine, and seriously undermined international efforts to cut funding to Moscow.

However, while India's refusal to join Western-led sanctions drew ire from the international community, its willingness to step up imports of Russian oil ensured that its refiners and fuel consumers were shielded from any rise in global oil prices.

Indeed, the opposite has occurred as Indian importers were able to extract steep discounts from Russian oil sellers who were desperate to secure sales wherever they could.

Those cheap imported Russian barrels in turn allowed major Indian refiners such as Reliance RELI.NS to expand supplies and fuel the country's economic growth since 2020.

Indian authorities have stated that providing energy security for its 1.4 billion population has been the main driver of its oil import program, and that the new tariffs are unfair given that the country is only acting in its own self-interest.

What's more, any aggressive pivot away from cheap Russian oil to pricier U.S. crude would drastically change the economic outlook for Indian oil refiners and consumers, and likely result in a surge in fuel prices that would cause economic harm.

Since 2022, the official prices of the main grade of Russian oil imported by India have averaged around $70 a barrel, which is around $10 cheaper than the price of the main U.S. crude for export over that same period, data from LSEG shows.

As Indian importers likely secured their Russian oil supplies at even lower prices, the real discount compared to U.S. prices is likely larger.

That in turn means that there is almost no prospect of Indian refiners being able to profitably switch to U.S. crude any time soon, even if pressured to do so.

LNG & Coal Longshots

U.S. trade negotiators have touted U.S. liquefied natural gas (LNG) as a means of reducing trade gaps, as a single LNG cargo can cost several million dollars.

However, Indian energy product importers have arguably even less scope to switch out current suppliers for the U.S. here.

The primary limiting factor is that Indian gas importers are already locked into long-term purchase deals with suppliers such as Qatar and the United Arab Emirates, and face stiff penalties for breaking contracts.

And even if Indian buyers were prepared to tear up those deals in favor of buying from the U.S. instead, they would face a surge in shipping costs that could make overall cargo costs uneconomical.

The journey time for an LNG tanker from the U.S. to India is around 30 days, which is six times longer than the trip from Qatar.

U.S. coal exporters will likely face similar difficulties in dislodging Indonesia from India's coal import pipeline.

The Indonesia to India shipping time is around 11 days, compared to around 27 days for the trip from the U.S. East coast.

Such a yawning gap in journey times and shipping costs means that India's trade negotiators may not be able to rely on its energy consumers to close the trade gap, and will need to look elsewhere to secure a trade deal with the U.S.

The opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters.

Trump Is Chopping Up NASA These two satellites are the only federally run instruments specifically designed to track planet-warming carbon dioxide from space.
Instead of a public fight over next year’s budget, Trump officials are allegedly trying to prematurely shut down missions already funded for 2025.
Senator Chris Van Hollen, a senior appropriator, was just as blunt: “We rejected cuts that would have devastated NASA science by 47 percent.
In this case, just dismantle the infrastructure of climate science, piece by piece.","According to multiple sources and internal NASA communications, senior Trump administration officials have instructed NASA to prepare for the termination (and literal destruction) of the Orbiting Carbon Observatories, OCO-2 and OCO-3.

These satellites are widely used by farmers, the oil industry, and a number of scientists and NGO groups. Their mission is to measure carbon dioxide and track plant growth and they’ve been doing it for years. They are among the best tools Earth has for understanding climate change, which makes this decision all the more bizarre.

There’s no technical reason to end either mission. No major failures or cost overruns. The equipment in space is state-of-the-art. In fact, NASA’s own 2023 review found the data coming from the satellites to be “exceptionally high quality.” The missions were recommended for continuation through at least 2026, likely beyond.

But the current US administration wants them gone. This has no apparent reason other than just hiding climate data and, according to critics, it’s illegal.

Trump Is Chopping Up NASA

These two satellites are the only federally run instruments specifically designed to track planet-warming carbon dioxide from space. They map the flow of CO₂ across Earth’s atmosphere, showing how much is being emitted, where it’s coming from, and how much is being absorbed by forests, oceans, and fields. They’re also used to monitor plant health by measuring solar-induced fluorescence (SIF), a faint glow emitted by plants during photosynthesis.

This is practical data used in multiple fields. Farmers use OCO data to track crop health. The USDA uses it for long-term planning. Even oil and gas companies rely on this data to model carbon sinks and risks to infrastructure.

David Crisp, a retired NASA atmospheric physicist who was the principal investigator of the original OCO mission and was OCO-2’s science team leader, says several NASA employees called and asked him questions indicating they were looking for ways to shut the satellites down.

“What I have heard is direct communications from people who were making those plans, who weren’t allowed to tell me that that’s what they were told to do. But they were allowed to ask me questions,” Crisp said. “They were asking me very sharp questions. The only thing that would have motivated those questions was [that] somebody told them to come up with a termination plan.”

This isn’t the first time Trump has taken a hatchet to NASA’s science division.

Battling with the Budget

In 2018, during his first term, Trump tried to cancel the original Orbiting Carbon Observatory program along with four other Earth science missions. He failed then. Congress restored the funding. But now, with a Congress that seems to bend to Trump’s very whim, fewer checks in place, and a team of loyalists in key agency positions, the dynamic is very different.

Instead of a public fight over next year’s budget, Trump officials are allegedly trying to prematurely shut down missions already funded for 2025. According to a July letter signed by 64 members of Congress, that kind of move violates federal law. It’s called impoundment — when the executive branch refuses to spend money that Congress has already approved.

“This is illegal,” says Rep. Zoe Lofgren, a Democrat from California. “Congress has the power of the purse, not Trump or Vought [from the Office of Management and Budget].”

Eliminating funds or scaling down the operations of Earth-observing satellites would be catastrophic and would severely impair our ability to forecast, manage, and respond to severe weather and climate disasters.

Senator Chris Van Hollen, a senior appropriator, was just as blunt: “We rejected cuts that would have devastated NASA science by 47 percent. Eliminating Earth-monitoring satellites would be catastrophic.”

It’s Falling Apart

The Senate’s draft 2026 budget explicitly rejects the Trump administration’s proposed Earth science terminations. It also includes a subtle but critical directive: NASA must “retain public ownership of technologies, scientific data, and discoveries made using public funds.” In other words: don’t privatize Earth science. Don’t scrap satellites built with taxpayer dollars. And don’t throw away the data we need to survive.

Yet, the White House is moving to do just that. This isn’t just about two satellites. It’s about trust, data, and NASA’s role in helping people, and that’s being dismantled step by step. Just recently, Trump’s NASA refused to publish a climate change report that it had already completed, citing ‘no legal obligation’ to do so.

The satellites could still be saved, but it won’t be easy.

Congress can intervene. It already has, in part. But the clock is ticking. Fiscal year 2025 ends on September 30. If Congress doesn’t pass a new budget (or a continuing resolution) the Trump administration could claim the power to start shutting down missions preemptively. They’ve already shown a willingness to do so.

The Trump administration’s strategy is clear: move fast and break all the things you don’t like. Do it quietly and don’t ask permission. In this case, just dismantle the infrastructure of climate science, piece by piece.

For a country that claims to be the leader in science and innovation, killing your carbon-monitoring satellites in the middle of a climate crisis is about as self-sabotaging as it gets. The data is valuable and the costs are low, but Trump has repeatedly expressed his denial of climate change, and these satellites pose a major barrier to that argument.

At the end of the day, you can take down all the satellites in the sky, the carbon will still rise. The planet will still get warmer.

When it comes to speeding up renewable energy deployment, there’s at least one big obstacle that governors have little control over.","Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act put new expiration dates on clean energy tax credits for business and consumers, raising the cost of climate action. Now some states are rushing to accelerate renewable energy projects and get as many underway as possible before the new deadlines take effect.

The new law requires wind and solar developers to start construction by the end of this year in order to claim the full investment or production tax credits under the rules established by the Inflation Reduction Act. They’ll then have at least four years to get their project online.

Those that miss the end-of-year deadline will have another six months, until July 4, 2026, to start construction, but will have to meet complicated sourcing restrictions on materials from China. Any projects that get off the ground after that date will face a severely abbreviated schedule — they’ll have to be completed by the end of 2027 to qualify, an all-but-impossibly short construction timeline.

Adding even more urgency to the time crunch, President Trump has directed the Treasury Department to revise the rules that define what it means to “start construction.” Historically, a developer could start construction simply by purchasing key pieces of equipment. But Trump’s order called for “preventing the artificial acceleration or manipulation of eligibility and by restricting the use of broad safe harbors unless a substantial portion of a subject facility has been built,” an ominous sign for those racing to meet already accelerated deadlines.

While the changes won’t suppress adoption of these technologies entirely, they will slow deployment and make renewable energy more expensive than it otherwise would have been. Some states that have clean energy goals are trying to lock in as much subsidized generation as they can to lessen the blow.

There are two ways states can meet the moment, Justin Backal Balik, the state program director at the nonprofit Evergreen Action, told me. Right now, many are trying to address the immediate crisis by helping to usher shovel-ready projects through regulatory processes. But states should also be thinking about how to make projects more economical after the tax credits expire, Balik said. “Green states can play a role in tilting the scale slightly back in the direction of some of the projects being financially viable,” he said, “even understanding that they’re not going to be able to make up all of the lost ground the incentives provided.”

In the first category, Colorado Governor Jared Polis sent a letter last week to utilities and independent power producers in the state committing to use “all of the Colorado State Government to prioritize deployment of clean energy projects.”

“Getting this right is of critical importance to Colorado ratepayers,” Polis wrote. The nonprofit research group Energy Innovation estimates that household energy expenses in Colorado could be $170 higher in 2030 than they would have been because of OBBB, and $310 higher in 2035. “The goal is to integrate maximal clean energy by securing as much cost-effective electric generation under construction or placed in service as soon as possible, along with any necessary electricity balancing resources and supporting infrastructure,” Polis continued.

As for how he plans to do that, he said the state would work to “eliminate administrative barriers and bottlenecks” for renewable energy, promising faster state reviews for permits. It will also “facilitate the pre-purchase of project equipment,” since purchasing equipment is one of the key steps developers can take to meet the tax credit deadlines.

Other states are looking to quickly secure new contracts for renewable energy. In mid-July, two weeks after the reconciliation bill became law, utility regulators in Maine moved to rapidly procure nearly 1,600 gigawatt-hours of wind and solar — for context, that’s about 13% of the total energy the state currently generates. They gave developers just two weeks to submit proposals, and will prioritize projects sited on agricultural land that has been contaminated with per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, the chemicals known as PFAS. (When asked how many applications had been submitted, the Maine Public Utilities Commission said it doesn't share that information prior to project selection.)

Connecticut’s Department of Energy and Environmental Protection is eyeing a similar move. During a public webinar in late July, the agency said it was considering an accelerated procurement of zero-carbon resources “before the tax increase takes effect.” The office put out a request for information to renewable energy developers the next day to see if there were any projects ready to go that would qualify for the tax credits. Officials also encouraged developers to contact the agency’s concierge permit assistance services if they are worried about getting their permits on time for tax credit eligibility. Katie Dykes, the agency’s commissioner, said during the presentation that the concierge will engage with permit staff to make sure there aren’t incomplete or missing documents and to “ensure smooth and efficient review of projects.”

New York’s energy office is planning to do another round of procurement in September, the outlet New York Focus has reported, although the solicitation is late — it had originally been scheduled for June. The state has more than two dozen projects in the pipeline that are permitted but haven’t yet started construction, according to Focus, and some of them are waiting to secure contracts with the state.

Others are simply held up by the web of approvals New York requires, but better coordination between New York agencies may be in the works. “I assembled my team immediately and we are trying to do everything we can to expedite those [renewable energy projects] that are already in the pipeline to get those the approvals they need to move ahead,” Governor Kathy Hochul said during a rally at the State University of New York’s Niagara campus last week. The state’s energy research and development agency has formed a team “to help commercial projects quickly troubleshoot and advance towards construction,” according to the nonprofit Evergreen Action. (The agency did not respond to a request for more information about the effort.)

States and local governments are also planning to ramp up marketing of the consumer-based credits that are set to expire. Colorado, for example, launched a new “Energy Savings Navigator” tool to help residents identify all of the rebate, tax credit, and energy bill assistance programs they may be eligible for.

Consumers have even less time to act than wind and solar developers. Discounts for new, used, and leased electric vehicles will end in less than two months, on September 30. Homeowners must install solar panels, batteries, heat pumps, and any other clean energy or efficiency upgrades before the end of this year to qualify for tax credits.

Many states offer additional incentives for these technologies, and some are re-tooling their programs to stretch the funding. Connecticut saw a rush of demand for its electric vehicle rebate program, CHEAPR, after the OBBB passed. Officials decided to slash the subsidy from $1,500 to $500 as of August 1, and will re-assess the program in the fall. “The budget that we have for the CHEAPR program is finite,” Dykes said during the July webinar. “We are trying to be good stewards of those dollars in light of the extraordinary demand for EVs, so that after October 1 we have the best chance to be able to provide an enhanced rebate, to lessen the significant drop in the total level of incentives that are available for electric vehicles.”

As far as trying to address the longer-term challenges for renewables, Balik highlighted Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro’s proposal to streamline energy siting decisions by passing them through a new state board. “One of the big things states can do is siting reform because local opposition and lawsuits that drag forever are a big drag on costs,” Balik told me.

A bill that would create a Reliable Energy Siting and Electric Transition Board, or RESET Board, is currently in the Pennsylvania legislature. (New York State took similar steps to establish a renewable siting office to speed up deployment in 2020, though so far it’s still taking an average of three years to permit projects, down from four to five years prior to the office’s establishment.) Connecticut officials also discussed looking at ways to reduce the “soft costs” of permitting and environmental reviews during the July webinar.

Balik added that state green banks can also play a role in helping projects secure more favorable financing. Their capacity to do so will be significantly higher if the courts force the federal government to administer the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund.

When it comes to speeding up renewable energy deployment, there’s at least one big obstacle that governors have little control over. Wind and solar projects need approval from regional transmission operators, the independent bodies that oversee the transmission and distribution of power, to connect to the grid — a notoriously slow process. The lag is especially long in the PJM Interconnection, which governs the grid for 13 mid-Atlantic States, and has generally favored natural gas over renewables. But governors are starting to turn up the pressure on PJM to do better. In mid July, Shapiro and nine other governors demanded PJM give states more of a say in the process by allowing them to propose candidates for two of PJM’s board seats.",https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy82MTE5NDM0Mi9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTgwNDM4OTc2OH0.o2KZ2b-x1MXadeJOWDgZjtLByKTrFG3K5YgdLJa0rR4/image.jpg?width=1200&height=600&coordinates=0%2C100%2C0%2C100,N,,2025-08-11 18:04:00.372604

What do an offshore wind farm in New York, a campaign to install 275,000 heat pumps in Maine, and the cancellation of the Keystone XL pipeline have in common? They were all the result of “community-based strategies” with involvement or leadership from local grassroots groups. Advocates say this is a powerful and relatively cheap way of driving climate action, especially as the Trump administration rolls back as much progress as it can.

A new report is the first to put hard numbers to that effectiveness in the United States and Canada. The analysis quantifies how much carbon a given law, protest movement, or clean energy project will keep out of the atmosphere. It also calculates the amount spent on the local efforts advancing each campaign to determine the cost of preventing each metric ton of CO2 equivalent from being released. (CO2 equivalent is a measurement that considers other greenhouse gases like methane.) “The numbers really did show that these had meaningful impacts and a good return on investment,” said Sam Greenberg, a director at Redstone Strategy Group and a coauthor of the report. “The benefits are not limited just to the quantifiable carbon impact — even though that’s what we were focusing on — but also understanding the full picture of all the other co-benefits we saw coming out of this.”

That wind farm in New York, for instance, will keep 7.7 million metric tons of CO2 equivalent out of the atmosphere by 2030, at a philanthropic cost of just 3 cents per ton, the report notes. A solar farm on the Moapa River Indian Reservation in Nevada will avoid 4.2 million metric tons in the same period, costing 12 cents per ton. Both are slowing climate change and reducing the air pollution that usually comes out of coal or natural gas power plants. That, in turn, brings the added benefit of improving human health.

The report considered the supply side of things as well. The Keystone XL pipeline would have ferried crude oil from Canada to refineries in the United States. But after 10 years of legal battles and fearsome opposition by environmentalists, Indigenous groups, and farmers along the route, the developer abandoned the project in 2021. The victory means that between 52 million and 105 million metric tons won’t be released by 2030, the report finds. The local advocacy efforts cost $2.6 million, or 2 to 5 cents per ton. “You can make a solid argument that both the supply-side efforts and the renewable energy development can both have a meaningful impact,” Greenberg said.

Community activism for state policies, too, are majorly slashing emissions. In 2023, Maine blew past its goal of installing 100,000 heat pumps two years ahead of schedule. Now it wants to install another 175,000 by 2027. Because the devices run on electricity, the state can power them with renewable energy, avoiding 1.2 million metric tons of CO2 equivalent by 2030, according to the report.

Heat pumps are a good example of climate action not necessarily being branded as such. People might want to adopt the appliances because they’re more efficient, or to avoid burning toxic gas in a furnace. Advocates can also pitch renewable energy projects like wind and solar farms as job creators. “The additional benefits of climate action, those are usually the motivating factors for people,” said Dan Jasper, senior policy advisor at Project Drawdown, a climate solutions group that wasn’t involved in the report. “Things like employment, health, less pollution — these are the things that people most fundamentally agree on, and it helps to move conversations beyond the political deadlock.”

With a lack of sufficient leadership on climate even before Donald Trump took office again, it’s been up to states to set their own policies. In 2019, New York passed the landmark Climate Leadership and Community Protection Act after years of organizing and campaigning by the coalition NY Renews. It commits the state to 100 percent clean electricity by 2040. But even before that, the report notes, by 2030 the law will have canceled 58 million to 120 million metric tons of CO2 equivalent. With $10 million spent on local philanthropic efforts, the cost comes to between 8 and 17 cents per ton.

Cities, too, are crucibles for climate action. The report notes that in 2019, San Jose, California, became the biggest city in the U.S. to mandate that all new single-family homes, duplexes, and multifamily homes of three stories or less be built without natural gas hookups. That means occupants will be running conventional electric or induction stoves and heat pumps, all electrified with ever more renewable power on the grid. The philanthropic support for the effort cost $1 million, avoiding 887,000 metric tons of CO2 equivalent by 2030.

“It’s kind of remarkable how much mitigation you can get from community-based, grassroots-promoted activities,” said Rhea Suh, president and CEO of the Marin Community Foundation, which collaborates with donors and nonprofits. (Redstone prepared the report for them, as well as the MacArthur Foundation and Equation Campaign.) “It is clear that policies that were created from the ground up tend to last longer than the top-down policies.”

That’s due to increased engagement, Suh adds. Whereas the federal government dictates broad policies across the whole country, mayors and governors are more in tune with what their people actually want. By working on a more granular level with communities, organizers and politicians can collaborate with residents, not dictate. “The durability comes from just the equity sweat that is put into these things,” Suh said.

Adjustments to rates are not about increasing profit, but investing in the long-term health, reliability, and resiliency of Bloomington’s water infrastructure.","Bloomington, Ind. – As part of a broader effort to continue delivering reliable water service with fewer interruptions and a billing system that better reflects how customers use water, the City of Bloomington Utilities (CBU) has begun the process of adjusting its water rates. This proposal reflects CBU’s commitment to ensuring the continued resilience of its infrastructure and its ability to keep pace with increasing maintenance and operation costs by conducting a comprehensive rate review every four years.

As part of this process, a cost-of-service study—completed in early 2025—allowed CBU to more accurately determine each user’s impact on the water utility and use that information to distribute rates more fairly. This was accomplished using smart meter data to provide a more detailed, accurate picture of usage for each customer class, an approach that was requested during the most recent rate case.

“This proposal is about stewardship,” said Mayor Kerry Thomson. “Access to clean, safe water—and the systems that carry it in, carry it away, and protect our environment in the process—is a public health responsibility. Most people don’t wake up thinking about water infrastructure, and that's a good thing. It means the system is doing its job. Behind every tap, storm drain, and flush is a web of decisions we have to get right. From neighborhood kitchens to school fountains to fire hydrants and community splash pads, water connects us all. This plan ensures that connection stays strong and resilient for the long haul.”

If approved, the proposed rate structure would be implemented in mid-to-late 2026. Once available, details about the proposed rates and the upcoming rate case will be posted online atbloomington.in.gov/utilities/rates.

To ensure continued service reliability and water quality, CBU is prioritizing upgrades to the Monroe Water Treatment Plant. Although selective improvements have been made to the plant during its 60 years of service, many systems need more comprehensive updates.

The construction of a new service center at the former Winston Thomas wastewater treatment plant is another priority of this rate case. CBU has outgrown its current facility, which can no longer support the staffing, equipment and material storage needs of today's utility.

A detailed list of the projects supported by this rate adjustment is available in CBU’s Capital Improvement Plan. These investments are essential to maintaining a safe, reliable water system that can meet Bloomington’s long-term needs.

The proposed rate case will be discussed at the following meetings, all of which are open to the public and will be held at the Utilities Service Center at 600 E. Miller Drive:

Monday, Aug. 25 at 5 p.m. – The Utilities Services Board will review the proposed rate changes. Anyone is welcome to attend and speak.

If approved by the Utilities Services Board, the case will be heard again at a Bloomington City Council meeting at Bloomington City Hall, 401 N. Morton St. This meeting, which will offer another opportunity for public input, will be scheduled and noticed at a later date.

If approved by the City Council, the plan will be submitted to the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission, the state agency that reviews and regulates utility rates. The Commission will hold its own separate hearings before making a final decision.

If all approvals are granted, the new rates will take effect in mid-to-late 2026. CBU is fully ratepayer funded, meaning every dollar invested in the water system comes directly from the people who rely on it—residents, businesses, institutions, and wholesale customers.

The letter was signed by Ranking Member Frank Pallone, Jr. (D-NJ), Environment Subcommittee Ranking Member Paul Tonko (D-NY), and Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee Ranking Member Yvette D. Clarke (D-NY).

Their letter comes on the heels of Zeldin’s announcement last week that EPA will begin illegally clawing back obligated Solar for All funding – a $7 billion residential solar program that is part of the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund.

“You continue to wage an unprecedented and defamatory assault on this fund without any credible evidence, weaponizing [EPA] to steal lawfully awarded taxpayer funds,” Pallone, Tonko, and Clarke wrote in their letter to Zeldin. “We have made multiple requests directing you to share any credible evidence that supports your accusations of waste, fraud, and abuse. However, as your own lawyers have confirmed, EPA has been unable to substantiate any of these claims.”

The three Committee leaders noted that in the Trump Administration’s latest attempt to dismantle critical programs, it has falsely claimed that enactment of H.R. 1 – Trump’s Big Ugly Bill – gave them the authority to take back obligated funds. But the Democrats pointed out that these claims are not even supported by congressional Republicans, as the vast majority of funding was obligated to projects across the country prior to enactment of H.R. 1.

“The same holds true for the Environmental and Climate Justice Block Grants, which invested $3 billion in community-led projects that address environmental and public health harms related to pollution and the worsening climate crisis,” they wrote. “The truth is the vast majority of Environmental and Climate Justice Block Grants were obligated to projects across the country prior to enactment of H.R. 1, yet you continue to try to steal these promised funds.”

The lawmakers cited language in H.R. 1 which specifies it only applies to unobligated funds and is not retroactive. The Democrats noted that the Congressional Budget Office’s (CBO) assessment confirms this reading of the law.

“Even if you were not inclined to follow the letter of the law or the interpretation of CBO, you could instead simply listen to what Congressional Republicans themselves said during debate on H.R. 1,” they continued. “Congressional Republicans made clear that the provisions in H.R. 1 do not affect obligated funds.”

Pallone, Tonko, and Clarke went on to directly quote Congressman Griffith, then-Chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee’s Subcommittee on Environment, who during the May 13, 2025 markup of H.R. 1 said(link is external):

“If a grant was already given, as far as this bill is concerned, then that would still be going forward… If the grant has already been granted and the money is obligated, then this — then our language does not affect that. […] We can’t rescind expenditures that have already been obligated.”

The three Committee leaders concluded by demanding that Zeldin follow the law and immediately release all funds that have already been obligated.

“Time and again, you have boasted about the unlawful activities EPA is conducting under your leadership without any credible evidence to justify your actions,” they concluded. “Once and for all, stop lying about these programs and grantees. It is long past time for you to release these duly obligated funds promised to communities across the nation.”

OBBBA preserves tax credits under Sections 48E and 45Y for solar projects while phasing them out for wind projects after 2027, accelerating domestic solar expansion.

First Solar and SolarEdge Benefit from OBBBA Provisions

First Solar (FSLR) is a key beneficiary, with UBS raising its price target to $275, citing a $75 per share boost from 45X tax credits. The company's Louisiana facility, set to open in late 2025, will expand its U.S. production capacity to over 10 GW. Meanwhile, SolarEdge (SEDG) reported strong Q2 earnings, aided by its U.S. manufacturing strategy, securing 45X credits for the next seven years.

,Louisiana and Evs,2025-08-11 20:27:58+00:00,The Washington Times,Ford hits the pedal on EV production with $2 billion overhaul of Kentucky plant,"Bruce Schreiner, The Washington Times https:, www.washingtontimes.com",,,,,https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2025/aug/11/ford-hits-pedal-ev-production-2b-overhaul-kentucky-plant/,"The automaker’s top executive unveiled the new EV strategy at Ford’s Louisville Assembly Plant which, after producing gas-powered vehicles for 70 years, will be converted to manufacture electric vehicles.
The traditional assembly line will be transformed into an “assembly tree” at the Louisville plant, it said.
Ford said its investment in the Louisville plant will secure 2,200 hourly jobs.
Ford’s new EV strategy comes as Chinese automakers are quickly expanding across the globe, offering relatively affordable electric vehicles.
“And this new vehicle built in Louisville, Kentucky, is going to be a much better solution to anything that anyone can buy from China,” he added.","LOUISVILLE, Ky. — Ford Motor Co. will invest nearly $2 billion retooling a Kentucky factory to produce electric vehicles that it says will be more affordable, more profitable to build, and will outcompete rival models.

The automaker’s top executive unveiled the new EV strategy at Ford’s Louisville Assembly Plant which, after producing gas-powered vehicles for 70 years, will be converted to manufacture electric vehicles.

“In our careers, as automobile people we’re lucky if we get to work on one, maybe two, projects that really change the face of our industry,” CEO Jim Farley told plant workers in Kentucky on Monday. “And I believe today is going to light the match as one of those projects for all of us here.”

The Big Detroit automakers have continued to transition from internal combustion engines to EV technology even as President Donald Trump’s administration unwinds incentives for automakers to go electric. Trump’s massive tax and spending law targets EV incentives, including the imminent removal of a credit that saves buyers up to $7,500 on a new electric car.

Yet Farley and other top executives in the auto industry say that electric vehicles are the future and there is no going back.

The first EV to roll off the revamped Louisville assembly line will be a midsize, four-door electric pickup truck in 2027 for domestic and international markets, the company said Monday.

The new electric trucks will be powered by lower-cost batteries made at a Ford factory in Michigan. The Detroit automaker previously announced a $3 billion investment to build the battery factory.

The automaker sees this as a “Model T moment” for its EV business - a reference to revolutionary changes on the production line led by the company’s founder, Henry Ford, when it began churning out vehicles from a factory more than a century ago. Farley said the changes will will upend how electric vehicles are made in the U.S.

“It represents the most radical change on how we design and how we build vehicles at Ford since the Model-T,” Farley said.

The company said it will use a universal platform and production system for its EVs, essentially the underpinning of a vehicle that can be applied across a wide range of models.

The Louisville factory - one of two Ford assembly plants in Kentucky’s largest city - will be revamped to cut production costs and make assembly time faster as it’s prepared to churn out electric vehicles.

The result will be “an affordable electric vehicle that we expect to be profitable,” Farley said in an interview with The Associated Press ahead of the announcement. “This is an example of us rejuvenating our U.S. plants with the most modern manufacturing techniques.”

The new platform enables a lineup of affordable vehicles to be produced at scale, Ford said. It will reduce parts by 20% versus a typical vehicle, with 25% fewer fasteners, 40% fewer workstations dock-to-dock in the plant and a 15% faster assembly time, Ford said. The traditional assembly line will be transformed into an “assembly tree” at the Louisville plant, it said. Instead of one long conveyor, three sub-assembly lines will operate simultaneously and then join together, it said.

Other specifications for the midsize electric truck – including its reveal date, starting price, EPA-estimated battery range, battery sizes and charge times - will be announced later, the company said. Ford revealed in its release that the truck will have a targeted starting price of about $30,000.

Ford said its investment in the Louisville plant will secure 2,200 hourly jobs.

Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear said Monday that the automaker’s plans for the Louisville plant will strengthen a more than century-old partnership between Ford and the Bluegrass State.

“This announcement not only represents one of the largest investments on record in our state, it also boosts Kentucky’s position at the center of EV-related innovation and solidifies Louisville Assembly Plant as an important part of Ford’s future,” Beshear said.

Ford said its combined investment of about $5 billion at the Kentucky assembly plant and Michigan battery plant is expected to create or secure nearly 4,000 direct jobs between the two plants while strengthening the domestic supply chain with dozens of new U.S.-based suppliers.

Ford previously forecast weaker earnings growth for this year and further losses in its electric vehicles business as it works to control costs. Model e, Ford’s electric vehicle business, posted a full-year loss of $5.08 billion for 2024 as revenue fell 35% to $3.9 billion.

Ford’s new EV strategy comes as Chinese automakers are quickly expanding across the globe, offering relatively affordable electric vehicles.

“We’re not in a race to build the most electric cars,” Farley told the AP when asked about competition from China. “We’re in a race to have a sustainable electric business that’s profitable, that customers love.

“And this new vehicle built in Louisville, Kentucky, is going to be a much better solution to anything that anyone can buy from China,” he added.",https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2025/08/11/Ford_Electric_Vehicles_56551_c0-0-5366-3130_s1200x700.jpg?f1d08162b355d20a88109cdde85bf83673f991c0,N,,2025-08-11 18:06:47.221993

Both conventional and advanced modular technologies are gaining traction, while nuclear's potential is expanding into space exploration and alternative energy industries.

A Renaissance in Policy and Regulation

The foundations of the 2025 U.S. nuclear revival lie in a combination of regulatory streamlining and executive orders that have prioritized nuclear energy as a key pillar of national policy. The Accelerating Deployment of Versatile, Advanced Nuclear for Clean Energy Act (ADVANCE Act) enacted in July 2024 and assertively implemented this year, has proven transformative. The law mandates the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) to modernize its licensing process, reduce fees and facilitate advanced reactor deployment, particularly at brownfield and former fossil fuel sites.

The current administration issued a series of executive orders in May 2025 that significantly altered the approval landscape to facilitate implementation of the ADVANCE Act, including:

Executive Order 14301: Reforming Nuclear Reactor Testing at the Department of Energy

Executive Order 14299: Deploying Advanced Nuclear Reactor Technologies for National Security

Under these directives, the Department of Energy (DOE) and Department of Defense (DOD) gained authority to conduct reactor design reviews whose findings are presumptively binding on the NRC, unless explicit safety objections arise. Critics argue this compromises NRC independence and raises concerns of regulatory capture by the nuclear industry, while proponents see it as a necessary acceleration to meet growing electricity demand and global competitiveness.

Surge in Advanced Reactor Development

This regulatory support has translated into real-world momentum for several reactor designs. NuScale Power achieved a key milestone in May when its updated 77 MWe small modular reactor (SMR) received standard design approval from the NRC. This marks the first such approval in years and positions NuScale as a potential leader in scalable nuclear deployment.

Also in May, Kairos Power commenced construction of the Hermes Low-Power Demonstration Reactor in Tennessee. The company’s use of molten salt coolant and pebble-fuel technology offers an alternative to conventional water-cooled systems, with enhanced safety and thermal efficiency. Kairos' strategic partnership with Google — which aims to power AI data centers with a 500 MW fleet of SMRs — has further elevated its visibility and commercial prospects.

Terrestrial Energy also made headlines in 2025, launching a $280 million SPAC deal to become the first nuclear molten salt reactor company to go public and reaching a siting agreement with Texas A&M University for its Integral Molten Salt Reactor (IMSR). The reactor's ability to operate at higher temperatures and provide industrial heat in addition to power production may help it secure a foothold in decarbonizing heavy industry.

Private Sector Investment and the AI Catalyst

Beyond policy, one of the defining drivers of the nuclear revival in 2025 has been the private sector — especially the tech industry. In a shift that would have seemed improbable just a few years ago, cloud and artificial intelligence (AI) giants have emerged as major nuclear advocates and investors.

Amazon’s Climate Pledge Fund led a $500 million investment in X-energy to support advanced small modular nuclear reactors and expand carbon-free power. The investment targets up to 5 GW of new nuclear capacity to support AI and cloud computing demands. Meta issued a request for proposals for four GW of new nuclear power to help meet AI and sustainability objectives. These moves reflect a broader trend among energy-intensive tech companies recognizing that nuclear is one of the few scalable, dispatchable clean energy sources capable of supporting massive computer workloads.

Perhaps the most ambitious new project to date is the Fermi America “Hypergrid” outside Amarillo, Texas, announced in July 2025 in collaboration with the Texas Tech University System. This planned 5,800-acre clean energy park will co-locate 4.4 GW of nuclear capacity — including AP1000 light-water reactors and future SMRs — with solar, battery storage and natural gas backup. The site is being designed specifically to host AI data center clusters, with 1 GW of nuclear targeted for deployment by 2026. The project is backed by recent Texas legislation (House Bill 14) that dedicates $350 million to advanced nuclear development and establishes the Texas Advanced Nuclear Energy Office.

Reviving Legacy Sites and Reactors

2025 has also witnessed renewed interest in previously shuttered or stalled nuclear assets. Holtec International, for instance, is leading efforts to restart the Palisades Nuclear Plant, a nuclear plant in Michigan that was retired in 2022. With $1.8 billion in combined funding from the DOE and state funding, the plant is expected to resume operations in 2026. Holtec also plans to deploy its SMR-300 reactor design at the same site by 2030, creating a unique hybrid of legacy and next-generation infrastructure.

Similarly, Santee Cooper and other stakeholders in South Carolina have revived discussions about acquiring and finishing V.C. Summer Nuclear Station Units 2 and 3. These Westinghouse AP1000 reactors were abandoned in 2017 due to cost overruns and mismanagement. However, with renewed federal interest, improved construction practices, and the influence of tech sector demand, completing the units is now seen as viable.

In perhaps the most creative crossover of resurrecting the old and using it to power new cutting edge AI development, Microsoft and Constellation announced an agreement in September 2024 “to reopen the Three Mile Island Unit 1 nuclear reactor, adding a new source of carbon-free electricity to offset the power demands of Microsoft’s expanding network of data centers.” Microsoft agreed to a 20-year supply agreement, with the parties aiming to have Unit 1 ready to restart in 2028, after repairs, renovation and NRC approval.

New Projects and Initiatives

In addition to ongoing efforts, several new nuclear projects and initiatives gained momentum in 2025:

TerraPower’s Natrium Demonstration Reactor (Wyoming): In January 2025, the 345 MWe sodium-cooled Natrium reactor, with integrated molten salt energy storage, received State approval of construction permits. Backed by DOE and private funding, it aims to begin operation by 2030.

Project Pele Mobile Microreactor (Department of Defense/BWX Technologies): In August 2025, BWX Technologies started fabricating the core for a 1.5 MW TRISO-fueled microreactor for military and remote use, targeting operation for 2028.

Oklo’s Aurora Microreactor (Eielson Air Force Base, Alaska): Selected by the U.S. Air Force, this1-2 MW microreactor will support energy resilience at Eielson Air Force Base under a 30-year agreement.

TVA & GE Hitachi’s BWRX‑300 (Clinch River, Tennessee): In May 2025 TVA submitted a construction permit application for the first U.S. deployment of GEH’s 300 MWe BWRX‑300 SMR. Licensing is underway with federal support.

New York Power Authority SMR Directive: In June 2025, Governor Hochul directed the New York Power Authority to develop a zero-emission advanced nuclear energy technology power plan to develop a zero-emission nuclear project — the state’s first in over 15 years.

DOE Fuel Line Pilot Program: On August 4, DOE selected Standard Nuclear selected Standard Nuclear for the first pilot project in the fuel line pilot program , announced in June 2025. The initiative, issued pursuant to the Executive Order 14299, is intended to eliminate America’s reliance on foreign sources of enriched uranium. Standard Nuclear will pioneer advanced fuel production in Tennessee to support emerging HALEU-based designs (high-assay, low-enriched uranium).

These projects underscore a broadened scope of nuclear development: from utility-scale and military deployments to regional power authority innovation and supply chain investments.

New Frontiers

Beyond grid power, nuclear technology is finding new applications that expand its strategic importance. On August 4, Politico reported that the Department of Transportation is issuing a directive to NASA to expedite formal plans to solicit industry proposals to deploy a 100-KW reactor on the Moon by 2030. The project is designed to provide surface power for future lunar bases and pave the way for eventual Mars missions. While the plan is optimistically ambitious, it faces a number of hurdles, including technical and engineering feasibility, budgetary and manpower constraints, and regulatory hurdles notwithstanding the favorable new policies.

State-Level Policy Acceleration

While federal policy sets the tone, states are increasingly active in promoting nuclear development. Texas, Michigan, Indiana, Utah, Arizona and Tennessee have introduced new laws to facilitate SMR siting, provide financial incentives and coordinate permitting. Tennessee, already home to Kairos Power's demonstration site, is positioning itself as a national hub for advanced reactor development.

These state-level initiatives are often framed as economic development strategies as well as decarbonization tools. SMRs offer a compelling opportunity to optimize grid connections, retain skilled labor and stimulate rural economies.

Challenges and Cautionary Notes

Despite strong tailwinds, challenges remain. Critics warn that pressure on the NRC to expedite approvals could compromise long-term safety. Environmental and nonproliferation groups continue to raise concerns over spent fuel management, proliferation risks and the potential for cost overruns.

Cost and timeline uncertainties also linger. While SMRs promise lower capital costs and faster builds, few have reached commercial scale. The cancellation of NuScale’s Carbon Free Nuclear Power Project in 2023 due to rising costs still casts a long shadow. Whether the new wave of reactors can deliver on time and on budget remains to be seen.

Supply chain constraints — from enriched fuel to specialized manufacturing components — pose additional risks. The U.S. currently lacks sufficient capacity for HALEU, which many advanced reactors require. Investments in domestic enrichment facilities are underway, but bottlenecks may slow deployment. Successful implementation of the DOE’s fuel line pilot program to develop or build and operate nuclear fuel lines will be critical to increasing nuclear power production capacity.

Conclusion

2025 has been a pivotal year for U.S. nuclear power. Legislative reforms, executive action, and an unprecedented wave of private investment have reignited momentum for both conventional and advanced nuclear energy. From restarting shuttered plants to siting next-generation reactors at data center campuses and even on the Moon, the range of applications is rapidly expanding.

Ultimately, success will depend on execution. Maintaining safety standards, delivering projects on schedule, and building public trust are essential. If the U.S. nuclear industry can navigate these hurdles, 2025 may come to be remembered not just as a turning point, but as the beginning of a sustained nuclear revival.",https://natlawreview.com/sites/default/files/styles/article_image/public/2025-08/nuclear-energy-power-plant-19570208.jpg.webp?itok=Qhgsd5Em,N,,2025-08-11 17:04:37.244595

Siemens Energy operates across four key business areas: Wind Power Generation (Siemens Gamesa): Our focus here is to expand renewable energy generation capacity.
This is crucial given Mexico's target of reaching 45% renewable energy generation by 2030.
How is Siemens Energy positioned to help Mexico achieve this target, and what role are electrification technologies playing in this?
This expansion will further consolidate Mexico's role as a key country for Siemens Energy, contributing significant added value from a Mexican perspective.","Q: From Siemens Energy's perspective, what has been your overarching adaptation strategy over the past two years to navigate the evolving energy market in Mexico?

A: Siemens Energy is a fully independent company, separated from Siemens since 2020. This strategic decision was made to create a company wholly dedicated to the energy sector and the burgeoning energy transition. Today, we refer to this as energy expansion.

Globally, we are observing a significant increase in energy demand, with an even sharper rise in electricity demand driven by the ongoing electrification of society and, more recently, by the advent of artificial intelligence and data centers. Our vision, which is closely aligned with Mexico's context, anticipates a growing demand for technology in both power generation and transmission.

Siemens Energy operates across four key business areas:

Wind Power Generation (Siemens Gamesa): Our focus here is to expand renewable energy generation capacity. In Mexico, we have over 3,000MW installed, representing approximately 37% of the country's total wind generation. This is crucial given Mexico's target of reaching 45% renewable energy generation by 2030.

Gas Services (Power Generation): This is another critical pillar. As electricity demand grows, we are focused on power generation using natural gas and combined cycles. Natural gas is considered a transition fuel because it allows for significant reductions in CO2 emissions. For example, a high-efficiency combined cycle power plant, like those we operate with efficiencies up to 64%, can reduce CO2 emissions by nearly 70% compared to a coal-fired plant. In Mexico, we are currently installing four new, highly efficient combined cycle power plants that will add approximately 2,700MW to the national grid.

Grid Technologies (Transmission): Here, we emphasize that ""there is no transition without transmission."" As electricity demand and electrification grow, transmission plays an essential role in connecting generation points to consumption centers. We are collaborating with CFE on installing new substations and transformers. Mexico is particularly vital in this area as we not only serve the domestic market but also supply other regions, especially the United States. We have a high-voltage circuit breaker factory in Queretaro and two transformer factories in Guanajuato, both undergoing expansion to meet this growing demand.

Transformation of Industries (Industrial Energy Solutions): This unit encompasses our entire energy portfolio for the industrial sector. It includes compressors for oil and gas, smaller steam turbines for industrial use, and an integrated area for electrification, automation, and digitalization. We also have an incipient but developing area focused on green hydrogen, with pilot projects already underway in Mexico.

Q: Mexico is pursuing a goal of 45% clean electricity by 2030. How is Siemens Energy positioned to help Mexico achieve this target, and what role are electrification technologies playing in this?

A: The good news is that the necessary technology is already available. The key is to implement these technologies in parallel. We utilize what we call a decarbonization radar, which outlines three main stages, encompassing all applicable technologies for this electrification process.

The first stage of our radar focuses on energy efficiency, which is paramount for maximizing the efficiency of existing infrastructure. This includes, for example, combined cycle power plants. As I mentioned, our fourth business unit, which focuses on electrification, automation, and digitalization, conducts energy efficiency studies for various industries. For instance, in the oil industry, flare gas, which is currently being released into the atmosphere, can be utilized to generate electricity. This represents a core concept of energy efficiency, alongside analyzing productive processes in industries like oil and cement to identify efficiency gains.

The second stage of our decarbonization radar involves increasing the penetration of renewable energies and hybridization. Hybridization integrates more renewable sources like wind and solar power with batteries, which provide essential firm capacity to the system. Technologies such as synchronous condensers are also vital for stabilizing grid frequency, as renewable energy introduces significant intermittency. Our third business unit, focusing on transmission, not only provides substations and transformers but also specializes in grid stability, power electronics, batteries, and synchronous condensers. These technologies enable the grid to absorb the growing influx of renewable energy in this hybridization process. This ""hybridization"" approach continues to use alternative or transitional fuels.

The third stage, which we call deep decarbonization, looks at the medium term and incorporates hydrogen technologies. We are already working on pilot green hydrogen projects in Mexico. We see green hydrogen being used to produce methanol or synthetic fuels for hard-to-electrify vehicles like airplanes, ships, trucks, and mining vehicles, leading to significant decarbonization in these segments. Furthermore, looking further into the future, our current gas turbines used in combined cycles can burn up to 100% hydrogen. As green hydrogen becomes more competitive, it can be increasingly used in these turbines, leveraging existing assets and creating a virtuous cycle to capitalize on that technology. This actively counters the concept of ""stranded assets,"" assets that become obsolete, by ensuring that combined cycle plants remain valuable as we advance through this third stage of deep decarbonization.

Q: How does Siemens Energy collaborate with the necessary institutions in Mexico to advance projects?

A: When we analyze Mexico's energy matrix, we see an installed capacity of approximately 90GW. However, the actual available capacity is significantly lower. Comparing this available capacity with peak demand periods reveals that the reserve margin can drop to around 1% during high peaks, underscoring the critical need for investment in expanding installed capacity and, subsequently, transmission infrastructure.

A substantial investment plan for the energy sector has been announced by the government with a total of over US$23 billion, set to drive the expansion of generation capacity in wind, solar, and combined cycles, which serve as a crucial transition fuel. Combined cycles also provide firm power, balancing the intermittent nature of renewables and bringing stability to the system.

A significant portion of this investment will be directed toward combined cycles, wind, and solar plants, as well as the modernization of the transmission grid. To directly answer your question, we are actively working with CFE to understand its strategic plan. For instance, having nearly completed the installation of four combined cycle plants, we are now engaging with CFE to identify new combined cycle projects, allowing us to prepare and bid on these opportunities. We are also preparing for wind projects, substation expansions, and grid stability projects to ensure system reliability.

All these initiatives are being pursued in collaboration with CFE. However, while CFE is the primary player, we are also actively engaging with private clients. We are co-creating and co-developing projects in areas like green hydrogen, energy efficiency, or substations for their own consumption. This forms part of our strategic focus. As a German company, we are also exploring the concept of partnerships to see how German institutions can support project development and future financing in Mexico.

Q: What are your main objectives for closing out 2025, and what are your expectations for the Mexican market in 2025 and 2026, considering your longer-term strategy?

A: In renewable energies, our focus is on consolidating our service operations and actively engaging in new wind power projects as they emerge.

For conventional power generation, we aim to advance the construction of the four combined cycle plants currently underway and prepare competitive bids for new combined cycle projects with CFE, thereby expanding generation capacity. In transmission, the primary focus for the next two years is to modernize Mexico's transmission and distribution system. Simultaneously, we are placing significant emphasis on exports from our Queretaro (circuit breakers) and Guanajuato (transformers) factories, and working on their expansion to further grow our international business. Within the Transformation of Industries business area, our objective is to continue supporting our industrial clients and further developing initiatives like green hydrogen.

Transversally, regarding our Competence Hub, we currently have approximately 600 employees, with a short-term goal of exceeding 1,000. This expansion will further consolidate Mexico's role as a key country for Siemens Energy, contributing significant added value from a Mexican perspective.",https://mexicobusiness.news/sites/default/files/styles/crop_16_9/public/2025-08/SiemensEnergy-img-2025-Javier-Pastorino-MBN.jpg?h=d44d1eb7&itok=7qTLdMi4,N,,2025-08-11 20:02:40.900488

From agrivoltaics in New York to one of the nation’s largest solar-plus-storage plants in California, this week’s solar project news spotlights innovation at every scale. This Projects Weekly includes news from developers and partners including Lightstar Renewables, Arevon, Prologis, Shell’s Savion and a Native-led nonprofit.

Lightstar Renewables plans agrivoltaics project in New York

Lightstar Renewables LLC proudly announces the launch of the Plains Road Agrivoltaics project, an initiative that seamlessly integrates solar energy production with agricultural use on the DiMartino Farm in Montgomery, New York. The agricultural consultant on the project was Solar Agricultural Services, Inc. (SolAg). This project demonstrates the new way farmers can both feed and fuel New York state – a forging together of both needed clean energy generation and vital agricultural production.

The Plains Road Agrivoltaics project was designed as an agricultural project from the beginning. The solar installation is tailored to accommodate hay planting and harvest equipment— the core agricultural activity of the DiMartino Farm— and will see an addition of two acres of vegetable production that will provide turnkey access to prime farmland for a new entry farmer. This trailblazing effort is expected to generate enough energy to power 466 homes annually while bolstering the long-term viability of the farm.

A critical foundation of this project was the adjustment of local bylaws to allow for agrivoltaics projects. The Town of Montgomery is one of the first in the State to tailor their bylaws to allow for agrivoltaics projects to maximize agricultural production – such as considering specific height restrictions, setbacks, and lot coverage. This shift highlights the growing acknowledgment of innovative land-use strategies to address the difficult challenges municipal leaders face when considering solar for their towns.

Lightstar is proud that the project aligns with American Farmland Trust’s Smart Solar principles, embodying a vision for responsible solar development that prioritizes farmers, communities, and the environment.

“Lightstar’s project is a prime example of the Smart Solar principles and reaffirms our commitment to fostering partnerships that benefit communities and protect our agricultural heritage,” said Linda Garrett, New York & New Jersey Regional Director at American Farmland Trust (AFT).

Arevon‘s $2 billion Eland Solar + Storage Project now operational

Arevon Energy hosted a ribbon-cutting ceremony to celebrate the completion of the company’s Eland Solar-plus-Storage Project, which is now fully operational. Arevon’s two-phase Eland project, sited near Mojave in Kern County, is one of the nation’s largest solar-plus-storage facilities, with total capital costs of more than $2 billion. Combined, the Eland 1 & 2 projects will be able to power more than 266,000 homes annually, and overall, can provide 7% of the total electricity requirements for the city of Los Angeles.

Arevon developed and will own and operate the Eland Solar-plus-Storage Project, which has a total nameplate capacity of 758 megawatts (MWdc) of solar paired with 300 MW/1,200 megawatt hours of energy storage. Eland 1 reached commercial operation at the end of 2024, and Eland 2 recently commenced full operation — together, the two phases comprise 1.36 million solar panels and 172 lithium iron phosphate batteries (LFP).

“We are building a greener Los Angeles. Arevon’s Eland Solar-plus-Storage Project alone will generate enough power to serve more than 266,000 homes in Los Angeles and push the city’s clean energy share above 60 percent, a major milestone in L.A.’s transition to being powered by 100% clean energy by 2035,” Mayor Bass said. “This is L.A.’s clean energy future — I want to thank LADWP, Arevon, and all of the partners who made this occasion possible.”

The energy generated and stored by Arevon’s Eland is under long-term agreements with SCPPA, who delivers it to its members, LADWP and GWP. The batteries were manufactured locally in Lathrop, California.

But wait, there is more. To date, Arevon has contributed to several community-centered initiatives in the Eland Solar-plus-Storage project area. As the long-term owner and operator of the project, Arevon is committed to continuing its support for local programs throughout the life of the project. In partnership with the Safe Haven Kid’s League of California City, Arevon has helped provide food security, school supplies, infant care items, and workforce reentry programs. The company also supports the I Love California City Economic Development Group, funding infrastructure upgrades and clean-up events for Balsitis Park to promote outdoor activities and community well-being.

Jamestown installs PV system at Levi’s Plaza

Jamestown, a global real estate investment and management firm, announced the installation of a solar energy system at Levi’s Plaza, a nearly one-million-square-foot office campus located along San Francisco’s Embarcadero, in the city’s Northern Waterfront market.

Jamestown partnered with Wunder, a provider of commercial energy solutions, to deploy the 200-kilowatt solar energy system, which is projected to deliver energy cost savings while reducing the environmental impact of the property. The system came online in June and is part of a broader partnership with Wunder to evaluate and deploy solar across applicable sites within Jamestown’s real estate portfolio and development pipeline.

The solar energy system at Levi’s Plaza was a significant element in the property achieving net-zero operational carbon, becoming the first existing, large-scale commercial campus in San Francisco to reach this milestone. The solar energy effort was part of a broader $50 million retrofit, which also included eliminating onsite fossil fuels, converting heating systems to electric, and offsetting remaining emissions.

“Achieving net-zero operational carbon requires a multi-pronged approach, and at Levi’s Plaza, deploying robust solar energy systems was a key part of that strategy,” said Alex Schwiebert, Senior Vice President, West Coast Regional Market Leader at Jamestown. “Sustainability initiatives like this have proven to be a key driver for attracting tenants, while also reducing energy costs.”

“Our work with Jamestown continues to set the bar for sustainability and solar within commercial real estate,” said Dave Riess, CEO of Wunder. “From Larkspur to Levi’s Plaza, we’re seeing how solar can complement a property’s design and function while delivering long-term value to owners and their tenants. It’s always exciting to see a new commercial solar system deployed in downtown San Francisco, and we’re proud to continue growing this partnership.”

Prologis to develop largest rooftop community solar portfolio in Northern Illinois

ComEd and Prologis celebrated a rooftop community solar project in Chicago’s Franklin Park, the first of 45 installations that the global logistics firm is developing across Illinois over the next two years.

The Prologis portfolio is expected to generate 82 megawatts (MW) of solar energy, resulting in the largest rooftop community solar initiative in northern Illinois. More than half of the energy credits will be directed to income-qualified households, expanding access to clean energy in underserved communities in the Chicago area and beyond.

“We’re proud to join ComEd to officially launch this project, the first of many community solar projects that our energy team is deploying across our Illinois rooftops,” said Carter Andrus, Prologis’ Chief Operating Officer. “Illinois is one of the fastest-growing solar markets in the country, and we’re excited to help lead its momentum. For us, this is about more than solar panels—it’s about using our scale to make a real difference in the communities where we operate and bring the benefits of clean energy to more people across Illinois.”

SunVest Solar, a national developer and independent power producer, designed the Franklin Park 3 rooftop community solar installation atop a 195,000-square-foot Prologis logistics center. Prologis will own and operate the 1.56 MW community solar project, which will serve mostly residential customers, with the remaining community solar credits benefiting local businesses.

Prologis is constructing dozens of rooftop community solar projects in northern Illinois, including several in the Chicagoland region. There are currently about 200 active community solar projects interconnected to the ComEd system.

Calibrant energizes VDER project in New York

Calibrant has energized and begun generating Value of Distributed Energy Resources (VDER) credits from three front-of-the-meter battery energy storage systems in New York. Located across Westchester County, these systems utilize U.S.-manufactured battery systems to deliver a combined 13.5 MW / 55.7 MWh of dispatchable capacity to the Con Edison electric grid.

The Westchester portfolio plays an important role in stabilizing the grid, especially during peak summer demand—when electricity is most expensive and grid reliability is critical. In exchange for providing power when the grid needs it most and helping to reduce the need for costly new infrastructure, these projects are compensated through VDER bill credits that offset utility bills.

The Westchester systems showcase a novel commercial approach that enables large commercial and industrial customers to enjoy the financial benefits of distributed energy—without requiring them to host any infrastructure on-site. Calibrant secured 100% of the off-take through direct agreements with C&I customers, creating a pathway for large energy users to benefit from New York’s VDER program. Contracted off-takers include CoreSite—a major data center operator—and a large hospital institution.

This model delivers meaningful bill savings and proves especially valuable for organizations with space constraints or permitting challenges that would otherwise prevent on-site energy deployment.

How Phil Murphy caused New Jersey electricity prices to soar

Wall Street Journal/Paul H. Tice

New Jersey residents face some of the highest electricity prices in the U.S., despite low per capita energy use, with rates 15% above the national average as of April 2025, exacerbated by a recent 17-20% rate hike approved by the state’s Board of Public Utilities. A decade ago, the state achieved energy independence using low-cost Marcellus Shale gas, but since Gov. Phil Murphy’s 2017 election, New Jersey has shifted away from coal and natural gas toward intermittent wind and solar power, aiming for 100% “clean” electricity by 2035. This transition has reduced generating capacity by 12% since 2016, increased reliance on the PJM regional grid, and driven a 33% rise in residential power prices. PJM’s climate-driven policies and a 20% capacity drop have led to a ninefold price spike in its latest auction, contributing to New Jersey’s rate hikes. To lower costs, the state should prioritize natural gas and nuclear expansion for reliable, affordable energy self-sufficiency. [MDN: Phil Murphy has been a disaster as Governor of NJ. Sky-high electric prices are just one example of his gross incompetence.]

Judge shuts down Charleston climate case, warns of “boundless” liability

Energy in Depth – Climate & Environment/Kyle Kohli

A South Carolina judge, Roger Young, dismissed Charleston’s climate lawsuit with prejudice, preventing refiling and marking a significant defeat for the Sher Edling law firm and Rockefeller-backed climate litigation efforts. This decision aligns with similar dismissals in New York, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and Maryland, emphasizing that climate policy belongs to national and global arenas, not state courts. The judge ruled that the claims, though framed as deception, fundamentally seek redress for greenhouse gas emissions’ effects. He warned of “boundless” liability, potentially exposing industries like airlines, automakers, and agriculture to endless suits, and enabling litigation over every weather event. The Unfair Trade Practices Act claim was time-barred due to long-standing public awareness of climate risks tied to fossil fuels. Rejecting parallels to tobacco and opioid cases, Young noted the global, cumulative nature of harms versus direct local impacts. Ultimately, the ruling underscores that courts are unfit for setting climate policy, eroding the campaign’s credibility. [MDN: We sincerely hope the Trump DOJ investigates Sher Edling for its collusion with Big Green in attempting to take down fossil energy. The SC case is yet another victory against Big Green.]

Gavin Newsom flinches as California’s war against oil produces a crisis

National Review/Jack Fowler

California Governor Gavin Newsom, once a fervent advocate for aggressive anti-fossil fuel policies, is now facing a self-inflicted energy crisis as his stringent regulations have driven oil companies like Phillips 66 and Valero to announce refinery closures, threatening the state’s fuel supply. The National Review article highlights Newsom’s shift from vilifying the oil industry to pleading with it to maintain operations, as California’s high gas taxes, cap-and-trade programs, and restrictive laws have led to skyrocketing fuel prices and reduced refining capacity. With the state importing over 70% of its oil by 2020, up from 4.5% in 1988, Newsom’s policies have created a precarious dependency on foreign oil. The article portrays this as a reckoning for Newsom, whose environmental crusade has backfired, forcing him to confront the economic and practical fallout of his administration’s war on oil, leaving California vulnerable to fuel shortages. [MDN: People get the government they voted for and deserve. Newsom is a disaster and a menace. Yet CA voters keep returning him to office. They’re getting what they deserve: a crisis.]

U.S. natural gas futures settle under $3

Wall Street Journal/Anthony Harrup

U.S. natural gas’s struggle around $3/mmBtu continues with concerns about ample storage and production countering the rise in LNG feedgas flows and a near-term pickup in weather-driven demand. “Currently weather patterns are plenty hot enough the next 15 days, although the risk is the weather data loses a few CDDs [cooling degree days] in time,” NatGasWeather.com says in a note. “Whether prices trade over or under $3 at the Sunday reopen is likely to be dependent on the direction of weekend weather trends.” Nymex natural gas settles down 2.5% at $2.99/mmBtu. [MDN: So the NYMEX settled at $2.99 on Friday. Bummer. Back below the all-important $3 level. Keep an eye on how today’s price goes. That will be the tip if it continues down or maybe (hopefully) goes back above $3 again.]

As electric bills rise, evidence mounts that data centers share blame

Associated Press/Marc Levy

Amid rising electric bills, states face mounting pressure to shield household and business ratepayers from the costs of powering Big Tech’s energy-intensive data centers, driven by the AI boom. While no state has a definitive solution and the precise impact on bills remains elusive, critics doubt regulators’ willingness to challenge giants like Microsoft, Google, Amazon, and Meta. Over a dozen states are responding by urging the nation’s largest grid operator, PJM Interconnection, to curb price hikes, studying data centers’ effects, and advocating for them to bear more transmission costs. Data centers consume electricity equivalent to entire cities like Pittsburgh or New Orleans, prompting a reevaluation of traditional cost-sharing models. Evidence from Wood Mackenzie indicates specialized rates in 16 states fall short of covering new power plant expenses, while Monitoring Analytics attributes 70% of last year’s $9.3 billion mid-Atlantic cost increase to data center demand. Actions include Oregon’s new rate legislation, New Jersey’s impact study, and proposals requiring data centers to self-procure power, amid concerns utilities may shift burdens to average consumers to attract these lucrative clients. [MDN: The AP is a Democrat shill operation, so you always have to factor that when you read an article published by them. Here’s the thing: Many data centers are proposing to build their own gas-fired power plants to power them. Dems don’t like that. But if data centers use electricity from the local grid, that means the grid has to add new gas-fired power plants, and Dems don’t like that either because it has the potential to raise everyone’s electric rates (more demand equals higher prices). It’s a catch-22 for data centers.]

EPA cancels $7 billion Biden-era grant program to boost solar energy

Associated Press/Alex St. John, Matthew Daly

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), under the Trump administration, has terminated a $7 billion grant program from the Biden-era Solar for All initiative, which aimed to fund residential solar projects for over 900,000 low-income U.S. households through investments like rooftop solar and community gardens. This move is part of broader efforts to deregulate environmental protections and promote fossil fuels, including proposing to rescind the EPA’s “endangerment finding” on greenhouse gases. EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin cited the elimination of statutory authority under a recent tax-and-spending law that axed the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund from the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, claiming it saves taxpayers $7 billion. Critics, including Sen. Bernie Sanders, denounced the action as illegal and insane, arguing it undermines lower utility bills, job creation, and climate action amid rising energy costs and environmental crises. Only $53 million has been spent, with grant recipients in planning stages, prompting threats of legal challenges from groups like the Solar Energy Industries Association and Southern Environmental Law Center, who assert the funds were already appropriated and cannot be rescinded. [MDN: One of the best things EPA has done under Trump—canceling this boondoggle that doesn’t benefit “low-income” people, it benefits the grifting companies that sell this stuff! That’s who benefits. That’s $7 billion of OUR taxpayer money saved!]

On the CO2 fertilization effect (real science for EPA)

Master Resource/Robert Bradley Jr.

The author challenges the U.S. EPA’s 2009 Endangerment Finding by highlighting the benefits of atmospheric CO2 increases, drawing from a study by Richard Lindzen and William Happer. They argue that doubling CO2 from 400 ppm to 800 ppm could boost global crop yields by about 40% based on empirical data, countering climate alarmism with evidence of CO2’s “fertilization” effect on plants. Experiments by Dr. Sherwood Idso demonstrate enhanced growth in pine trees at higher CO2 levels, while Dr. Craig Idso reports agricultural production increases of 28% to 70% (averaging 46%) since the Industrial Revolution due to a 120-ppm rise, with some rice varieties surging 263%. The piece warns that pursuing Net Zero emissions would reduce food availability worldwide with minimal temperature impact, quoting Sylvan Wittwer on CO2 as a boundary-less resource boosting global food production for all nations. [MDN: What’s this? We need more CO2, not less! Bring it on. Burn those fossil fuels, baby!]

Oil holds steady as traders assess possible Ukraine war truce

Bloomberg/Mia Gindis and Catherine Cartier

Oil prices remained steady after a volatile session as investors evaluated the potential impact of a US-Russia deal to halt the Ukraine war, which could secure Russia’s control over seized territories but faces uncertain support from Ukraine and European allies. West Texas Intermediate closed unchanged at $63.88 per barrel, ending a six-session decline, while Brent rose slightly to $66.59. Despite US and EU sanctions targeting Russian oil revenues, including new US tariffs on Indian imports for accepting Russian crude, markets anticipate minimal disruption to Russian oil flows to major buyers like China and India. Analysts suggest a truce would have a limited bearish effect on oil prices unless sanctions are lifted. Meanwhile, a bearish outlook persists due to fading summer demand, OPEC+ easing output cuts, and economic slowdown concerns linked to US tariffs, with commodity traders increasingly betting against oil price rises. [MDN: The price of oil remains in “perfect” territory for us. No complaints.]

China defends buying Russian oil

Bloomberg/Rigzone

China defended its imports of Russian oil as legitimate and lawful, rejecting U.S. threats of new tariffs after Washington imposed secondary levies on India for similar purchases. The Chinese Foreign Ministry emphasized its right to conduct economic and energy cooperation with all countries, including Russia, in line with its national interests. This response came amid former U.S. President Donald Trump’s warnings of potential tariffs on China for buying Russian oil, as part of his strategy to pressure major Russian trade partners to facilitate a peace deal in the Russia-Ukraine conflict. While Trump signaled progress in talks, including a potential meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin, his adviser Peter Navarro downplayed the likelihood of new tariffs, citing potential harm to the U.S. economy. Chinese President Xi Jinping, in a call with Putin, described the Ukraine situation as complex, while U.S.-China trade tensions remain paused as both sides negotiate an expiring tariff truce.

Ford said its investment in the Louisville plant will secure 2,200 hourly jobs.
Ford’s new EV strategy comes as Chinese automakers are quickly expanding across the globe, offering relatively affordable electric vehicles.
“And this new vehicle built in Louisville, Kentucky, is going to be a much better solution to anything that anyone can buy from China,” he added.","LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) — Ford Motor Co. will invest nearly $2 billion retooling a Kentucky factory to produce electric vehicles that it says will be more affordable, more profitable to build and will outcompete rival models.

The automaker’s top executive unveiled the new EV strategy at Ford’s Louisville Assembly Plant which, after producing gas-powered vehicles for 70 years, will be converted to manufacture electric vehicles.

“In our careers, as automobile people we’re lucky if we get to work on one, maybe two, projects that really change the face of our industry,” CEO Jim Farley told plant workers in Kentucky on Monday. “And I believe today is going to light the match as one of those projects for all of us here.”

The Big Detroit automakers have continued to transition from internal combustion engines to EV technology even as President Donald Trump’s administration unwinds incentives for automakers to go electric. Trump’s massive tax and spending law targets EV incentives, including the imminent removal of a credit that saves buyers up to $7,500 on a new electric car.

Yet Farley and other top executives in the auto industry say that electric vehicles are the future and there is no going back.

The first EV to be produced by the revamped Louisville production process will be a midsize, four-door electric pickup truck in 2027 for domestic and international markets, the company said Monday.

The new electric trucks will feature plenty of interior space to fit five adults and pack enough power to have a targeted 0-60 time as fast as a Mustang EcoBoost but with more downforce, Ford said

The electric trucks will be powered by lower-cost batteries made at a Ford factory in Michigan. The Detroit automaker previously announced a $3 billion investment to build the battery factory.

The automaker sees this as a “Model T moment” for its EV business — a reference to revolutionary changes on the production line led by the company’s founder, Henry Ford, when it began churning out vehicles from a factory more than a century ago. Farley said the changes will upend how electric vehicles are made in the U.S.

“It represents the most radical change on how we design and how we build vehicles at Ford since the Model T,” Farley said.

The company said it will use a universal platform and production system for its EVs, essentially the underpinning of a vehicle that can be applied across a wide range of models.

The Louisville factory — one of two Ford assembly plants in Kentucky’s largest city — will be revamped to cut production costs and make assembly time faster as it’s prepared to churn out electric vehicles.

The result will be “an affordable electric vehicle that we expect to be profitable,” Farley said in an interview with The Associated Press ahead of the announcement. “This is an example of us rejuvenating our U.S. plants with the most modern manufacturing techniques.”

The new platform enables a lineup of affordable vehicles to be produced at scale, Ford said. It will reduce parts by 20% versus a typical vehicle, with 25% fewer fasteners, 40% fewer workstations dock-to-dock in the plant and a 15% faster assembly time, Ford said.

The traditional assembly line will be transformed into an “assembly tree” at the Louisville plant, the company said. Instead of one long conveyor, three subassembly lines will operate simultaneously and then join together, it said.

Other specifications for the midsize electric truck – including its reveal date, starting price, EPA-estimated battery range, battery sizes and charge times — will be announced later, the company said. Farley revealed that the truck will have a targeted starting price of about $30,000.

Ford said its investment in the Louisville plant will secure 2,200 hourly jobs.

Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear said Monday that the automaker’s plans for the Louisville plant will strengthen a more than century-old partnership between Ford and the Bluegrass State.

“This announcement not only represents one of the largest investments on record in our state, it also boosts Kentucky’s position at the center of EV-related innovation and solidifies Louisville Assembly Plant as an important part of Ford’s future,” Beshear said.

Ford said its combined investment of about $5 billion at the Kentucky assembly plant and Michigan battery plant is expected to create or secure nearly 4,000 direct jobs between the two plants while strengthening the domestic supply chain with dozens of new U.S.-based suppliers.

Ford previously forecast weaker earnings growth for this year and further losses in its electric vehicles business as it works to control costs. Model e, Ford’s electric vehicle business, posted a full-year loss of $5.08 billion for 2024 as revenue fell 35% to $3.9 billion.

Ford’s new EV strategy comes as Chinese automakers are quickly expanding across the globe, offering relatively affordable electric vehicles.

“We’re not in a race to build the most electric cars,” Farley told the AP when asked about competition from China. “We’re in a race to have a sustainable electric business that’s profitable, that customers love.

“And this new vehicle built in Louisville, Kentucky, is going to be a much better solution to anything that anyone can buy from China,” he added.

Ford could have opted to launch its EV project overseas to reap lower-cost labor and currency advantages but instead is “taking the fight to our competition” from the plant in Kentucky, Farley said at Monday’s event. But the Ford CEO cautioned that “there are no guarantees” with project.

“We’re doing so many new things I can’t tell you with 100% certainty that this will all go just right,” he said. “It is a bet. There is risk. The automotive industry has a graveyard littered with affordable vehicles that were launched in our country with all good intentions. And they fizzled out with idle plants, laid off workers and red ink. And at Ford … we set out to break that cycle.”",https://virginiabusiness.com/files/1/2025/08/AP25223591456551.jpg,N,,2025-08-11 17:07:47.960259

President Trump’s signature on the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA) the day before didn’t just reshape federal spending; it shortened years of energy planning into months of urgent decision-making.

For the thousands of public agencies that have been methodically planning solar installations, fleet electrification, HVAC modernizations and building efficiency upgrades, the question is no longer “when should we move forward?” but “can we move fast enough to capture federal incentives before they disappear?”

‍

1. What the One Big Beautiful Bill Act Actually Does: Different Deadlines for Different Technologies with an Emphasis on Domestic Suppliers

The legislation dramatically alters the timeline for federal energy incentives established under the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). Technologies that previously had support through 2032-2033, or in some cases permanently, now face much tighter deadlines.

Solar, wind, electric vehicle and energy efficiency incentives that were originally available through 2032-2033 now face deadlines as early as 2025-2027, effectively accelerating their phase-out by five to seven years. Meanwhile, energy storage, geothermal, nuclear and hydropower projects retain their original timelines through 2033-2034.

Even if the timelines can be met, strict “Foreign Entity of Concern” (FEOC) rules are also in play. Partial use of components from those entities may disqualify projects unless domestic content thresholds are met.

Solar and Wind Projects (Section 48E): Projects must begin construction by July 4, 2026, to maintain a four-year completion window. If that deadline is missed, projects must be placed in service by December 31, 2027. In this case, “beginning construction” doesn’t mean board approval or permits; it requires either physical work of a significant nature at the job site, such as installing racks or structures to support solar panels or paying for at least 5% of the project’s total cost. Any solar or wind project that begins construction after December 31, 2025, must also comply with the FEOC rules.

Commercial Electric Vehicles (Section 45W): Agencies now have until September 30, 2025, to purchase qualifying vehicles to receive tax credits.

EV Charging Infrastructure (Section 30C): Projects must be placed in service by June 30, 2026.

Energy-Efficient Buildings (Section 179D): Construction must begin by June 30, 2026, to maintain deductions that were previously permanent in the tax code.

Energy Storage, Geothermal, Nuclear, Hydropower: These technologies retain their original federal support timelines through 2034.

Adding to the urgency, President Trump signed an executive order on July 7 directing the Treasury Secretary to tighten construction requirements within 45 days. The new guidance will require “substantial progress” rather than simply beginning work, potentially making it even harder for projects to qualify.

‍

2. Impact on Public Agencies: Every Month Matters

Major energy infrastructure investments are already driven by practical necessities rather than federal incentives alone. Aging infrastructure means higher utility bills and decreased quality of air, temperature control and comfort for students, staff and residents. Federal incentives are valuable, but the One Big Beautiful Bill is a reminder that hedging against utility cost increases that have risen 2-3 times faster than inflation will still deliver net savings even without federal support.

If support is what they’re after, public agencies with aging facilities must expedite their critical infrastructure improvements to leverage federal incentives. These agencies must now accelerate HVAC, lighting and building efficiency projects that lose their federal Section 179D support after June 30, 2026. Water districts operating energy-intensive treatment plants with specialized pumps and aeration systems, community college campuses with multiple buildings requiring coordinated upgrades, and cities with numerous fire stations, libraries and administrative buildings all previously relied on permanent federal deductions for energy-efficient improvements.

The shortened timeline from “permanent” federal support to a June 2026 deadline creates urgency for public agencies to accelerate project timelines. With California commercial and residential IOU customers spending an average 90% more on their utility bills than in 2013, agencies that can successfully navigate these new deadlines will capture significant savings, while those that delay face higher project costs and continued exposure to rising energy expenses.

‍

3. Strategic Silver Linings: Opportunities Within the Chaos

Despite the challenges, forward-thinking agencies are identifying opportunities within the new framework. Energy storage projects retain full federal support through 2034, making battery installations increasingly attractive for agencies seeking long-term budget relief. Unlike solar projects, storage systems can still access federal incentives with reasonable planning horizons. Geothermal Projects also maintain their full 30% credit through 2034, offering another pathway for agencies with suitable geography and long-term energy planning.

Municipal Bond Expansion represents a lesser-known but significant win in the legislation. The bill expands tax-exempt private activity bonds for energy efficiency, school retrofits and resiliency projects, raising caps on bond insurance and expanding eligibility. This gives agencies additional financing tools to bridge federal funding gaps.

Accelerated Depreciation remains permanently at 100%, supporting projects like energy storage, fuel cells, linear generators and some energy efficiency improvements. This provision allows agencies working with private sector partners to deduct the full cost of eligible technologies in the first year, providing additional tax benefits.

State and Utility Programs continue offering substantial incentives that can help offset reduced federal support. The California Alternative Energy and Advanced Transportation Financing Authority (CAEATFA), California Energy Commission (CEC) and California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) programs, along with utility rebates, provide alternative funding pathways for strategic agencies.

Further, as agencies delay projects due to the policy changes, fast-moving agencies may benefit from reduced competition, and in-turn gain better access to contractors, equipment and permitting resources.

‍

4.The Path Forward: Act Now or Pay More Later

Successful agencies will rapidly assess their exposure, prioritize high-impact projects and accelerate timelines without sacrificing quality.

Immediate Steps:

Inventory all energy projects and their federal incentive dependencies

Assess which projects can meet new deadlines and financial exposure if funding disappears

Evaluate shifts to energy storage or other qualifying technologies that retain federal funding support

Determine how foreign content sourcing affects eligibility and whether project financing can still move forward under the new rules

Medium-Term Steps:

Fast-track approvals, permitting and contractor selections for priority projects

Consider bundling multiple projects for economies of scale

Explore alternative financing through municipal bonds and state programs

Ongoing Strategy:

Develop contingency budgets for projects that may lose federal support

Build relationships with state agencies managing alternative incentive programs

Partner with experienced energy service providers who can navigate timeline challenges and optimize available incentives

Smartly identify other funding sources from the State, utilities, private funding, etc.

The bottom line is that federal timelines are significantly shortened, while the fundamental drivers for energy infrastructure investments remain strong. Aging systems create inefficient operations and higher utility costs, plus poor comfort conditions for occupants, making modernization essential regardless of federal policy. Agencies that act decisively can still capture federal incentives while securing long-term protection against escalating utility costs. The clock is ticking, but the strategic incentive and motivation to modernize energy infrastructure — with or without federal incentives — has never been clearer.",https://www.publicceo.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Metrolink-1.jpg,N,,2025-08-11 17:04:13.830888

Johnson Amendment amicus showdown

Executive Order: Democratizing Access to Alternative Assets for 401(k) investors

The IRS announced on August 7 that it will not adjust 2025 withholding tables to take into account changes made by the One Big Beautiful Bill Act. Taxpayers receiving tax breaks from the bill, such as the child tax credit, tips and overtime will instead have lower tax bills or larger refunds when filing their 2025 tax returns in early 2026.

Republicans continue to discuss enacting another reconciliation bill with significant tax provisions towards the end of the year. There is some uncertainty about whether congressional rules allow Congress to pass another reconciliation bill this fiscal year given that the OBBBA addresses all three of the issues that can be included in reconciliation: spending, revenue, and the debt limit. But that is probably a moot point because the fiscal year will end at the end of September, several weeks after Congress returns from August recess. The first formal step in the process is to pass another budget resolution, although Republicans would likely first forge agreement on the rough parameters of the bill they would like to enact pursuant to that resolution.

But Congress and the White House will likely spend all of September attempting to reach a deal on funding the government. Congress has made more progress this year than in the recent past – the Senate passage of three of the twelve appropriations bills before August recess was the first time the Senate has passed any of the twelve bills before September since 2018. But there remain significant roadblocks. The Senate will also likely engage in a bitter partisan battle over changing the rules under which a President’s nominees are considered. A continuing resolution through the first quarter of next year seems like the most viable path, although even that may not be doable. The White House proposing another recissions package may result in Democrats refusing to agree to any deal.

IRS funding and the IRA

According to a report by the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration (TIGTA), the IRS still has $23.8 billion of the $80 billion funding boost it was given in the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act. The IRS has spent about $13.8 billion of the funding, while Congress subsequently rescinded about $40 billion. As of April 21, the IRS had canceled 93 contracts entered into with IRA funding.

Personnel

On Friday, August 8, IRS Commissioner Billy Long, in office since June 12, announced on Twitter that he will become Ambassador to Iceland. Treasury Secretary Bessent will become acting IRS Commissioner.

The IRS has reduced its workforce by 25% since February, according to TIGTA. In February, the IRS had about 103,000 employees. As of May, 77,428 employees remained. The Small Business/Self Employed Business unit had the largest decrease in the percentage (35%) and number of employees (8,604).

The Trump administration has stated that it is determined to significantly reform the IRS, particularly by upgrading its technology.

Senators Grassley (R-IA) and Curtis (R-UT) are blocking three of President Trump’s nominees for positions in the Treasury Department pending Treasury issuing guidance regarding the solar and wind tax credits pursuant to President Trump’s Executive Order of July 7. Senator Grassley announced in the August 1 Congressional Record:

“Mr. President, today, I placed a hold on three Department of the Treasury nominees. The nominees are Brian Morrissey, Jr., of Virginia, to be General Counsel for the Department of the Treasury; Francis Brooke, of Virginia, to be an Assistant Secretary of the Treasury [for International Trade and Development]; and Jonathan McKernan, of Tennessee, to be an Under Secretary of the Treasury [for Domestic Finance]. During consideration of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, I worked with my colleagues to provide wind and solar an appropriate glidepath for the orderly phase-out of the tax credits. Ultimately, Congress enshrined in statute a 12-month transition period based on when projects “begin construction.”

What it means for a project to “begin construction” has been well established by Treasury guidance for more than a decade. Moreover, Congress specifically references current Treasury guidance to set that term’s meaning in law. This is a case where both the law and congressional intent are clear.

The Department of the Treasury is expected to issue rules and regulations implementing the agreed upon phase-out of the wind and solar credits by August 18, 2025.

Until I can be certain that such rules and regulations adhere to the law and congressional intent, I intend to continue to object to the consideration of these Treasury nominees.”

On August 7, President Trump nominated Chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers (CEA), Stephen Miran to the Federal Reserve Board of Governors to fill the seat of Adriana Kugler who announced her resignation last week. The term expires on January 31, 2026. The next scheduled vacancy on the Board is not until September 7, 2027. Chairman Powell’s term as Chairman (although not as a governor) is set to expire on May 15, 2026.

Miran’s November 2024 critique of post-Cold War American international economic policy, “A User Guide to Restructuring the Global Trading System,” has helped shape President Trump’s trade agenda. Miran has been a top advocate of the OBBBA, leading the CEA’s economic analysis of the bill. Miran has also strongly argued that President Trump’s tariffs should not dissuade the Fed from lowering interest rates.

President Trump has said that he is considering Kevin Warsh, Kevin Hassett and two other unnamed candidates for Federal Reserve Chair, although recent reports indicate he has expanded the search. Picking a person currently not on the Board would require such person to be nominated and confirmed to fill the seat expiring on January 31, 2026, for which Miran was nominated – unless another Board member resigns, which appears unlikely. Alternatively, President Trump could ultimately decide to nominate Miran for a full term, and then nominate Miran or another existing Governor for Chair.

Executive Order: Democratizing Access to Alternative Assets for 401(k) investors

On August 7, President Trump signed an Executive Order to facilitate 401(k) plans offering alternative asset funds as investment options. The Order includes six classes of alternative assets: (1) private market equity or debt holdings not traded on public exchanges, including where the investment managers take an active management role; (2) real estate interests; (3) actively managed vehicles investing in digital assets; (4) commodities; (5) infrastructure development project financing; and (6) lifetime income investment strategies, including longevity risk-sharing pools.

Employer-sponsored defined contribution plans, such as 401(k)s, and defined benefit plans are subject to myriad rules under the Tax Code and ERISA. In general, specific laws and regulations do not dictate what investment options plan trustees may include in a plan (other than rules against prohibited transactions, such as self-dealing). The decision by trustees as to what investment options to offer in a 401(k) plan is subject to the general fiduciary obligations governing plan trustees under ERISA.

As noted in the Executive Order, in June 2020, the Department of Labor (DOL), issued an Information Letter concluding that a 401(k) plan offering a “professionally managed asset allocation fund with a private equity component” as an investment option would not violate fiduciary duties if the trustees properly weighed the risks and benefits of offering such option. In December 2021, DOL issued a Supplemental Statement to the 2020 Information Letter striking a very different tone, although not a formal retraction. The Supplemental Statement noted that the 2020 guidance did not affirmatively recommend inclusion of alternative assets as investment options and highlighted the potential downsides (but not upsides) of such investments discussed in the Information Letter. The 2021 guidance provides that fiduciaries of a large 401(k) plan also serving as fiduciaries of an affiliated defined benefit plan already using alternative assets may be suited to analyze those investments for the 401(k) plan, but “cautions against application of the Information Letter outside of that context. Except in this minority of situations, plan-level fiduciaries of small, individual account plans are not likely suited to evaluate the use of PE investments in designated investment alternatives in individual account plans.”

President Trump ordered the Secretary of Labor to reexamine DOL’s fiduciary guidance, including whether to rescind the 2021 guidance, within 180 days. The Secretary of Labor shall also “seek to clarify DOL’s position on alternative assets and the appropriate fiduciary process associated with offering asset allocation funds containing investments in alternative assets under ERISA.” The Secretary shall also propose “rules, regulations or guidance” to clarify fiduciary duties associated with offering alternative asset investment options to participants, which “may include calibrated safe harbors.”

The DOL Secretary is to consult with the Secretary of Treasury, the SEC, and other Federal regulators in carrying out the order, including the possibility of other Federal regulators carrying out parallel regulatory changes.

The Executive Order blames “a combination of regulatory overreach and encouragement of lawsuits filed by opportunistic trial lawyers” for “stifl[ing] investment innovation” and depriving 401(k) plan participants of the opportunity to invest in asset classes utilized by public pension plans and other institutional investors.

A recent Committee on Education and the Workforce subcommittee hearing focused on the proliferation of private lawsuits alleging violations of fiduciary duties by defined contribution plans and claims of wrongful collusion by DOL under President Biden with plaintiffs’ attorneys to advance those lawsuits.

Plan fiduciaries may be reluctant to include alternative asset investment options even if DOL provides more favorable guidance, especially if such guidance is informal. But DOL issuing regulations (after undergoing formal notice and comment rulemaking) providing safe harbors as to what steps fiduciaries should take in offering such investment options might lead to inclusion of such options in more plans. DOL will want to carefully consider how to formulate such guidance in a manner that would allow trustees who are acting properly to avoid getting dragged into costly litigation.

Johnson Amendment litigation update

The joint motion filed by the IRS and the plaintiffs in National Religious Broadcasters Association et al. v. Long with regards to the Johnson Amendment’s applicability to houses of worship is still outstanding, with Judge J. Campbell Barker of the United States District Court, Eastern District of Texas, yet to rule. The motion to intervene by the Americans United for Separation of Church and State is also still outstanding. On August 7, Judge Barker granted motions by a string of organizations for leave to file amicus briefs in the case.

Proposed Reg. Sec. 1.132-4: “Line of business” update

On Tuesday, August 5, Treasury and the IRS released proposed regulations addressing the line of business requirement for no-additional-cost services and qualified employee discounts. Section 132(a)(1) and (2) exclude from gross income any fringe benefit qualifying as a no-additional cost service or a qualified employee discount, respectively.

An employee is only eligible for either tax benefit if the employee is performing services for the employer in the same “line of business” as the service or (in the case of the qualified employee discount) property is offered for sale to customers.

The Deficit Reduction Act of 1984 added Section 132 to the Tax Code. The House Committee Report provides that Treasury “may” use the Standard Industrial Classifications (SIC), which was developed by the Office of Management and Budget in 1938, to categorize lines of business.

Treas. Reg. Sec. 1.32-4(a)(2)(i), issued in 1989, provides that an employer’s line of business is determined by reference to the Enterprise Standard Industrial Classification Manual (ESIC Manual), a supplement to the SIC that was last updated in 1974.

Under the regulations, an employer is considered to have more than one line of business if the employer offers for sale to customers property or services in more than one two-digit classification in the ESIC Manual. However, there are certain circumstances under which more than one line of business will be treated as a single line of business. More specifically, this favorable treatment applies if (1) it is uncommon for any of the separate lines of business to be operated without the others; (2) it is common for a substantial number of employees to perform substantial services for more than one line of business so that determination of which employee works at which line of business would be difficult; or (3) if the employer has more than one line of business in retail operations on the same premises, but the lines of business would be considered one line of business if the merchandise were offered for sale at a department store.

The proposed regulations would replace the ESIC Manual with the North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS), which the OMB developed with Canada and Mexico starting in 1992, and which is updated every five years. NAICS is used by the IRS for other purposes under the Tax Code, including Form 1120 and Form 1040, Schedule C. The four-digit classification under the NAICS would be the determining factor in what constitutes a line of business.

The proposed regulations would also amend the existing regulations summarized above to replace “department store” with “general merchandise store, including warehouse clubs and super centers.”

The proposed regulations are proposed to be effective on the date final regulations are published in the Federal Register and apply to taxable years beginning on or after that date.",https://www.sullcrom.com/SullivanCromwell/_Assets/images/Sullcrom_LinkedIn_480x347.jpg,N,,2025-08-11 17:06:08.711652

Chuck Grassley posed for photos at the Power Up Iowa exhibit with renewable energy developers, technicians and advocates.

Grassley is often called the “father of wind energy” for introducing the first federal wind energy production tax credit, which took effect in 1993.

“I'm really pleased with the way things have worked out,” Grassley said.

Today, around 60% of Iowa’s net generation of electricity comes from wind energy. It’s the highest share of any state. While solar represents a much smaller percentage, the sector has rapidly grown in recent years with the help of tax credits — mostly notably from the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) of 2022.

The IRA expanded tax credits for renewable energy projects and extended many of the credits for a decade or more.

The version of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act that first passed in the U.S. House of Representatives would have ended some credits for wind and solar projects that started construction more than 60 days after the legislation was signed. The U.S. Senate’s version was less severe. For example, utilities that begin construction on a wind or solar project by July 4, 2026 will still qualify for a production tax credit.

“I think that might not be as good as what wind power people wanted, but it's sure a heck of a lot better than what the House of Representatives did. So, we're going to have to fight to make sure that this is carried out the way the Senate [intended],” Grassley said.

The House approved the Senate’s bill, and Trump signed the ""Big Beautiful Bill"" into law July 4. But three days later, Trump issued an executive order directing the Secretary of the Treasury to end tax credits for wind and solar.

Grassley said the main concern is that the Treasury may issue new criteria for “beginning of construction.” This could make it harder for wind and solar projects to qualify for the tax credits even before they expire next July.

“We made very clear in the legislation that the practice of the last 10 years, both from the standpoint of the regulation, as well as the guidelines, was what should be followed as a result of the compromise that we made in the United States Senate,” Grassley said.

He said the renewable energy statutes in the Senate version of the bill were “the difference between getting the votes” to pass the One Big Beautiful Bill Act.

Grassley announced Aug. 1 that he will delay three of Trump’s nominees to the treasury until the agency’s rules “adhere to the law and congressional intent.” He’s joined by Republican Sen. John Curtis of Utah.

The treasury is expected to issue its regulations by Aug. 18.

Jason Grumet, the CEO for the American Clean Power Association, said many of the tax credits for renewable energy have been around for decades.

“The problem was they'd be for two years, and they'd expire, and then companies wouldn't know what to do, and it was hard to make investments,” Grumet said.

The IRA created stability for the sector, but it also politicized renewable energy, he added.

Beyond tax credits

Grumet emphasized the wind industry can handle the phase out of tax credits, even though it’s expected to increase prices and uncertainty.

“It’s the additional restrictions that are being put forward that no one anticipated that will literally stop Iowa companies from building any more wind power,” Grumet said.

Trump’s executive order also ""directs the secretary of the interior to revise regulations and policies to eliminate preferential treatment for wind and solar facilities compared to reliable, dispatchable energy sources.”

This includes an “elevated review” for leases, construction plans and grants for wind and solar projects on federal land. Additionally, the Department of the Interior is investigating how wind turbines may impact migratory bird populations, which could impact projects on private land; they still need to comply with federal wildlife protections.

According to the Audubon Society, climate change poses the greatest threat to birds and responsibly-sited wind and solar energy “is essential for bird conservation.”

The U.S. Department of Transportation is also recommending a minimum 1.2-mile setback for wind turbines built near highways and railroads.

Mak Heddens, the senior advisor of Power Up Iowa, a statewide coalition of renewable energy supporters, said the industry is navigating a slew of challenges with recent policy changes.

“Clean energy is in our backyards,” Heddens said. “It's a huge benefit to Iowans with tax revenue for communities that helps supplement schools and infrastructure, provides payments to farmers — and given current market conditions, that's critical right now. So, we're proud to be a part of a very important industry in Iowa.”",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/ce2fe64/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1620x851+0+104/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fc9%2F65%2F6fbef3dc4414b4d5cba62edf5f33%2F080825-pham-iastatefair-senchuckgrassley9-jpg-web.jpg,N,,2025-08-11 17:06:13.437516

Clean tech is no longer a decarbonization tool; it is a central pillar of energy security, economic competitiveness, and foreign policy.","News headlines in the United States have been dominated by funding freezes, executive orders, and tax credit repeals, all curtailing public support for clean energy. After four years of global leadership in decarbonization ambition, this political climate reversal is unnerving domestic project developers, investors, and global observers. While this uncertainty undoubtedly challenges U.S. clean tech manufacturing and deployment, global clean technology investment will prove resilient to U.S. climate policy withdrawal, propelled by economic, security, and environmental imperatives. To avoid long-term geopolitical consequences, the United States must reassert its leadership or risk marginalizing itself from the future economic and geopolitical opportunities of global value chains.

Alongside its emphasis on fossil fuels as the keystone of energy dominance, the Trump administration is pursuing a narrow set of clean energy resources—namely, advanced nuclear and advanced geothermal. Executive orders and the tax credits in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act seek to strengthen supply chain security and maximize energy exports of novel technologies through international trade agreements, international finance institutions, and public financial support (such as for advanced nuclear energy through the Department of Energy Loan Programs Office).

Clean Energy Is an Economic Driver

Global investment in clean energy technologies reached a record $2.1 trillion in 2024—an 11 percent increase from the previous year and more than double investments in 2020. Despite elevated geopolitical tensions and economic uncertainty, the International Energy Agency (IEA) estimates this will rise to $3.3 trillion in 2025. Clean tech investments vastly outpace fossil fuel investments, with two dollars spent on clean energy for every dollar invested in fossil fuels (Figure 1); in the electricity sector, this ratio is even more pronounced, with $10 invested in clean power for every $1 invested in fossil fuel electricity generation. Global investment in solar photovoltaics alone now surpasses investment in all other electricity generation technologies combined. Currently, almost 75 percent of global energy investment is financed by commercial sources. Around 25 percent comes from public finance and 1 percent from development finance institutions (DFIs).

In 2023, clean technology manufacturing alone accounted for around 4 percent of global GDP growth. Nowhere is it more evident how clean tech investments can drive economic competitiveness than in China, where clean energy contributed 10 percent to China’s GDP in 2024, driving a quarter of the year’s GDP growth. Studies have found carbon-neutral or carbon-sink activities generate more than a dollar’s worth of economic activity for each dollar invested; for renewable energy, this multiplier is estimated to be between $1.00 and $1.50 for each dollar spent, compared to ¢50 for fossil fuel investments. Clean energy generates more jobs and stimulates more localized economic activity. Around half of the global energy workforce is employed in clean energy, despite coal, oil, and natural gas supplying about 80 percent of total energy global energy.

The value creation potential is especially prominent in developing economies, where addressing energy poverty is a stated goal of Secretary of Energy Chris Wright, who asserts energy poverty is a more pressing issue than climate change. In the developing world, clean energy technologies are a key part of expanding energy access and economic development. Over 680 million people lack access to electricity, primarily in Sub-Saharan Africa. Off-grid solar could provide first-time electricity access to almost 400 million people globally by 2030. In the same time period, clean energy technologies could create 1.5–3.3 million new jobs in Africa alone. Expanded access to energy would also create half a billion jobs across the rest of the economy, including in agriculture, health care, and education.

Global Leaders Pick Up Where the United States Federal Government Left Off on Industrial Policy

Recognizing global momentum and the desire to meet their own climate goals, other developed countries will continue to scale new clean technologies into commercial reality. Partly inspired by the U.S. Inflation Reduction Act and motivated by decarbonization and energy security goals, U.S. allies such as the European Union and Australia are bolstering their industrial competitiveness ambitions.

The European Union, in particular, sees opportunity in the uncertain U.S. policy landscape to position itself as the stable alternative for U.S. clean tech investment. The European Green Deal, announced in 2019, was the flagship initiative of the previous European Commission. While it focused heavily on climate ambition, it lacked a coordinated industrial policy, which weakened its effectiveness. To address this shortcoming, the new European Commission introduced the Green Industrial Deal, which focuses more strategically on linking climate goals to competitiveness, manufacturing, and energy security. Key to its success will be its ability to mobilize private capital, address high energy costs, and align the fragmented markets across the European Union.

Australia’s current Labor government was recently reelected with a larger majority, signaling public support for its climate agenda. Like the European Union, in its first term, the focus was on establishing climate ambition and is now moving towards implementation. As Australia has long relied on energy exports for economic growth, part of this plan recognizes the strategic need to build new export industries for a decarbonizing system, such as green hydrogen and low-carbon metals. To do so, it is leveraging institutional tools to align conditions for domestic innovation and foreign investment. For example, the Clean Energy Finance Corporation is a government-backed green bank supporting large projects. Australia is also seeking geopolitical partnerships to align security and trade, especially around supply chains and critical minerals.

The Path Forward for U.S. Clean Tech Export Competitiveness

Market trends and continued policy developments challenge the United States to claim a leadership position within global energy value chains that also happen to be clean.

To do so, especially in competition against China, the U.S. must better align its development finance institutions, such as the Development Finance Corporation (DFC) and the Export-Import Bank (EXIM), with security and economic diplomacy goals; there is a gap between industrial competitiveness ambitions at the strategic level and institutional execution authorities at the implementation level. Because DFC is demand-driven with no statutory requirement for the investment to use U.S. goods or services, U.S. diplomacy must focus on expanding global markets for next-generation U.S. clean tech such that low- and lower-middle-income countries self-select U.S. technologies. For such technologies that are high-risk endeavors requiring high degrees of upfront capital investments, DFC should make greater use of its equity authority to bring more risk-tolerant capital to early commercial deployments. However, even with equity, DFC’s allowable risk-tolerance is not conducive to supporting advanced nuclear projects abroad, and financing speed, flexibility, and scale are not competitive with China’s financing model. DFC and EXIM are both up for congressional reauthorization, which is an important opportunity to reform these institutions to more effectively facilitate U.S. export competitiveness, especially in clean tech sectors. For example, statutory changes in reauthorization could raise DFC’s portfolio-cap and single-project exposure limits and extend EXIM’s Clean Technology Export Program (CTEP) into a more ambitious and longer-term program to more meaningfully compete with the 15 plus year financing terms offered by Chinese state investments.

Reclaiming Momentum through Coordinated Investment

As global investment in clean technology accelerates, the United States risks losing momentum at a critical time when global clean tech value chains are being formed and solidified. Clean tech is no longer a decarbonization tool; it is a central pillar of energy security, economic competitiveness, and foreign policy. While allies and competitors alike are leveraging industrial policy to attract capital, scale deployment, and secure supply chains, the United States risks sidelining itself by narrowly focusing on a narrow subset of energy technologies. While advanced nuclear and geothermal have strategic potential, they alone cannot sustain U.S. competitiveness across the full spectrum of global clean energy markets. To reclaim its leadership, the United States must support both domestic innovation and deployment as well as empower its development finance institutions to more effectively build global markets for U.S. energy technology exports. Failing to do so will not stop the energy transition; it will only allow the rest of the world to set its trajectory. With the right strategic investments, the United States can still assert its leadership to shape a global clean energy system that aligns with long-term economic and security interests.

Democratic U.S. House members from North Carolina condemned the Environmental Protection Agency’s plan to cancel $7 billion in grants for the Solar for All program, created under the Biden administration to expand access to solar energy in low-income and disadvantaged communities.

Among those grants was $156 million awarded in April 2024 to a state coalition—the N.C. Clean Energy Fund, the N.C. Department of Environmental Quality, Advanced Energy, and the N.C. Clean Energy Technology Center.

That effort had received about $1 million in early planning funds as of March 2025, according to DEQ spokesperson Sascha Medina, but a recent dollar figure was not immediately available.

“We strongly urge you to reverse this decision, which will raise energy costs for our constituents, eliminate North Carolina jobs, and negatively impact communities across our state,” the members wrote.

U.S. Reps. Deborah Ross, Valerie Foushee, Don Davis, and Alma Adams signed the letter.

EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin announced the move Thursday on the social-media site X, formerly Twitter, pointing to the One Big Beautiful Bill Act as the reason: “EPA no longer has the statutory authority to administer the program or the appropriated funds to keep this boondoggle alive.”

The Trump administration’s interpretation of the new law is sure to widen the litigation it finds itself in over its handling of most of the climate-related programs that Congress passed in the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act.

In the new law, Congress did not and could not rescind the programs entirely. It only rescinded the relatively small amount of money that the Biden administration had not obligated to grantees. But the Trump administration is arguing that the impact was the same as if Congress ended the programs entirely, since it now lacks the money that was left behind to administer the programs.

The North Carolina House Democrats wrote that the EPA’s action could violate federal law.

“North Carolina has long been a leader in the clean energy economy, and this Administration’s actions over the past seven months are putting billions of dollars in economic investment in our state at risk,” the members wrote. “Again, we strongly urge you to reconsider this reckless and illegal course of action.”

In Washington, Patrick Drupp, climate policy director for the Sierra Club, blasted President Donald Trump for propping up the fossil fuel industry in a “made up” national energy emergency while taking a “sledgehammer” to renewable energy projects.

“Solar energy is cheaper, cleaner, and more reliable than dirty fossil fuels,” Drupp said in a statement. “By rescinding these grants, Donald Trump and Lee Zeldin are denying our most vulnerable communities a resource that would have helped alleviate their financial burdens and improved their quality of life.”

The program has 60 grantees across the country, in North Carolina and in 48 other states, as well as six Native American tribes and five multi-state coalitions. Nationally, the program would have provided solar energy to 900,000 households in low-income and disadvantaged communities, a mix of rooftop solar and subscription-based community solar, the Biden administration said last year.

In North Carolina, the Solar for All grant was intended to serve 12,500 low-income and disadvantaged communities across the state, including state- and federally recognized tribal lands, according to DEQ. The plan was to launch at least 43 megawatts of residential solar by the end of the five-year program.

DEQ spokesman Josh Kastrinsky said the agency received the termination letter from the EPA Friday. “The resilience benefits of this program are particularly important in North Carolina after recent extreme weather events. Termination of this program puts economic prosperity and energy security at risk for all North Carolinians,” Kastrinsky said.

The program is part of the broader Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund, and the administration has already sought to cancel funding for the “green bank” programs that make up the bulk of the fund.

Steve Kalland, executive director of the N.C. Clean Energy Technology Center, told Inside Climate News that the state’s Solar for All program is designing “innovative pilot programs,” including a solar-plus-battery option for households that have critical medical devices, like electric oxygen concentrators.

Solar for All in North Carolina would undertake several ambitious projects for both eligible single-family homes and multifamily housing owned and operated by nonprofit and public organizations. It also planned to launch a community solar pilot program, including with municipal utilities and electric co-ops.

North Carolina is a good location for solar projects. In 2023, it ranked fourth in the nation in solar generating capacity, with nearly 6,600 megawatts, and fifth in total solar power generation, according to the federal Energy Information Administration. But it’s also adding natural-gas infrastructure at a fast clip.

“North Carolinians are experiencing record-high energy bills, rising costs driven largely by our reliance on fossil fuel power plants,” said David Kelly, North Carolina state director of the Environmental Defense Fund. “The Solar for All program is aimed squarely at lowering household energy costs, recognizing that clean energy is more affordable than outdated, polluting power sources. Cancelling these funds will make it harder for working families to afford their utility bills.”

The U.S. Department of Transportation said it would alter requirements in the $5 billion National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Formula Program, or NEVI, to provide more flexibility to states and ""slash red tape"" left by the previous administration.

“The Biden-Buttigieg Administration failed to deliver EV chargers despite their promises. Our revised NEVI guidance slashes red tape and makes it easier for states to efficiently build out this infrastructure,"" said Transportation Sec. Sean Duffy, referring to his predecessor Pete Buttigieg. ""While I don’t agree with subsidizing green energy, we will respect Congress' will and make sure this program uses federal resources efficiently.”

The move is a surprising reversal following months of work by President Donald Trump and his allies to roll back pro-EV initiatives in the federal government. Now, instead of nixing NEVI, the Trump administration has pledged to improve a program that became a bipartisan symbol of sluggish bureaucracy under the Biden administration.

""If Congress is requiring the federal government to support charging stations, let’s cut the waste and do it right,” Duffy added.

NEVI was part of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law signed by Democratic President Joe Biden in November 2021. It offered an infusion of $5 billion to states to build out their charger networks as electric vehicles become more common, with Michigan getting $110 million through fiscal year 2026. The law also included a separate $2.5 billion grant program issued on a discretionary basis to cities, rural areas and major transportation corridors.

Republican and Democratic lawmakers alike criticized the program after it produced only a handful of completed, functional charger stations within the first three years of the program. ""That’s pathetic,"" U.S. Sen. Jeff Merkley, D-Ore., said in a May 2024 hearing. ""That is a vast administrative failure.”

A recent update showed progress. The federal programs yielded 384 charging ports by April 2025, according to a recent Government Accountability Office report. But even as projects and investments started to yield more results, the Trump administration fought for months to put — and keep — the program on hold.

Trump, in an executive order signed the day he returned to office, called out NEVI in a section on ""Terminating the Green New Deal."" His Department of Transportation then suspended the program in February, though the agency noted a goal of providing updated guidance later in the year.

NEVI had about $2.7 billion remaining in unobligated funds at the time, according to the Federal Highway Administration.

The GAO, a nonpartisan agency within Congress, issued an opinion in May finding that the Trump administration was breaking the law by withholding charger funds. The opinion was not binding, but it served as an important signal that federal courts might reach a similar conclusion and force the DOT to resume the program, according to the nonpartisan Eno Center for Transportation.

The White House's Office of Management and Budget then instructed the DOT to disregard the opinion and continue its suspension of the NEVI program. But the Trump administration now appears to be ending its NEVI fight, instead vowing to make it easier for states to address a lag in public charging infrastructure that has slowed EV adoption in the United States.

The Transportation Department said Monday it would minimize onerous requirements and simplify the federal approval process for state plans. For example, the new guidance removes an order for states to ensure ""the deployment, installation, operation, and use of EV charging infrastructure achieves equitable and fair distribution of benefits and services.""

The new guidance also removes a requirement for states to explain how their NEVI implementation would encourage participation from small businesses, including minority-owned and women-owned small businesses. The guidance also minimizes requirements for states to consider ""electric grid integration and renewable energy.""

States will be required to submit new plans to the Department of Transportation within 30 days.

They came with promises of transformation: thousands of jobs, surging salaries and a foothold in the booming electric vehicle market.

Imola Automotive USA, a Boca Raton, Florida-based startup, pitched officials in small, struggling towns in Georgia, Oklahoma and Arkansas on a bold vision. The company planned to build six EV plants, create 45,000 jobs — and help these impoverished communities secure a place in America’s green future.

But more than 18 months later, the company hasn’t broken ground on a single site. And its top executive — whose background is in television and athletic shoes, not automotive manufacturing — has gone silent.

A Floodlight investigation did not uncover lost taxpayer money in Fort Valley, Georgia; Langston, Oklahoma; or Pine Bluff, Arkansas, where Imola has sought free land, municipal financing and other incentives for its shifting proposals.

But an economic development watchdog said the episode illustrates how the frenzy to land electric vehicle jobs can leave economically distressed towns vulnerable to empty promises.

Imola CEO Rodney Henry declined requests for an interview. He responded to Floodlight’s inquiries with a short statement, insisting the company had not given up on its plans, which have included a partnership with an Italian manufacturer of two-seat electric vehicles.

“Our timetable has been modified due to matters outside of our control,” Henry said in a statement. “We are highly focused on bringing our goals into alignment. Due to proprietary consideration as well as NDA (nondisclosure) agreements, we are not at liberty to discuss specifics at this juncture.”

That’s a stark shift from the company’s earlier promises. In a press release issued in January 2024, Henry claimed the company had already secured land in multiple states to build half a dozen plants and create tens of thousands of jobs.

Could someone with no experience in car manufacturing really deliver that?

“It’s ludicrous,” said Greg LeRoy, CEO of Good Jobs First, a nonprofit that tracks and analyzes economic development projects.

Building large auto plants, he said, requires “a great deal of capital, a great deal of management skill, a great deal of engineering and marketing chops. And obviously, Tesla developed those, but they didn’t do it overnight, right?”

Langston, Fort Valley and Pine Bluff weren’t the only towns swept up in the competition to attract electric vehicle plants. Spurred by federal policies like the Inflation Reduction Act, which unlocked billions in private investment and expanded government incentives, local officials across the country scrambled to land high-paying manufacturing jobs and a slice of the booming clean energy economy.

Since the IRA passed in 2022, more than 150 EV plants have been announced in the United States, according to E2, a nonpartisan group of business leaders who advocate for economic development good for the environment.

But that rush may be grinding to a halt. The recently passed “One Big Beautiful Bill,” which rolls back many federal tax credits and incentives for electric vehicles, is already throwing the EV sector into turmoil — threatening to stall or shrink the kinds of ambitious projects towns like Langston, Fort Valley and Pine Bluff were counting on. E2 reports that plans for 14 EV-related plants have been canceled this year.

Bold promises, then silence

In three towns where Imola pledged massive investment, there’s no sign of construction and little more than confusion.

Langston — a town of 1,600 where more than 35% of residents live in poverty — never saw Imola’s plans take shape.

A 2023 letter to the city council from former Imola chief operating officer Eric Pettus stated that the company had run into “multiple obstacles,” including trouble acquiring enough land.

“In order for us to continue moving forward on the project we are requesting that the City of Langston convey to us any and all vacant properties owned by the city,” Pettus wrote.

Langston City Council member Magnus Scott said the company also asked the town to issue municipal bonds to help them build their plant.

But before any land changed hands or bonds were issued, a company representative delivered unexpected news: The deal had been canceled. “I guess maybe they ran into financial problems,” Scott said.

Reached by phone, Pettus, of south Florida, said he’s no longer employed by Imola but instead works as a consultant for the company. Citing a nondisclosure agreement, he declined to discuss Imola’s plans.

Fort Valley gave its backing in early 2024 to Imola’s ambitious plan to build an EV plant that would employ 7,500 workers.

A year later, with no sign of progress on the plant, the company came back to the Georgia town with an entirely different proposal. This time, instead of building an EV plant, they pitched a high-tech lighting system for the town.

One city council member balked.

“You want us to sign an agreement for 99 years before you bring us the car company,” said council member Laronda Eason, according to minutes of the March 2025 meeting. “It feels like a bait and switch.”

Eason did not respond to emails and text messages seeking comment on the Imola proposal.

In Pine Bluff, where per capita income last year was just over $21,000, city officials were initially all in. Writing to Henry in August 2024, then-Mayor Shirley Washington said the city of 39,000 stood ready to buy land, build infrastructure and issue industrial revenue bonds to support Imola’s vision.

“With an anticipated employment base of more than 8,000 jobs,” Washington wrote, “we firmly believe this investment will marshal a pivotal turning point in our community.”

But a year later, the project hasn’t moved. “We never did get off the ground with that,” Washington said in a brief phone interview.

LeRoy said Imola’s pitch fits a troubling pattern.

“It grabs me as an example of how the craze among governors and mayors to get the next big thing has caused some sloppy vetting,” he said of the struggling communities courted by Imola.

Such towns, he said, are “easy prey. …They’re desperate.”

Grand vision, missing details

Henry, who lives in Florida, touts a background as a longtime TV executive producer and the founder of Protégé, an athletic footwear brand. He claims on his IMDB profile that Protégé donated a million pairs of shoes to African nations.

But despite announcements of partnerships and promises of good-paying jobs, his EV company has yet to show any tangible progress.

Floodlight found the website for Imola — named after the Italian city where Tazzari EVs are made — is no longer accessible without a password. A search of the Tazzari website found no mention of plants in the United States. But a 2024 version of the Imola site mentions the tiny vehicles “coming soon to America.”

In early 2024, Imola Automotive USA and the Tazzari Group — an Italian firm best known for its electric two-seater micro cars — jointly announced plans for a partnership.

The EVs that Tazzari makes in Italy aren’t designed for highway driving. Top speed on the company’s Opensky Sport model is about 56 miles per hour, while maximum speed on the Opensky Limited is about 37 mph, according to the company’s webpage.

Tazzari didn’t respond to email messages from a Floodlight reporter.

Henry said at that time that the company chose Langston and Fort Valley because of their universities.

“Both of these locations are ideal,” he said in the January 2024 news release, “as their proximity to communities with institutions of higher learning, will allow residents and students career opportunities in the fast growing EV Technology and Innovation Industry.”

Many local officials in Fort Valley, Langston and Pine Bluff did not respond to interview requests. Few documents were provided in response to Floodlight’s public records requests.

But it’s clear from available records that Imola’s promises stirred hope.

Langston Mayor Michael Boyles called the proposal “transformative” in a January 2024 news release.

But some local leaders soon began to question the details.

Erica Johnson, a real estate agent and former member of Langston’s economic development commission, said parts of the plan didn’t add up. How, for instance, would the company house more than 1,000 workers in such a small town? And how were they going to build such a large plant on land without utilities or water?

Her doubts deepened when she learned that Imola wanted to lock down land agreements without putting up any earnest money.

“My early feeling was that, ‘Something is not quite okay with this,’ ” she said. “But I think the hope for our community kind of outweighed the ability to just take things slow and look at them for where they are and what they are — versus where you hope them to be.”

Eventually, the promise fizzled.

“It was disappointing,” Johnson said. “…We could have had our energy and time focused on something that seemed more valid and more substantial.”

Still waiting for the shovels

Some residents in Fort Valley are still holding out hope.

Mayor Jeffery Lundy said early last year that it was a “priority for my administration to land a company like Imola Automotive USA.” Local officials, he said, were looking forward to the economic boost the plant would bring.

At the time, Imola claimed it would break ground on a 195-acre site by the third quarter of 2024 and open the plant within 20 months, according to a report in the Macon Telegraph.

During a February 2024 town hall meeting, Imola officials told residents that the plant would pay employees an average of $45 an hour, according to a Facebook post. Commenters buzzed with excitement, with one writing: “Application me !!!!”

Pettus told a local TV station that most jobs would require only a high school diploma.

In early 2024, Fort Valley rezoned land to accommodate the plant, and the city council signed off on the deal. But more than 15 months later, there’s still no sign of construction.

Council members were told that Georgia Power couldn’t provide sufficient power for the EV company, according to minutes of their March 2025 meeting. A spokesman for Georgia Power said that while the utility doesn’t discuss economic development projects, “We’re prepared and ready to meet the energy needs of any new customer.”

Makita Driver, one of the Facebook commenters who’d voiced excitement about the proposed EV plant, said there’s no doubt she would have applied for one of the jobs there — had the facility ever been built.

“The pay rate was really what got my attention,” she said.

As a medical assistant, Driver said she earns far less than what Imola had promised. But she eventually concluded the promises were too good to be true.

“Who really makes that kind of money starting out?” she asked.

In a brief interview with Floodlight on July 11, Mayor Lundy said he’s still in contact with Henry.

Ford President and CEO Jim Farley told an audience of plant workers, local and state elected officials and other representatives Monday inside the Louisville Assembly Plant that moving forward with the “universal” EV platform was a risk, especially with global EV competition, but the company was investing in the future.
The EV batteries for the new platform will be supplied from a Michigan battery plant.

“It’s not nearly as drastic as they expected when they first came at us talking about an EV,” said Brandon Reisinger, the Louisville Assembly Plant building chair for the union.","LOUISVILLE — Ford Motor Company will invest nearly $2 billion to convert a longtime auto manufacturing plant in Louisville to build electric vehicles from a new platform adaptable to multiple vehicle types, aiming to launch a mid-sized EV pickup truck by 2027.

Ford President and CEO Jim Farley told an audience of plant workers, local and state elected officials and other representatives Monday inside the Louisville Assembly Plant that moving forward with the “universal” EV platform was a risk, especially with global EV competition, but the company was investing in the future.

“We needed a rapid approach and a really tough challenge to create an affordable vehicle that delights customers in every way that matters,” Farley said. “We need to do it and be sustainable and make money, and we need to do it with American workers.”

Farley and other Ford executives said the EV truck would be priced starting at $30,000, would have an “amazing range” and be built through a newly designed assembly line to be created at the Louisville plant. The EV batteries for the new platform will be supplied from a Michigan battery plant. The new truck will have 20% fewer parts compared to internal combustion engine vehicles, allowing for significantly quicker assembly line production. The more efficient assembly line for electric vehicles, these executives said, would also mean less physical strain workers and less getting in and out of vehicles.

Farley was joined on stage by Democratic Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear, who lauded the “massive investment” in the state. A release from Beshear’s office states Ford’s plant conversion would be the third largest economic development project in Kentucky’s history.

“This cutting-edge platform will be the foundation for the next generation of vehicles. The best part is, these vehicles will be affordable,” Beshear said. “They’re going to help so many American families keep more money in their pockets for groceries, medicine, school supplies and yes, even that family vacation.”

Leaders with United Auto Workers Local 862, representing workers at Ford’s Louisville Assembly Plant and Kentucky Truck Plant in Louisville said the newly designed assembly line for electric vehicles would cause some plant workers to lose their jobs in Louisville and have to take jobs at another Ford operation. The Louisville Assembly Plant currently builds two SUVs, the Ford Escape and Lincoln Corsair.

“It’s not nearly as drastic as they expected when they first came at us talking about an EV,” said Brandon Reisinger, the Louisville Assembly Plant building chair for the union. “I don’t foresee anybody hitting the street at all. I don’t know that our working number will be exactly the same it is now, but nobody’s gonna get laid off.”

Reisinger told reporters some of the work done elsewhere to preassemble cars before they arrive at the plant will be done at the plant with the new EV, offsetting the downsizing. He estimates the plant’s workforce will be about a couple hundred fewer people when the plant conversation is complete, also accounting for people who retire. Ford executives said 2,200 jobs at the plant will be “secured” with the conversion; about 3,300 workers are employed at the plant as of 2024, according to Ford.

Reisinger said he believes the conversion could begin at the end of the year with some workers temporarily unemployed during a few months of the conversion, but the union’s contract provides for supplemental unemployment benefits to workers worth about 80% of a paycheck.

When asked about political headwinds against electric vehicles from elected officials in the federal and state governments Reisinger pointed to the lower cost of charging an EV compared to filling up a gas tank as a compelling reason for EVs.

“I’m going to end up buying me one of these as well when we start building,” Reisinger said. “It’s going to be a very cost-effective vehicle to drive.”",https://cdn.newsfromthestates.com/styles/social_large/s3/articles/feeds-state-47652/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/img_1740-1024x6831754938553.jpg?h=199d8c1f&itok=-eV24Hj5,N,,2025-08-11 17:08:02.534850

This move aims to revitalize Ford's EV strategy and tap into the growing demand for electric vehicles. The platform will enable the production of a more modestly priced electric pickup truck, targeting a broader customer base.

Ford Motor Company (NYSE: F) has announced a significant investment of $2 billion to retool its Kentucky plant, aiming to develop a new, more efficient electric vehicle (EV) manufacturing platform for a more affordable electric pickup truck. This strategic move is part of Ford's broader effort to revitalize its EV program and capture a larger share of the growing electric truck market [1].

The company plans to launch the midsize electric pickup truck in 2027, priced at around $30,000. The new vehicle will be built on Ford's Universal EV Platform, which is expected to underpin several models. The platform promises to produce vehicles at scale, reduce parts by 20% compared to traditional vehicles, and decrease assembly time by 15%. This efficiency is crucial as consumers face the end of EV tax credits [1].

Ford's new assembly line, known as the ""assembly tree"" platform, will streamline production by using three sub-assemblies that run simultaneously and then join together. The Kentucky facility will be expanded by 52,000 square feet to enhance material efficiency. The investment was supported by an incentive offer from the Kentucky Economic Development Finance Authority [1].

The new electric pickup truck is expected to have more interior space than a Toyota RAV4, including a front trunk and a truck bed for cargo. This design aims to cater to a broader customer base, particularly those seeking a more affordable and spacious electric vehicle option [2].

The $2 billion investment in the Kentucky facility comes amid concerns over the phasing out of government subsidies for EV buyers. Ford's strategy to lower the cost of ownership over five years compared to a three-year-old used Tesla Model Y is a strategic move to remain competitive in the market [1].

Ford's CEO, Jim Farley, emphasized the company's commitment to creating affordable vehicles that delight customers. The new platform and truck aim to address the evolving needs of consumers in the electric vehicle market [1].

The automaker’s top executive unveiled the new EV strategy at Ford’s Louisville Assembly Plant which, after producing gas-powered vehicles for 70 years, will be converted to manufacture electric vehicles.

“In our careers, as automobile people we’re lucky if we get to work on one, maybe two, projects that really change the face of our industry,” CEO Jim Farley told plant workers in Kentucky on Monday. “And I believe today is going to light the match as one of those projects for all of us here.”

The Big Detroit automakers have continued to transition from internal combustion engines to EV technology even as President Trump’s administration unwinds incentives for automakers to go electric. Trump’s massive tax and spending law targets EV incentives, including the imminent removal of a credit that saves buyers up to $7,500 on a new electric car.

Yet Farley and other top executives in the auto industry say that electric vehicles are the future and there is no going back.

The first EV to roll off the revamped Louisville assembly line will be a midsize, four-door electric pickup truck in 2027 for domestic and international markets, the company said Monday.

The new electric trucks will be powered by lower-cost batteries made at a Ford factory in Michigan. The Detroit automaker previously announced a $3-billion investment to build the battery factory.

The automaker sees this as a “Model T moment” for its EV business — a reference to revolutionary changes on the production line led by the company’s founder, Henry Ford, when it began churning out vehicles from a factory more than a century ago. Farley said the changes will will upend how electric vehicles are made in the U.S.

“It represents the most radical change on how we design and how we build vehicles at Ford since the Model T,” Farley said.

The company said it will use a universal platform and production system for its EVs, essentially the underpinning of a vehicle that can be applied across a wide range of models.

The Louisville factory — one of two Ford assembly plants in Kentucky’s largest city — will be revamped to cut production costs and make assembly time faster as it’s prepared to churn out electric vehicles.

The result will be “an affordable electric vehicle that we expect to be profitable,” Farley said in an interview with the Associated Press ahead of the announcement. “This is an example of us rejuvenating our U.S. plants with the most modern manufacturing techniques.”

The new platform enables a lineup of affordable vehicles to be produced at scale, Ford said. It will reduce parts by 20% versus a typical vehicle, with 25% fewer fasteners, 40% fewer workstations dock-to-dock in the plant and a 15% faster assembly time, Ford said. The traditional assembly line will be transformed into an “assembly tree” at the Louisville plant, it said. Instead of one long conveyor, three sub-assembly lines will operate simultaneously and then join together, it said.

Other specifications for the midsize electric truck — including its reveal date, starting price, EPA-estimated battery range, battery sizes and charge times — will be announced later, the company said. Ford revealed in its release that the truck will have a targeted starting price of about $30,000.

Ford said its investment in the Louisville plant will secure 2,200 hourly jobs.

Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear said Monday that the automaker’s plans for the Louisville plant will strengthen a more than century-old partnership between Ford and the Bluegrass State.

“This announcement not only represents one of the largest investments on record in our state, it also boosts Kentucky’s position at the center of EV-related innovation and solidifies Louisville Assembly Plant as an important part of Ford’s future,” Beshear said.

Ford said its combined investment of about $5 billion at the Kentucky assembly plant and Michigan battery plant is expected to create or secure nearly 4,000 direct jobs between the two plants while strengthening the domestic supply chain with dozens of new U.S.-based suppliers.

Ford previously forecast weaker earnings growth for this year and further losses in its electric vehicles business as it works to control costs. Model e, Ford’s electric vehicle business, posted a full-year loss of $5.08 billion for 2024 as revenue fell 35% to $3.9 billion.

Ford’s new EV strategy comes as Chinese automakers are quickly expanding across the globe, offering relatively affordable electric vehicles.

“We’re not in a race to build the most electric cars,” Farley told the AP when asked about competition from China. “We’re in a race to have a sustainable electric business that’s profitable, that customers love.

“And this new vehicle built in Louisville, Ky., is going to be a much better solution than anything that anyone can buy from China,” he added.",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8f9b0d3/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5366x2817+0+380/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F52%2F8b%2Fc52e45ec91f96edfdd3a7541a301%2Fcb0fadd79f46435aa54c247b3f977595,N,,2025-08-11 17:04:18.594018

Recent reports suggest the new EV pickup could be a revival of the Ranchero.","Just as the American EV market braces for a potential collapse, Ford is making a shocking pivot. With federal tax credits set to disappear on September 30 and demand expected to plummet, the automaker is doubling down with an additional $2 billion investment in battery-electric vehicles (BEVs). But it’s doing so with a new strategy borrowed not from its American rivals, but directly from China.

The centerpiece of this bet is a new midsize electric pickup with a targeted base price of just $30,000. CEO Jim Farley announced, on Monday, the unnamed vehicle at an event in Louisville, Kentucky, where it will be assembled, with a planned market arrival in 2027.

“This new truck, based on this universal platform, is going to be more spacious inside than the RAV4, the best-selling car in the United States,” Farley declared, directly targeting the king of the gasoline SUV market. “But it will have a frunk and it will have a whole pickup truck bed behind it. No one has seen this kind of flexibility.”

A $30,000 Truck With a Familiar Name?

Recent reports suggest the new EV pickup could be a revival of the Ranchero. According to the site Ford Authority, the company has filed a new trademark for the name, specifically for use on electric pickup trucks. The Ranchero, a car-truck hybrid not seen on U.S. roads since 1979, was a cult classic that offered the comfort of a sedan with the utility of a pickup bed.

This move marks a radical departure for Ford. It’s a break from its American competitors, notably Tesla, which has focused on premium vehicles like the commercially struggling Cybertruck. It’s also a break from Ford’s own profitable strategy of selling large, expensive pickups and SUVs like the F-150 and Expedition.

Instead, Ford is adopting a strategy that looks much more like that of Chinese automaker BYD, which has become the world’s largest EV seller by specializing in affordable electric cars. The cheapest BYD EV, the Seagull, starts at the equivalent of just $9,700 in China. This focus on affordability has allowed BYD to steal massive market share from Tesla in both China and Europe.

Farley acknowledged that many current EVs don’t address what buyers actually want. “A computer can have much lower costs—that’s why we redid this platform… to bring the costs down,” he told CNBC.

The Secret Sauce: Reinventing the Factory

So how does Ford plan to build a low-cost, high-performance pickup that no other American automaker has managed? By completely reinventing its design and manufacturing process. A secret “skunkworks” team created, the carmaker said, the new “Ford Universal EV Platform,” a simplified architecture using 20% fewer parts and 25% fewer fasteners. The wiring harness alone is 4,000 feet shorter.

The battery is another key. Ford is manufacturing its own cobalt-free LFP prismatic batteries in Michigan. This chemistry is, Ford claimed, significantly cheaper, and its design allows it to serve as a structural part of the truck’s floor, saving space and cost.

Finally, Ford has reinvented the factory itself. Instead of the traditional moving assembly line, the new truck will be built using an “assembly tree.” The vehicle is built in three main sub-assemblies—the front, the rear, and the structural battery floor with the interior already attached—which are then joined at the end. Ford claims this revolutionary process is 15% faster and considerably simpler.

“Our idea is that the people working here in Louisville will be able to buy this car and spend money on other things they love, like vacations, their home, and their children’s education,” Farley said.

This new truck is a direct challenge to the entire auto industry. But it comes as Ford’s own EV division is struggling. In the second quarter of 2025, the unit recorded an operating loss of $1.3 billion. The company is betting that this radical new approach, borrowed from China and powered by American innovation, is the only way to finally make EVs profitable for the company and affordable for everyone else.",https://gizmodo.com/app/uploads/2024/09/A-Ford-F-150-on-a-sales-lot-in-Miami.jpg,N,,2025-08-11 17:04:22.797962

By terminating the partnership, VINCI streamlines decision-making and governance, enabling faster execution of its renewable energy projects.
The broader renewable energy M&A landscape offers additional insights.
VINCI's strategic adjustments also reflect a broader recalibration of investor priorities in the renewable energy sector.
In conclusion, VINCI's post-acquisition strategy offers a compelling case study for investors navigating the renewable energy sector.","The renewable energy sector is undergoing a seismic shift as companies recalibrate their strategies to align with evolving regulatory frameworks, investor priorities, and technological realities. At the forefront of this transformation is VINCI, a global infrastructure and concessions leader, which has recently restructured its post-acquisition strategy for Cobra IS, a Spanish renewable energy developer. By terminating its joint venture with ACS and fixing the earn-out for Cobra IS at €380 million—down from a performance-based €600 million—VINCI has signaled a strategic pivot toward capital efficiency, risk mitigation, and direct control over its green energy portfolio. For investors, these moves offer a blueprint for navigating the sector's complexities and assessing the long-term profitability of energy infrastructure investments.

VINCI's decision to fix the earn-out for Cobra IS reflects a broader industry trend: the de-risking of performance-based incentives in favor of predictable cash flows. Originally, the earn-out was tied to the development of new “Ready to Build” projects, a structure that exposed VINCI to uncertainties such as regulatory delays, supply chain bottlenecks, and market volatility. By locking in a fixed payment, VINCI eliminates these variables, ensuring a stable capital allocation path. This shift aligns with the U.S. Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), which has incentivized direct investments in clean energy infrastructure by offering tax credits and streamlined permitting for projects with clear timelines. Investors should note that companies prioritizing operational clarity over speculative growth are better positioned to capitalize on IRA-driven opportunities.

The termination of VINCI's joint venture with ACS further underscores this strategic realignment. Joint ventures, while useful for sharing risks and expertise, often introduce governance complexities and profit-sharing dilution. By terminating the partnership, VINCI streamlines decision-making and governance, enabling faster execution of its renewable energy projects. This move mirrors the sector-wide shift toward standalone development, particularly in the U.S., where the IRA has encouraged companies to pursue projects with clear ownership and control. For VINCI, this means greater flexibility to redirect capital toward high-impact initiatives, such as its €1.2 billion second-generation biofuel plant in Spain, which is projected to reduce CO₂ emissions by 75%.

From an investor perspective, VINCI's strategy highlights the importance of evaluating energy infrastructure portfolios through the lens of capital efficiency and concession stability. The company's robust order book of €71.3 billion and liquidity of €6.5 billion provide a strong foundation for funding these initiatives without diluting shareholder returns. Moreover, the fixed earn-out structure reduces financial exposure, allowing VINCI to maintain a disciplined balance sheet—a critical factor in an environment of rising interest rates and regulatory uncertainty. Investors should monitor how companies like VINCI leverage fixed-cost structures to enhance returns while maintaining alignment with global decarbonization goals.

The broader renewable energy M&A landscape offers additional insights. The U.S. market, for instance, has seen a shift toward mature assets with long-term power purchase agreements (PPAs) and energy storage solutions, as investors prioritize predictable cash flows over speculative projects. VINCI's focus on high-impact, capital-efficient projects aligns with this trend, particularly in sectors like biofuels and advanced nuclear, which are gaining traction due to their scalability and alignment with zero-carbon objectives.

For investors assessing the evolving profitability of energy infrastructure portfolios, several key metrics warrant attention. First, the ability of a company to convert development pipelines into operational assets with stable cash flows is critical. VINCI's revised strategy, which prioritizes projects with clear interconnection timelines and concession stability, demonstrates this capability. Second, the alignment of a company's portfolio with IRA incentives—such as tax credits for energy storage, advanced nuclear, and sustainable aviation fuels—can significantly enhance project economics. Finally, liquidity and order book strength are essential indicators of a company's capacity to fund growth without overleveraging.

VINCI's strategic adjustments also reflect a broader recalibration of investor priorities in the renewable energy sector. As the industry matures, stakeholders are increasingly favoring companies that balance short-term stability with long-term sustainability. The termination of the ACS joint venture and the fixed earn-out for Cobra IS exemplify this balance, reducing financial risk while maintaining a strong pipeline of decarbonization projects. For investors, this signals a preference for companies that demonstrate disciplined capital allocation and a clear path to decarbonization.

In conclusion, VINCI's post-acquisition strategy offers a compelling case study for investors navigating the renewable energy sector. By fixing earn-outs, terminating joint ventures, and focusing on high-impact projects, VINCI has positioned itself to capitalize on IRA-driven opportunities while mitigating risks associated with regulatory and market volatility. As the sector evolves, investors should prioritize companies that exhibit similar strategic clarity, capital discipline, and alignment with global sustainability goals. The future of energy infrastructure lies not in speculative bets but in the execution of well-defined, capital-efficient projects that deliver both environmental and financial returns.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-08-11 21:01:01.837050

Tesla is emphasizing the expiration of the tax credits on its site to encourage potential buyers to commit to a sale.
What to know if you’re thinking about buying an EV If you’re one of the people who was considering an EV purchase, experts say you should figure out which car you want soon—and not hesitate on the purchase.
The good news for potential buyers is that in July, at least, EV prices are still coming down.","The clock is ticking on tax credits for electric vehicles—and that’s pushing a lot of people who were debating whether or not to get one off of the fence.

Sales are surging at dealerships for EVs, and likely will remain high for the next month and a half. That’s because on September 30, the $7,500 tax credit for new EV purchases (and $4,000 for a used one) will disappear, a move that will add challenges to an industry that already has plenty.

Wait times for a new Tesla are currently hovering between four and six weeks, but over the weekend, the Tesla site was reportedly showing waits of four to six months. (It’s unclear if that was a mistake or glitch on Tesla’s part. Tesla did not reply to Fast Company‘s request for comment on the matter.)

Ford and General Motors, which also make EVs, have not reported extended wait times, but customer interest is growing.

Analysts say that’s to be expected, but once September comes to an end, the party may well be over for EV companies.

The July 4 signing of the Trump budget bill marked the death knell for EV incentives (and also spurred a feud between the White House and Elon Musk). That puts the EV industry at something of a crossroads.

Last month, consumers purchased 130,100 new EVs, the second-highest total on record, according to Cox Automotive. That was a 26.4% jump from June, and roughly 20% higher than last July. Used EV sales came in at 36,700, which was a record high.

Tesla is emphasizing the expiration of the tax credits on its site to encourage potential buyers to commit to a sale. The company has also increased lease rates of the Model Y by as much as 14% and done away with a free upgrade incentive for the Models Y and 3.

But the sales numbers won’t remain that high, experts say.

“Volatility is anticipated, as EV share mix from July-September is expected to advance, followed by much lower take rates in the fourth quarter of 2025,” S&P wrote in a blog post.

A June report from AAA showed flagging consumer interest in EVs. Only 19% of the people surveyed by the organization said they were “likely” or “very likely” to purchase one as their next car. The number who were adamantly against buying an EV was up, with 63% saying they were “unlikely” or “very unlikely” to buy an EV. That’s the highest number since 2022.

Tesla, meanwhile, reported a 16% drop in vehicle sales in its second quarter earnings. (The company’s stock is down 10% year to date.)

What to know if you’re thinking about buying an EV

If you’re one of the people who was considering an EV purchase, experts say you should figure out which car you want soon—and not hesitate on the purchase. Those who do could find themselves at the mercy of the dealers.

“Electric vehicle demand and sales will absolutely spike between now and September 30,” says iSeeCars executive analyst Karl Brauer. “I expect the typical last-minute rush between September 20 and 30, and I expect those buyers will be left with the dregs of the EV market. Dealers will be happy to leverage their advantage if they still have a desirable EV on the lot on September 29 and 30.”

An alternate scenario could see a stand-off between dealers and consumers in the coming weeks. Dealers, who know sales are about to plummet in October, could be willing to come down much further on pricing as September 30 approaches if they still have a surplus of inventory.

(To receive the tax credit, consumers must not only purchase their vehicle before the September 30 deadline, but must also take delivery by that date.)

The good news for potential buyers is that in July, at least, EV prices are still coming down. Kelley Blue Book says the average new EV cost $55,689, down by 2.2% from the June average and 4.2% lower than the year prior. Tesla saw the biggest price drops.

“The urgency created by the administration’s decision to sunset government-backed, IRA-era EV incentives was expected to create serious demand for EVs in the short term,” said Stephanie Valdez Streaty, senior analyst, Cox Automotive. “If last month is any measure: Mission Accomplished. . . . At this pace, Q3 will be the best ever and then some, as buyers jump in before the big incentives dry up.”","https://images.fastcompany.com/image/upload/f_webp,q_auto,c_fit,w_1024,h_1024/wp-cms-2/2025/08/p-91383989-EV-tax-credit-ends-september-30-2025.jpg",N,,2025-08-11 16:03:23.764770

The company said it would use a “new universal EV platform” to produce a midsize, four-door electric pick-up, with a price tag starting from about $30,000. The chassis would be subsequently rolled out across “a family of affordable vehicles to be produced at scale for customers”, it added.

Ford’s announcement comes at a crucial time for EV makers. US groups, already facing strong competition from lower cost Chinese rivals such as BYD, have been grappling with President Donald Trump’s tariffs and the ending of policies favourable to electric cars.

Chief executive Jim Farley had previously hailed Ford’s new universal EV platform as a “Model T” moment for the company. The platform involves building vehicles with fewer parts and a streamlined manufacturing process, which the group hopes will cut the cost of producing EVs.

Ford said the new EV platform would use 20 per cent fewer parts than a “typical” vehicle and would result in the assembly line being 15 per cent faster.

In its most recent quarter, Ford’s Model EV business reported an operating loss of $1.3bn, while its other two divisions — petrol and hybrid vehicles, and commercial vehicles — were profitable.

Ford will make its new mid-size EV pick-up, which is scheduled to roll off the production line in 2027, at its assembly plant in Louisville, Kentucky, which is being converted from a factory that produced petrol-powered vehicles.

The $2bn retooling of the plant comes alongside Ford’s earlier $3bn commitment for its EV battery making factory in its home state of Michigan. The total $5bn investment, would result in the “creating or securing” of almost 4,000 jobs, the group said.

Farley acknowledged that Detroit carmakers had all too many times tried to make affordable vehicles that ended up with idled plants, job cuts and uncertainty. “This had to be a strong, sustainable and profitable business,” he said on Monday.

Ford already makes a higher percentage of vehicles in the US than Detroit rival General Motors, leaving it better positioned on international supply chains and therefore less exposed to the Trump administration’s tariff policies.

The decision to pour money into domestic production dovetails with the president’s push to bring manufacturing back to the US.",,N,,2025-08-11 17:05:58.405994

It will be built at Louisville Assembly Plant.

The new Ford Universal EV Platform and Ford Universal EV Production System introduced today were born from a team that combines the discipline, expertise and scale of a company with 122 years of experience with the speed, innovation and first-principles thinking of a California-based electric vehicle hardware and software skunkworks team.

The result: a simple, efficient, flexible ecosystem to deliver a family of affordable, electric, software-defined vehicles – the first of which is a midsize, four-door electric pickup that will be assembled at Ford’s Louisville Assembly Plant for U.S. and export markets. Its launch is scheduled for 2027.

“We took a radical approach to a very hard challenge: Create affordable vehicles that delight customers in every way that matters – design, innovation, flexibility, space, driving pleasure, and cost of ownership – and do it with American workers,” said Ford President and CEO Jim Farley.

“We have all lived through far too many ‘good college tries’ by Detroit automakers to make affordable vehicles that ends up with idled plants, layoffs and uncertainty. So, this had to be a strong, sustainable and profitable business. From Day 1, we knew there was no incremental path to success. We empowered a tiny skunkworks team three time zones away from Detroit. We tore up the moving assembly line concept and designed a better one. And we found a path to be the first automaker to make prismatic LFP batteries in the U.S.”

The Ford Universal EV Platform

The numbers tell the story, Farley said. The platform reduces parts by 20% versus a typical vehicle, with 25% fewer fasteners, 40% fewer workstations dock-to-dock in the plant and 15% faster assembly time. Lower cost of ownership over five years than a three-year-old used Tesla Model Y.

Take for instance the wiring harness in the new midsize truck; it will be more than 4,000 feet (1.3 kilometers) shorter and 10 kilograms lighter than the one used in our first-gen electric SUV.

Lithium iron phosphate (LFP) prismatic batteries also enable space and weight savings, while delivering cost reduction and durability for customers. The platform’s cobalt-free and nickel-free LFP battery pack is a structural sub-assembly that also serves as the vehicle’s floor. This low center of gravity improves handling, creates a quiet cabin, and provides a surprising amount of interior space.

The new midsize truck is forecasted to have more passenger room than the latest Toyota RAV4, even before you include the frunk and the truck bed. You can lock your surfboards or other gear in that bed – no roof rack or trailer hitch racks required.

But it’s not just about space and utility. Ford makes passion products – and this electric vehicle platform with a low center of gravity from the battery, instant torque from electric motors and obsessive chassis engineering will make it fun to drive. The midsize truck will have a targeted 0-60 time as fast as a Mustang EcoBoost, with more downforce.

“We took inspiration from the Model T – the universal car that changed the world,” said Doug Field, Ford chief EV, digital and design officer. “We assembled a really brilliant collection of minds across Ford and unleashed them to find new solutions to old problems. We applied first‑principles engineering, pushing to the limits of physics to make it fun to drive and compete on affordability. Our new zonal electric architecture unlocks capabilities the industry has never seen. This isn’t a stripped‑down, old‑school vehicle.”

Additional specifications for the midsize electric truck – including reveal date, starting price, EPA-estimated battery range, battery sizes and charge times – will be communicated later.

The Ford Universal EV Production System

The Ford team obsessed about efficiency in manufacturing, too, transforming the traditional assembly line into an “assembly tree”. Instead of one long conveyor, three sub-assemblies run down their own lines simultaneously and then join together.

Large single-piece aluminum unicastings replace dozens of smaller parts, enabling the front and rear of the vehicle to be assembled separately.

The front and rear are then combined with the third sub-assembly, the structural battery, which is independently assembled with seats, consoles and carpeting, to form the vehicle.

Parts travel down the assembly tree to operators in a kit. Within that kit, all fasteners, scanners and power tools required for the job are included – and in the correct orientation for use.

The Ford Universal EV Production System dramatically improves ergonomics for employees by reducing twisting, reaching and bending, allowing them to focus on the job at hand.

Because of the integration between the Ford Universal EV Production System and Platform, assembly of the midsize electric truck could be up to 40% faster than Louisville Assembly Plant’s current vehicles. Some of that time will be reinvested into insourcing and automation to improve quality and cost, ultimately netting a 15% speed improvement.

“We put our employees at the center and re-created the factory from scratch,” said Bryce Currie, Ford vice president, Americas Manufacturing. “We live and breathe continuous improvement, but sometimes you need a dramatic leap forward. We expect ergonomic breakthroughs and complexity reduction – through elimination of parts, connectors and wire – will flow through to significant quality and cost wins.”

Continued Investment in American Manufacturing

Ford builds on its strong legacy of investing in U.S. vehicle assembly, planning to invest nearly $2 billion in Louisville Assembly Plant to assemble the midsize electric truck, securing 2,200 hourly jobs.

The project is supported by an incentive offer from the Kentucky Economic Development Finance Authority.

“Today, Ford and Team Kentucky are introducing the world to the future of automotive production with nearly $2 billion being invested to transform the Louisville Assembly Plant, which will also secure 2,200 jobs for Kentuckians,” said Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear. “This announcement not only represents one of the largest investments on record in our state, it also boosts Kentucky’s position at the center of EV-related innovation and solidifies Louisville Assembly Plant as an important part of Ford’s future. Thanks to Ford’s leaders for their continued faith in Kentucky and our incredible workforce. Ford and Kentucky have been a tremendous team for more than 100 years, and that partnership has never been stronger than it is today.”

Louisville Assembly Plant will expand by 52,000 square feet in order to move material more efficiently. Digital infrastructure upgrades will give Louisville Assembly Plant the fastest network with the most access points out of any Ford plant globally, enabling more quality scans.

Ford’s investment in Louisville Assembly Plant is in addition to its previously announced $3 billion investment in BlueOval Battery Park Michigan, which will build the prismatic LFP batteries for the midsize electric truck starting next year. Together, the investments total approximately $5 billion, and between the two plants, Ford expects to create or secure nearly 4,000 direct jobs while strengthening the domestic supply chain with dozens of new U.S.-based suppliers.",https://ae-lane-report.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/11145248/Fords-first-all-electric-Explorer.webp,N,,2025-08-11 18:06:36.388614

FPL and 10 supporting groups announced on Friday that they reached an agreement in principle. Today's vote enables the parties to finalize and file the settlement agreement with the Florida Public Service Commission (PSC) by Aug. 20.

The PSC granted the request by FPL and the supporting parties to delay technical hearings that were scheduled to begin today on FPL's original rates petition for 2026-2029.

A word from FPL President and CEO Armando Pimentel: ""Today's decision enables us to finalize a settlement with key stakeholders that will benefit our customers and the state of Florida. We are pleased to have reached an agreement and appreciate the Commission's actions today to ensure a fair and open process for our customers and stakeholders. We are confident that the agreement we reach should enable FPL to continue to make smart investments on behalf of our customers, ensuring we can continue to provide reliable electricity while keeping customer bills low.""

Participants: The agreement in principle is supported by the Florida Retail Federation, Florida Industrial Power Users Group, Florida Energy for Innovation Association, Walmart, the Southern Alliance for Clean Energy, EVgo Services, Fuel Retailers, Electrify America, the Federal Executive Agencies and Armstrong World Industries.

How we got here: With FPL's current four-year rate agreement set to conclude at the end of this year, FPL on Feb. 28 submitted a petition to the PSC to set new rates for 2026 through 2029. That kicked off an extensive public review process in which FPL submitted thousands of pages of witness testimony and documents in support of its proposal. FPL responded to more than 3,000 interrogatories and requests for documents from 13 intervening parties and FPL witnesses participated in more than 30 depositions. The PSC conducted 10 public hearings across the state in May and June in which hundreds of customers weighed in on FPL's proposal.

What's next: Once FPL and the supporting parties submit a finalized rate settlement agreement, the PSC will set a schedule to review the entire case. FPL has proposed that new rates would take effect Jan. 1, 2026.

The model captures global energy flows within traded energy products, enabling an integrated analysis of the interactions between energy, carbon emissions and the environment.","Australia’s net-zero emissions (NZE) pathway faces major challenges such as decarbonisation of agriculture and hard-to-abate sectors (e.g. steel, cement and fertilisers manufacturing, chemicals manufacturing and transport)1. The country is also heavily dependent on fossil fuels; thus, phasing out fossil fuels while maintaining energy reliability and economic stability is a major hurdle. Coal and gas exports also remain major pillars of the economy, but Australia’s exporters face growing pressure to decarbonise due to international climate polices. For example, the European Union (EU) and other regions are implementing policies that tax imports based on their carbon content, indicating that Australian exports with high embedded emissions could face tariffs or lose competitiveness. Major trading partners such as the EU, Japan, South Korea and China are also pursuing net-zero goals and prefer cleaner supply chains, pushing exporters to decarbonise or risk losing market access. In addition, Australia’s large agricultural sector contributes substantially to methane and nitrous oxide emissions. Consequently, reducing emissions without harming productivity or food security is a delicate balance, as well as avoiding conflicting demands on land for food, biodiversity, carbon offsets and bioenergy.

Deployment of carbon dioxide removal (CDR) technologies is thus considered critical in counterbalancing hard-to-abate residual emissions so that Australia and other nations can achieve NZE2,3. Additional industries are expected to emerge and thrive through the advancement of low-emissions technologies, helping to offset emissions from hard-to-abate sectors. Transition to renewable resources in the power sector is another critical factor in reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions4,5,6, as electricity generation makes up over 40% of global energy-related carbon dioxide emissions from burning fossil fuels7. Emissions-free electricity generation would therefore reduce the otherwise substantial burden on CDR technologies, as well as related investment expenses. An early transition to emissions-free electricity generation would also reduce the economic costs for a country in mitigating high levels of GHG emissions8,9. A pathway to a NZE global economy would also require a major contribution by land use, land use change and forestry (LULUCF) activities10,11,12. Some areas may have high potential for decarbonisation from these activities. For instance, LULUCF currently removes around an annual amount of 50–60 Mt CO2e in Australia13, while it removes around 230 Mt CO2e annually in the EU, equivalent to 7% of the annual EU’s GHG emissions14.

Recent work by the International Energy Agency (IEA) provides an authoritative global analysis of technological, energy and investment needs for a 1.5 °C scenario, though it does not identify individual country decarbonisation pathways15. Global analysis is important in highlighting broad targets and objectives that must be achieved to reach an NZE world economy. However, an NZE transition will affect the whole economy, impacting progress towards social, economic and environmental goals, presenting decision-makers with challenges of how to balance multiple objectives. Thus, country-specific analyses are needed to operationalise this transition and to assess the potential trade-offs of different national development strategies.

Here, we develop an integrated modelling framework to examine the implications of the IEA’s modelling work on international climate action at a country scale. Two contrasting scenarios are evaluated. The first is the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) Rapid Decarbonisation (CRD) scenario, which assumes Australia follows a rapid decarbonisation trajectory consistent with the IEA’s NZE global 1.5 °C carbon budget (see Section 1 in the Supplementary Information for detailed assumptions). The second is the CSIRO Stated Policies (CSP) scenario, which reflects current domestic and international policy commitments and is projected to result in a global temperature rise of ~2.6 °C by 2100. In this framework, we apply the global emissions target over years with specific technological improvements, including productivity growth, power shares, negative emissions technologies following the IEA15, LULUCF removals (global values calculated from GLOBIOM-G4M models data16, while Australian values redrived from ref. 17), etc. Countries and industrial sectors will then calculate how much emissions levels can be cut along with changes in production levels, subject to marginal abatement costs induced by substitution possibilities for high-emissions intensive inputs, trade power and supply chain systems. These costs also decline with the development of negative emissions technologies and LULUCF removals. This framework, which could be applied to other countries, is developed for Australia, providing a comprehensive examination of how power sector transformation, negative emissions technologies and LULUCF activities may help a country achieve NZE.

Australia was selected as a case study due to the federal government’s active engagement in net-zero initiatives across the economy, aimed at transforming the nation into a low-carbon and net-zero economy. Key actions include plans to phase out coal-fired power stations18, the large-scale development of renewable energy19 and substantial investments in negative emissions technologies20. Additionally, Australia shares many critical factors for decarbonisation with other countries worldwide. For example, while its power generation sector remains heavily reliant on fossil fuels, Australia possesses vast renewable energy resources, such as wind, solar, hydro and ocean thermal power, similar to regions like Europe, the United States and China. Australia’s LULUCF sector also offers considerable potential, akin to regions such as Southeast Asia and South America, in offsetting emissions from hard-to-abate sectors. Furthermore, Australia is strongly focusing on deploying mature zero- and low-emissions technologies, providing valuable lessons for other nations striving to meet net-zero targets21.

Australia, like many other nations, is increasingly exposed to international regulatory risks, as illustrated by the proposed European Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism22,23. In addition to evolving regulatory frameworks, global markets and consumers are placing greater emphasis on value chain emissions and the decarbonisation of production processes. The capability to deliver goods and services with a reduced carbon footprint is emerging as a critical source of competitive advantage. Furthermore, the gap between current Nationally Determined Contributions and the temperature goals of the Paris Agreement highlights the growing likelihood of more stringent decarbonisation policies and the need for accelerated investment in low-emissions solutions24,25,26. Previous research by the Network for Greening the Financial System and CSIRO9,27 has highlighted the risks of delaying the transition, including the need for faster and more costly decarbonisation efforts, the stranding of assets, heightened sovereign risk and negative impacts on Australia’s long-term competitiveness. Therefore, analysing Australia’s pathway to net zero, along with effective strategies and activities, can serve as a valuable example for other countries navigating similar challenges.

This study highlights several important advances in Australia’s NZE pathway. First, it downscales the IEA global scenarios to the Australian context, providing a more detailed, sector-specific roadmap for decarbonisation. Second, power sector transformation emerges as a key enabler, with the rapid decarbonisation of electricity generation identified as a critical early step in achieving NZE at low cost. Third, LULUCF activities, along with negative emissions technologies, are crucial for reducing abatement costs—especially for a resource-rich country like Australia. Fourth, the development of a sustainable global zero-emissions energy market is vital for worldwide decarbonisation. In this context, Australia has the potential to become a key supplier of zero-emissions energy, particularly green hydrogen, supporting international net-zero efforts.

Achieving near-zero emissions in electricity generation in the short term

Sectoral emissions analysis highlights the electricity sector as Australia’s most important decarbonisation opportunity during the 2020s, positioning it as a cornerstone of the nation’s broader emissions reduction pathway (Fig. 1). Between 2020 and 2035, the sector rapidly transitions from the largest emitter to contributing a relatively small volume of emissions. Annual GHG emissions from the electricity sector are projected to decline by over 50% between 2020 and 2025 (from 175 Mt CO2e to 70 Mt CO2e) compared to a decline to the level of 143 Mt in 2024 under the stated policy scenario, making it the third largest emitter—after transport and agriculture—by 2025. The electricity sector is expected to achieve net-zero GHG emissions by 2035. Given the magnitude of this transformation, its contribution is critical to meeting the 2050 emissions reduction target. Over the past decade, aging coal-fired power stations in Australia have faced rising operational costs and declining reliability, prompting early retirements driven by both economic and environmental considerations. At the same time, falling costs of renewable technologies have spurred substantial growth in renewable energy capacity, with continued expansion anticipated across solar, wind, hydro and battery storage systems28. Economic factors have played a key role in accelerating the adoption of rooftop solar photovoltaic systems, with installations now present in over one in four Australian households.

The modelling results also reflect the expectation that 85% of Australia’s coal-fired generation capacity will close by 2030 (the remaining coal capacity by then generating just 6.7% of total electricity), and the remainder will be closed by 2035. Renewable energy is projected to make up more than 90% of the electricity mix by 2030. To achieve this, almost all additional capacity installed over the next decade would need to come from wind and solar, supported by increased storage capacity (Fig. 2). Total capacity installation is also higher in the CRD scenario, reaching 300 GW in 2050 compared to a capacity of 210 GW in the CSP scenario. Most of the additional capacity in the CRD scenario comes from solar and rooftop PV.

The transition away from fossil fuel-based electricity generation plays a pivotal role in reducing emissions intensity. In 2020, over 70% of electricity in the National Electricity Market was generated from fossil fuels, while wind and solar contributed ~20% (see Fig. 3). This energy mix resulted in an emissions intensity exceeding 600 kg CO₂/MWh. However, by 2030, a major shift occurs: wind and solar are projected to supply around 85% of NEM electricity, while fossil fuels account for only 10%. Rooftop solar PV generation is also expected to quadruple relative to 2020 levels. Consequently, the emissions intensity drops substantially—to below 15% of its 2020 level—reaching ~95 kg CO₂/MWh. With coal-fired power generation phased out by 2035, emissions intensity falls to around 40 kg CO₂/MWh and continues to decline, reaching net-zero by 2050.

Crucial CDR technologies in Australia’s net-zero pathway

While many negative emissions technologies in Australia are still in the early stages of development, they are expected to play a vital role in achieving NZE. In the CRD scenario, modelling adopts a conservative approach to their contribution, aligning with IEA projections. By 2050, total global annual negative emissions are estimated at 7.2 gigatonnes (Gt) of CO₂—comprising 5.8 Gt from direct air capture with carbon storage (DACCS) and 1.4 Gt from bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS)15. That is, the projections for total global negative emissions technologies are based on those of the IEA, while the model allocates them across countries and regions according to relative market shares, costs and renewable energy availability. Australia aims to capture 84 million tonnes (Mt) of CO₂ by 2050, with 66 Mt expected from unspecified technologies including DACCS, and 18 Mt from BECCS (refer to Table 1). Additional measures could involve carbon capture and storage (CCS) to support emissions reduction in challenging sectors such as aluminium, cement and steel. While CCS helps lower emissions in these industries, it is not considered a source of negative emissions.

The global annual negative emissions assumed in this study differ slightly from the IEA’s Net Zero Roadmap, which forecasts that 7.6 GtCO₂ per year will be captured worldwide by 2050, and 95% of that will be permanently stored15 by DACCS and BECCS. Our study finds that BECCS plays a limited role in Australia, primarily due to its higher costs relative to other renewable energy options. Since BECCS serves as a source of power generation, its development also competes with the increasingly cost-effective solar and wind energy sources29. DACCS is gaining attention, and according to IEA analysis, it is expected to contribute to global decarbonisation efforts30. Preliminary research and feasibility studies are currently in progress, alongside the development of business cases. The IEA projects that DACCS costs could decrease to below $100/tCO2, although the technology is anticipated to require substantial time before becoming fully established, with Australian projects still at an early phase31. The balance between permanent and temporary carbon removals depends on the relative costs of different technologies. In countries with abundant land, where temporary removals from LULUCF activities are relatively inexpensive, these methods tend to dominate over permanent removals from technologies like DAC and BECCS. This has been observed in Australia, where marginally productive lands provide ample opportunities for carbon sequestration17. However, Australia is projected to have a peak of land-based emissions removals by 2050 at 128 Mt per year due to land constraints21 (Fig. 4). A portion of this increase stems from enhanced carbon sequestration in vegetation and soils. Activities such as tree planting and changes in agricultural practices are projected to remove ~3 GtCO₂-eq from the atmosphere between 2020 and 2050. However, forest fires could threaten this projected value, especially as climate change increases the extent and likelihood of fires in central Australia32. This, in turn, reduces forested land, negatively impacting carbon removals from LULUCF activities. Since most land-based removals in Australia occur on marginally productive lands, cropland and pastureland remain largely unaffected. As a result, GTEM (Global Trade and Environment Model) projects only a slight reduction in crop and livestock production, along with a modest decline in agricultural emissions (Fig. 1).

In this study, we examine whether Australia has the capacity to develop negative emissions technologies and land-based carbon removals as part of its strategy to achieve NZE. Our model recognises that not all countries will be able to reach net-zero targets through these means alone, as the global allocation of resources for negative emissions technologies and land carbon removals depends on international cost competitiveness. We acknowledge that using land-based offsets to compensate for residual emissions may not deliver climate benefits equivalent to avoiding emissions altogether, as established in the broader literature12,33. Rather, our aim is to highlight that both land offsets and negative emissions technologies are likely to play a critical role in enabling Australia to reach NZE at economically viable costs, even though the climate impacts of emission avoidance and removal are not equivalent and must be carefully considered.

The findings indicate that decarbonising the electricity sector offers the greatest potential for emissions reductions in the near term. Total generation capacity expands substantially, with the proportion of electricity supplied by renewables tripling by 203034. Battery storage capacity is expected to rise more than fivefold, surpassing 11 GW, while pumped hydro storage nearly doubles. The reliance on fossil fuels for electricity drops sharply—from over 70% today to under 10% by 2030—and is nearly eliminated by 2040, aside from limited gas-fired generation for peak demand. This transition in the electricity sector plays a critical role in lowering emissions across various areas, including homes, commercial buildings, resource extraction and processing, aluminium production, and eventually, transportation.

While fossil fuel exports are projected to decline sharply, the overall volume and value of Australia’s mining exports are expected to rise. Coal production is anticipated to drop by 20% by 2030 and by as much as 80% by 2050, with the remaining output primarily consisting of metallurgical coal. These trends are driven by global adoption of NZE strategies, which substantially reduce demand for thermal coal. Oil and gas output may experience a modest increase—approximately 5%—by 2030, but both are forecast to fall by around 50% and 66%, respectively, by 2050. Conversely, production of iron ore is expected to grow by 73% compared to 2019 levels, and other mineral commodities may see an increase exceeding 40%. Rising global demand for solar photovoltaics and battery technologies is also projected to boost demand for critical minerals such as lithium, cobalt and rare earth elements—creating additional growth opportunities for Australia’s mining sector. However, achieving net-zero targets will necessitate the decarbonisation of mining operations, requiring major advancements in technology and substantial capital investment to curb emissions from extraction, processing and transportation. Despite potential economic benefits, the fossil fuel segment of the mining industry faces mounting risks. Firms heavily reliant on fossil fuel revenue and reserves are under increasing pressure due to heightened legal scrutiny, shareholder activism35 and stricter regulatory conditions36. Investors are demanding greater transparency on emissions, net-zero targets, and credible transition strategies37. Recent attempts by major firms, such as Origin38 and BHP39, to divest from fossil fuel assets have often been unsuccessful or resulted in financial losses, highlighting the sector’s evolving challenges.

As Australia advances through the energy transition, sustained collaboration among governments, industry and communities will be essential to ensure that the shift is equitable and inclusive. Companies that continue to operate within the fossil fuel industry are increasingly looking to CCS and hydrogen technologies as strategies to maintain viability in a low-emissions economy. At the same time, Australia’s pathway will be substantially shaped by the decarbonisation policies and trajectories of its international trading partners. Together, these dynamics present notable risks. Existing infrastructure for fossil fuel production, exploration and transport may face early obsolescence or become stranded assets. Moreover, our analysis indicates that alternatives to fossil fuels are unlikely to be deployed quickly or extensively enough to fully compensate for the declining role of conventional energy sources. This slow uptake may result in elevated energy costs for consumers and could severely impact regions whose economies are heavily reliant on fossil fuel industries. Without careful planning, these factors increase the likelihood of a disorderly transition. Addressing these risks will require a coordinated approach that includes recognition from stakeholders across the energy value chain, thoughtful policy and regulatory frameworks, and targeted public investment to catalyse private sector funding in emerging industries and technologies. Delaying the phase-out of fossil fuels will also place added pressure on other sectors to decarbonise more rapidly, making the overall transition to net zero even more complex and demanding.

Although the modelling indicates a relatively orderly transition, there are several factors that could disrupt this trajectory. Companies operating in emissions-intensive sectors may depend heavily on CCS, hydrogen technologies, or offsets to extend their viability in a low-carbon economy. If the phase-out of fossil fuels proceeds more slowly than anticipated, the burden of deeper and faster emissions reductions will shift to other sectors, complicating the already demanding pathway to net zero. This creates a risk that existing high-emissions assets may be retired before sufficient low-emissions alternatives are in place, potentially leading to supply gaps or economic disruptions. To mitigate such risks and support a stable transition, carefully crafted policy and regulatory frameworks, along with targeted investments in emerging technologies and industries, will be essential.

To achieve NZE by 2050, technologies currently in early development must be widely deployed by 2030. By mid-century, approximately one-third of global emissions reductions are expected to rely on innovations still in prototype or demonstration phases today. Among the most critical of these are low- or zero-emissions hydrogen, carbon capture, utilisation and storage, and feedstocks and catalysts—particularly for emissions-intensive sectors like heavy industry and transport. Domestic uptake of green hydrogen is projected to drive substantial production growth, reaching an estimated 200 petajoules by 2050. However, achieving this scale of transformation will require sustained and substantial investment, both in emerging technologies and in supporting infrastructure. Model projections estimate that approximately AU$713 billion will be required between 2022 and 2050 to upgrade electricity infrastructure, primarily through replacing aging fossil fuel generation with renewable energy and storage solutions. This figure does not account for parallel investments needed to develop complementary technologies such as green hydrogen, carbon capture, utilisation and storage, and sustainable biofuels—each of which will require funding across the entire innovation pipeline, from research and development to commercial deployment. To support such a large-scale investment, public policy may need to go beyond direct funding. Removing barriers to private sector participation and enabling innovative financing mechanisms to distribute risk more effectively will be essential to unlocking capital and accelerating the transition.

Australia is well-positioned to capitalise on the rising global demand for zero-emissions fuels. As an early adopter, the nation benefits from expertise in the design, construction and operation of complex infrastructure, as well as in handling and processing volatile liquids and gases. These capabilities offer a competitive edge in establishing emerging export sectors that could eventually supplement and replace traditional fossil fuel exports. The development of a green hydrogen industry presents a strategic opportunity to maximise the use of Australia’s abundant renewable energy resources—by absorbing surplus generation during periods of low demand and low prices. In addition, green hydrogen has the potential to support emissions reductions in hard-to-abate sectors such as aluminium smelting, cement production and steel manufacturing. However, realising this opportunity will require overcoming a range of technical and commercial challenges. These include improving production efficiency, reducing costs, building appropriate infrastructure and creating viable domestic and international markets for green hydrogen and its derivatives.

Currently, producing hydrogen from renewable energy sources remains considerably more expensive than conventional methods such as coal gasification or steam methane reforming. While it is technically feasible to blend small amounts of hydrogen (~10–20%) into existing natural gas networks, higher concentrations would necessitate the replacement of end-use appliances and the development of additional pipeline infrastructure40. Additionally, the process of generating hydrogen—especially when involving energy conversions at both the production and consumption ends—can lead to considerable energy losses. If hydrogen is produced through high-emissions pathways, these losses could actually result in a net increase in GHG emissions. Further obstacles include the limited infrastructure for hydrogen production, storage and distribution, as well as the underdeveloped state of domestic and international markets. Australia’s ability to establish itself as a competitive player in the global hydrogen economy may also be challenged by rapidly advancing policy and investment shifts in other countries, such as the United States’ Inflation Reduction Act41. To maintain a competitive edge and attract international capital and expertise, Australia must act swiftly to overcome these barriers and capitalise on its early-mover potential.

In developing a hydrogen industry, it is essential that policymakers, investors and stakeholders remain focused on the primary goal: supplying low- or zero-emissions energy to meet both domestic and global demand. As the industry takes shape, avoiding the risk of locking in high-emissions pathways will be critical. A comprehensive view of emissions across the entire hydrogen value chain is necessary, including efforts to minimise transport-related emissions—a particularly important consideration given Australia’s geographic remoteness. To overcome existing barriers such as high production costs, limited infrastructure and uncertain demand, continued commercial investment and demonstration projects will be vital. Meanwhile, biofuels are expected to play a key role in decarbonising aviation and could also serve as alternatives to fossil fuels in sectors like heavy transport and industrial chemical production. However, increasing reliance on biofuels may intensify competition for land use, with implications for food production and carbon sequestration through vegetation and soils—both of which are projected to expand in a low-emissions future.

Research indicates that Australia is a global leader in leveraging land-based carbon removals to offset agricultural emissions. Although agriculture is projected to become one of the largest sources of residual emissions—rising from 14% of gross national emissions in 2020 to 39% by 2050—Australia’s vast land area, including degraded and marginal lands, offers a great opportunity for mitigation through afforestation and reforestation. Generating carbon offsets from vegetation and soils could provide farmers with an additional revenue stream, often complementing existing practices, utilising underproductive land and enhancing natural capital.

However, achieving net-zero in the sector faces challenges related to measurement, traceability and carbon accounting. Moreover, while nature-based solutions like avoided deforestation offer considerable mitigation potential, their impact is constrained by temporal saturation (as forests cannot sequester carbon indefinitely), vulnerability to disturbances (such as wildfires and droughts) and land-use competition driven by economic pressures like agricultural expansion42. There are also considerable risks if nations, jurisdictions, or companies rely heavily on offset-based strategies at the expense of pursuing feasible decarbonisation pathways. Such an approach may delay progress toward zero—though not necessarily net-zero—emissions. Current land-based offset technologies, which provide only temporary carbon sequestration, are particularly vulnerable to reversal, as forested areas may be converted to cropland or pasture for agricultural use. Delaying decarbonisation increases the risk of a disorderly and globally fragmented transition, while also raising the future costs and pace of emissions reductions as offsets become scarcer and more expensive. This could heighten the risk of asset impairment or stranding, undermine Australia’s long-term competitiveness, and elevate sovereign risk.

In summary, this study provides important quantitative insights, including yearly emissions breakdown across Australian sectors, particularly electricity, offering a data-driven framework for net-zero planning. Additionally, Australia can scale up NETs and LULUCF to over 200 MtCO₂e by 2040, offsetting emissions from sectors that are difficult to decarbonise. The country also has the potential to become a major exporter of green hydrogen, contributing to emissions reductions both domestically and globally. Key qualitative message implies that early decarbonisation of electricity is both essential and cost-effective in reaching NZE. Negative emissions technologies and land-based removals play a critical role in offsetting residual emissions, enabling Australia to potentially reach NZE even earlier than 2050. With aggressive emissions reductions in the power sector and robust negative emissions strategies, Australia could achieve negative emissions by 2050, helping offset emissions from other regions and contributing to the global net-zero target.

To support a sustainable move toward an NZE economy, Australia needs to facilitate key concrete actions. First, Australia needs to expedite infrastructure implementation by streamlining approvals and regulations (e.g. simplify and fast-track environmental and planning approvals for renewable energy projects, transmission networks and green hydrogen hubs), developing public-private partnerships to co-fund large scale infrastructure such as offshore wind farms, battery storage and electric vehicle charging networks, expanding strategic grid to accelerate transmission upgrades to connect renewable energy zones with major demand centres, and increasing domestic manufacturing support by developing local supply chains for wind turbines, solar panels, batteries and hydrogen electrolysers to reduce reliance on imports and ensure rapid deployment.

Second, Australia needs to attract more international capital and expertise by creating green investment incentives (e.g. introduce tax incentives, low-interest loans and government-backed guarantees to attract international investors in renewable energy, clean hydrogen and carbon capture technologies), creating fast-track foreign direct investment with reductions of bureaucratic hurdles for international firms looking to invest in clean energy projects, leverage skilled migration programs (e.g. expand visas for clean energy engineers, battery scientists, and hydrogen specialists to address skill shortages in the workforce), and establishing a government-backed green investment fund to co-finance major projects, leveraging private capital for rapid scale-up.

Third, transport is also a key sector requiring strong support. Australia can implement stronger fuel efficiency standards to encourage automakers to bring more electric vehicles into the Australian market and offer tax breaks and subsidies for electric vehicle purchases, and expand nationwide charging infrastructure. Australia should also develop public transport electrification by transitioning buses, trains, and ferries to electric and hydrogen-powered alternatives, especially in urban areas, and investing in high-speed rail along the east coast to reduce short-haul domestic flights. Development of green hydrogen for heavy transport is also needed by providing incentives for fleet operators to transition to hydrogen and battery-electric trucks, and supporting hydrogen refuelling stations and mandates for hydrogen-powered trucking, aviation and shipping. Australia should also develop urban planning for low-carbon mobility by expanding cycling lanes, pedestrian zones and public transport networks to reduce reliance on private cars and implementing congestion charges and low-emission zones in major cities.

Fourth, since carbon offsets from land use are abundant and relatively cheap sources to compensate for emissions from hard-to-abate sectors, Australia needs to expand these resources. Schemes might involve scaling up carbon farming by expanding incentives for soil carbon sequestration through regenerative agriculture and rotational grazing, and supporting biochar projects to lock carbon into soils and improve agricultural productivity. Australia can also foster indigenous land management programs by expanding funding for Indigenous-led fire management practices that reduce emissions while preserving ecosystems. In addition, Australia should also strengthen its participation in international carbon markets by exporting high-quality carbon credits from reforestation and soil carbon projects.

Results show that Australia provides valuable insights for other countries pursuing net-zero goals. First, since most nations rely heavily on fossil fuels, an early transition to renewable energy is critical to minimising the costs of achieving a net-zero economy. However, renewable energy may not expand quickly enough to fully replace fossil fuel-based power, potentially leading to energy insecurity. Therefore, it is essential to develop strategies that align the growth of renewable energy with the phased reduction of fossil fuels to meet rising energy demands.

For countries with substantial LULUCF potential, leveraging these activities is vital, as they often provide more cost-effective options for offsetting GHG emissions, lowering carbon prices and abatement costs. Additionally, the deployment of negative emissions technologies is indispensable for compensating for emissions from hard-to-abate sectors. Efforts must also address emissions across the full value chain, including minimising those associated with transport, which is particularly important for geographically isolated nations like Australia. Export-oriented countries should closely monitor and adapt to the decarbonisation policies of their trade partners, as these can considerably impact their economies.

Finally, international collaboration is crucial for sustainable decarbonisation and the maintenance of resilient value chain systems. Support from developed nations—whether through human, financial, or technical assistance—plays a key role in helping developing countries transition to a low-carbon economy.

The developed integrated modelling framework can also be applied to other countries, subject to key conditions such as data availability, policy relevance and structural flexibility. First, an applied country must have environmental and socioeconomic input-output data to serve as inputs for the models. Second, the framework requires comprehensive economic, emissions and climate data for projections and external shocks. Countries with well-established data collection systems, similar to Australia, can more easily implement such an integrated assessment modelling framework. Third, the models are designed for climate and energy policy analysis. In cases where a country lacks strong policy instruments (e.g. carbon pricing or renewable subsidies), alternative policy settings should be incorporated. Finally, the models account for global trade, capital flows and climate interactions. Therefore, countries that are highly dependent on imports or exports must ensure that trade linkages within the model accurately reflect real-world interdependencies.

It is also noted that the current framework does not account for changes in carbon emissions resulting from predicted forest fires. However, these emissions can be incorporated as exogenous shocks in future work when climate models are used to forecast emissions levels based on historical events and climate data. These will provide more comprehensive emissions pathways, particularly for Australia, which often experiences bushfires. Additionally, at this stage, the framework does not have detailed critical minerals resources due to data unavailability. If such data were available, there would be a more detailed analysis of the requirements in the transition. In addition, chronic and physical climate hazards are not included in the model, which may impose higher abatement costs and thus affect sectoral emissions pathways and the Australian NZE target.

This study employs a multi-model framework (Fig. 5) designed to downscale several IEA scenarios to the Australian context. The approach integrates three nested modelling layers—global, national and sectoral—to generate tailored Australian outputs:

CSIRO’s GTEM, a computable general equilibrium (CGE) model, assesses global macroeconomic impacts across scenarios and examines how these global dynamics affect Australia through trade and globalisation. Treatment of key variables in GTEM is provided in Table 2;

KPMG’s Energy and Environment model (KPMG-EE), another CGE model calibrated to Australia’s industry sectors and international trade, translates the global influences into sector-specific impacts within the Australian economy. Treatment of key variables in KPMG-EE is provided in Table 3; and

CSIRO and ClimateWorks’ Australian TIMES (AusTIMES) model focuses on least-cost energy, emissions and technology pathways, providing detailed sectoral insights that complement KPMG-EE’s economic analysis. Treatment of key variables in AusTIMES is provided in Table 4.

GTEM evaluates global transition risks and their effects on Australia via international linkages and trade43. Using KPMG-EE, the study examines how these global shifts translate into economic impacts across Australian sectors, focusing specifically on the economic transition without accounting for the financial consequences of physical climate hazards. Given that both chronic and acute climate-related risks are projected to rise—especially affecting agriculture, construction and carbon removal efforts like afforestation—future work should incorporate these factors more comprehensively.

Finally, AusTIMES explores technology pathways for six high-emission sectors: energy, transport, buildings, steel, aluminium and cement. Calibrated to Australia’s existing sectoral technology base, AusTIMES identifies least-cost decarbonisation strategies consistent with emissions pricing and trading parameters from GTEM, alongside sector growth trajectories derived from KPMG-EE.

CSIRO Global Trade and Environment Model (GTEM)

GTEM combines a top-down macroeconomic CGE approach with detailed bottom-up energy production data and sector-level GHG emissions accounting (see Section 2 in the Supplementary Information for full model framework and structure). The model captures global energy flows within traded energy products, enabling an integrated analysis of the interactions between energy, carbon emissions and the environment. Below is a summary of the model’s main components, with a comprehensive description provided in ref. 44.

In the GTEM model used for this analysis, adjustments to emissions pathways occur through two primary mechanisms. The first involves the pace at which technologies within the available mix can be substituted for one another, reflecting the elasticity of substitution across existing technologies. The second mechanism is the rate of technological innovation driven by price signals. Although GTEM includes a third mechanism—climate feedback effects from emissions pathways—this feature is not activated in the current analysis and is therefore not discussed here. The model’s responses to emissions pathways are grounded in empirical data and can be adjusted or constrained as needed to align with outputs from other models, such as those from the IEA, or to incorporate updated information and anticipated future responses.

KPMG-EE energy and environment model of the Australian economy

Similar to GTEM, the KPMG-EE model integrates a top-down macroeconomic CGE framework with detailed bottom-up engineering data on energy production. In this study, KPMG-EE is employed to translate the global changes identified by GTEM into specific sectoral growth projections for the Australian economy. Unlike GTEM, KPMG-EE does not directly model GHG emissions by sector within Australia. To address this, the AusTIMES model (described below) is utilised to help calibrate GTEM’s sector-level emissions and emissions intensity trajectories for key Australian industries. The foundational data, theoretical basis and parameters of KPMG-EE are derived from the model described in ref. 45. Below, we offer an overview of KPMG-EE, focusing specifically on elements not covered in ref. 45.

KPMG-EE represents the economy through a system of simultaneous equations that capture the interactions of interdependent economic agents functioning within competitive markets. The model is grounded in economic theory, detailing the behaviour and market dynamics of consumers, producers, investors and governments. These agents engage across domestic and international goods markets, as well as capital and labour markets, reflecting the relationships illustrated in (Fig. 6). Key characteristics of KPMG-EE’s theoretical framework include:

Households and businesses optimise their behaviour within competitive markets, subject to explicit resource and budget constraints (further details on agent behaviour are provided in Section 3, Supplementary Information).

Prices adjust to clear both goods and primary factor markets.

Marginal costs equal marginal revenues across all economic activities.

High-emission sectors’ emission paths using AusTIMES

The Integrated MARKAL-EFOM System (TIMES) was developed collaboratively through the IEA’s Energy Technology Systems Analysis Project (see Section 4, Supplementary Information for detailed structure and key features). As a contracting member of ETSAP, CSIRO has created an Australian adaptation of the TIMES model, known as AusTIMES, in partnership with ClimateWorks Australia, a key collaborator on this project.

The TIMES energy system modelling framework has been widely adopted in more than 20 countries and serves as the successor to the MARKAL model. It optimises the delivery of energy services by minimising total system costs while adhering to physical, technological and policy constraints. The model simultaneously determines technology investments, primary energy supply and energy trade. Comprehensive documentation for the TIMES model generator can be found on the ETSAP website (https://iea-etsap.org/index.php/documentation).

The TIMES model generator operates as a partial equilibrium model focused specifically on the energy sector. Partial equilibrium models in this context—often called ‘bottom-up’ models—were originally developed during the 1970s and 1980s to analyse energy systems in detail45,46,47. Partial equilibrium models are favoured in energy and environmental policy analysis because they allow for a detailed representation of technologies. The same end-use service—such as space heating or lighting—or fuel type—like electricity or transport fuels—can be supplied by multiple technologies. These technologies often rely on different primary energy sources and have varying emission levels, even if their costs are comparable48.

Partial equilibrium modelling incorporates a range of technologies linked to each supply option and calculates market equilibrium without predetermined assumptions about which technologies or quantities will be adopted—some technologies may not be chosen at all. This approach offers analytical flexibility by allowing detailed representation of demand patterns, supply technologies and additional constraints, such as resource limits, industry scale-up, saturation effects and policy restrictions, to reflect their influence on market dynamics.

A key benefit of a system-level modelling approach, as opposed to focusing on individual fuels, technologies, or processes, is the explicit inclusion of infrastructure constraints. These include the lifespan of existing asset stocks (e.g. plants, buildings, vehicles, appliances) and consumer adoption patterns for emission reduction options that may involve non-financial decision factors. This system perspective also enables capturing the combined effects of multiple abatement options when deployed together, rather than in isolation.

Compared to economy-wide CGE models, partial equilibrium models focus on a narrower subset of economic sectors, treating service demands, prices and elasticities in the rest of the economy as external inputs. However, they provide more detailed representations of investments in specific types of physical capital—such as industrial capacity, buildings, or transport fleets—which CGE models generally represent with less granularity.

Key scenario assumptions and inputs

We have created a comprehensive integrated framework to evaluate how the IEA’s global climate action scenarios are reflected at the national scale. This study examines two distinct scenarios: (i) the CSP scenario, which incorporates current stated policies internationally and within Australia, and (ii) the CRD scenario, representing a swift pathway toward NZE worldwide and domestically. The tables below present the critical assumptions used within the GTEM, KPMG-EE and AusTIMES models for each scenario. A key focus in establishing these assumptions was to maintain coherence and consistency across all three modelling approaches whenever feasible.",https://media.springernature.com/m685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs43247-025-02615-4/MediaObjects/43247_2025_2615_Fig1_HTML.png,N,,2025-08-11 19:00:51.331017

The recently passed One Big Beautiful Bill Act represents a significant shift in U.S. energy and tax policy.

It dramatically cuts many clean energy tax incentives introduced under the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022.

Individuals and businesses must act quickly to take advantage of valuable federal tax credits that are now being phased out or scaled back years ahead of schedule.

This article outlines the key clean energy tax incentives affected by the OBBBA and what you can do to benefit before they disappear.

Clean Vehicle Tax Credits (Individuals)

Ends Sept. 30, 2025.

New Clean Vehicle Credit (Up to $7,500): This federal credit for new electric and hydrogen fuel cell vehicles was originally scheduled to run through 2032. The OBBBA now ends it on Sept. 30, 2025.

The full $7,500 credit requires vehicles to meet specific battery and mineral sourcing standards. A partial credit of $3,750 may still apply to vehicles that meet only one of those criteria.

Eligibility limits:

MSRP: $55,000 for sedans; $80,000 for SUVs, trucks, and vans

Adjusted gross income: $150,000 (single), $225,000 (head of household), $300,000 (married filing jointly)

Used Clean Vehicle Credit (Up to $4,000): A separate credit remains available for used electric or hydrogen vehicles purchased from licensed dealers. It provides up to $4,000 or 30% of the vehicle’s sale price, whichever is lower.

Requirements:

Vehicle price cap: $25,000

Vehicle must be at least two years old and not previously claimed for this credit

AGI: $75,000 (single), $112,500 (head of household), $150,000 (married filing jointly)

With the expiration approaching, consumer demand is expected to rise sharply, potentially driving up prices and limiting availability. Acting now ensures both access to vehicles and eligibility for the credit.

Home Energy Tax Credits (Individuals)

Energy Efficient Home Improvement Credit: Expires Dec. 31, 2025. This nonrefundable credit covers 30% of the cost of various home energy upgrades, up to $1,200 annually, with item-specific sub-limits.

Annual limits include:

$250 per exterior door (maximum $500 total)

$600 for windows, electrical panels, and central air conditioning

$150 for home energy audits

$2,000 for heat pumps, biomass stoves, and energy-efficient water heaters

There are no income limits, and homeowners may benefit by spreading improvements across two tax years to maximize credits.

Residential Clean Energy Credit (30%): Expires Dec. 31, 2025. This credit allows individuals to claim 30% of the cost for eligible renewable energy systems, including:

Solar panels

Geothermal heat pumps

Solar water heaters

Wind turbines

Biomass fuel systems

Previously scheduled to last until 2034, this credit now ends in 2025. There is no income cap or dollar limit, making it one of the most valuable incentives for homeowners installing rooftop solar or geothermal systems.

Planning consideration: These installations often require permitting, inspections, and utility approvals. Initiating projects early in 2025 is critical to ensure eligibility.

Alternative Fuel Refueling Property Credit (Individuals and Businesses)

Expires June 30, 2026. This credit provides 30% of the cost (up to $1,000 per item) for installing clean fuel infrastructure, such as:

EV charging stations (Level 1 or 2)

Hydrogen fuel cell dispensers

On-site fuel storage systems

Important note: To qualify, equipment must be professionally installed and meet certification standards. Early planning is advised to avoid shortages and installation delays.

Business-Specific Clean Energy Credits

Commercial Clean Vehicle Credit (Up to $40,000 per vehicle): Ends Sept. 30, 2025. Businesses can claim:

Up to $7,500 for light-duty clean vehicles

Up to $40,000 for medium- or heavy-duty electric or hydrogen fuel cell vehicles

Action required: Due to production lead times and vehicle backlogs, businesses considering fleet upgrades must act now to secure orders and take delivery before the deadline.

Investment Tax Credit

Full 30% credit ends Dec. 31, 2025. The ITC allows businesses to claim a percentage of the cost for qualifying energy systems, including solar, storage, geothermal, fuel cells, and wind.

Under OBBBA:

30% credit ends after 2025

Reduced base credit (6%) begins in 2026

Phased out entirely by 2028

Bonus credits (for domestic content, energy communities, etc.) are eliminated

Production Tax Credit: Projects must begin construction by Dec. 31, 2025.

The PTC offers a per-kilowatt-hour tax credit for clean electricity generation. Eligible technologies include:

Wind

Geothermal

Biomass

Hydropower

Under OBBBA, new projects beginning construction after 2025 will no longer be eligible. Existing rules still allow a four-year window for completion if started by the end of 2025.

Section 179D Commercial Building Deduction: Reduced starting Jan. 1, 2026 and phased out after 2027.

This deduction allows up to $5.00 per square foot for energy-efficient commercial building improvements. Starting in 2026, the maximum deduction will be reduced to $1.80 per square foot, and it will sunset fully after 2027.

This incentive is especially relevant to:

Real estate developers

Design-build contractors

Architectural and engineering firms working on government or nonprofit buildings

Direct Pay and Transferability Provisions

Direct pay ends after 2025 and transferability ends: After 2026. The IRA introduced two mechanisms to increase accessibility:

Direct pay: Allows tax-exempt entities to receive credit refunds in cash

Transferability: Allows for-profit entities to sell unused tax credits

These options are being eliminated, dramatically limiting flexibility for both public sector entities and private companies.

What You Should Do Now

For individuals:

Secure an eligible EV purchase before Q4 2025

Schedule home energy upgrades and renewable installations early

Maintain documentation for purchases and installations

Consult a tax advisor to optimize credit claims across tax years

For businesses:

Accelerate clean energy projects and fleet conversions

Document project start dates for ITC/PTC eligibility

Engage tax and legal professionals to utilize transferability and direct pay before they expire

Coordinate with vendors early to avoid capacity or supply issues

Charting an interwoven future The future for energy and emerging technologies is as interwoven—and at times as fraught—as the U.S.-China relationship.","The fates of breakthrough technologies and the energy to power them are deeply interwoven, with progress at scale in one difficult to advance without the other. Nowhere is this interconnection more consequential—and more dynamic—than in the U.S.-China relationship, which is marked by intense political tensions and competition, but also by under-appreciated technical overlap. Given the inescapably interconnected nature of digital and energy systems, and of U.S. and Chinese progress there-within, current and future U.S. administrations will need to consider both together, making conscious decisions about how technology investments may drive new frontiers in energy production, and how new energy innovations will be essential to progress in applied and cross-cutting technology priority areas like artificial intelligence (AI).

The race to develop, control, and power AI offers a particularly clear lens through which to observe these intertwined dynamics, as technological developments fuel competition, and where that competition shapes each country’s energy choices. The policy moves Washington and Beijing make in prioritizing demand drivers like AI and in turn confronting the energy demand challenges AI creates; dealing with the security consequences of smarter grids; and investing in global market expanders like standardization all have strategic consequences for both countries’ competitiveness in energy and technology.

While the United States will face a range of choices when addressing the dual imperatives of maintaining energy security and driving technological innovation, most important to success will be recognizing the extent to which one depends on the other. This dynamic is emblematic in AI, as this paper will explore, with similar dynamics likely to play out across technological innovations, and for energy security, on which so many sectors rely. Putting into place a clear strategy—one that recognizes this interplay and harnesses the multipliers of private sector investment—will confer not just strategic advantage but could also offer platforms for multilateral and even bilateral cooperation, on the basis of mutual interest, as shared concerns about AI animate policy discussions in both capitals.

The AI demand driver

AI systems in their present form are notorious energy consumers, a demand burden potentially borne by the U.S. and Chinese grids that may strain long-standing projections of energy demand. While AI by no means accounts for the bulk of growing energy demand globally, its significant needs, rapid emergence, and mass diffusion provide a window into a new and importantly disruptive dynamic to clean energy plans around the globe.

Straining demand. Prior to the development of AI systems at scale, a relatively stable dynamic existed between the increasing need for energy-intensive data centers and the efficiency of the machines within those data centers. As a result, in the decade before modern AI systems came of age (roughly 2005-2016), the energy being consumed by U.S. data centers was relatively flat, as efficiency counterbalanced the growing number of data centers. However, as the world’s most data-intensive and data-center-operating firms like Amazon, Alphabet’s Google, and Meta’s Facebook began to seize the business benefits of advanced machine learning—the underlying science that would drive “generative” tools like ChatGPT in recent years—the necessary shift to particularly energy-intensive hardware led energy consumption to more than double in the five years that followed (2017-2023).

The demand spikes caused by AI take many forms. Training advanced AI systems creates needs among single, large power consumers that may rapidly outstrip any ability to serve them, let alone with the clean energy they increasingly seek. While estimates vary wildly, parsing available research and companies’ own statements suggests that training (which is to say building for consumer use) the current, cutting-edge models available today is estimated to have expended tens of megawatts per model. The “scaling laws”1 that many AI companies are using to project future demand and acquire energy capacity suggest a multi-gigawatt annual need in just a few years to develop and sustain next-generation systems. This energy need would translate into one widely used “frontier” AI model’s training, consuming perhaps as much electricity as 5 million U.S. households in a year. Increases in the efficiency of the chips used to train most AI systems, as well as in how those processors are used, could prevent a worst-case scenario of runaway consumption—but with longer “training runs” becoming the norm, those gains may have difficulty offsetting the growth in the computational intensity/duration of a training process itself.

Yet a less appreciated but also significant demand driver will be the cost of actually utilizing AI systems to perform functions, so-called “inference” (literally querying an AI model, whether for an answer to a text-based question, to seek the generation of an image, etc.). What many would think of as a “standard” search engine inquiry, made instead with a large language model (LLM), is widely estimated to require 10 times the electricity to deliver a similar result—though, without providing details or baselines, some in the industry have claimed simple queries demand far less. Yet models are capable of much more than just text generation, with other capabilities such as image or video generation demanding more inference per input, and in turn, increasing the energy used to generate an output. Precise estimates of inference cost depend not just on the query’s type and complexity but on the number of “parameters” an underlying model (ChatGPT or Meta’s Llama) has. Though the landscape changes daily, as of this writing, capable AI models range from just under 10 billion for the smallest, to tens to hundreds of billions for so-called “multimodal” models capable of handling and outputting images in addition to text, to (an estimated) more than 1 trillion for the largest such models. Energy usage does not perfectly track the increase in parameters, but it does provide directional indications, with additional fluctuations based on factors like whether computation needs to be spread across multiple processors within data centers. Increasingly, incurring that energy cost may also be inescapable for consumers, as companies embed LLM-driven results into even basic web searches. As a result, which models become “default” for queries at a global scale (e.g., when an iPhone user does a web search in their phone’s browser) or even formally standardized (as discussed below), can matter immensely for aggregate AI energy consumption.

Enduring strategic focus. A pivotal question is whether AI will remain of strategic significance, particularly in the U.S.-China relationship, in the decade-long timescale on which many energy decisions are made. Based on current evidence, it is unlikely that the race to develop better, more capable AI systems will be diminished in the second Trump administration. Despite some critics’ expectations of another “AI winter” or that these technologies will fail to deliver national-level economic impact, the second Trump administration’s personnel and policy choices give little indication that it anticipates a cooling of the issue in the context of foreign policy. President Donald Trump’s appointment of several technology figures—some with significant experience working on AI in the first Trump administration—on the day-one White House team, combined with the creation of an elevated White House AI (and crypto) czar within the organizational hierarchy, suggests AI’s continuity as a high-tier policy concern. In the administration’s opening weeks, it released an executive order stating “we can solidify our position as the global leader in AI,” which sought to review (but not wholesale stop the work of) President Joe Biden’s main AI order. Days later, it devoted Vice President JD Vance’s first international speech entirely to the topic of AI. Much was made of that speech’s calls to reconsider the prior administration’s safety-focused approach to AI. Yet beyond the headlines, notable continuity prevailed. On the characterization of the challenge, Vance pointed to how “hostile foreign adversaries have weaponized AI,” just as Biden focused on “use of AI systems by adversaries and other foreign actors.” And both drew attention to energy as a key vector of that AI competition, with last-minute moves by the Biden administration to try to accelerate the growth of energy infrastructure for U.S. AI firms echoing Vance’s claims that “we stand now at the frontier of an AI industry that is hungry for reliable power.” Vance continued, “AI cannot take off unless the world builds the energy infrastructure to support it,” and he even opined that “it will help us create and store new modes of power in the future.” In the geopolitical competition for AI, energy is envisaged, across administrations, as critical.

In China, President Xi Jinping has consistently cited various constructions of how “China attaches great importance to the development of AI” and must “aim at the commanding heights of future science and technology and industrial innovation,” focusing in particular on “artificial intelligence” and “new energy.” While the tie between energy and AI development has not yet been stressed as explicitly in Beijing’s rhetoric as in Washington’s, the relationship between the two was cited in Xi’s calls for a “major strategic deployment for building a new power system” and the “empowerment of new technologies.” Beijing’s AI push, for its part, has continued despite China’s significant headwinds for the technology sector: namely, crackdowns on the technology sector in recent years. Leading AI capabilities continue to emerge from researchers, startups, and established firms alike. (Though as in the United States, a healthy—if distinct—debate may be taking place in China’s elite political circles about the socioeconomic puts and takes of accelerating AI’s development.) While many have covered the progress Chinese companies have had on AI development, including DeepSeek’s surprise release of a model rivaling some leading American competitors, a counterintuitive metric of the significance China is placing on its AI progress may be the lengths to which Beijing is going to bring it to heel. New requirements for registration and rigorous testing to ensure query responses dutifully comply with political diktats—with AI developers privately lamenting the performance consequences—suggest significant expectations for AI’s permeation into the economy and broad consumer use. On the other side of the spectrum, that AI represented one of the rare new areas of diplomatic exchange, ultimately yielding reciprocal leader-level statements about the inadvisability of using AI systems in nuclear command and control, speaks at a minimum to the ongoing military anxieties about the technology. The ever-greater push for more AI capability is driven by market demand but stoked by geopolitics; in competition with the United States, quenching AI’s need for energy will be a measure of Beijing’s internal success not just in economic competition, but in the geopolitical advantage AI confers—and that China so actively seeks.

Upstream alternatives

Shopping abroad. With the trajectory of AI development and utilization unlikely to subside on either side of the Pacific, questions arise over alternatives to the U.S. and Chinese grids fully shouldering AI’s energy burden. To that end, countries like the United Arab Emirates are working to lure U.S. (and presumably Chinese) AI companies to do their energy-intensive training far from home. These investments are worthy of attention; with capital that can dwarf U.S. venture and private equity offerings, and the appeal of broader packages to support companies’ competitive edge, they are likely to become bludgeons in domestic negotiations. That said, the practical and regulatory challenges to significant offshoring of model training make this an outside prospect, at scale and in the near-term. A growing thicket of domestic data sovereignty rules and active litigation over copyright violations may well complicate frontier model companies’ willingness to train such expensive models overseas. Even deals like Saudi Arabia-based (and sovereign-backed) Humain’s large purchase of cutting-edge Nvidia chips for AI training are more likely to be deployed for domestic model development and inference than a replacement for significant U.S. frontier model training.2 Rather, to power the most substantial data center use, both U.S. and Chinese AI companies may have to (or will be compelled to) make do with the grids they have, and lean as they are on government leadership for more supply and prioritization. It is here that divergent approaches in the United States and China could become particularly interesting.

More with less? Not yet three years into the era of “armchair AI” (general-purpose systems, available to most anyone), both countries are still in the early days of this technology’s evolution. In the United States, the lavish funds being invested in new AI companies and the cash-flush tech incumbents showering funds on training AI models on the data they already possess mean this is a subsector unaccustomed to deprivation. The question is one of market trajectory: will revenues from the use of these models, combined with investors’ appetite to invest in their potential, be a motivator for greater efficiency—or such an accelerant to business competition that energy efficiency becomes a secondary priority to overall model performance?

To be clear, academic computer science research has long prized more computationally efficient ways of delivering AI models, and the companies themselves have a clear profit motive to bring down training costs. A central question for the field—and indeed, for the future of clean energy globally—is whether new computational techniques can permanently arrest the exponential energy costs that are a present corollary to the “scaling laws.” The early state and important breakthroughs in this research suggest there may be; beyond existing market drivers, government incentives to focus minds on this set of areas could provide outsized returns, when the broader clean energy picture is taken into account. (It could also, if improperly managed, simply create greater demand, as costs of AI inference plummet even more quickly than in years past.)

But this is an area where such a breakthrough would be unlikely to stay a state secret for long; behind the rhetoric of U.S.-China decoupling, the reality is a much more nuanced story of frequent mutualism between international technical AI researchers, coupled with a culture of open publication as a significant norm and means of validation in the field. While state investments in dramatically more efficient AI training may solve energy challenges, they may end up being a point of parallel progress or even cooperation, rather than conferring strategic advantage to one side or the other.

Sparking fission? Tech giants’ recent moves to acquire dedicated nuclear fission plants to service their demand may be a tipping point in the fast-changing global debate over nuclear energy. Indeed, in a moment of U.S. political transition and deep fissures over climate investments, nuclear fission offers an area of potential political détente: not “so green” to turn off the political right, yet not carbon-intensive enough to court the most vociferous opposition from the left. Whether AI firms are effectively triangulating this area of potential overlap; piling onto evolving views on the technology given the political climate and reliable, baseload energy imperatives; or simply short on alternatives to meet their demand needs, the result is the same: nuclear fission may be the stopgap measure investors and AI leaders need to have confidence they can continue building ever-more-energy-intensive models—despite the unattractive regulatory timelines and lack of popular consensus on fission’s deployment. In this respect, the federal lawsuit challenging the Nuclear Regulatory Commission’s oversight of modern small modular reactors will be one to watch for this sector and those planning to rely on small modular reactors to meet growing energy use projections.

A related dynamic is playing out in China, with government planners engaged in a similarly delicate dance around untested public opinion linking data centers to nuclear power expansion. To look at one example, China’s “Eastern Data, Western Computing” (东数西算) initiative to build data centers to power its growing compute needs is colliding with set policy goals to power them with 80% clean energy by 2025. Notably absent from the explanations of “how” is any inclusion of nuclear power. This is a material and telling omission, suggesting either that in the context of data centers, Chinese planners do not yet see the public as primed to accept data centers as a reason for major nuclear energy expansion (despite that such a nuclear expansion is long underway, for other reasons), that grid-scale battery storage will make major breakthroughs in only a few years, or both. In both cases, utilization of nuclear fission may indeed be meaningfully driven by private AI and data-intensive firms’ rapid need for it—and commercial interest in normalizing it nationwide—paving the way for a warmer welcome into policymakers’ desired clean energy mix than publics may have to the technology.

Betting on fusion? AI demand needs are also accelerating—and partially financing—the United States’ strategic investments in as-yet-undeployed long-term clean alternatives, namely fusion energy. While the list of investors in the technology includes a range of institutional finance, venture capital, and strategic industrial players, current and former founders/CEOs of the largest AI and tech giants have played significant financial and organizational roles in the firms. For perspective, a single investment from just one of those “big tech” players dwarfs (over seven-fold) total federal funding to private fusion under its signature “Milestone-based” Fusion Development Program designed to help commercialize the technology.3 In the summer of 2025, Google alone announced two separate investments in, and aspirational agreements to purchase power from, U.S. fusion firms. Time and again in recent months, these commercial fusion bets by tech firms seem underwritten by AI’s power needs and, in turn, national AI competitiveness. Bipartisan U.S. enthusiasm for fusion was clear, if tentative, given the lack of demonstration power plants under both the first Trump and Biden administrations. Beijing, for its part, has redoubled its state investments in fusion, a move not lost on U.S. fusion officials. Jean Paul Allain, the head of the Department of Energy’s fusion science program, said in a recent interview that more than just the estimated $1 billion to $1.5 billion Beijing is pumping into its domestic fusion program annually, “To me, what’s more important than the number, it’s actually how fast they’re doing this.” Here, the AI race is in part driving, and shaping, the next chapter of the clean energy race. And some lead commercial fusion firms, for their part, are pinning some of their near-term hopes on the demand jolts the sector is publicly confronting.

Downstream drivers

To what extent will the United States or China seize other advantages at the intersection of clean energy and emerging technology to improve their competitive advantage—or even use them to build new areas of cooperation—has yet to be seen. But in at least two areas, grid cybersecurity and standardization, the imperatives of the moment may be important contributors to the overall tenor of U.S.-China relations even more than their direct effects on energy policy.

A better, brittle grid. One inheritance of the significant increases in energy demand, driven in part by AI, will be prompting necessary upgrades to public grids that are not up to the task of supporting new clean energy onboarding, let alone significant demand spikes. From smarter metering to grid-enhancing technologies, the digitization of electric grids supported by immense public spending (such as the U.S. Inflation Reduction Act) poses opportunities for efficiency but also carries a notable risk: introducing new brittleness to the grid via cybersecurity vulnerabilities, allowing remote sabotage on a scale once only feared. This concern has been known for decades and rehearsed in other regions by other U.S. adversaries, but it has returned to the fore with the recent string of discoveries of “kill switch” capabilities implanted in U.S. critical infrastructure and attributed to China—actions the director of the U.S. National Security Agency called “unique and different.” Beijing has, in typical fashion, denied responsibility for these hacks, but U.S. attribution has yet to draw a serious challenge. Increased upgrades to the grid, driven by clean energy investments and growing demand, yield greater cyber vulnerability. As both nations modernize their grids, each will introduce more digital elements that can be commandeered, disabled, or maliciously activated—a growing, mutual vulnerability. Cognizable “attacks” or episodes of sabotage could range from selective blackouts of critical facilities, straining areas where grids are already overtaxed, and potentially large-scale cascading failures in regional grids. Scenarios like these were seemingly contemplated when the Biden administration moved to ban Chinese software in U.S. vehicles, given that the vehicles themselves serve as significant nodes on the grid—which, if manipulated at once, could cause such blackouts.

This dynamic—and the potential for deep mistrust—is likely to expand in the bilateral relationship in the years to come. It is too soon to say whether there is potential to reduce the level of tension on this matter, despite China’s once-expressed interest in bilateral commitments. The United States could substantially upgrade—and sharpen—its push for certain cyber norms of behavior, extending the focus beyond commercial secret theft. That effort was unusual in producing a measurable, if temporary, change in Beijing’s willingness to pilfer certain U.S. digital systems at their prior scale.4 Thus far, such pursuits at true restraint have been assumed by both sides to be half-hearted, insincere, or both, raising the question of just what level of risk will be necessary to bring both sides to a serious negotiating table. With the stakes arguably far higher than they were in the mid-2010s, the time is ripe to explore the avenues to escape this destabilizing dynamic.

The standards dividend. A final dynamic worth noting is competition over technological standardization—deeply competitive in the context of telecommunications (most notably 5G and internet standards)—and potentially market- and relationship-shaping in emerging technology and clean energy spaces as well. The day-to-day of standards development is often grinding and jargon-filled, as engineers, scientists, and increasingly, national officials seek agreement on the architectural lattices of new technologies. In what was once thought of in the United States as an industry-led and largely hands-off approach to avoid picking winners and losers, a focus on national leadership in standards accompanied the Biden administration’s greater intentionality of industrial policy. Not to be outdone, Chinese officials have echoed these sentiments in an explicit three-year national action plan—crystallizing a strategy long alleged by U.S. officials but largely left unspoken in official Chinese documents in the decades prior. The Chinese strategy aims to focus work on securing a range of technological standards for the Chinese technological ecosystem, with a prime focus on AI (among other emerging technologies, including quantum computing and brain-computer interfaces). In this respect, both countries have now explicitly recognized that in AI, as with many technologies before it, holding standards confers a significant dividend to the broader innovation ecosystem within a sector—telecom, AI, or otherwise.

Despite those outsized returns, substantial questions remain about states’ ability and interest in following through on these grand ambitions of continued standards involvement. In some areas of clean energy, early competition is already underway. On emerging technologies like fusion energy, Chinese companies have been hard at work at the International Standards Organization to standardize a version of the technology in which they have invested most significantly. But clean energy technologies are neither cell phones nor web protocols; jurisdictions vary, and securing standardization at official standards development organizations (SDOs) can take a back seat to substantial market players like Tesla getting large-scale traction with proprietary standards. The Tesla charging standard, now rebranded to the North American Charging Standard, or NACS, to encourage adoption, is one such example—largely bypassing SDOs and adding new complexity to a model in which states exert official or unofficial pressure at established SDOs. And although under the first Trump administration, focus on 5G, secure telecommunications, and other standards-relevant areas sidestepped broader curbs on international engagement, it remains to be seen whether declining budgets and headcount, combined with institutional reorganizations, will hamstring this intensive diplomatic task. For clean energy, the level of state involvement in other standards processes, such as those over renewables failure modes and analytics, energy management systems, and components of energy storage systems, may offer early clues.

Charting an interwoven future

The future for energy and emerging technologies is as interwoven—and at times as fraught—as the U.S.-China relationship. These relationships are hardly zero-sum, but deserve to be considered in concert with one another, and most importantly, as part of a coherent strategy for the United States that intends to put China and energy security atop its agenda. Smart investments in commercializable energy breakthroughs, market-complementary incentives to drive more efficient AI models and inference, and diplomatic engagement to ensure the most promising technologies achieve standardization all drive at the same strategic imperatives. While other factors will shape this emerging dynamic—from Taiwan’s role in semiconductor manufacturing to critical mineral resources in Southeast Asia—this moment represents an opportunity to consider the broader picture and accelerate both technological and energy needs in concert.",https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/2025-07-25T000000Z_1343002482_MT1NURPHO000BVGYI0_RTRMADP_3_SCIENCE-TECHNOLOGY-CHINA.jpg?quality=75,N,,2025-08-11 16:03:34.709281

Please let us know if you have feedback.

Dive Brief:

A federal judge denied BlackRock, Vanguard and State Street’s motion to dismiss an antitrust lawsuit, brought by Texas and nine other states, that alleges the nation’s three largest asset managers collectively conspired to constrict coal production through their public holdings and engagements, according to court documents.

U.S. District Court Judge Jeremy Kernodle, for the U.S. Eastern Texas District Court, denied the asset managers’ bids to toss the case and said in an Aug. 1 opinion and order, that “at this stage in the proceeding, the court must assume that Plaintiffs’ allegations are true.”

The asset managers had a high burden of proof to meet in order to have the case dismissed, Victor Flatt, Case Western Reserve University’s environmental law chair, told ESG Dive Thursday. “Simply because the court is allowing the case to go forward does not mean that there will ultimately be a finding of anti-competitive behavior.”

Dive Insight:

The lawsuit was filed in December by Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton and nine other Republican-led states, alleging BlackRock, Vanguard and State Street had “formed a cartel to rig the coal market” and conspired “to artificially constrict” the coal market. BlackRock and State Street called the initial filing “baseless” in separate statements to ESG Dive at the time, and all three of the asset managers initially filed the motion to dismiss the lawsuit in March. BlackRock also filed a separate motion to dismiss state claims of deceptive marketing levied against the institution.

Kenodle rejected the bulk of those motions, but dismissed three state-level consumer protection suits against BlackRock, two from Louisiana and one from Nebraska.

The case at this point relies heavily on the attorneys general’s accusations that the three asset managers — as part of their commitments under climate alliances like the Net Zero Asset Managers initiative and Climate Action 100+ — sought to decrease coal production and used their public holdings to do so.

“Taken as true, these allegations plausibly state that Defendants’ acquisition and use of stocks, by proxy voting or otherwise, is reasonably likely to have the effect of substantially lessening competition by decreasing output of coal and creating supracompetitive prices,” Kernodle said.

“It is plausible that Defendants did what they publicly said they were going to do: use their stock to decrease the output of coal,” he added. “Plaintiffs may ultimately be unable to prove this claim.”

As far as the allegations of a conspiracy to artificially deflate coal production, Kernodle said the states “lack direct evidence of a conspiracy.”

“Plaintiffs do, however, plausibly allege the existence of a conspiracy among Defendants based on circumstantial evidence,” the judge wrote. “This is a close call.”

Kernodle said that while the asset managers’ choices to join NZAM and CA100+ “announces a commitment to the public, it is not necessarily a commitment by Defendants to each other — at least as alleged in the amended complaint.”

Following the ruling, Paxton again accused the asset managers of forming “an investment cartel to illegally control national energy markets” and said in an Aug. 1 press release that the court win “represents a major step in holding them accountable.”

Prior to the ruling, the Federal Trade Commission and Department of Justice issued a joint statement in support of the states’ arguments. The government’s official stance is that — while antitrust laws allow for passive investing, corporate governance-focused shareholder advocacy and active investing “that doesn’t harm competition” — BlackRock, Vanguard and State Street went beyond those bounds in this case.

“In failing to grant the case dismissal, the court gives plausibility to certain theories that the very concept of net-zero policies may implicate anti-competitive behavior rather than it being a response to the financial risks for companies that are large [greenhouse gas] producers in a climate changing world,” Flatt said in emailed comments. “That certainly has to give pause to companies seeking to work together to reduce GHGs in specific industries.”

In separate statements to ESG Dive last week, the asset managers said they remain resolute in fighting the charges.

Vanguard said in an emailed statement that it was “disappointed in the court’s decision,” but “looks forward to the opportunity to vigorously defend against plaintiffs’ claims and will continue to give investors the best chance for investment success.

State Street told ESG Dive that it still believes the lawsuit to be “baseless and without merit” and said it “poses unnecessary risk to investors and energy markets.”

“There is no collusion here, and we remain confident that the facts and legal substance are on our side,” State Street said in an emailed statement.

BlackRock said it is pleased to have some of the state-level claims dismissed, but said that the states’ goal of forcing the companies to divest their coal holdings risks “undermining the Trump administration’s goal of American energy independence.”",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/DvP8VPp2DwfVTP-ChHqkhld-RWDlp5a80C7-QiLAxjM/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9HZXR0eUltYWdlcy05Mjk3NzQyMjBfckQyOHdISy5qcGc=.webp,N,,2025-08-11 16:05:50.155811

Wesley Ingwersen’s U.S. Environmentally-Extended Input-Output, or USEEIO, model — a top federal dataset used by companies to calculate supply chain emissions — will remain public but will no longer be updated by the EPA.

Ingwersen, suspended for joining an open letter accusing the administration of undermining EPA’s mission, is leaving for Stanford University, where a consortium will keep the database free and updated.

Critics warn that moving such research to the private sector could reduce credibility, while some companies rely on the data to comply with upcoming European Union and California reporting rules.

Key quote:

“Moving data to the private sector with private motivations such as profit, power, market share or competitive advantage makes the data less trustworthy and therefore less valuable.”

— Paul Anastas, former EPA assistant administrator for research and development

Why this matters:

Reliable greenhouse gas emissions data underpins corporate climate reporting, environmental regulation, and public understanding of the carbon footprint of goods and services. When such information is left to private stewardship, transparency can be harder to guarantee and trust can erode — especially when profit or competitive advantage enters the equation. Losing government-backed updates could create gaps in how accurately companies measure and reduce pollution, particularly as jurisdictions like California and the European Union expand mandatory reporting.

In short:

Gov. Josh Stein urged DHS Secretary Kristi L. Noem to release $115 million in Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) public assistance grants for about 100 projects, including debris removal, wastewater repairs, and bridge reconstruction.

FEMA has provided $1.36 billion in aid since Helene, but a new DHS policy requiring Noem’s personal approval for expenses over $100,000 has slowed disbursements, with FEMA’s monthly aid to North Carolina dropping from $40 million to $6.5 million.

Rural counties have spent millions from their own budgets, expecting rapid federal reimbursement, but now face financial strain that threatens basic services like paying first responders and maintaining waste collection.

Key quote:

“Cash-strapped local governments in western North Carolina need this money as soon as possible to keep essential services going, whether that is continuing recovery operations, paying first responders and teachers, or picking up trash.”

— Josh Stein, governor of North Carolina

Why this matters:

When disaster recovery funds are delayed, communities already reeling from storms can face a cascade of new crises. Small and rural towns often front the costs for cleanup, infrastructure repair, and emergency services, betting on timely federal reimbursement. Without it, budgets shrink, services falter, and recovery stalls — sometimes for years. Prolonged gaps in aid also deepen public mistrust in government disaster response, a problem compounded when climate change drives more frequent and severe storms. As hurricane seasons grow longer and more destructive, bottlenecks in disaster funding mean damaged roads, unsafe drinking water, and unstable housing remain part of daily life, with health, safety, and economic stability hanging in the balance.

In short:

The Trump administration ruled that orphaned well cleanup grants are not subject to the Endangered Species Act or National Historic Preservation Act, removing a step states had previously been required to take.

Legal experts question the decision’s basis, warning states could face lawsuits if federally funded projects harm endangered species without protective permits.

States with large numbers of abandoned wells, including Texas and Pennsylvania, welcomed the change, citing faster work and fewer administrative delays.

Key quote:

“Starting a reckless race to plug oil and gas wells at the expense of endangered species and historic sites only adds insult to injury. A better approach is making sure these companies pay to quickly and responsibly clean up the messes they created so Americans don’t get stuck with the bill.”

— Hollin Kretzmann, senior attorney at the Center for Biological Diversity

Why this matters:

Orphaned oil and gas wells are a major source of methane emissions, leaking a potent greenhouse gas linked to climate change. They can also contaminate groundwater and soil, posing long-term health and environmental risks to surrounding communities. Removing environmental and historic preservation reviews may allow faster plugging, but it also reduces oversight intended to protect wildlife habitats and cultural landmarks. With hundreds of thousands of wells already documented — and potentially a million more undiscovered — the scale of the cleanup effort is vast. Decisions about how to balance speed with safeguards will shape not only climate and conservation outcomes, but also the financial and legal liabilities borne by states and taxpayers.

In short:

Dominion says the Chesterfield Energy Reliability Center is essential to meet peak power demands, with energy use in Virginia projected to double by the late 2030s.

Environmental advocates argue the project violates the spirit of the Virginia Clean Economy Act and should be replaced with solar, wind, and battery storage.

DEQ’s analysis shows emissions would be lower than the coal plant it replaces, but residents say any additional pollution threatens recent air quality gains.

Key quote:

“This plant is dirty and expensive. No two ways about it. Burning methane is bad for our health.”

— Rachel James, attorney for the Southern Environmental Law Center

Why this matters:

Peaker plants, designed to run during extreme heat or cold, can be major sources of short-term but intense air pollution, releasing fine particulate matter and other contaminants linked to respiratory and cardiovascular disease. Building them in or near low-income communities and communities of color raises environmental justice concerns, as these neighborhoods often face higher baseline pollution and poorer health outcomes. While natural gas produces fewer emissions than coal, methane — the main component — has potent climate-warming effects. The debate over Chesterfield reflects a larger national tension: balancing rapidly rising electricity demand with climate goals, and deciding whether short-term reliability should be met with fossil fuels or accelerated investment in renewables and storage.

In short:

The Bureau of Land Management proposes rescinding safeguards for key Arctic habitats, opening 82% of the 23-million-acre reserve to oil and gas development.

Alaska Native leaders say the rollback disregards decades of work to protect areas critical for wildlife and subsistence, warning of worsening health and environmental damage.

Scientists cite threats to caribou migration, polar bear denning, and permafrost stability, along with long-term oil production timelines stretching into the 2050s and beyond.

Key quote:

“To have all the work we’ve done for the last two decades, trying to create important special areas with their unique biological features demonstrated by science, disregarded to allow full-force development is crazy to consider.”

— Rosemary Ahtuangaruak, activist and former mayor of Nuiqsut, Alaska

Why this matters:

The Alaskan Arctic is warming nearly four times faster than the global average, making it one of the most climate-sensitive regions on the planet. The National Petroleum Reserve–Alaska serves as a critical habitat for migratory birds, caribou, and polar bears, while also supporting subsistence traditions that sustain Indigenous communities. Expanding oil drilling here could lock in fossil fuel production for decades, increasing greenhouse gas emissions well past the period when scientists say reductions are needed to avert catastrophic climate impacts. Industrialization also threatens permafrost integrity, which, once thawed, releases vast amounts of carbon and destabilizes land and infrastructure.

In short:

The Trump administration and Congress repealed three major waivers under the Clean Air Act that allowed California to set tougher vehicle and truck emission standards than what was required under federal law.

Gov. Gavin Newsom has ordered agencies to develop new actions to promote affordable zero-emission vehicles without relying on federal approval.

Experts warn the policy shift could slow U.S. electric vehicle growth, ceding market leadership to China, and worsen air pollution in California, which has some of the nation’s worst air quality.

Key quote:

“The governor and the legislature should understand that their people need to breathe clean air, and that auto pollution is the worst contributor to the polluted air in California.”

— Dan Becker, director of the Safe Climate Transport Campaign at the Center for Biological Diversity

Why this matters:

Air pollution remains one of the most persistent environmental health threats in the United States, contributing to asthma, heart disease, lung cancer, and premature deaths. California’s geography and heavy traffic make it particularly vulnerable, trapping pollutants in valleys and urban basins. Vehicle emissions are a leading source of smog-forming chemicals and fine particles, which disproportionately harm low-income communities located near highways and freight corridors. Rolling back state-level emission standards could prolong exposure to these pollutants, increasing the public health burden and straining healthcare systems. The stakes extend beyond California, as its clean vehicle policies have historically set the pace for national standards and influenced global markets.

In short:

The order directs agency heads to appoint senior officials to oversee grant reviews, with the stated goal of aligning spending with “agency priorities and the national interest.”

The administration has already canceled over 15,000 grants worth $44 billion, including $7 billion for solar projects in low-income communities.

Critics warn the change will slow funding, politicize the process, and disrupt programs in environmental justice, science, and education.

Key quote:

“The bureaucracy exists to help facilitate government working effectively and efficiently, and this is going in the opposite direction.”

— Matthew Tejada, senior vice president at the Natural Resources Defense Council and former senior staff at the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency

Why this matters:

Federal grants fuel essential programs that often operate far from political attention — cleaning up polluted waterways, funding renewable energy in struggling neighborhoods, or enabling universities to conduct public health research. Shifting control from career experts to political appointees risks tilting funding decisions toward short-term political agendas rather than long-term public benefit. In environmental health and climate policy, where projects can take years to show results, sudden cancellations can dismantle progress and waste prior investments. Rural towns, low-income communities, and small nonprofits — often reliant on federal aid to address pollution, energy access, or disaster resilience — could be hit hardest.

The Service on Friday sent developers a request for records related to their permits under the Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act, which compels companies to obtain permission for “incidental take,” i.e. the documented disturbance of eagle species protected under the statute, whether said disturbance happens by accident or by happenstance due to the migration of the species. Developers who received the letter — a copy of which was reviewed by Heatmap — must provide a laundry list of documents to the Service within 30 days, including “information collected on each dead or injured eagle discovered.” The Service did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

These letters represent the rapid execution of an announcement made just a week ago by Interior Secretary Doug Burgum, who released a memo directing department staff to increase enforcement of the Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act “to ensure that our national bird is not sacrificed for unreliable wind facilities.” The memo stated that all permitted wind facilities would receive records requests related to the eagle law by August 11 — so, based on what we’ve now seen and confirmed, they’re definitely doing that.

There’s cause for wind developers, renewables advocates, and climate activists to be alarmed here given the expanding horizon of enforcement of wildlife statutes, which have become a weapon for the administration against zero-carbon energy generation.

The August 4 memo directed the Service to refer “violations” of the Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act to the agency solicitor’s office, with potential further referral to the Justice Department for criminal or civil charges. Violating this particular law can result in a fine of at least $100,000 per infraction, a year in prison, or both, and penalties increase if a company, organization, or individual breaks the law more than once. It’s worth noting at this point that according to FWS’s data, oil pits historically kill far more birds per year than wind turbines.

In a statement to Heatmap News, the American Clean Power Association defended the existing federal framework around protecting eagles from wind turbines, noted the nation’s bald eagle population has risen significantly overall in the past two decades, and claimed golden eagle populations are “stable, at the same time wind energy has been growing.”

“This is clear evidence that strong protections and reasonable permitting rules work.

Australia as an energy intensive green export superpower is extremely practical.","What is your one big idea?

One really big idea is to take the steps necessary to see Australia become a renewable energy superpower by exporting green energy intensive products such as green iron, green aluminium, green transport fuels and green fertilisers. Australia is blessed with some of the best solar and wind resources with world-best availability factors, and comparatively little of this is needed domestically.

These significant resources can be used to make energy intensive exports. The key point to understand is that in the fossil fuel world it is low cost to transport, for example, our iron ore, coking coal, gas and thermal coal to north-east Asia where they are used to make iron and steel. In the net zero world, however, it is extremely expensive to export the renewable energy, and the hydrogen to replace coking coal, which are needed to make green iron. So green iron should be made where the renewable resources are and where the hydrogen is made – in Australia. The change in transport costs flips the economics so that it is logical that more value adding occurs in Australia.

What are the benefits?

The benefits for Australia and the world are enormous. Significant investment is required, many skilled workers are needed, and our productivity will be boosted as the technology and learning-by-doing sees continuing improvement in making these products.

The world benefits as well because if we realise our green energy intensive export potential Australia can produce products that will reduce world emissions by up to 10%. Countries that do not have the renewable resources to decarbonise themselves will rely on Australia playing its role, just as we have by being the world’s largest exporter of coal and gas combined.

What are the downsides?

The only downside is that we do not know how quickly countries will meet their international commitments and decarbonise. The faster they do, the larger the opportunity for Australia.

How practical is it?

Australia as an energy intensive green export superpower is extremely practical. Indeed, its time has come. Continually talking about the superpower opportunity without projects emerging encourages scepticism and sees other countries gain an advantage over us that they should not have. Other countries are starting projects and gaining the learning-by-doing lessons we should be benefiting from.

What is needed is for the government to support early projects with 15-30% innovation capital grants, and to provide initial support to make up for the lack of a world carbon price. If you believe in the climate science that fossil fuel use damages our environment, it is ridiculous that products that do not damage the environment are competing with those that do without the latter paying for the damage they cause.

While not a necessary component of this big idea, this could all be paid for, with considerable money left over, if Australia introduced a carbon price. This would see Australia decarbonise in an easier and much less costly way than we are now.

How politically risky is it?

There are minimal political risks apart from where the government obtains the small amount of money to fund this. The funding is small as only the first few projects will qualify for the innovation grants, and Australia’s green energy intensive exports, once we have made a start, can respond to overseas carbon pricing, as will soon apply in Europe with the introduction of its Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism, and as is emerging in other countries directly or via increasing green product mandates which have the same effect.

Whereas decarbonising Australia involves some politically difficult decisions, what is not to like about Australia value adding more in Australia, with new jobs outside our cities, and a continuing boost to productivity and prosperity?

The only downside is talking about it but not taking the steps to bring it about.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bc7903dc32350967d7f5b965969ca5109e08e386/605_142_2554_2044/master/2554.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=a79def826d0e8712ac9d9caa98c5f155",N,,2025-08-11 16:03:46.586513

OBBBA retains the zero-emission nuclear power production credit for existing nuclear facilities through December 31, 2032. OBBBA, as discussed below, also enacted new “foreign entity of concern” (FEOC) rules, which may limit taxpayers’ access to the credit in certain circumstances.

Termination and Restrictions on Clean Electricity Production Credit (Section 45Y) and Clean Electricity Investment Credit (Section 48E)

OBBBA terminates the clean electricity production credit and the clean electricity investment credit for wind and solar energy property placed in service after December 31, 2027. However, such placed-in-service requirement does not apply to property that begins construction within one year after the enactment of OBBBA (i.e., by July 4, 2026). The credit for technologies other than wind and solar begins to phase out in 2034 as follows: 75% credit for facilities beginning construction during 2034, 50% credit for facilities beginning construction during 2035, and 0% credit for facilities beginning construction after December 31, 2035. Additionally, as discussed below, OBBBA’s FEOC limitations apply to restrict access to the credit in certain circumstances.

Phase-Out and Restrictions on Advanced Manufacturing Production Credit (Section 45X)

OBBBA terminates the advanced manufacturing production credit for wind components produced and sold after December 31, 2027. Additionally, effective for eligible components sold after December 31, 2026, a person will not be treated as having sold an eligible component that is integrated (a primary component) into another eligible component (a secondary component) unless 65% of the direct material cost to produce the secondary component within the same manufacturing facility is attributable to primary components mined, produced, or manufactured in the United States. Additionally, as discussed below, the credit is subject to OBBBA’s FEOC limitations.

Extension and Modification of Clean Fuel Production Credit (Section 45Z)

OBBBA extends the period for which the clean fuel production credit can be claimed by two years, until December 31, 2029. However, with respect to fuel produced after December 31, 2025, OBBBA (1) reduces the credit for sustainable aviation fuel from $1.75/gallon to $1/gallon, (2) limits the credit to fuel that is exclusively derived from a feedstock that was produced or grown in the United States, Mexico, or Canada, and (3) modifies the calculation of the emissions rate, which is used in determining the credit amount. Additionally, as discussed below, the credit is subject to OBBBA’s FEOC limitations.

Restrictions on Carbon Oxide Sequestration Credit (Section 45Q)

While OBBBA does not modify the expiration of the carbon oxide sequestration credit, OBBBA increases the amount of the Section 45Q tax credit for captured carbon oxides used in either enhanced oil or natural gas recovery projects or for other specified commercial purposes from a current rate of $60 per metric ton to $85 per metric ton, the same amount available for captured carbon oxides disposed of in secure geological storage. The increased credit amounts apply to facilities or equipment that are placed in service after July 4, 2025. Additionally, as discussed below, the credit is subject to OBBBA’s FEOC limitations.

Phase-Out of Clean Hydrogen Production Credit (Section 45V)

OBBBA phases out Section 45V early. Under OBBBA, clean hydrogen facilities must begin construction by December 31, 2027, as opposed to December 31, 2032, as previously contemplated under the IRA. However, OBBBA does not apply the FEOC limitations to Section 45V.

Termination of Various Other Credits

OBBBA terminates early various other clean energy tax credits. For vehicles acquired after September 30, 2025, OBBBA terminates Section 30D (Clean Vehicle Credit), Section 25E (Previously Owned Clean Vehicles), and Section 45W (Qualified Commercial Clean Vehicles). Further, for property placed in service and expenditures made, respectively, after December 31, 2025, OBBBA terminates Section 25C (Energy Efficient Home Improvement Credit) and Section 25D (Residential Clean Energy Credit). Additionally, for property placed in service, property beginning construction, and property acquired, respectively, after June 30, 2026, OBBBA terminates Section 30C (Charging/Alternative Fuel Refueling Property), Section 179D (Energy Efficient Commercial Buildings), and Section 45L (New Energy Efficient Homes).

The various changes above may create additional pressure for taxpayers intending to claim energy incentives to accelerate expenditures or begin construction on projects much sooner than originally planned.

Foreign Entity of Concern Rules

OBBBA imposes greater FEOC restrictions on the production of renewable energy in the United States. Under OBBBA, FEOC rules disqualify certain energy projects from access to certain energy tax credits if the project is either owned or controlled by a disqualified foreign entity or person tied to China, Russia, North Korea, or Iran (each a Covered Nation) or if the project receives certain material assistance or supply chain inputs from such foreign entities or persons. Thus, understanding an energy producer’s supply chain and contractual ties to FEOCs is critical to ensuring eligibility for certain energy tax credits.

Key Definitions Under the FEOC Rules

At the heart of the FEOC rules is the concept of the “prohibited foreign entity” (PFE). A PFE is defined as either a “specified foreign entity” (SFE) or a “foreign-influenced entity” (FIE).

Specified Foreign Entity (SFE)

SFEs are defined as any of the following: (1) foreign terrorist organizations designated by the US Secretary of State, (2) specially designated nationals and blocked persons on the US Department of Treasury’s OFAC list, (3) Chinese military companies operating in the United States, (4) entities on the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act list, (5) certain Chinese battery manufacturers identified in the National Defense Authorization Act for FY 2024, (6) the governments of a Covered Nation (or any instrumentality thereof), (7) any entity incorporated (or maintaining a qualified business unit or principal place of business) in a Covered Nation, or (8) a citizen or national of a Covered Nation. In addition, any entity (whether a US entity or otherwise) that is “controlled” (generally meaning more than 50% owned, directly or indirectly) by a legal entity incorporated in a Covered Nation, a national or citizen of a Covered Nation, or a Covered Nation (or instrumentality thereof), is an SFE.

Foreign-Influenced Entity (FIE)

FIEs generally are entities that are determined to be under too much control or influence from an SFE. OBBBA uses two approaches to defining FIEs.

FIE – Statutory Test First, OBBBA statutorily lays out several contractual relationships that will render an entity a FIE: (1) an SFE owns at least 25% of the entity (by vote or value), (2) multiple SFEs together own at least 40% of the entity (by vote or value), (3) at least 15% of the entity’s original issued debt is held by one or more SFEs, or (4) an SFE has the authority —directly or indirectly — to appoint a covered officer, such as a board member or officer.

FIE – Effective Control Test Second, OBBBA introduces a much broader “effective control” test, which provides that if the entity makes a payment to an SFE under a contract or arrangement that gives the SFE (or a related entity) “effective control” over a qualified facility, energy storage technology, or eligible component — including the extraction, processing, or recycling of critical minerals — then such entity is a FIE. OBBBA requires the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to publish guidance on the definition and application of the “effective control” test, and until such point, certain statutory rules apply for purposes of determining effective control.

Material Assistance From a PFE

Material assistance from a PFE is another critical factor that can jeopardize a project’s eligibility for energy tax credits. OBBBA establishes a cost ratio mechanism to measure material assistance with respect to each project: the material assistance cost ratio (MACR). As noted in the chart below, the material assistance rules apply only to clean electricity production credits, clean electricity investment credits, and advanced manufacturing production credits.

For the clean electricity production credit (Section 45Y) and the clean electricity investment credit (Section 48E), the MACR is calculated by taking the total direct costs of all manufactured products and subcomponents incorporated into the facility, subtracting the costs attributable to PFEs, and dividing by the total direct costs. If the MACR is less than certain statutorily set thresholds, the project is deemed to have received material assistance from a PFE. For the advanced manufacturing production credit (Section 45X), only the direct material costs for eligible components are counted for purposes of calculating the MACR, which is calculated in the same manner noted above.

Projects must meet or exceed certain statutorily set MACR thresholds, which vary depending on the technology and the year in which construction begins. For example, some facilities must meet a 40% threshold in 2026, with the requirement rising to 60% or more in later years. The Treasury is required to issue safe harbor tables by December 31, 2026, to help clarify these MACR threshold requirements. Until such point, IRS Notice 2025-08 and supplier certifications can be used by taxpayers to demonstrate compliance with MACR percentage thresholds.

Summary of Tax Credits Limited by FEOC Rules

If a taxpayer meets the definition of a PFE due to its ownership structure or contracts with certain foreign entities, or receives material assistance from a PFE, depending upon the type of tax credit at issue, the taxpayer may not be eligible to claim the credit. The following chart provides an overview of how the FEOC rules limit access to the tax credits discussed above.

As a result of the FEOC rules, any renewable energy project or manufacturing of eligible components will require an extensive FEOC analysis to determine tax credit eligibility. Moreover, strategics, private equity funds, or tax credit syndicators purchasing tax credits under Section 6418 will now need to conduct extensive diligence of the tax credit seller’s capital and organizational structure, and supply-chain structure, to ensure FEOC compliance is satisfied, and credits are properly transferable.

Further Guidance Needed on FEOC Rules

Although Congress attempted to refine the FEOC rules as OBBBA was enacted, there remain significant areas where Treasury and the IRS are expected to provide further guidance. For example, the scope of what constitutes “effective control” in the context of payments to FIEs is not fully defined, and the statute directs the Treasury and the IRS to issue rules to prevent entities from circumventing the restrictions through contracts or other arrangements. Additionally, the material assistance rules require the development of safe harbor tables by December 31, 2026, to clarify the percentage of costs attributable to PFEs. Until then, taxpayers must rely on interim guidance and supplier certifications, which may not address all practical scenarios.

Beginning of Construction Guidance

For many of the energy tax credits discussed in this alert, eligibility to claim such credits will turn on the precise moment a project is considered to have “begun construction.” The IRS, through a series of notices, has long applied two primary tests to determine when a project has begun construction: the five percent safe harbor and the physical work test. Although the details of those tests fall outside the scope of this update, it is important to note that in 2022 the Service confirmed that the analytical framework set out in those notices remains valid when evaluating projects for energy tax credit purposes. In certain parts of OBBBA, Congress formally incorporated the existing IRS beginning of construction notices, but only for the limited purpose of administering the statute’s FEOC provisions.

However, on July 7, 2025, the Trump Administration issued an Executive Order directing the Treasury Department to publish guidance on the “beginning of construction” rules, which would prevent developers from relying on perceived “loopholes” in the current beginning of construction guidance. Because this Executive Order could materially alter how and how quickly projects qualify for the array of federal energy credits discussed herein, sponsors, investors, and other stakeholders should re-examine their beginning of construction strategies and documentation in real time.

NJ loses $156M in grants for low-income solar access

Murphy, state leaders criticize decision

Program aimed to cut energy costs, create clean energy jobs

The Environmental Protection Agency announced Aug. 7 plans to eliminate the Solar for All program.

A $7 billion grant competition, the Biden administration launched SFA through the Inflation Reduction Act‘s Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund. The initiative aimed to increase access to affordable, resilient and clean solar energy for millions of low-income households.

As NJBIZ reported last year, New Jersey received awards totaling $156.1 million in grant funding through the program. However, the recently enacted One Big Beautiful Act eliminated the GGRF. And thus the funds for Solar for All, EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin announced Thursday.

“In some cases, your tax dollars were diluted through up to FOUR pass-through entities, each taking their own cut off the top! The bottom line is this: EPA no longer has the statutory authority to administer the program or the appropriated funds to keep this boondoggle alive,” Zeldin wrote in a social media post. “Today, the Trump EPA is announcing that we are ending Solar for All for good, saving US taxpayers ANOTHER $7 BILLION!”

Zeldin said that much of the money has not actually been spent yet.

“While this program was stood up in 2024, very little money has actually been spent,” said Zeldin in a video statement. “Recipients are still very much in the early planning phase – not the building and construction process.”

Increased costs

The announcement immediately drew blowback here in New Jersey from some of the state’s top leaders, such as Gov. Phil Murphy.

“This reckless declaration by the Trump administration will directly increase household energy costs for our most vulnerable families – and it could not come at a worse moment,” said Murphy in an Aug. 8 statement. “At a time when Americans are struggling with skyrocketing energy costs, the Solar for All program would have helped lower costs for working families up and down the Garden State, in towns represented by both Democrats and Republicans.

“This program was estimated to help thousands of our state’s low-income households save $400 every year.”

Murphy said that instead, the Trump administration has pulled support for a “commonsense program.” According to the governor, Solar For All would have delivered cleaner energy and lower costs.

“Americans deserve better, and the Trump administration must reconsider this about-face,” said Murphy. “I am committed to supporting the continued expansion of solar energy, which powers 750,000 homes across New Jersey and has the potential to create thousands of more good-paying jobs and make energy more affordable for many years to come.”

‘A deliberate choice’

Assembly Speaker Craig Coughlin, D-19th District, echoed that sentiment in an Aug. 8 statement.

“I am deeply disappointed by the Trump administration’s decision to walk back on a promise that would have brought meaningful relief to so many hard-working families in New Jersey and across the country,” said Coughlin. “Cutting the Solar for All program is a short-sighted and harmful decision that will raise energy costs at the worst possible time, eliminate jobs, and reverse years of progress toward affordable, reliable energy.”

This reckless declaration by the Trump administration will directly increase household energy costs for our most vulnerable families – and it could not come at a worse moment.

— Gov. Phil Murphy

Alex Glass is communications director for strategic communications organization Climate Power. “Instead of cutting energy costs in half, like he promised, Donald Trump has taken an ax to popular bipartisan programs that help working families lower their energy costs,” Glass said. “First, he came for LIHEAP and EnergyStar, and now he’s ready to gut Solar for All.”

Glass also noted the positive impacts of the SFA program on energy costs and job creation. He said that the cancellation comes as millions of Americans facing rising electricity bills.

“This is a deliberate choice to make life harder for working Americans,” said Glass. “The Trump administration isn’t just walking away from climate solutions – they’re ripping affordable energy away from the families who need it most.”",https://originnjbiz.wpenginepowered.com/files/2025/05/solar-stock-jess-4.png,N,,2025-08-11 15:06:12.482994

In North America, shares of U.S. producers Albemarle Corp. and Piedmont Lithium Inc. surged above 10% in premarket trading in New York. Lithium Americas Corp. and Chilean producer SQM rose around 9% in early U.S. trading.

The fate of the CATL mine — the biggest in China’s lithium hub of Yichun — had been under close scrutiny for weeks amid speculation that authorities wouldn’t extend its license. The mine accounts for some 6% of global output, according to Bank of America Corp., while other mines in the region account for at least another 5%.

“I think it will mean the lithium price in the near term has very big upside,” Matty Zhao, co-head of China equity research at the lender, said in a Bloomberg TV interview.

The most-active lithium carbonate futures contract on the Guangzhou Futures Exchange jumped by the daily limit of 8% on Monday, according to the exchange website. The contract due in November traded at 81,000 yuan a ton, up from a settlement of 75,000 yuan on Friday.

Lithium producers have struggled with a global supply glut exacerbated by demand headwinds for electric vehicles, including President Donald Trump’s rollback of incentives for the industry in the United States. In China, the so-called anti-involution campaign has fueled speculation about a possible crackdown on a sector that’s clearly suffering from oversupply.

CATL, the world’s biggest battery producer, confirmed the closure of its Jianxiawo mine on Monday morning, saying it’s seeking to renew its expired permit without giving more details. The operation will be shut for at least three months, people familiar with the matter told Bloomberg News over the weekend, after its mining license expired on Aug. 9.

The Chinese company said the stoppage would have little impact on its overall operations, and its shares rose as much as 2.8% in Hong Kong.

“For CATL we do not expect any meaningful operational impact to battery production from the Jiangxi mine suspension,” said Eugene Hsiao, the head of China equity strategy at Macquarie Capital. “The concern from the mine suspension is less on CATL and more on if the broader lithium supply chain can see tighter capacity, and if this will be coordinated via Chinese government actions.”

The “anti-involution” theme has gripped China’s financial markets in recent months, with investors trying to pinpoint industries and companies that might benefit from Beijing-led efforts to tackle deflation and overcapacity. It’s encompassed sectors from e-commerce to EVs and steelmaking.

“We believe this could be part of the government’s anti-involution initiative,” Citigroup Inc. analysts said in a note. Closures in Yichun “should help China to re-price its strategic resource in the long-run, and the government can ensure lithium is mined and extracted in a proper and compliant way.”

Like many Chinese battery companies, CATL has aggressively expanded investments in minerals from lithium to nickel and cobalt in order to lock in long-term supplies and lower costs. That vertical integration has in turn aided China’s push to become the world’s leading EV manufacturer.

Spot lithium carbonate prices in China rose by 3% on Monday to reach 75,500 yuan a ton, the highest since February, according to Asian Metal Inc. The lithium carbonate prices traded on Liyang Zhonglianjin E-Commerce platform, a popular benchmark for domestic investors, rose by over 10,000 yuan today to around 85,500 yuan per ton for November delivery.

Shares of Australian lithium producers also spiked. PLS Ltd., formerly Pilbara Minerals Ltd., jumped as much as 20% in Sydney, while Liontown Resources Ltd. surged as much as 25%. Mineral Resources Ltd. was up as much as 14%.

Traders and industry executives are now watching for other mining curbs around China’s Yichun city, which has emerged as a battery-metals hub. A local government department has asked eight miners to submit reserves reports by the end of September, according to notes from brokers and analysts, following an audit that found non-compliance in the registration and approvals process.

“CATL’s situation does not change the oversupply structure in the market,” said Zhang Weixin, an analyst at China Futures Co. “However, if production disruption is expanded to other mines in Yichun after Sept. 30, the lithium price level could go even higher.”

The funding, authorized by Congress and awarded through the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), was intended to help Washington prepare for climate-driven hazards like wildfires, flooding, drought, and sea level rise. Projects targeted for cuts include programs focused on equity, inclusion, and ""engagement with historically underrepresented communities that are disproportionately exposed to the effects of climate change.""

According to the state’s complaint, NOAA abruptly terminated two awards on May 5, claiming they conflicted with the president’s priorities. Brown argues the decision violates the U.S. Constitution’s Spending Clause, separation of powers principles, and the Administrative Procedure Act.

One major casualty is the State Board for Community and Technical Colleges’ (SBCTC) $9.3 million Tribal Stewards Program, designed to train more than 2,100 students in environmental and natural resource fields. Eleven employers had pledged to hire program graduates for jobs in climate resilience — many in economically depressed regions.

“NOAA’s decision … directly impacts future workers who want to start work in well-paying climate resilience jobs,” said Nate Humphrey, the executive director of the SBCTC.

The other cut project, run by the Department of Ecology, sought to strengthen coastal communities’ defenses against hazards like flooding and erosion. NOAA withheld nearly half of its $250,000 award, halting work entirely.

Lisa Friedman reports for The New York Times.

In short:

Interior Secretary Doug Burgum ordered a review of permits that allow wind companies to incidentally harm eagles and suggested possible criminal prosecutions.

At the same time, the administration has rolled back parts of the Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act, the Endangered Species Act, and the Migratory Bird Treaty Act, often benefiting fossil fuel producers.

Federal data shows wind power kills far fewer birds than oil pits, power lines, buildings, or domestic cats, and scientists warn climate change poses the greater long-term threat to birds.

“All of the concern for eagles is concentrated solely on wind right now.”

— Sarah Krakoff, professor of environmental law, University of Colorado, Boulder

Why this matters:

Bald eagles are one of the most visible symbols of American wildlife, and their rebound from near extinction is often cited as a major conservation success. But their survival remains tied to environmental safeguards that limit industrial impacts, from toxic lead to habitat destruction. Energy policy decisions that selectively enforce wildlife protections can skew public perception about the real sources of harm and shift the regulatory burden away from larger threats.

The 100% domestic content solar tracker market is filling up. Since Nextracker claimed the “first” in December 2024, several other tracker manufacturers have filled the final supply chain gaps—sourcing actuators, drives, and controllers domestically—to launch their own 100% domestic content solar tracker solutions. Others are also promoting safe harbor strategies in preparation for the upcoming change to “construction start” language. Here’s a recap of recent announcements.

Domestic Content Table for Ground-Mount Trackers

For reference, here is a breakdown of the “First Updated Elective Safe Harbor” domestic content percentages from Treasury Notice 2025-08 for Ground-Mount Trackers, modified Notice 2024-41. The column on the right is that original New Elective Safe Harbor for comparison’s sake.

OMCO Solar now shipping 100% U.S. made trackers

Solar racking manufacturer OMCO Solar is now offering a 100% U.S.-made solar tracker system. With the delivery of Kinematics’ American-made drives and motors, OMCO’s fully domestic tracker solution is officially being deployed to project sites nationwide.

“OMCO has historically been a leader in solar domestic manufacturing and this achievement, working in conjunction with our partners at Kinematics, is a milestone for our team,” says Eric Goodwin, VP of Business Development. “The timing of this also allows OMCO Solar’s Phoenix, AZ Headquarters, one of five OMCO manufacturing plants in the US. OMCO to deliver for our customers immediately in the aftermath of the OBBB passage and the compressed schedule requirements to ensure tax credits for projects are secured.”

OMCO Solar is the solar division of OMCO Holdings, which has more than 70 years of American manufacturing experience, and has manufactured components for solar systems for decades. Combining the OMCO U.S. manufacturing footprint (five plants) with Kinematics’ U.S. volume adds up to 13 GW annual capacity. To date, OMCO Solar has delivered over 12 GW of factory-direct solar mounting structures within the US.

Terrasmart brings ground screws in house

Terrasmart’s domestic ground screws for solar racking foundations, which have historically been manufactured at outside companies, will now be produced at Terrasmart’s manufacturing facility in Cincinnati, Ohio.

“Moving domestic ground screw production in-house streamlines our supply chain, maximizing availability for qualifying solar projects to meet domestic content thresholds to benefit our customers, the solar industry, and the wider U.S. economy,” says Ed McKiernan, President, Terrasmart.

Currently, Terrasmart’s ground screw manufacturing capacity is on track to sustain nearly 500 MWs of new PV projects. The new production line consists of twelve work stations, an induction heater, forge, plasma cutter, stamping press, three-hole punch and set nut welder, and six helical welders. The facility will also add three different sizes of ground screws to its list. To empower its team members, Terrasmart trained and upskilled the ground screw assembly line team in five new skill sets.

Nextracker solidifies 100% domestic content to start 2025

As mentioned, back in December 2024, Nextracker announced it shipped and delivered what they believed to be “the first U.S.-manufactured solar trackers expected to achieve 100% domestic content value.” These were delivered to SB Energy’s Pelican’s Jaw project, 570 MW solar and 954 MWh storage project under construction by SOLV Energy.

Together with its manufacturing partners, Nextracker has now expanded or opened more than 25 U.S. factories with over 30 GW of annual capacity.

“By systematically focusing our manufacturing partnerships close to our customer project sites, we secure the supply chain and provide superior on-time delivery and cost savings for project development and construction,” stated Dan Shugar, Nextracker founder and CEO. “We also significantly de-carbonize our products by incorporating clean steel manufactured in the United States.”

ARRAY set to deliver 100% domestic content trackers to Indiana project

The 200 MWac Emerald Green Solar project in Indiana being developed by ENGIE North America (ENGIE) will be with a domestic content ARRAY OmniTrack tracker. Deliveries of the trackers are expected to begin in Q3 2025.

ARRAY Technologies says the trackers meet 100% of the domestic content Assigned Cost Percentage (ACP) under the U.S. Treasury Department’s latest guidance (Notice 2025-08) issued in January 2025. To validate full compliance with federal guidelines, ARRAY partnered with a third-party tax and advisory firm to analyze its manufacturing processes and supply chain. It enables developers to qualify for the maximum 28.7% ACP, which includes the 9.4% production ACP available exclusively for projects using trackers with only domestic content manufactured product components.

“The fact that the steel used in ENGIE’s largest energy project in Indiana will include torque tube and steel rolled locally in the state and installed by some of the more than 250 construction workers that will build the project really reflects the local nature of renewable energy production in the U.S.” said David Carroll, Chief Renewables Officer and Senior Vice President at ENGIE North America

GameChange and FTC promote module-agnostic safe harbor strategies

Following the passage of the OBBB, the upcoming changes to the definition of “construction start” will have a big impact on tax credit eligibility. Both GameChange Solar and FTC Solar are emphasizing the importance of designing projects with module flexibility to accommodate potential future module changes, and thus promoting their torque tubes.

GameChange Solar’s Genius Tracker system has unpunched torque tubes, low-profile bearings, and SpeedClamps or flexible purlins to accommodate changes in module dimensions or mounting hole patterns without requiring costly field rework. In addition, in January, GameChange Solar, announced six more tracker torque tube factory partners across the United States, with a combined annual production capacity exceeding 35 GW.

FTC Solar’s 1P “Pioneer” trackers utilize universal torque tubes with innovative Python Clip rail designs, which eliminate the need to puncture torque tubes and accommodate any variation in module form factor, giving developers and EPCs ultimate flexibility for module changes late in the design process.

“FTC Solar’s products are not just safe harbor eligible – they are optimized for safe harbor,” said Yann Brandt, CEO of FTC Solar. “Whether developers pursue a hard money investment or an early works construction start, FTC Solar is ready to support with proven tracker technology, engineering expertise, and domestic capacity.”

In terms of 100% domestic content tracker, FTC Solar says it is rapidly scaling a domestic supply chain, and will begin taking orders starting in Q4 2025.

In addition, while most PV panel innovations originated in research organizations or industry, many BOS innovations were developed by city governments, U.S. states, or professional associations.
“PV was very well-positioned to absorb innovations from other industries — thanks to the right timing, physical compatibility, and supportive policies to adapt innovations for PV applications,” Klemun adds.","The cost of solar panels has dropped by more than 99 percent since the 1970s, enabling widespread adoption of photovoltaic systems that convert sunlight into electricity.

A new MIT study drills down on specific innovations that enabled such dramatic cost reductions, revealing that technical advances across a web of diverse research efforts and industries played a pivotal role.

The findings could help renewable energy companies make more effective R&D investment decisions and aid policymakers in identifying areas to prioritize to spur growth in manufacturing and deployment.

The researchers’ modeling approach shows that key innovations often originated outside the solar sector, including advances in semiconductor fabrication, metallurgy, glass manufacturing, oil and gas drilling, construction processes, and even legal domains.

“Our results show just how intricate the process of cost improvement is, and how much scientific and engineering advances, often at a very basic level, are at the heart of these cost reductions. A lot of knowledge was drawn from different domains and industries, and this network of knowledge is what makes these technologies improve,” says study senior author Jessika Trancik, a professor in MIT’s Institute for Data, Systems, and Society.

Trancik is joined on the paper by co-lead authors Goksin Kavlak, a former IDSS graduate student and postdoc who is now a senior energy associate at the Brattle Group; Magdalena Klemun, a former IDSS graduate student and postdoc who is now an assistant professor at Johns Hopkins University; former MIT postdoc Ajinkya Kamat; as well as Brittany Smith and Robert Margolis of the National Renewable Energy Laboratory. The research appears today in PLOS ONE.

Identifying innovations

This work builds on mathematical models that the researchers previously developed that tease out the effects of engineering technologies on the cost of photovoltaic (PV) modules and systems.

In this study, the researchers aimed to dig even deeper into the scientific advances that drove those cost declines.

They combined their quantitative cost model with a detailed, qualitative analysis of innovations that affected the costs of PV system materials, manufacturing steps, and deployment processes.

“Our quantitative cost model guided the qualitative analysis, allowing us to look closely at innovations in areas that are hard to measure due to a lack of quantitative data,” Kavlak says.

Building on earlier work identifying key cost drivers — such as the number of solar cells per module, wiring efficiency, and silicon wafer area — the researchers conducted a structured scan of the literature for innovations likely to affect these drivers. Next, they grouped these innovations to identify patterns, revealing clusters that reduced costs by improving materials or prefabricating components to streamline manufacturing and installation. Finally, the team tracked industry origins and timing for each innovation, and consulted domain experts to zero in on the most significant innovations.

All told, they identified 81 unique innovations that affected PV system costs since 1970, from improvements in antireflective coated glass to the implementation of fully online permitting interfaces.

“With innovations, you can always go to a deeper level, down to things like raw materials processing techniques, so it was challenging to know when to stop. Having that quantitative model to ground our qualitative analysis really helped,” Trancik says.

They chose to separate PV module costs from so-called balance-of-system (BOS) costs, which cover things like mounting systems, inverters, and wiring.

PV modules, which are wired together to form solar panels, are mass-produced and can be exported, while many BOS components are designed, built, and sold at the local level.

“By examining innovations both at the BOS level and within the modules, we identify the different types of innovations that have emerged in these two parts of PV technology,” Kavlak says.

BOS costs depend more on soft technologies, nonphysical elements such as permitting procedures, which have contributed significantly less to PV’s past cost improvement compared to hardware innovations.

“Often, it comes down to delays. Time is money, and if you have delays on construction sites and unpredictable processes, that affects these balance-of-system costs,” Trancik says.

Innovations such as automated permitting software, which flags code-compliant systems for fast-track approval, show promise. Though not yet quantified in this study, the team’s framework could support future analysis of their economic impact and similar innovations that streamline deployment processes.

Interconnected industries

The researchers found that innovations from the semiconductor, electronics, metallurgy, and petroleum industries played a major role in reducing both PV and BOS costs, but BOS costs were also impacted by innovations in software engineering and electric utilities.

Noninnovation factors, like efficiency gains from bulk purchasing and the accumulation of knowledge in the solar power industry, also reduced some cost variables.

In addition, while most PV panel innovations originated in research organizations or industry, many BOS innovations were developed by city governments, U.S. states, or professional associations.

“I knew there was a lot going on with this technology, but the diversity of all these fields and how closely linked they are, and the fact that we can clearly see that network through this analysis, was interesting,” Trancik says.

“PV was very well-positioned to absorb innovations from other industries — thanks to the right timing, physical compatibility, and supportive policies to adapt innovations for PV applications,” Klemun adds.

The analysis also reveals the role greater computing power could play in reducing BOS costs through advances like automated engineering review systems and remote site assessment software.

“In terms of knowledge spillovers, what we've seen so far in PV may really just be the beginning,” Klemun says, pointing to the expanding role of robotics and AI-driven digital tools in driving future cost reductions and quality improvements.

In addition to their qualitative analysis, the researchers demonstrated how this methodology could be used to estimate the quantitative impact of a particular innovation if one has the numerical data to plug into the cost equation.

For instance, using information about material prices and manufacturing procedures, they estimate that wire sawing, a technique which was introduced in the 1980s, led to an overall PV system cost decrease of $5 per watt by reducing silicon losses and increasing throughput during fabrication.

“Through this retrospective analysis, you learn something valuable for future strategy because you can see what worked and what didn’t work, and the models can also be applied prospectively. It is also useful to know what adjacent sectors may help support improvement in a particular technology,” Trancik says.

Moving forward, the researchers plan to apply this methodology to a wide range of technologies, including other renewable energy systems. They also want to further study soft technology to identify innovations or processes that could accelerate cost reductions.

“Although the process of technological innovation may seem like a black box, we’ve shown that you can study it just like any other phenomena,” Trancik says.

Josh Stein’s veto. This landmark legislation introduces significant reforms to North Carolina’s electric utility regulatory framework. Perhaps most notably, the act eliminates the interim resource planning goal of achieving a 70% reduction in carbon dioxide emissions by 2030 while maintaining the target of reaching carbon neutrality by 2050. The act also provides new mechanisms for cost recovery and securitization of utility capital investments and fuel costs.

Elimination of the 2030 Interim Target for Carbon Reduction

The act amends N.C.G.S. § 62-110.9 by eliminating the statutory requirement that the North Carolina Utilities Commission (NCUC) and electric public utilities must, in preparing their biennial Carbon Plan, plan to reduce the utilities’ carbon emissions by 70% from 2005 levels by 2030 (Interim Target), while retaining the long-term goal of carbon neutrality by 2050. Under the law, the NCUC must still biennially review the Carbon Plan to achieve this goal, considering least-cost planning principles and ensuring the continued reliability of the system. Duke Energy will file its 2025 Carbon Plan and Integrated Resource Plan on Oct. 1, 2025, with an NCUC decision required by Dec. 31, 2026.

Construction Work-in-Progress Cost Recovery for Baseload Generation Facilities

The act amends N.C.G.S. §§ 62-110.1 and 62-133 to authorize an alternative cost recovery mechanism for financing costs associated with construction work-in-progress (CWIP) for baseload electric generating facilities. Utilities may now seek recovery of financing costs on reasonable and prudent expenditures for CWIP through yearly applications, including detailed documentation and supporting testimony, submitted to the NCUC for review as part of enhanced progress reporting and annual review proceedings after a certificate of public convenience and necessity to construct a generating facility has been issued. If the NCUC determines after a hearing that the expenditures were reasonably and prudently incurred, the NCUC may allow an increase in base rates authorizing recovery of financing costs outside of the normal rate-making process. For natural gas baseload facilities, this alternative cost-recovery mechanism sunsets for construction costs incurred after Dec. 31, 2033, but permits continued recovery of financing costs incurred prior to that date. The NCUC must consider the overall cost savings for customers over the life of the facility when approving such recovery.

Refinements to Cost Recovery of Fuel and Fuel-Related Charges

The act substantially revises N.C.G.S § 62-133.2 governing cost recovery for fuel and fuel-related charges. Notably, the amendments expand and clarify the process for annual rider recovery of purchased power expenses and require utilities to make appropriate adjustments to their fuel riders to reflect costs already being recovered in base rates, avoiding the potential for double recovery of any fuel or fuel-related costs. The amendments also require utilities to file quarterly reports with the NCUC detailing any actual over- or under-recovery of incurred fuel costs they observe and projecting the cumulative over- or under-recovery for the 12-month recovery period. If the projected amount is greater than 10% of the total revenue requirement approved by the NCUC in the most recent fuel proceeding, the utility must adjust the increment or decrement rider and file an updated tariff to go into effect at the start of the month that is approximately 45 days from the report filing. Finally, any over- or under-recovery of reasonable and prudently incurred fuel costs will accrue interest on a weighted average basis over the applicable time period.

Performance-Based Regulation and Multi-Year Rate Plan (MYRP) Adjustments

The act amends N.C.G.S. § 62-133.16 to allow for inclusion of the revenue requirement associated with certain new combustion turbine units in excess of $500 million provided that the amount of increase for the third rate year does not exceed 4%. In addition, the act introduces new requirements for quarterly reporting on MYRP project status and cancellations and mandates post-MYRP reporting on project execution and differences from approved plans.

The act amends N.C.G.S. § 62-133.16 to authorize securitization of costs related to the retirement of subcritical coal-fired generating units. The act provides that utilities may petition the NCUC for a financing order to issue securitization bonds related to their coal plant retirement costs using the same procedures previously available to utilities for securitization of storm recovery costs. The act defines the types of coal-retirement activities and costs that are eligible for securitization and ensures such costs are non-bypassable and must be paid by all retail customers.",https://jdsupra-static.s3.amazonaws.com/profile-images/og.15495_4416.jpg,N,,2025-08-11 15:06:08.178412

In total, 63 provisions were vetoed, including those that expanded the License by Adhesion and Commitment (LAC)

By WWF-Brazil

The partial vetoes of Bill 2159/2021 represent an effort by the federal government to curb the most critical points of the text approved by Congress, which could have immediate and severe impacts on the environment and Brazilian society. In total, 63 provisions were vetoed, including those deemed highly contentious, such as those that expanded the License by Adhesion and Commitment (LAC) to projects of medium pollution potential, removed the right to consultation of Indigenous and Quilombola communities affected by developments, and scrapped mandatory input from FUNAI (National Indigenous People Foundation) and the Chico Mendes Institute for Biodiversity Conservation in licensing processes. Additionally, the vetoes struck down sections that would have weakened the Atlantic Forest Law and removed the requirement for financial institutions to grant credit only to licensed projects.

This marks a significant response from the federal government, demonstrating its attention to demands from civil society and the scientific community. The vetoes safeguard core elements of Brazil’s socio-environmental protections and avert much of the damage the original bill could have inflicted. Yet, the enacted text retains provisions that undermine environmental licensing, potentially reducing the state’s capacity to prevent socio-environmental harm and weakening safeguards for biomes and vulnerable communities. Thus, while the worst of the so-called ""Devastation Bill"" has been neutralised, lingering risks demand continued attention and monitoring.

A glaring example is the maintenance of the Special Environmental License (LAE), which was only partially vetoed and is present in the Provisional Presidential Decree that establishes its immediate entry into force. The LAE is a special license for projects labelled “strategic” by the Government Council, and designed to expedite the licensing of large infrastructure projects. Touted as an innovation by the federal government, creates a loophole to expedite processes such as oil and gas exploration in the mouth of the Amazon river - which will have a maximum one-year license issuance period -, and provides no clarity on how the process will occur in practice.

Next steps require a detailed analysis of how the vetoes, the Provisional Measure, and the executive’s bill interact, and how vetoed items will be addressed. Close monitoring of the bill’s progress in Brazil’s National Congress is essential to determine whether vetoes will stand or be overridden. This moment requires dialogue with lawmakers and authorities, as well as civil society, experts, and environmental oversight and control agencies.

The bill’s partial sanction coincides with a pivotal moment for Brazil’s environmental and climate agenda. On the eve of COP30, which will be held in Brazil, a time when the world looks to the country as a global climate leader, the weakening of environmental licensing risks tarnishing this reputation and threatening Brazilian leadership, in addition to jeopardising the achievement of the country's climate goals, particularly its pledge to end deforestation by 2030.

Brazilian environmental democracy cannot be weakened, and to this end, we reinforce the importance of the National Congress upholding President Lula's vetoes. The country needs efficient, technical, transparent, and participatory environmental licensing - one that reconciles development with environmental protection and meets the urgent climate and social challenges of our era.",https://wwfbrnew.awsassets.panda.org/img/_ww1286427_1_127647.jpg,N,,2025-08-11 19:01:02.753121

The lawsuit, filed in the U.S. District Court Western District of Washington, takes aim at the U.S. Department of Commerce and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.

Last year, NOAA promised to award Washington’s State Board for Community and Technical Colleges about $9.3 million for the education of more than 2,100 postsecondary students in wildlife biology, environmental science and climate-focused degrees, Brown’s office said in a release. The administration also promised about $114,000 to Washington’s Department of Ecology for a coastal resilience program.

But in May, NOAA officials withheld money for both programs, the release said.

The first program would have funneled these students directly into jobs to help some of the state’s most economically depressed regions and those at the highest risk of suffering the worst effects of climate change, the release said. The second would have contributed to work guarding the state’s coastline against flooding, erosion and other hazards of extreme weather and sea-level rise.

Brown’s office alleges in its lawsuit that the Trump administration arbitrarily and capriciously cut the funding, which had been mandated by Congress. The complaint asks the federal judge to reverse the cuts.

The overwhelming consensus on climate science has long been in Trump’s sights. He’s canceling subsidies for wind and solar energy, imposing new restrictions for renewables, slashing data-gathering and forecasting efforts and cutting billions in funding designed to help communities guard against and recover from disasters fueled by climate change. At the same time, the president supported and Congress granted billions in subsidies to the fossil fuel industry.

Brown has sued the Trump administration more than a dozen times so far this year, accusing the president of lawless behavior and taking over the mantle from Gov. Bob Ferguson, who previously served as attorney general and who also repeatedly sued the Trump administration.

Lawsuits filed range from trying to reverse Trump’s decisions to block Planned Parenthood and disaster mitigation funding, to sharing data with immigration enforcement and attempting to change federal elections.

Brown’s team has won some preliminary victories in court, though many arguments are sure to span much deeper into Trump’s second term.",https://images.seattletimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/08112025_brown_suit_tzr_095143.jpg?d=1200x630,N,,2025-08-11 15:04:44.464616

State of play: Newsom’s effort comes as the state legislature scrambles to hash out policy that could help keep the Phillips 66 refinery in Los Angeles and Valero’s refinery in the Bay Area open. The companies announced plans to shutter those facilities, which account for nearly 20% of the state’s capacity to refine gasoline, after lawmakers passed special session bills that gave state officials the power to cap refiner profit margins and require minimum fuel reserves to prevent shortages. The draft bill has sparked pushback from environmental justice groups, who’ve framed it as a handout to oil companies that would endanger public health.

Why it matters: Newsom’s shift is emblematic of a national Democratic party course correction on cost-of-living issues in the wake of the 2024 election, when President Donald Trump and Republicans notched wins on a message of affordability. It also spotlights the fact that state officials haven’t developed transition plans to keep gas prices in check and support nearby communities after refinery closures.

As widely expected, OBBBA is far from beautiful for various industries within the solar and wind energy sectors. However, the solar sector has continued to defy bearish expectations one month after OBBBA was passed, thanks in large part to robust U.S. and global solar demand as well as specific provisions within the OBBBA that favor solar manufacturing in the United States. The solar sector’s favorite benchmark, Invesco Solar ETF (NYSEARCA:TAN), has outperformed its oil and gas peers, returning 10.9% in the year-to-date compared by -0.7% return by the oil and gas benchmark, the Energy Select Sector SPDR Fund (NYSEARCA:XLE), and 8.6% gain by the S&P 500.

OBBBA favors solar manufacturing through provisions that incentivize domestic production and streamline the tax credit process, while also setting deadlines for construction and placement in service of solar projects. Specifically, it maintains and clarifies the tax credits for solar projects under Sections 48E and 45Y, while also phasing them out for wind and solar projects placed in service after December 31, 2027, unless construction began within 12 months of the Act's enactment.

First Solar (NASDAQ:FSLR) is one of the companies heavily favored by OBBBA. UBS recently reiterated its Buy rating and hiked its price target on FSLR to $275 from $255, good for nearly 50% upside, saying the company will receive a significant boost to the bottomline from OBBBA credits. According to UBS, the present value of 45X tax credits for the company is worth $75 per share, while the company is expected to grow net cash to $25 per share by the second quarter of 2026. UBS says its PT is conservative, pointing out that it did not factor in extra earnings when First Solar’s finishing factory comes online. First Solar's 3.5 GW per year manufacturing facility in Louisiana is expected to be commissioned in the second half of 2025. This facility is part of First Solar's broader strategy to scale its American manufacturing footprint to over 10 gigawatts (GW) by 2025, according to Made in Alabama. The Louisiana factory, along with a new facility in Alabama, are key components of this expansion.

FSLR shares have been on a tear over the past week after the company posted Q2 earnings that exceeded Wall Street estimates, driven by surging solar module sales to third parties. According to First Solar’s CEO Mark Widmar, the company is more favored by OBBBA than it was by Biden’s IRA credits.

Israel-based SolarEdge (NASDAQ:SEDG) beat top- and bottom-line estimates on Thursday, with revenue of $289.4M (+9.0% Y/Y) beating by $14.91M while non-GAAP EPS of -$0.81 beat by $0.03. The company shipped 247 MWh of batteries for solar applications and 1,194 MW of inverters during the quarter. SolarEdge issued upbeat guidance, saying it expects revenues in the range of $315 million to $355 million, well above the Wall Street consensus at $304.33M; Non-GAAP gross margin of 15% to 19%, including ~2% in tariff impact while Non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to come in at $85 million to $90 million. Regarding regulatory changes under OBBBA, SolarEdge CEO Shuki Nir said the company’s multi-year strategy of onshoring manufacturing to the U.S. will help it preserve 45X advanced manufacturing credits over the next 7 years.

Meanwhile, some residential solar companies are also defying bearish projections. California-based residential solar company Sunrun (NASDAQ:RUN) surged nearly 30% on Thursday after posting strong second quarter earnings driven by robust cost efficiencies as well as a record 70% storage attachment rate. Sunrun installed a record 392 MWh of storage capacity during the quarter, good for a 48% Y/Y increase while solar capacity installations clocked in at 227 MW, up 18% Y/Y. Meanwhile, subscriber additions grew 15%, bringing the company’s total subscribers to 941,701 as of June 30.

For the full year, Sunrun has projected aggregate subscriber value growth of 14% to $5.7B-$6 and upped its guidance for contracted net value creation to $1B-$1.3B from $650M-$850M.

""Our actions to drive cost efficiencies and value optimization resulted in the strongest Upfront Net Subscriber Value the company has ever reported, expanding our margins by seventeen percentage points compared to the prior year,"" CFO Danny Abajian said.

Susquehanna maintained its Positive rating on RUN and raised its price target to $13 from $12, noting that the company is well positioned to capitalize on the ongoing shift towards third-party ownership offerings, a market where it commands a 33% share. The Wall Street analysts expect Sunrun to grow installation volumes despite the looming phase out of residential clean energy tax credits. Residential solar companies are expected to be negatively impacted by the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA). Specifically, the elimination of the Section 25D tax credit for residential solar systems after 2025 will significantly reduce the affordability of solar for homeowners, potentially leading to a slowdown in near-term growth.

Last time it got any serious traction in Washington, D.C., former U.S. Sen. Joe Machin was leading the charge on the Energy Permitting Reform Act. Now, U.S. Sen. Shelley Moore Capito, R-W.Va., is bringing lawmakers’ attention back to the matter in the hope that something will be on the president’s desk by the end of the year.

She’s working with Senate Environment and Public Works Committee ranking Democratic member Sheldon Whitehouse, D-R.I. (She is chairwoman of that committee). This is a bipartisan press.

“It’s not just new pipelines or natural gas. It’s solar, it’s wind, it’s broadband, it’s housing development, it’s transportation projects,” Capito said. “I think what we’re seeing here is a convergence of clean energy folks and people like me who are all-of-the-above meeting together with an urgency, and I think that’s why I think we have a better shot at this year than we’ve had over the last few years.”

In other words, this is a wide-ranging effort that streamlines a process that now genuinely impedes progress. It has support from both sides of the aisle and makes sense. And, as Capito points out, “that would be great for West Virginia.”

U.S. power consumption is expected to hit new record highs this year and next. The bottom line? Unleashing innovation, diversifying energy supply, and a power consumption boom driven by new technologies like AI are needed now—there is no time for delay. By investing in workforce development, expanding infrastructure, and equipping professionals with the right tools and training, we can drive progress toward a secure energy future.

The Role of Renewables

The surge in electrification is redefining how power is generated, distributed, and consumed. A recent survey of solar OEMs, technicians, and installers found that 63% believe solar will be the primary driver of their nation’s energy transition. Solar, when combined with battery storage, can provide resiliency and energy independence with its ability to operate independently during outages. It can also combat rising electricity rates, given that batteries can store excess energy produced to use at a later time, reducing reliance on grid electricity purchases.

A diverse set of energy technologies can also mitigate intermittency by allowing the grid to tap into the strengths of each. For example, when solar power production is low, wind power can compensate, further enhancing grid resilience by increasing the grid's ability to withstand, respond to, and recover from disruptions.

We have seen the impact and success of strong renewable energy legislation and policy. For example, the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), passed in 2022, has played a transformative role in creating a robust and resilient energy system. The $4.5 billion the IRA has allocated to date for efficiency and electrification rebates, and the expansion of manufacturing, installation, and the production of clean energy technologies like solar and energy storage, has created over 100,000 clean energy jobs across 40+ states.

While there are ongoing legislative efforts that would significantly reduce the IRA’s renewable energy tax credits, the success the IRA has already had is clear. Regardless of the future of the IRA, the private sector can and should continue the practices it encouraged. Our continued commitment to clean energy will be needed to strengthen the grid, build the workforce, and keep the U.S. competitive in the global economy.

Energy Security Depends on a Robust Workforce

The U.S. will need to develop a robust workforce to build and maintain the energy infrastructure of tomorrow. The current workforce is not equipped to meet this challenge. A recent report found that 55% of companies surveyed outsource the majority of their maintenance needs due to insufficient in-house expertise. Without strategic and coordinated investments in training programs, this skills gap could become a critical bottleneck and significantly hinder the clean energy transition.

This situation is reminiscent of the internet boom in the mid-2000s when the demand for software engineers skyrocketed. Companies responded by investing heavily in training initiatives, mentorships, and apprenticeship programs. Investing in workforce development means creating in-depth upskilling initiatives such as apprenticeships, trade programs, and advanced certifications focused on emerging technologies like solar energy, battery storage, and electric vehicles. These programs should focus not only on building technical expertise but also on equipping workers with the foundational knowledge needed to thrive in this rapidly evolving sector.

Empowering workers through comprehensive training will be critical for advancing the electrified economy. These skilled professionals will play a pivotal role in developing and maintaining the infrastructure necessary to foster long-term energy security and drive domestic job growth.

The Path Forward

The electrification of the world represents an opportunity to redefine our energy systems and protect U.S. energy security. To fully realize the benefits of clean energy, we must encourage investment, workforce development, and infrastructure expansion.

Policymakers, industry leaders, and communities must work together to ensure that electrification efforts continue to be prioritized. With strategic investments in people, tools, and systems we can build a cleaner, more resilient energy future that benefits generations to come.

It is the company’s second EV battery production site in the region, following the Nevada Factory, which has been operating since 2017 with the current annual capacity of approximately 41 GWh.

For supply chain and logistics professionals, Panasonic’s investment signals a critical shift toward reshoring and localizing supply chains for EV components. Producing batteries closer to automotive manufacturing hubs helps reduce lead times, lowers transportation costs, and lessens vulnerability to international disruptions—a growing concern in today’s global logistics environment.

Key Takeaways:

Increased Domestic Capacity: The new plant will boost U.S. battery production, reducing reliance on foreign suppliers and improving supply chain resilience.

Localized Supply Chains: Bringing battery manufacturing closer to OEMs allows for more streamlined logistics, faster delivery, and reduced freight costs.

Growing Demand for Specialized Logistics: Handling lithium-ion batteries requires specialized warehousing, transportation, and compliance with safety regulations—areas that logistics providers must prepare to support.

Strategic Regional Impact: The DeSoto facility positions the Kansas City area as a critical node in the EV supply chain, attracting related suppliers and creating new business opportunities in transportation and distribution. The project is the largest economic development project in Kansas state history.

“The opening of our Kansas Factory marks a major milestone in our journey to scale advanced battery production in the United States,” said Kazuo Tadanobu, CEO of Panasonic Energy at the facility opening last month.",https://www.inboundlogistics.com/wp-content/uploads/Screenshot-2025-08-11-at-1.43.39-PM-1024x546.png,N,,2025-08-11 15:04:31.430163

The company unveiled its new ""universal EV platform"" at a Monday event, with Ford CEO Jim Farley calling it ""the most radical change on how we design and how we build vehicles at Ford since the Model T,"" which Ford introduced in 1908.

According to Ford, the new assembly line will be structured more like an ""assembly tree,"" with three different lines that converge into one, rather than a single assembly belt.

""This way of building a vehicle, we're confident, is the first time anyone's done this anywhere in the world,"" said Doug Field, Ford's EV chief of digital and design, at Monday's event.

The company said the design will lead to a quicker, smoother assembly process and improve ergonomics for employees through a less obstructive layout.

Ford's first EV from the new system

The first product of this new production system will be a four-door midsize truck, which will debut in 2027. Farley said on Monday that the new vehicle will accommodate five people and feature a ""frunk"" — a front storage compartment — as well as a pickup truck bed.

The vehicle will start at $30,000. By comparison, the average price for a new electric vehicle in July was about $56,000, according to Kelley Blue Book

Field touted the new vehicle's charging capabilities, referring to the truck as a ""mobile power plant.""

""Outlets in the back can give you high power and let you plug in anything from tools to a refrigerator, and it can provide backup power for your home,"" he said.

The midsize electric truck could be produced up to 40% faster than other vehicles at the Louisville Assembly Plant due to the new process, Ford said.

In another effort to lower costs, the auto company is also reducing the number of components that go into each car. Vehicles produced on the ""universal EV platform"" will have 20% fewer parts than a traditional vehicle, Ford said.

Ford said the new design will lower costs while making production faster and less difficult for workers on the line.","Ford plans to invest billions in new electric vehicle production, calling it the company’s “next Model T moment.”

Ford said Monday it will invest $5 billion into a new assembly line and battery production to build EVs, including for a new, unnamed model that Ford says will be the most affordable electric pickup truck on the market. Ford said this announcement will add or “secure” 4,000 US jobs.

“We took inspiration from the Model T – the universal car that changed the world,” Doug Field, Ford’s chief EV digital and design officer, said Monday. “We think today will be a turning point for Ford Motor Company and the auto industry.”

Ford says about $2 billion of the investment will secure 2,200 hourly jobs at its Louisville assembly plant to build the company’s next generation of electric vehicles. However, Ford said the conversion at the plant from gas powered SUVs to electric vehicle will require about 600 fewer jobs than it currently needs, at least partly because the new assembly line will be more efficient. Ford may also produce fewer cars.

When asked about the job loss on CNBC Monday, Ford CEO Jim Farley suggested that some workers could be moved to the Kentucky Truck plant, Ford’s largest factory that is also in Louisville. He also said Ford would be adding additional EV models to the Louisville Assembly plant.

“So the 2,200 (jobs) is just the beginning,” he said. “By the way, we’re adding 1,700 new jobs up in Michigan that don’t exist today. The 600 people here will have plenty to do.”

The other jobs and investment will be directed to that Michigan battery plant, whose investment has actually been in the works since 2023.

Ford is the latest company to announce a large investment in US operations as it faces steep tariffs on imports and demands by the Trump administration to shift manufacturing back to the United States. Ford already builds more cars in America than any automaker. But the company said Monday it does not plan to shift production of one of its electric models, the Ford Mustang Mach-E, from a plant in Cuautitlan, Mexico.

Ford’s announcement also introduced a new battery design, which will be smaller and lighter than its previous versions. The new battery will allow the company to price a new EV pickup at $30,000, making it one of the most affordable available. By comparison, the Ford F-150 Lightning pickup has a starting price of about $55,000. The new line will be up and running in 2027, the company said Monday.

But the Trump administration has cut federal government support for electric vehicles by doing away with tax credits to help buyers, as well as rolling back emissions regulations put in place by the Biden administration.

And Ford is currently losing money on its EVs. While its EV revenue nearly tripled in the first half of this year compared to a year ago, it still lost $2.2 billion in the EV segment during the same time period.

Ford said the most significant change will be a different design for its assembly line, which has basically been in a straight line since its founder Henry Ford started the first auto assembly line in 1913.

The automaker said its new assembly line will be a tree layout rather than a straight line, with several lines feeding vehicle parts into one another. Ford said the new design will lower costs while making production faster and less difficult for workers on the line.

This isn’t a quest for cleaner energy; it’s a government-orchestrated wealth transfer disguised as progress.
The focus on job creation glosses over a harsh reality: traditional energy generation projects are designed to create energy, not jobs.
In contrast to traditional energy projects, renewable energy projects have never been about energy, they have been about buying jobs – and that is the disconnect.
Maine’s energy policy should focus on affordable, reliable and secure power sources, not just those favored by labor groups.","By now, you’ve seen the Axios report that shows Maine’s electricity costs increasing by 36.3% over the last year, in sharp contrast to the national average of 6.5%. We all know it doesn’t have to be this way, but have you considered another significant cost driver that is rarely discussed: project labor agreements (PLAs) or harmony agreements, that are embedded in Maine’s energy policy? Several independent studies from housing, to energy, to construction show that these PLAs increase project costs up to 30%.

Maine Democrats push for wind and solar energy is often pitched as a win for both the environment and the economy. But let’s be honest: the rhetoric from labor groups and their majority party allies isn’t about delivering reliable, affordable power—it’s about a green jobs programs paid for by ratepayers and taxpayers. These jobs aren’t created. They are bought with the hard earned fruits of your labor. This isn’t a quest for cleaner energy; it’s a government-orchestrated wealth transfer disguised as progress.

Labor groups tied to project labor agreements (PLAs) for renewable projects in Maine are upfront about their priorities. They celebrate in the press and in the State House about the homes bought, vacations taken, and economic gains their members enjoy—not from market-driven innovation, but from mandated contracts that guarantee union labor for wind and solar projects. These agreements inflate costs, forcing ratepayers to shoulder the burden of inefficient, expensive energy. One former Maine Democrat representative – turned union thug – even claimed, “Capitalism is a race to the bottom,” as if market competition, which drives efficiency and affordability, is the problem. Instead, they champion a system where government picks winners, and consumers pay the price.

This mindset echoes a famous story about economist Milton Friedman. Visiting a canal-building site in a foreign country, Friedman was shocked to see workers using shovels instead of modern machinery. When told it was a “job creation program,” he quipped, “If you want to create jobs, give them spoons, not shovels.” The lesson? Prioritizing gross job creation over efficiency is economic folly. In Maine, we’re not just using shovels—we’re practically handing out spoons to build a “green economy” while ignoring the real cost to ratepayers and the broader economy.

The focus on job creation glosses over a harsh reality: traditional energy generation projects are designed to create energy, not jobs. These projects are labor-light by design. As climate economist Richard Tol explains, if the energy sector employs more and more people, retail energy prices skyrocket.

Higher energy costs ripple across every sector, stifling growth and eliminating jobs elsewhere. Maine’s non-energy economy—small businesses, manufacturing, tourism—employs far more people than wind or solar ever will. A small uptick in energy sector jobs comes at the expense of far greater job losses due to higher electricity bills. It’s basic economics: expensive energy means less growth, not more.

Maine’s renewable energy push hits ratepayers hard with soaring costs. In contrast to traditional energy projects, renewable energy projects have never been about energy, they have been about buying jobs – and that is the disconnect. Wind and solar projects demand significant labor for operations and maintenance, especially as equipment ages—a deliberate design to secure jobs for a few, often unionized, workers.

Professor Gordon Hughes of Edinburgh University argues these jobs are a cost, not a benefit, requiring hefty subsidies that strain the economy. Maine, already saddled with some of the nation’s highest electricity rates, faces even higher bills for unreliable energy. Wind and solar often generate power when it’s least needed, forcing reliance on dependable backup sources like natural gas, nuclear or hydroelectricity. Ratepayers are stuck paying for both intermittent renewables and the base-load systems that actually keep the lights on. Add to that the cost of new transmission lines to carry this inefficient energy and unaccounted decommissioning expenses for outdated equipment.

Are you ready to bankroll a “green economy” that prioritizes a few jobs over affordable, reliable energy for all Mainers?

The obsession with “green jobs” reveals a deeper issue: the goal isn’t decarbonization; it’s a government-led Ponzi-scheme. Maine’s policymakers, backed by labor and special interest groups, are picking winners—wind and solar—while sidelining alternatives like nuclear or market-driven innovations that could deliver cleaner energy more affordably. This isn’t about reducing carbon; it’s about funneling money to politically favored groups under the guise of environmentalism. If carbon reduction were the real priority, we’d let markets find the most efficient solutions, not mandate labor-heavy projects that enrich a few at the expense of everyone else.

As a conservative lawmaker, I trust markets, not government handouts. Economic growth comes from competition and innovation, not from forcing ratepayers to subsidize jobs. Maine’s energy policy should focus on affordable, reliable and secure power sources, not just those favored by labor groups. The green economy, as it’s being pitched, isn’t a path to prosperity—it’s a race to the bottom for everyone except those cashing the checks. Let’s stop digging with spoons and build an energy system that works for all Mainers.",https://www.themainewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/The-Great-Green-Heist-1024x576.png,N,,2025-08-11 14:03:21.518042

Interior Secretary Doug Burgum ordered a review of permits that allow wind companies to incidentally harm eagles and suggested possible criminal prosecutions.

At the same time, the administration has rolled back parts of the Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act, the Endangered Species Act, and the Migratory Bird Treaty Act, often benefiting fossil fuel producers.

Federal data shows wind power kills far fewer birds than oil pits, power lines, buildings, or domestic cats, and scientists warn climate change poses the greater long-term threat to birds.

Key quote:

“All of the concern for eagles is concentrated solely on wind right now.”

— Sarah Krakoff, professor of environmental law, University of Colorado, Boulder

Why this matters:

Bald eagles are one of the most visible symbols of American wildlife, and their rebound from near extinction is often cited as a major conservation success. But their survival remains tied to environmental safeguards that limit industrial impacts, from toxic lead to habitat destruction. Energy policy decisions that selectively enforce wildlife protections can skew public perception about the real sources of harm and shift the regulatory burden away from larger threats. If political battles over energy sources obscure scientific evidence, wildlife protections risk becoming tools of partisan agendas rather than consistent safeguards for species survival.

In short:

Wesley Ingwersen’s U.S. Environmentally-Extended Input-Output, or USEEIO, model — a top federal dataset used by companies to calculate supply chain emissions — will remain public but will no longer be updated by the EPA.

Ingwersen, suspended for joining an open letter accusing the administration of undermining EPA’s mission, is leaving for Stanford University, where a consortium will keep the database free and updated.

Critics warn that moving such research to the private sector could reduce credibility, while some companies rely on the data to comply with upcoming European Union and California reporting rules.

Key quote:

“Moving data to the private sector with private motivations such as profit, power, market share or competitive advantage makes the data less trustworthy and therefore less valuable.”

— Paul Anastas, former EPA assistant administrator for research and development

Why this matters:

Reliable greenhouse gas emissions data underpins corporate climate reporting, environmental regulation, and public understanding of the carbon footprint of goods and services. When such information is left to private stewardship, transparency can be harder to guarantee and trust can erode — especially when profit or competitive advantage enters the equation. Losing government-backed updates could create gaps in how accurately companies measure and reduce pollution, particularly as jurisdictions like California and the European Union expand mandatory reporting.

In short:

Gov. Josh Stein urged DHS Secretary Kristi L. Noem to release $115 million in Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) public assistance grants for about 100 projects, including debris removal, wastewater repairs, and bridge reconstruction.

FEMA has provided $1.36 billion in aid since Helene, but a new DHS policy requiring Noem’s personal approval for expenses over $100,000 has slowed disbursements, with FEMA’s monthly aid to North Carolina dropping from $40 million to $6.5 million.

Rural counties have spent millions from their own budgets, expecting rapid federal reimbursement, but now face financial strain that threatens basic services like paying first responders and maintaining waste collection.

Key quote:

“Cash-strapped local governments in western North Carolina need this money as soon as possible to keep essential services going, whether that is continuing recovery operations, paying first responders and teachers, or picking up trash.”

— Josh Stein, governor of North Carolina

Why this matters:

When disaster recovery funds are delayed, communities already reeling from storms can face a cascade of new crises. Small and rural towns often front the costs for cleanup, infrastructure repair, and emergency services, betting on timely federal reimbursement. Without it, budgets shrink, services falter, and recovery stalls — sometimes for years. Prolonged gaps in aid also deepen public mistrust in government disaster response, a problem compounded when climate change drives more frequent and severe storms. As hurricane seasons grow longer and more destructive, bottlenecks in disaster funding mean damaged roads, unsafe drinking water, and unstable housing remain part of daily life, with health, safety, and economic stability hanging in the balance.

In short:

The Trump administration ruled that orphaned well cleanup grants are not subject to the Endangered Species Act or National Historic Preservation Act, removing a step states had previously been required to take.

Legal experts question the decision’s basis, warning states could face lawsuits if federally funded projects harm endangered species without protective permits.

States with large numbers of abandoned wells, including Texas and Pennsylvania, welcomed the change, citing faster work and fewer administrative delays.

Key quote:

“Starting a reckless race to plug oil and gas wells at the expense of endangered species and historic sites only adds insult to injury. A better approach is making sure these companies pay to quickly and responsibly clean up the messes they created so Americans don’t get stuck with the bill.”

— Hollin Kretzmann, senior attorney at the Center for Biological Diversity

Why this matters:

Orphaned oil and gas wells are a major source of methane emissions, leaking a potent greenhouse gas linked to climate change. They can also contaminate groundwater and soil, posing long-term health and environmental risks to surrounding communities. Removing environmental and historic preservation reviews may allow faster plugging, but it also reduces oversight intended to protect wildlife habitats and cultural landmarks. With hundreds of thousands of wells already documented — and potentially a million more undiscovered — the scale of the cleanup effort is vast. Decisions about how to balance speed with safeguards will shape not only climate and conservation outcomes, but also the financial and legal liabilities borne by states and taxpayers.

In short:

Dominion says the Chesterfield Energy Reliability Center is essential to meet peak power demands, with energy use in Virginia projected to double by the late 2030s.

Environmental advocates argue the project violates the spirit of the Virginia Clean Economy Act and should be replaced with solar, wind, and battery storage.

DEQ’s analysis shows emissions would be lower than the coal plant it replaces, but residents say any additional pollution threatens recent air quality gains.

Key quote:

“This plant is dirty and expensive. No two ways about it. Burning methane is bad for our health.”

— Rachel James, attorney for the Southern Environmental Law Center

Why this matters:

Peaker plants, designed to run during extreme heat or cold, can be major sources of short-term but intense air pollution, releasing fine particulate matter and other contaminants linked to respiratory and cardiovascular disease. Building them in or near low-income communities and communities of color raises environmental justice concerns, as these neighborhoods often face higher baseline pollution and poorer health outcomes. While natural gas produces fewer emissions than coal, methane — the main component — has potent climate-warming effects. The debate over Chesterfield reflects a larger national tension: balancing rapidly rising electricity demand with climate goals, and deciding whether short-term reliability should be met with fossil fuels or accelerated investment in renewables and storage.

In short:

The Bureau of Land Management proposes rescinding safeguards for key Arctic habitats, opening 82% of the 23-million-acre reserve to oil and gas development.

Alaska Native leaders say the rollback disregards decades of work to protect areas critical for wildlife and subsistence, warning of worsening health and environmental damage.

Scientists cite threats to caribou migration, polar bear denning, and permafrost stability, along with long-term oil production timelines stretching into the 2050s and beyond.

Key quote:

“To have all the work we’ve done for the last two decades, trying to create important special areas with their unique biological features demonstrated by science, disregarded to allow full-force development is crazy to consider.”

— Rosemary Ahtuangaruak, activist and former mayor of Nuiqsut, Alaska

Why this matters:

The Alaskan Arctic is warming nearly four times faster than the global average, making it one of the most climate-sensitive regions on the planet. The National Petroleum Reserve–Alaska serves as a critical habitat for migratory birds, caribou, and polar bears, while also supporting subsistence traditions that sustain Indigenous communities. Expanding oil drilling here could lock in fossil fuel production for decades, increasing greenhouse gas emissions well past the period when scientists say reductions are needed to avert catastrophic climate impacts. Industrialization also threatens permafrost integrity, which, once thawed, releases vast amounts of carbon and destabilizes land and infrastructure.

In short:

The Trump administration and Congress repealed three major waivers under the Clean Air Act that allowed California to set tougher vehicle and truck emission standards than what was required under federal law.

Gov. Gavin Newsom has ordered agencies to develop new actions to promote affordable zero-emission vehicles without relying on federal approval.

Experts warn the policy shift could slow U.S. electric vehicle growth, ceding market leadership to China, and worsen air pollution in California, which has some of the nation’s worst air quality.

Key quote:

“The governor and the legislature should understand that their people need to breathe clean air, and that auto pollution is the worst contributor to the polluted air in California.”

— Dan Becker, director of the Safe Climate Transport Campaign at the Center for Biological Diversity

Why this matters:

Air pollution remains one of the most persistent environmental health threats in the United States, contributing to asthma, heart disease, lung cancer, and premature deaths. California’s geography and heavy traffic make it particularly vulnerable, trapping pollutants in valleys and urban basins. Vehicle emissions are a leading source of smog-forming chemicals and fine particles, which disproportionately harm low-income communities located near highways and freight corridors. Rolling back state-level emission standards could prolong exposure to these pollutants, increasing the public health burden and straining healthcare systems. The stakes extend beyond California, as its clean vehicle policies have historically set the pace for national standards and influenced global markets.

In short:

Dominion says the Chesterfield Energy Reliability Center is essential to meet peak power demands, with energy use in Virginia projected to double by the late 2030s.

Environmental advocates argue the project violates the spirit of the Virginia Clean Economy Act and should be replaced with solar, wind, and battery storage.

Why this matters:

Peaker plants, designed to run during extreme heat or cold, can be major sources of short-term but intense air pollution, releasing fine particulate matter and other contaminants linked to respiratory and cardiovascular disease. Building them in or near low-income communities and communities of color raises environmental justice concerns, as these neighborhoods often face higher baseline pollution and poorer health outcomes. While natural gas produces fewer emissions than coal, methane — the main component — has potent climate-warming effects.

The Charlotte-based service provider has plans to file later this month for the merger of its Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress utilities, which would levelize rates across its North Carolina territory. According to the Charlotte Business Journal, the utility’s new chief executive officer, Harry Sideris, believes that the application process will take about a year. If approved, the merger is expected to take effect in January 2027. Duke Energy calculates it would save customers $1 billion through 2038.

“We’ve had a strong start to the year, executing on our strategic priorities of advancing large-scale economic development projects, securing industry-leading regulatory and legislative outcomes, and strengthening the balance sheet,” said Sideris, also Duke Energy president. “To position the company for the significant growth ahead, we recently announced two strategic transactions – an equity investment in Duke Energy Florida and the sale of our Piedmont Tennessee business. These efficient funding sources at compelling valuations materially strengthen our credit profile and help fund the increasing investments needed to meet unprecedented growth over the next decade.”

Duke Energy recently sold a 19.7% indirect equity interest in Duke Energy Florida for an aggregate $6 billion to infrastructure investor Brookfield. Duke Energy said the investment represents a “significant premium” to its current public equity valuation. Two billion dollars of the proceeds from the transaction will fund Duke Energy’s increased $87 billion, five-year capital plan, and $4 billion will be used to displace holding company debt.

“We’re pleased to have Brookfield, a highly regarded infrastructure investor, as a long-term partner in Duke Energy Florida,” said Sideris at the time of the announcement. “This significant transaction at a compelling valuation best positions Duke Energy to unlock additional capital investments in Duke Energy Florida during this unprecedented growth period. It also materially strengthens Duke Energy’s overall credit profile, which in turn enables us to invest in our energy modernization plans across our entire footprint – all while helping keep prices as low as possible for our customers.”

In late July, Duke Energy announced the sale of its Tennessee Piedmont Natural Gas business to Spire, one of the largest publicly traded natural gas companies in the United States, for $2.48 billion. The sale agreement included nearly 3,800 miles of distribution and transmission pipelines and a liquefied natural gas facility serving approximately 205,000 customers.

That doesn’t mean Duke Energy is giving up on gas, far from it.

Yet even by nuclear energy standards, the Palisades plant was dogged by criticism in the decade before it was decommissioned.
Beyond Nuclear, a Maryland based non-profit nuclear plant safety watchdog, has referred to Palisades as a “zombie reactor”, given the unprecedented request that it be put back online.
Kevin Kamps, an expert in radioactive waste at Beyond Nuclear, told The National that Holtec has never operated a nuclear reactor.
Nick Culp, a senior manager for government affairs and communications with Holtec Palisades, dismissed Beyond Nuclear's concerns.","Increased energy demands from data centres largely caused by an artificial intelligence boom have given new life to one of the oldest decommissioned US nuclear reactors: Palisades in Covert on Lake Michigan.

The project to bring the Palisades nuclear plant back online after being decommissioned in 2022 has the support of Democratic Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer, who has insisted that it is necessary to meet a spike in energy demand along with the state's goals of reducing fossil fuel emissions.

A recent announcement from the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) also bodes well for the decommissioned reactor, now owned by Holtec International.

The NRC gave Holtec the green light to transition Palisades from its current status as decommissioned, to eventually being classified as operationally licensed.

Yet even by nuclear energy standards, the Palisades plant was dogged by criticism in the decade before it was decommissioned.

An NRC report warned about the work culture at Palisades, where safety concerns were often ignored.

In 2016, security workers at the reactor were placed on leave from the plant, then owned by Entergy, for failing to properly follow fire prevention protocols.

But AI-driven energy demands, Michigan's push for a smaller carbon footprint and Holtec purchasing the decommissioned plant led to a push in taking the reactor back online.

Holtec has received ample funding from the state and federal government to make it all possible.

Beyond Nuclear, a Maryland based non-profit nuclear plant safety watchdog, has referred to Palisades as a “zombie reactor”, given the unprecedented request that it be put back online.

Kevin Kamps, an expert in radioactive waste at Beyond Nuclear, told The National that Holtec has never operated a nuclear reactor.

“It is not intelligent, nor wise, to restart the 60-year-old reactor at Palisades,” he said.

“It was designed in the mid-1960s, built in 1967, and it was a lemon from the get-go.” This was a reference to a lawsuit from Consumers Power, which accused the construction company that built Palisades of flawed design and construction.

Mr Kamps, who lives in West Michigan where Palisades is located, also said that recent developments with more energy-efficient AI offerings, such as DeepSeek in China, nullify the argument that nuclear energy deserves a renaissance to meet a growing energy need.

“Renewables, combined with storage and efficiency, could power AI data centres,” he said.

“Restarting Palisades is an unnecessary risk from both cost and time perspectives, but also an unnecessary risk to health, safety, security and the environment.”

He also pointed out that Arnold Gundersen, a former nuclear engineer-turned-vocal critic of the industry, has cautioned that given its age, Palisades might be susceptible to something called neutron embrittlement, making it more of a safety risk.

Beyond Nuclear has also accused Holtec of trying to push for “plaster fixes” of various tubes within the plant by using a process called “sleeving”, instead of replacing tubes and other equipment.

Nick Culp, a senior manager for government affairs and communications with Holtec Palisades, dismissed Beyond Nuclear's concerns.

“The plant remains on track and on budget for a safe restart, supported by extensive inspections, testing, preventive maintenance, repairs, and upgrades,” he told The National, also pointing to Palisades's operational evaluation just before it shutting down in 2022.

“Palisades operated in the NRC’s highest safety category and completed multiple record-setting production runs, which is a testament to the plant’s strong material condition and the professionalism of the team.”

As to the allegations of sleeving for repairs, Mr Culp said that Holtec was using an “industry-proven repair method” in line with its preventive maintenance strategy.

“Each sleeved tube is subject to thorough testing and inspection before return to service,” he said.

Despite the controversy surrounding Palisades, Mr Culp said that Palisades is still on track for what he described as a “safe restart”.

If all goes according to plan and if the NRC continues to grant approval amid regulatory requirements, Palisades could be restarted by the end of this year.

Holtec indicated that means less of a burden on the energy grid, along with thousands of jobs contributing to the West Michigan economy.

It would be premature, however, for Holtec to take a victory lap on Palisades.

Beyond Nuclear has filed a challenge to Holtec through the NRC, which Mr Kamps said revolves around the company's “request to repair, not replace, the degraded steam generators” inside Palisades.

He also said Beyond Nuclear also wants to litigate the matter in federal court.

“This could happen sooner rather than later,” he told The National.

The NRC, however, is currently reviewing a license amendment request on the repair methodology proposed by Holtec.

""The agency’s top specialist inspectors have been observing and assessing the plant’s steam generator activities real-time,"" read a statement from the NRC.

""The plant will not be able to progress in its startup sequence past the operational need for the steam generators until they are fully repaired and fully operational.""

Meanwhile, the spike in electricity consumption due to the proliferation of AI has led energy providers to warn of a looming energy crunch.

How Michigan chooses to deal with that crunch, along with regulators making decisions about nuclear reactors, could prove to be pivotal for many parts of the US.

All eyes now turn to the NRC.

In a statement to The National, the nuclear regulatory body acknowledged the ""high interest"" from the general public surrounding the potential restart of the Palisades reactor.

""To that end, we created a special web page dedicated to the potential restart of Palisades so that members of the public can easily find all publicly available documents, submittals, correspondence, inspection reports and other materials related to the potential restart,"" a statement read in part.

Viktoria Mitlyng, the NRC's public affairs officer for the regulatory region overseeing Palisades, said that the NRC has made it a priority to ensure that Palisades will have to meet all the regulatory commission's ""requirements for a safe operation of a nuclear reactor before Palisades can resume operation.""

As for Beyond Nuclear's allegations that Holtec lacked the experience to operate a nuclear reactor, the NRC pointed to its ""technical and financial"" review conducted before transferring operational authority of the plant.

""After a thorough review of the license transfer application, the NRC concluded that Palisades Energy LLC has the technical expertise and financial mechanisms to operate Palisades,"" a statement from the regulatory commission read.",https://www.thenationalnews.com/resizer/v2/FK3LYA2CPNARTGXSLGLBPWWNWE.jpg?smart=true&auth=c6a8e9df6f926fa58a462830f8aeda1be9e447bd917342e8f6714d60a86cd072&width=1200&height=630,N,,2025-08-11 17:04:55.051942

The moment has finally come for Ford enthusiasts to learn what the fuss over the company’s secret, not-so-secret “skunkworks” affordable EV project was all about. This morning, Ford higher-ups gathered at the sprawling Louisville Assembly Plant in Kentucky to celebrate the launch of a new, all-electric “Model T Moment” for the legacy automaker, while also going head-to-head against Tesla and blowing a hearty raspberry against the foes of the vehicle electrification movement.

Ford Launches The Affordable EV Of The Future

Much ink has been spilled over the premature demise of the federal EV tax credit. However, with the cost of EV batteries continuing to drop like a rock, Ford is among the many automotive stakeholders to plan ahead for the electric mobility scenario of the future, tax credits or not.

Ford announced plans to produce an affordable EV back in 2022, walling off a separate “skunkworks” staff in California to focus exclusively on the project. Described as a revolutionary change of pace on the level of the game-changing Model T of the 20th century, the plan has consolidated around three key cost-cutting pathways. It involves deploying low cost LFP (lithium iron phosphate) batteries, a “tree” assembly process instead of a singular assembly line, and a universal platform that can serve for pickup trucks and vans as well as SUVs and passenger cars.

The first model out of the box will be a mid-sized pickup truck available beginning in 2027, with a target price of $30,000 or thereabouts. Beyond that, Ford is playing its cards close to the vest.

“Additional specifications for the midsize electric truck – including reveal date, starting price, EPA-estimated battery range, battery sizes and charge times – will be communicated later,” Ford explained in a press release.

Where Is This Affordable EV Of Which You Speak?

Of course, no story about affordable EVs is complete without a mention of Tesla, especially so because Ford has introduced the idea that the value of a brand new Ford EV beats a used Model Y any day of the week. Tesla has pledged to produce an affordable EV ever since it received an Energy Department loan of $465 million back in 2009. As described by the Energy Department, the loan did not stipulate that Tesla must produce an inexpensive vehicle on par with low-priced internal combustion engine vehicles, it simply asked the startup to turn its focus from pricey electric sports cars to produce full sized cars that would attract a larger segment of the car buying public.

Tesla initially came through on that promise in spades and then some. Though still somewhat pricey, Tesla EVs still top the charts of EV sales in the US by a wide margin. However, for various reasons (particularly this one, as well as these ones), the bloom has come off the brand reputation rose. Tesla sales are spiraling down and it has yet to tap into the more affordable EV market.

Meanwhile, Ford is banking on its newly launched “Ford Universal EV Platform” to fill the gap.

“Lower cost of ownership over five years than a three-year-old used Tesla Model Y,” Ford proclaimed in a press release this morning.

I’m reaching out to Ford for more details on how they calculated that. In the meantime, they draw attention to the cost savings issuing from the new Universal Platform, including the use of large aluminum unicastings that replace dozens of smaller parts. “The platform reduces parts by 20% versus a typical vehicle, with 25% fewer fasteners, 40% fewer workstations dock-to-dock in the plant and 15% faster assembly time,” Ford explains.

“Take for instance the wiring harness in the new midsize truck; it will be more than 4,000 feet (1.3 kilometers) shorter and 10 kilograms lighter than the one used in our first-gen electric SUV,” they add.

LFP batteries round out the cost savings by performing a key structural task in addition to power supply. “The platform’s cobalt-free and nickel-free LFP battery pack is a structural sub-assembly that also serves as the vehicle’s floor,” Ford notes.

An Affordable EV With More Fun & More Function

While Ford is aiming to cut ownership costs below the Model Y goalpost, the company is also promoting EVs as simply better in all respects than the equivalent ICE vehicle, including performance, as well as all that stuff about saving the planet and what-not.

Ford notes that the structural LFP battery enables “a surprising amount” of interior space. The company anticipates that the forthcoming mid-sized electric pickup truck will have more passenger room than the new Toyota RAV4, with additional space in the frunk and a truck bed large enough for a surfboard among other gear.

The structural battery also providing a low center of gravity that improves handling. “Ford makes passion products – and this electric vehicle platform with a low center of gravity from the battery, instant torque from electric motors and obsessive chassis engineering will make it fun to drive,” the company reminds everyone.

“The midsize truck will have a targeted 0- 60 time as fast as a Mustang EcoBoost, with more downforce,” they add.

The Affordable EV Of The Future: Follow The Money

As for transferring the vision of a more affordable EV into an actual EV in today’s tumultuous environment of tariffs and trade wars, that’s easier said than done. As of now, though, Ford anticipates that the Universal platform will churn out enough EVs to satisfy the domestic market and leave some over for export, too.

The company is putting its money where its mouth is. Despite the unfavorable direction that federal electrification policy has taken this year, Ford plans to invest a total of $5 billion, more or less, in the Louisville facility and its BlueOval Battery Park in Michigan.

If that seems mighty ambitious, it is, and much depends on the new platform. The “tree” assembly process is a three-part strategy that separates the front and rear assemblies from each other and from the structural battery. As a key structural element, the battery can be equipped with seats, consoles, and carpeting before the front and rear are attached.

The tree assembly strategy also involves combining parts and tools. “Parts travel down the assembly tree to operators in a kit. Within that kit, all fasteners, scanners and power tools required for the job are included – and in the correct orientation for use,” Ford explains.

The company also expects to realize some worker wellness benefits from the Universal platform. By sending tools at an easily reachable height, the platform “dramatically improves ergonomics for employees by reducing twisting, reaching and bending.”

Hold on to your hats. The pickup truck is just for starters. In addition to a family of passenger cars, Ford is also eyeing the fleet electrification movement with a forthcoming van to be produced on the Universal platform.

Why it matters: The effort includes a complete rethinking of how vehicles are assembled — essentially throwing out the traditional assembly line Henry Ford invented — in order to overcome China's low-cost labor.

""We took a radical approach to a very hard challenge: Create affordable vehicles that delight customers in every way that matters – design, innovation, flexibility, space, driving pleasure, and cost of ownership – and do it with American workers,"" Ford president and CEO Jim Farley said at an event in Kentucky on Monday.

""We have all lived through far too many 'good college tries' by Detroit automakers to make affordable vehicles that ends up with idled plants, layoffs and uncertainty. So, this had to be a strong, sustainable and profitable business,"" Farley said.

""We tore up the moving assembly line concept and designed a better one.""

Between the lines: The first product, on sale in 2027, will be a midsize four-door electric pickup starting around $30,000.

Ford is investing at its Louisville Assembly Plant in Kentucky to prepare for the breakthrough manufacturing process.

The vehicle — and future derivatives on the same platform — will be assembled in three large castings on separate lines, which will then united in final assembly.

The new process will be dramatically faster and cheaper, and far less taxing on employees, officials said.

By the numbers: The EV platform will have 20% fewer parts than a typical vehicle, with 40% fewer fasteners.

The number of employee work stations is reduced by 40%, while assembly time, measured in hours per vehicle, will be 40% shorter, too.

Yes, but: New efficiencies mean fewer jobs. Ford said it is ""securing"" 2,200 jobs at Louisville, which currently employs 2,800 to build gas-powered Ford Escape and Lincoln Corsair SUVs.

600 workers will be offered buyouts or move to other plants, including Ford's nearby Kentucky Truck plant.

The court affirmed that the reporting exemption under the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act (EPCRA), issued by the Environmental Protection Agency in June 2019, is appropriate because of the relationship between the reporting mandates under EPCRA and the Comprehensive Emergency Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA), also known as the federal Superfund law.

This decision comes more than 20 years after the U.S. Poultry & Egg Association (USPOULTRY), the National Turkey Federation and the National Chicken Council formally requested that EPA exempt poultry farms from the requirement to report the emission of ammonia under CERCLA and EPCRA.

The request emphasized the principle that the CERCLA and EPCRA programs were never meant to cover the release of naturally occurring substances into the air that originate from the breakdown of animal waste.

An overarching goal is to get data center developers to put their money where their mouth is.","HARRISBURG, Pa. (AP) — Amid rising electric bills, states are under pressure to insulate regular household and business ratepayers from the costs of feeding Big Tech’s energy-hungry data centers.

It’s not clear that any state has a solution and the actual effect of data centers on electricity bills is difficult to pin down. Some critics question whether states have the spine to take a hard line against tech behemoths like Microsoft, Google, Amazon and Meta.

But more than a dozen states have begun taking steps as data centers drive a rapid build-out of power plants and transmission lines.

That has meant pressuring the nation’s biggest power grid operator to clamp down on price increases, studying the effect of data centers on electricity bills or pushing data center owners to pay a larger share of local transmission costs.

Rising power bills are “something legislators have been hearing a lot about. It’s something we’ve been hearing a lot about. More people are speaking out at the public utility commission in the past year than I’ve ever seen before,” said Charlotte Shuff of the Oregon Citizens’ Utility Board, a consumer advocacy group. “There’s a massive outcry.”

Not the Typical Electric Customer

Some data centers could require more electricity than cities the size of Pittsburgh, Cleveland or New Orleans, and make huge factories look tiny by comparison. That’s pushing policymakers to rethink a system that, historically, has spread transmission costs among classes of consumers that are proportional to electricity use.

“A lot of this infrastructure, billions of dollars of it, is being built just for a few customers and a few facilities and these happen to be the wealthiest companies in the world,” said Ari Peskoe, who directs the Electricity Law Initiative at Harvard University. “I think some of the fundamental assumptions behind all this just kind of breaks down.”

A fix, Peskoe said, is a “can of worms” that pits ratepayer classes against one another.

Some officials downplay the role of data centers in pushing up electric bills.

Tricia Pridemore, who sits on Georgia’s Public Service Commission and is president of the National Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners, pointed to an already tightened electricity supply and increasing costs for power lines, utility poles, transformers and generators as utilities replace aging equipment or harden it against extreme weather.

The data centers needed to accommodate the artificial intelligence boom are still in the regulatory planning stages, Pridemore said, and the Data Center Coalition, which represents Big Tech firms and data center developers, has said its members are committed to paying their fair share.

But growing evidence suggests that the electricity bills of some Americans are rising to subsidize the massive energy needs of Big Tech as the U.S. competes in a race against China for artificial intelligence superiority.

Data and analytics firm Wood Mackenzie published a report in recent weeks that suggested 20 proposed or effective specialized rates for data centers in 16 states it studied aren’t nearly enough to cover the cost of a new natural gas power plant.

In other words, unless utilities negotiate higher specialized rates, other ratepayer classes — residential, commercial and industrial — are likely paying for data center power needs.

Meanwhile, Monitoring Analytics, the independent market watchdog for the mid-Atlantic grid, produced research in June showing that 70% — or $9.3 billion — of last year’s increased electricity cost was the result of data center demand.

States Are Responding

Last year, five governors led by Pennsylvania’s Josh Shapiro began pushing back against power prices set by the mid-Atlantic grid operator, PJM Interconnection, after that amount spiked nearly sevenfold. They warned of customers “paying billions more than is necessary.”

PJM has yet to propose ways to guarantee that data centers pay their freight, but Monitoring Analytics is floating the idea that data centers should be required to procure their own power.

In a filing last month, it said that would avoid a “massive wealth transfer” from average people to tech companies.

At least a dozen states are eyeing ways to make data centers pay higher local transmission costs.

In Oregon, a data center hot spot, lawmakers passed legislation in June ordering state utility regulators to develop new — presumably higher — power rates for data centers.

The Oregon Citizens’ Utility Board says there is clear evidence that costs to serve data centers are being spread across all customers — at a time when some electric bills there are up 50% over the past four years and utilities are disconnecting more people than ever.

New Jersey’s governor signed legislation last month commissioning state utility regulators to study whether ratepayers are being hit with “unreasonable rate increases” to connect data centers and to develop a specialized rate to charge data centers.

In some other states, like Texas and Utah, governors and lawmakers are trying to avoid a supply-and-demand crisis that leaves ratepayers on the hook — or in the dark.

Doubts About States Protecting Ratepayers

In Indiana, state utility regulators approved a settlement between Indiana Michigan Power Co., Amazon, Google, Microsoft and consumer advocates that set parameters for data center payments for service.

Kerwin Olsen, of the Citizens Action Council of Indiana, a consumer advocacy group, signed the settlement and called it a “pretty good deal” that contained more consumer protections than what state lawmakers passed.

But, he said, state law doesn’t force large power users like data centers to publicly reveal their electric usage, so pinning down whether they’re paying their fair share of transmission costs “will be a challenge.”

In a March report, the Environmental and Energy Law Program at Harvard University questioned the motivation of utilities and regulators to shield ratepayers from footing the cost of electricity for data centers.

Both utilities and states have incentives to attract big customers like data centers, it said.

To do it, utilities — which must get their rates approved by regulators — can offer “special deals to favored customers” like a data center and effectively shift the costs of those discounts to regular ratepayers, the authors wrote. Many state laws can shield disclosure of those rates, they said.

In Pennsylvania, an emerging data center hot spot, the state utility commission is drafting a model rate structure for utilities to consider adopting. An overarching goal is to get data center developers to put their money where their mouth is.

“We’re talking about real transmission upgrades, potentially hundreds of millions of dollars,” commission chairman Stephen DeFrank said. “And that’s what you don’t want the ratepayer to get stuck paying for.”",https://www.thewellnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Electricity_Prices_Data_Centers_25219611138875-1568x881.jpg,N,,2025-08-11 16:06:41.816562

The recently passed One Big Beautiful Bill Act represents a significant shift in U.S. energy and tax policy.

It dramatically cuts many clean energy tax incentives introduced under the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022.

Individuals and businesses must act quickly to take advantage of valuable federal tax credits that are now being phased out or scaled back years ahead of schedule.

This article outlines the key clean energy tax incentives affected by the OBBBA and what you can do to benefit before they disappear.

Clean Vehicle Tax Credits (Individuals)

Ends Sept. 30, 2025.

New Clean Vehicle Credit (Up to $7,500): This federal credit for new electric and hydrogen fuel cell vehicles was originally scheduled to run through 2032. The OBBBA now ends it on Sept. 30, 2025.

The full $7,500 credit requires vehicles to meet specific battery and mineral sourcing standards. A partial credit of $3,750 may still apply to vehicles that meet only one of those criteria.

Eligibility limits:

MSRP: $55,000 for sedans; $80,000 for SUVs, trucks, and vans

Adjusted gross income: $150,000 (single), $225,000 (head of household), $300,000 (married filing jointly)

Used Clean Vehicle Credit (Up to $4,000): A separate credit remains available for used electric or hydrogen vehicles purchased from licensed dealers. It provides up to $4,000 or 30% of the vehicle’s sale price, whichever is lower.

Requirements:

Vehicle price cap: $25,000

Vehicle must be at least two years old and not previously claimed for this credit

AGI: $75,000 (single), $112,500 (head of household), $150,000 (married filing jointly)

With the expiration approaching, consumer demand is expected to rise sharply, potentially driving up prices and limiting availability. Acting now ensures both access to vehicles and eligibility for the credit.

Home Energy Tax Credits (Individuals)

Energy Efficient Home Improvement Credit: Expires Dec. 31, 2025. This nonrefundable credit covers 30% of the cost of various home energy upgrades, up to $1,200 annually, with item-specific sub-limits.

Annual limits include:

$250 per exterior door (maximum $500 total)

$600 for windows, electrical panels, and central air conditioning

$150 for home energy audits

$2,000 for heat pumps, biomass stoves, and energy-efficient water heaters

There are no income limits, and homeowners may benefit by spreading improvements across two tax years to maximize credits.

Residential Clean Energy Credit (30%): Expires Dec. 31, 2025. This credit allows individuals to claim 30% of the cost for eligible renewable energy systems, including:

Solar panels

Geothermal heat pumps

Solar water heaters

Wind turbines

Biomass fuel systems

Previously scheduled to last until 2034, this credit now ends in 2025. There is no income cap or dollar limit, making it one of the most valuable incentives for homeowners installing rooftop solar or geothermal systems.

Planning consideration: These installations often require permitting, inspections, and utility approvals. Initiating projects early in 2025 is critical to ensure eligibility.

Alternative Fuel Refueling Property Credit (Individuals and Businesses)

Expires June 30, 2026. This credit provides 30% of the cost (up to $1,000 per item) for installing clean fuel infrastructure, such as:

EV charging stations (Level 1 or 2)

Hydrogen fuel cell dispensers

On-site fuel storage systems

Important note: To qualify, equipment must be professionally installed and meet certification standards. Early planning is advised to avoid shortages and installation delays.

Business-Specific Clean Energy Credits

Commercial Clean Vehicle Credit (Up to $40,000 per vehicle): Ends Sept. 30, 2025. Businesses can claim:

Up to $7,500 for light-duty clean vehicles

Up to $40,000 for medium- or heavy-duty electric or hydrogen fuel cell vehicles

Action required: Due to production lead times and vehicle backlogs, businesses considering fleet upgrades must act now to secure orders and take delivery before the deadline.

Investment Tax Credit

Full 30% credit ends Dec. 31, 2025. The ITC allows businesses to claim a percentage of the cost for qualifying energy systems, including solar, storage, geothermal, fuel cells, and wind.

Under OBBBA:

30% credit ends after 2025

Reduced base credit (6%) begins in 2026

Phased out entirely by 2028

Bonus credits (for domestic content, energy communities, etc.) are eliminated

Production Tax Credit: Projects must begin construction by Dec. 31, 2025.

The PTC offers a per-kilowatt-hour tax credit for clean electricity generation. Eligible technologies include:

Wind

Geothermal

Biomass

Hydropower

Under OBBBA, new projects beginning construction after 2025 will no longer be eligible. Existing rules still allow a four-year window for completion if started by the end of 2025.

Section 179D Commercial Building Deduction: Reduced starting Jan. 1, 2026 and phased out after 2027.

This deduction allows up to $5.00 per square foot for energy-efficient commercial building improvements. Starting in 2026, the maximum deduction will be reduced to $1.80 per square foot, and it will sunset fully after 2027.

This incentive is especially relevant to:

Real estate developers

Design-build contractors

Architectural and engineering firms working on government or nonprofit buildings

Direct Pay and Transferability Provisions

Direct pay ends after 2025 and transferability ends: After 2026. The IRA introduced two mechanisms to increase accessibility:

Direct pay: Allows tax-exempt entities to receive credit refunds in cash

Transferability: Allows for-profit entities to sell unused tax credits

These options are being eliminated, dramatically limiting flexibility for both public sector entities and private companies.

What You Should Do Now

For individuals:

Secure an eligible EV purchase before Q4 2025

Schedule home energy upgrades and renewable installations early

Maintain documentation for purchases and installations

Consult a tax advisor to optimize credit claims across tax years

For businesses:

Accelerate clean energy projects and fleet conversions

Document project start dates for ITC/PTC eligibility

Engage tax and legal professionals to utilize transferability and direct pay before they expire

Coordinate with vendors early to avoid capacity or supply issues

Need Help Navigating the Changes?

These policy changes require fast, informed decision-making.

The automaker is investing nearly $2 billion to overhaul its 70-year-old Louisville Assembly Plant, transforming a gas-vehicle-era workhorse into the launchpad for a midsize, four-door electric pickup that the company says will start around $30,000 when it rolls out in 2027.

Paired with a $3 billion battery plant in Michigan, the two projects represent a $5 billion bet on making EVs that can compete on price, quality, and scale — without bleeding red ink. Ford said the work will create or secure almost 4,000 U.S. jobs, including about 2,200 in Louisville.

What’s coming to life is an “assembly tree,” where three sub-lines feed into one, which Ford said will shave 15% off build time and cut part counts by 20% and workstations by 40%.

The new truck will be the first built on Ford’s “Universal EV Platform,” which is designed for a family of affordable, software-enabled electric vehicles. The company says the architecture uses 20% fewer parts and 25% fewer fasteners than comparable models, trims the wiring harness by more than 4,000 feet, and incorporates lithium-iron-phosphate prismatic batteries that double as the vehicle floor. The design lowers the center of gravity for better handling and frees up more passenger space — Ford claims it’ll have more than the latest Toyota RAV4 — along with a “frunk” and a bed.

On the company’s most recent earnings call, Ford’s CEO, Jim Farley, cast the endeavor as a “Model T moment,” positioning the project as a breakthrough in bringing EVs to the mass market. The goal: deliver an EV that’s affordable, efficient, and built by American hands — and that actually makes money. The company’s EV unit, Model e, lost more than $5 billion in 2024 and another $1.3 billion in the second quarter of this year. With federal EV tax credits set to shrink, Ford needs lower costs to compete with Tesla, GM, and a growing slate of cheaper Chinese players such as BYD.

The electric truck is designed to be more affordable than Ford’s current F-150 Lightning, which has seen limited market appeal due to the higher price point that it carries. The vehicle will compete against coming electric trucks from other manufacturers such as General Motors and Rivian.

“We took inspiration from the Model T – the universal car that changed the world,” Doug Field, Ford’s chief EV, digital, and design officer, said in the press release. “We assembled a really brilliant collection of minds across Ford and unleashed them to find new solutions to old problems. We applied first‑principles engineering, pushing to the limits of physics to make it fun to drive and compete on affordability. Our new zonal electric architecture unlocks capabilities the industry has never seen. This isn’t a stripped‑down, old‑school vehicle.”

​​Ford’s strategy is in contrast with some of its competitors in the auto industry. GM has scaled back some of its electric vehicle targets, while other automakers have expressed caution about EV investments amid concerns about profitability and consumer demand. Right now, the EV market faces headwinds: high battery costs, supply chain challenges, and intense price competition. Still, Ford is betting that improvements in manufacturing efficiency and scale will eventually lead to profitability — and that it can develop EVs for mainstream consumers.

“We have all lived through far too many ‘good college tries’ by Detroit automakers to make affordable vehicles that ends up with idled plants, layoffs and uncertainty,” Farley said in a press release. “So, this had to be a strong, sustainable and profitable business. From Day 1, we knew there was no incremental path to success. … We tore up the moving assembly line concept and designed a better one. And we found a path to be the first automaker to make prismatic LFP batteries in the U.S.”

Kentucky officials are backing the project with incentives through the state’s Economic Development Finance Authority. The plant will also get a 52,000-square-foot expansion and a digital network upgrade to support more quality checks. The Louisville plant is expected to keep producing gas-powered SUVs alongside the new EVs during the transition, with full EV capacity ramping up ahead of the 2027 truck launch. If the strategy works, it could give Ford a template for converting other legacy plants — and a much-needed foothold in a segment where price, speed, and scale now decide the winners.","https://qz.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=300,quality=85,format=auto/https://assets.qz.com/media/GettyImages-2229439045.jpg",N,,2025-08-11 14:03:16.933642

Contributing Writer

(lailluminator.com) — Higher electricity bills are customary during a Louisiana summer, but 2025 has seen an especially sharp spike, reaching levels not seen since 2022.

Except for January, the average monthly cost of electricity in Louisiana has been higher every month compared with last year.

The average July bill for a Louisiana home that uses 1,000 kilowatt-hours was eight percent higher than the same month last year, according to data from the Louisiana Public Service Commission. The figures are self-reported by the utility companies under its jurisdiction.

Cleco customers are seeing some of the highest bills in the state. The company serves roughly 295,000 customers across 24 parishes. For July, it reported a 29 percent average bill increase from a year ago, going from $123 to $159. Southwestern Electric Power Cooperative, which serves about 235,000 Louisiana customers, reported a 20 percent increase, from $126 to $151, and the 1.1 million customers who get their power from Entergy Louisiana saw an average increase of 11 percent, from $129 to $143.

The last time the average sized home saw monthly bills that high was in the summer of 2022. In July of that year, a Cleco customer paid about $157, and an Entergy Louisiana customer paid roughly $159.

State regulators and utilities say the trend is linked to an increase in the price of the natural gas utilities use to run power plants. The biggest spike in spot prices of natural gas occurred in March, reaching $4.12 per million BTUs compared to $1.49 from March 2024, though that gap has shrunk steadily since then.

Entergy is allowed to pass the higher cost of natural gas down to customers, labeling it as a fuel adjustment cost on their bills.

“These are costs that Entergy Louisiana does not earn a profit on, and it is only the actual costs the company incurs which are paid by customers,” Entergy Louisiana spokesman Brandon Scardigli said.

While still higher than last year, natural gas prices have trended downward since March, signaling a reprieve might be on the horizon for customers. In June, the spot price was down to $3.02 per unit compared to $2.54 a year ago. Cooler temperatures as summer transitions into fall would help that trend, according to analysts.

SWEPCO spokeswoman Shantell Jordan said an extra fuel adjustment charge customers have been paying on will decrease this month.

Foreign demand for liquified natural gas is behind the increase in commodity prices, Louisiana State University economist David Dismukes said. LNG exports in May were 18 percent higher than a year ago, with most of it going to Europe, Japan, South Korea and Egypt.

Because of high natural gas prices, some electricity generation shifted to coal. Nationwide, power plants are using nearly five percent more coal, and coal imports for the first quarter of 2025 nearly doubled from the same period last year. Foreign coal has fallen in price, down 39 percent from a year ago, according to U.S. Energy Information Administration data. In the first quarter, the U.S. imported Colombian coal at an average price of $117 per short ton and exported domestic coal at a price of $110 per short ton. Domestic coal sold at a spot price of about $79 per short ton in July.

Fuel costs are not the only reason behind higher power bills. Dismukes said utility companies share part of the blame for failing to make infrastructure investments that could deliver electricity much more efficiently and save their customers money. Louisiana’s electrical grid has many aging transmission and distribution lines that are wasting power, and utilities have only recently begun to address the issue, he said.

“For them to sit there and say, ‘We don’t have any control over that,’ just isn’t true,” Dismukes said. “ … In Louisiana, we are behind the curve on this issue.”

Possible solutions include more affordable and cost-stable energy sources, such as utility-scale solar and onshore wind. Both are cheaper than natural gas even without government subsidies to support setting up the alternative energy sources, according to the latest yearly analysis from the financial firm Lazard.

Reconductoring – the process of replacing existing transmission lines with advanced, more efficient conductors – could save customers up to four percent on electricity prices, according to a nonpartisan GridLab study.

Rather than upgrade existing lines, utility companies have opted for more time-consuming, more expensive regular conductor lines. Building new transmission is generally more expensive than reconductoring and typically takes two to three times longer to complete, according to the study. Those costs are also passed down to customers.

Consumer advocates also note there is a disincentive for utility companies to deliver power more efficiently; it generally means they sell less electricity and see less profit.

Sustained economic growth powered by clean energy requires renewable energy that is more affordable and storage systems which can readily dispatch power to address outages.
Investments in power transmission can be more cost-effective for reducing outages and GHG emissions than investments in power generation.
With continued technological advances, the costs of battery and other storage technologies are likely to decline further in the relatively near term.
Our role as an investor in new and emerging power generation technologies, as well as in T&D infrastructure, is critical for reliable power supply on the African continent.","Reliable electricity is essential for economic progress, but it remains a challenge in sub-Saharan Africa, where 75% of firms face outages. At BII, investing in power is an important part of what we do, with 24% of our portfolio in the power sector. Fossil fuels are major contributors to global carbon emissions and climate change, which is why we invest in low-carbon alternatives. Our climate change strategy1 and 2022–26 technical strategy2 ensure that our investments align with economic development pathways consistent with net zero emissions and climate resilience.

This study, by independent evaluators from Itad and Steward Redqueen as part of the FCDO–BII Evaluations and Learning Programme, uses detailed modelling to assess how various power generation technologies support our ambitions to boost reliable power and accelerate the green transition in different country contexts. It models how adding 1 megawatt of power to the grid using different technologies affects gross domestic product (GDP) and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in six African countries.

There are several valuable insights from the research:

Investing in technology to accelerate the transition to reliable, clean power is essential. Sustained economic growth powered by clean energy requires renewable energy that is more affordable and storage systems which can readily dispatch power to address outages. The impact of battery energy storage systems for solar power at peak times in South Africa highlights the need to reduce the cost of these technologies. For us, this underlines the importance of equity and concessional finance to strengthen the supply of bankable projects and demonstrate the business case for increased investment. For example, we have backed Scatec’s development of solar and battery storage facilities in South Africa to contribute 1.1 gigawatt hours (GWh) of dispatchable power to the grid,3 and we have backed similar projects through Globeleq in Mozambique.4

Investments that diversify the energy grid are crucial for strengthening climate resilience, particularly in countries reliant on hydropower and vulnerable to climate change-related weather events such as drought. In Kenya, the study found that diversifying away from hydropower, for example through other renewable energy sources, enhances resilience in dry years.

Investments in power transmission can be more cost-effective for reducing outages and GHG emissions than investments in power generation. Investing in electricity networks is also key to diversifying energy sources and increasing the sustainability and economic efficiency of the power system. The Kenya case study found that, with large regional variations in outages, investment in transmission reduced outages and emissions more cost-efficiently than investments in generation. We invest in transmission through Gridworks,5 which provides equity finance to develop projects in transmission and distribution (T&D), and off-grid electricity across Africa, for example the Amari Power Transmission project in Uganda to improve electricity supply to industrial users.6

Investments to improve economic efficiency and reduce peak demand could offset the need for investment in generating capacity. Although not directly addressed in this study, the results suggest that investing in system efficiencies (such as digitalisation of the grid) and demand-side management (such as smart meters) can reduce demand at peak times and improve the overall economic efficiency of the power system.

As with all models and underlying datasets, there are limitations which need to be considered when interpreting the results. Critically, in addition to the limitations identified in the report, the model only considers supply-side interventions and does not adequately assess the impact of investing in T&D and regional interconnectors. Further analysis of this wider set of technological options for demand-side management and other system improvements would enhance understanding of their impact.

Similarly, the modelling does not consider key economic and financial risks, such as transition risk (the risk of long-term infrastructure assets becoming stranded as countries transition to a low-carbon economy), dependency on fossil fuel imports, and volatile fossil fuel prices. It assesses short-term reliability of the power system but not the optimal addition of generation technologies to meet growing electricity demand over time.

The analysis sometimes identifies investment in fossil fuels as the most effective investment. However, this is based on historical cost data for generation and storage technologies and does not include social benefits of technological advances in renewable power and storage systems, which have only recently started to become cost-competitive with fossil fuels as a source of dispatchable power. With continued technological advances, the costs of battery and other storage technologies are likely to decline further in the relatively near term.

In our view, when considering the broader range of risks associated with fossil fuels, potential opportunities for power systems, and the imperative to support countries transition to net zero, renewable power systems that improve reliability (including storage technologies and improved T&D systems) are the right choice. This is also consistent with our fossil fuel policy,7 whereby we only invest in lower-emitting fossil fuel technologies when the investment aligns with a country’s development pathway to net zero emissions by 2050 and contributes towards the power system’s net zero transition.

Overall, the report provides useful, practical analysis of the interactions between differing generation technology options. It highlights that more reliable power systems can increase GDP by many times the investment’s capital cost in a just a few years, suggesting that the right investments can pay off quickly from a societal perspective.

Our role as an investor in new and emerging power generation technologies, as well as in T&D infrastructure, is critical for reliable power supply on the African continent. Our ability to be involved at an early stage of project development through our equity investments sets us apart from our peers and is something we will continue to build on. We hope that the findings of this report will be useful to other investors and stakeholders considering the range of issues that are relevant to their power sector investments and financing approaches.",https://assets.bii.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/11123726/P1030683-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-08-11 14:03:56.345311

JOHANNESBURG - Under U.S. President Donald Trump's administration, climate change regulation, research and funding have been slashed, including the cash meant to help developing countries like South Africa transition from coal to cleaner energy.

But while green goals may take longer to hit, the head of the just energy transition unit in South Africa's presidency - a body overseeing the shift to clean energy - said the country is ""not backtracking on its climate commitments.""

Context spoke with Joanne Yawitch about South Africa's plans to transition to clean energy and how to finance energy access for ordinary South Africans.

Where is South Africa on its green transition road map?

November 2021 is basically where it began, but since then there's been a broadening of partners.

A few years ago we did an analysis of (our grant financing) and essentially what we realised is that very little of it was flowing directly to initiatives on the ground.

One of the things that we have done is to set up something called a funding platform launched in October 2024. It is a matchmaking facility.

We take project proposals from small and large businesses, community organisations and trade unions to grant funders to get them funding in a much more direct way.

There are people looking at things like mine rehabilitation, circular economy projects, recycling and waste projects. We have received hundreds of inputs.

It's been very interesting to see that there is no shortage of ideas out there about what you need to make a just transition work.

Do you think U.S. climate reversals have made it harder for your team to push for green reforms?

I don't see South Africa backtracking on its climate commitments. It might take longer to achieve them, but I don't think that there's any understanding that the urgency of doing so has receded.

In fact, I think that the increase in extreme weather events and the consequences of it in South Africa mean it's seen as a much more urgent thing to do.

The less climate mitigation that is undertaken globally, the more adaptation you're going to need, the higher the cost.

I think that you must look at what's happening globally.

India, for example, has now got 50% of its installed (renewable) capacity. They've met their 2030 targets five years ahead of schedule. China has over-capacity at the moment.

The infrastructure that you need for renewables is (affordable), and you've got other countries like Bangladesh and Pakistan that are buying up that infrastructure in large, large quantities.

I don't think that we must only look at the West. I think it's very important to understand what is happening, in particular across Asia, and I think there is an unstoppable move to a diversified and a cleaner energy economy.

Can you clarify how much money is needed for the transition and how much is already pledged?

We need to mobilise and deploy around $98 billion to basically put the country on a trajectory that would enable it to meet its 2030 (climate goals).

Some $12.9 billion is what has been pledged by partners to support South Africa. And that is pledges. It doesn't mean that all or even most of that has flowed, but there are pledges of support.

We reckon that another roughly 500 billion rand ($28 billion) is likely to come from private sector investment, whether in (electricity) generation, transmission or in distribution.

What is your response to the criticism that the just energy transition is not moving fast enough?

Is anything moving fast enough? I do think that if you look at our infrastructure needs in the country and the pace at which we've been able to deal with them, it's not optimal.

I think we've got a catch-up to do, but I think there is a shift and a change that is happening that over time is going to gain traction. Every country in the world is trying to expand their transmission grid at the moment.

I do think that we must bear in mind something very important: we want a transition that is an orderly and phased transition.

We are not talking about the end of coal tomorrow in South Africa. Coal is in the system for a long time to come, but maybe as a declining proportion of the energy economy.

And we need to see that as an opportunity to put the alternatives in place and to be able to secure the additional investments at the same time.

It is a decades-long transition, and that's the opportunity that it gives us: to try and prevent serious shocks from happening.

That changed when Monsanto and BASF developed dicamba-tolerant GMO crops to be used with new dicamba herbicides after widespread use of Monsanto’s glyphosate herbicide on genetically altered glyphosate-tolerant crops caused millions of acres of weeds to develop glyphosate resistance.
Last year, a federal court found that the EPA violated the law in approving the three new dicamba herbicides.
In 2020, a separate federal court found that the EPA had rendered flawed analyses and “substantially understated” risks associated with the dicamba herbicides.
The decision on dicamba is one of many moves made since President Donald Trump took office to overturn or otherwise undo dozens of environmental restrictions.","This story was originally published by The New Lede.

In the latest reversal of U.S. environmental protections, regulators said this week that they plan to approve a trio of new herbicide products made with dicamba, a controversial chemical that has wreaked havoc across farm country, sparked years of litigation and twice drawn court-ordered bans.

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) released a proposed decision dated July 22 stating it sees more benefits than risks in allowing three dicamba products made by agrochemical industry giants Bayer, Syngenta and BASF to be used by farmers growing cotton and soybeans genetically altered to tolerate dicamba.

Public and environmental health advocacy groups attacked the decision, saying it ignores established evidence that dicamba is prone to drift away from where it is sprayed, particularly in warm temperatures, and the potent herbicide has damaged millions of acres of crops, orchards and landscape where it was never intended to be applied.

They also say the decision smacks of political favoritism, coming shortly after a former soybean industry lobbyist was named deputy assistant administrator for pesticides in the EPA’s Office of Chemical Safety and Pollution Prevention.

But the EPA said that cotton and soybean farmers are struggling to kill weeds that threaten the health of their crops because the weeds have become resistant to other types of herbicides. Dicamba products are needed to protect those important industries, the EPA said.

In its assessment, the EPA notes that the US cotton industry “accounts for more than $21 billion in products and services annually,” and says the annual soybean harvest is valued at roughly $57.6 billion.

The EPA said it was working with BASF, Syngenta and Bayer to include several restrictions on product labels aimed at reducing risks, both to people spraying the chemicals and certain endangered and threatened species, and to “sensitive crops and certain plants downwind.”

Still, critics railed against the decision.

“Trump’s EPA is hitting new heights of absurdity by planning to greenlight a pesticide that’s caused the most extensive drift damage in US agricultural history and twice been thrown out by federal courts,” Nathan Donley, environmental health science director at the Center for Biological Diversity, said in a statement. “This is what happens when pesticide oversight is controlled by industry lobbyists. Corporate fat cats get their payday and everyone else suffers the consequences.”

Bill Freese, science director at the Center for Food Safety, urged EPA officials to withdraw the plan.

“If we allow these proposed decisions to go through, farmers and residents throughout rural America will again see their crops, trees and home gardens decimated by dicamba drift, and natural areas like wildlife refuges will also suffer,” Freese said in a statement.

Dicamba was introduced to American agriculture in 1967, but was not widely used during warm months because it was known that the chemical can volatilize and move long distances when temperatures climb. That changed when Monsanto and BASF developed dicamba-tolerant GMO crops to be used with new dicamba herbicides after widespread use of Monsanto’s glyphosate herbicide on genetically altered glyphosate-tolerant crops caused millions of acres of weeds to develop glyphosate resistance.

Last year, a federal court found that the EPA violated the law in approving the three new dicamba herbicides. In 2020, a separate federal court found that the EPA had rendered flawed analyses and “substantially understated” risks associated with the dicamba herbicides.

Internal corporate documents show that Monsanto, which Bayer bought in 2018, and BASF were well aware that the combination of their dicamba-tolerant genetically altered crops and dicamba herbicides would likely lead to damage across many US farms not buying the specialty crops and chemicals.

The documents also lay out how Monsanto opposed third-party product testing as a way to limit data that might worry regulators.

The decision on dicamba is one of many moves made since President Donald Trump took office to overturn or otherwise undo dozens of environmental restrictions. So far, the Trump administration has undertaken more than 140 actions to reverse rules protecting the environment, according to an analysis by The Guardian.

About 20% of the potential demand has signed contracts or is considered “high-confidence load,” he said.
Given the number of interconnection requests, Oncor could add more than $12 billion to its existing $36 billion capital plan when it revises that plan sometime next year, according to Jeffrey Martin, chairman, CEO and president of Oncor parent company Sempra.

Oncor Electric Delivery now has some 200 GW of interconnection requests in its queue, including 186 GW of data centers, 7 GW of traditional commercial and industrial customers, 5 GW of crypto currency facilities, and 4 GW of oil and gas operations, Oncor CEO Allen Nye said during Thursday’s earnings call.

Given the number of interconnection requests, Oncor could add more than $12 billion to its existing $36 billion capital plan when it revises that plan sometime next year, according to Jeffrey Martin, chairman, CEO and president of Oncor parent company Sempra.

The sales of Sempra’s Ecogas Mexico and a stake in Sempra Infrastructure and have drawn interest from potential buyers and financiers, Martin said. The sales are intended to raise funds for Oncor’s multibillion dollar expansion.

Dive Insight

Sempra’s pivot to a more utility-focused business model, inspired in part by the massive growth in electric demand in Oncor’s service territory, should improve earnings and reduce risk for investors, Martin told analysts on Thursday.

Martin announced on the call that Sempra Infrastructure, the company’s development arm, has signed a nonbinding letter of intent with global investment firm KKR for the sale of 15% to 30% equity depending on the company’s valuation. The Ecogas sale has also drawn interest, he said, and both sales are expected to close in mid-2026.

“It’s also very important ... that we’re thoughtful on the timing and use of proceeds.” Martin said. “There’s an opportunity here to improve our balance sheet and put some cushion on the balance sheet.”

Sempra should see more of its earnings coming from its regulated utilities, and from Oncor and Texas in particular, in the future, Martin said. Oncor initiated service to 20,000 new properties in the second quarter alone, Nye said, and has about 1,100 new large load customers in its interconnection queue. The company already has 9 GW in new, signed interconnection agreements and has another 30 GW in requests that it considers “high confidence load.”

Morgan Stanley analyst David Arcaro noted that these figures suggested the company hasn’t added any new high confidence load to its queue in the past quarter, but Nye said this was because the company updates its high confidence figures once a year when it submits those numbers to the Electric Reliability Council of Texas.

On the California side of its business, Sempra CFO Karen Sedgwick said San Diego Gas & Electric has been awarded a contract for $600 million in new transmission by the California Independent System Operator — another potential addition to the company’s existing capital plan. The California utility also recently completed hardening 100% of its highest-risk transmission systems against wildfire, Martin said, and hasn’t been involved in a major wildfire in more than 18 years.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/1_SYXC3h4vVHAz_RWyshGuOH506QeErcly4n1p6iiAg/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9HZXR0eUltYWdlcy0xMzIzNzI3NTMxLmpwZw==.webp,N,,2025-08-11 15:06:03.122892

As far back as 1977, when oil prices were a big concern in the United States, a Cadillac Seville fueled by hydrogen drove in President Jimmy Carter’s inaugural parade.

More recently, a signature law under President Joseph R. Biden Jr. offered generous tax credits to companies that made hydrogen in ways that release little or no carbon dioxide. That spurred a flood of investment announcements by many businesses.

But the hype around the fuel is fading fast — and not for the first time.

From Arizona to Oklahoma, companies are pulling the plug on clean hydrogen projects after Congress shortened the window for them to qualify for a Biden-era tax credit by five years. Projects now must be under construction by the end of 2027 to qualify, a hurdle that three-quarters of proposals most likely will not meet, according to Wood Mackenzie, an energy consulting firm.

Hydrogen is widely used to make fertilizer and to turn oil into gasoline, diesel and other fuels. It can also store energy, much like a battery, and be used to power cars or trucks, though it has long struggled to take off in those applications.

The appeal is clear: Using hydrogen produces water vapor instead of greenhouse gases. But the fuel is expensive, is hard to store and transport, and is made using lots of energy.

Delivery of 350,000 pounds of U3O8 into sales contracts at an average price of $62.58 per pound;

In addition to sales of 350,000 pounds, 72,972 pounds of U3O8 were transferred to Boss Energy Ltd, the 30% joint venture partner at the Alta Mesa Project;

No U3O8 has been, nor is forecasted to be, purchased in 2025.

Operational Updates:

Improvements in operational efficiency at Alta Mesa In-Situ Recovery (""ISR"") Uranium CPP and Wellfield (""Alta Mesa"") continued through the second quarter with monthly increases in U3O8 extraction during the second quarter. Daily production averaged 2,678 pounds per day in June 2025, 2,103 pounds per day in May 2025 and 1,942 pounds per day in April 2025;

Wellfield development at the Alta Mesa Project's Wellfield 7 continued to expand throughout the second quarter with the addition of 75 wells: 35 extraction wells and 40 injection wells. This is part of the ongoing ramp up strategy to advance wellfield expansion every 4 to 5 weeks. Wellfield development has been ongoing at an accelerated rate with a total of 24 drill rigs in operation across the South Texas operations at the end of the quarter. The Company anticipates increasing the number of drill rigs operating to 30 in the third quarter of 2025;

Important permitting progress during the second quarter was highlighted by the inclusion of the Upper Spring Creek ISR Uranium Project in the existing Radioactive Materials License (""RML"") from the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (""TCEQ""). This license allows the Company to handle radioactive materials, which includes the final product, U3O8. The current RML includes the Rosita ISR Uranium Project, which has now been extended to cover the Upper Spring Creek Project's Brown Area. The RML allows the construction of wellfields and a Satellite Ion Exchange (""IX"") Plant which will provide feed for the Rosita ISR Uranium Central Processing Plant. Construction activities commenced during the quarter.

About the Alta Mesa ISR Uranium CPP and Wellfield (""Alta Mesa Uranium Project"")

The Alta Mesa Uranium Project hosts a fully licensed and constructed ISR Central Processing Plant and operational wellfield located on 200,000+ acres of private land and mineral rights in and regulated by the state of Texas. Total operating capacity at the Alta Mesa CPP is 1.5 million pounds uranium per year with additional drying capacity of 0.5 million pounds. The Alta Mesa Uranium Project operates under a 70/30 joint venture with Boss Energy Limited which is managed by the Company.

The Alta Mesa CPP historically produced nearly 5 million pounds of uranium between 2005 and 2013 when production was curtailed as a result of low prices. The Alta Mesa Uranium Project utilizes well known ISR technology to extract uranium in a non-invasive process using natural groundwater and oxygen. Currently, oxygenated water is being circulated in the wellfield through injection or extraction wells plumbed directly into the primary pipelines feeding the Alta Mesa CPP. Expansion of the wellfield will continue, with extraction to steadily increase from the wellfield as expansion continues through 2025 and beyond.

About the Upper Spring Creek ISR Uranium Project

The 100% Company-owned Project is a planned Satellite ion exchange (""IX"") Plant operation for the Rosita CPP. The Project consists of several future potential production units within the historic Clay West uranium district. The Project was previously held by Signal Equities LLC, who previously licensed and permitted the property as an ISR uranium project, maintaining the aquifer exemption and ceased work following continued low uranium spot prices. In December 2020, the Company acquired the Upper Spring Creek Project. The uranium mineralized sands that are associated with the project area lie within the Oakville Formation. These historic uranium producing sands stretch across an area of approximately 120 miles long by approximately 20 miles wide in South Texas. The uranium mineralized ore body at the Upper Spring Creek Project occurs at depths typically between 300 and 450 feet from the surface.

Rosita ISR Uranium Central Processing Plant

The Rosita CPP can receive uranium-loaded resin from remote project areas across the South Texas region through a network of Satellite IX Plants. These Satellite IX Plants, located near wellfields, are a key component of the ISR uranium extraction process. A lixiviant, consisting of groundwater mixed with oxygen and sodium bicarbonate, is injected into the wellfield using ISR technology, where it dissolves uranium from the underground sandstone. The uranium-bearing solution is then pumped to the surface and directed through the IX columns at the nearby Satellite IX Plant, where uranium is absorbed onto resin beads. The uranium-loaded resin is then transported to the Rosita CPP, where the uranium is removed from the resin and processed into yellowcake. Once processed, the resin is recycled and trucked back to the Satellite IX Plants for reuse. These modular, efficient, and relocatable IX Plants allow for cost-effective operation across multiple sites without the need to construct full processing facilities at each location, and they can be relocated once a wellfield is depleted.

The traditional assembly line will be transformed into an “assembly tree” at the Louisville plant, it said.
Ford said its investment in the Louisville plant will secure 2,200 hourly jobs.
Ford’s new EV strategy comes as Chinese automakers are quickly expanding across the globe, offering relatively affordable electric vehicles.
“And this new vehicle built in Louisville, Kentucky, is going to be a much better solution to anything that anyone can buy from China,” he added.","LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) — Ford Motor Co. will invest nearly $2 billion retooling a Kentucky factory to produce electric vehicles that it says will be more affordable, more profitable to build, and will outcompete rival models.

The automaker’s top executive unveiled the new EV strategy at Ford’s Louisville Assembly Plant which, after producing gas-powered vehicles for 70 years, will be converted to manufacture electric vehicles.

“In our careers, as automobile people we’re lucky if we get to work on one, maybe two, projects that really change the face of our industry,” CEO Jim Farley told plant workers in Kentucky on Monday. “And I believe today is going to light the match as one of those projects for all of us here.”

The Big Detroit automakers have continued to transition from internal combustion engines to EV technology even as President Donald Trump’s administration unwinds incentives for automakers to go electric. Trump’s massive tax and spending law targets EV incentives, including the imminent removal of a credit that saves buyers up to $7,500 on a new electric car.

Yet Farley and other top executives in the auto industry say that electric vehicles are the future and there is no going back.

The first EV to roll off the revamped Louisville assembly line will be a midsize, four-door electric pickup truck in 2027 for domestic and international markets, the company said Monday.

The new electric trucks will be powered by lower-cost batteries made at a Ford factory in Michigan. The Detroit automaker previously announced a $3 billion investment to build the battery factory.

The automaker sees this as a “Model T moment” for its EV business — a reference to revolutionary changes on the production line led by the company's founder, Henry Ford, when it began churning out vehicles from a factory more than a century ago. Farley said the changes will will upend how electric vehicles are made in the U.S.

“It represents the most radical change on how we design and how we build vehicles at Ford since the Model-T,” Farley said.

The company said it will use a universal platform and production system for its EVs, essentially the underpinning of a vehicle that can be applied across a wide range of models.

The Louisville factory — one of two Ford assembly plants in Kentucky’s largest city — will be revamped to cut production costs and make assembly time faster as it’s prepared to churn out electric vehicles.

The result will be “an affordable electric vehicle that we expect to be profitable,” Farley said in an interview with The Associated Press ahead of the announcement. “This is an example of us rejuvenating our U.S. plants with the most modern manufacturing techniques.”

The new platform enables a lineup of affordable vehicles to be produced at scale, Ford said. It will reduce parts by 20% versus a typical vehicle, with 25% fewer fasteners, 40% fewer workstations dock-to-dock in the plant and a 15% faster assembly time, Ford said. The traditional assembly line will be transformed into an “assembly tree” at the Louisville plant, it said. Instead of one long conveyor, three sub-assembly lines will operate simultaneously and then join together, it said.

Other specifications for the midsize electric truck – including its reveal date, starting price, EPA-estimated battery range, battery sizes and charge times — will be announced later, the company said. Ford revealed in its release that the truck will have a targeted starting price of about $30,000.

Ford said its investment in the Louisville plant will secure 2,200 hourly jobs.

Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear said Monday that the automaker’s plans for the Louisville plant will strengthen a more than century-old partnership between Ford and the Bluegrass State.

“This announcement not only represents one of the largest investments on record in our state, it also boosts Kentucky’s position at the center of EV-related innovation and solidifies Louisville Assembly Plant as an important part of Ford’s future,” Beshear said.

Ford said its combined investment of about $5 billion at the Kentucky assembly plant and Michigan battery plant is expected to create or secure nearly 4,000 direct jobs between the two plants while strengthening the domestic supply chain with dozens of new U.S.-based suppliers.

Ford previously forecast weaker earnings growth for this year and further losses in its electric vehicles business as it works to control costs. Model e, Ford’s electric vehicle business, posted a full-year loss of $5.08 billion for 2024 as revenue fell 35% to $3.9 billion.

Ford’s new EV strategy comes as Chinese automakers are quickly expanding across the globe, offering relatively affordable electric vehicles.

“We’re not in a race to build the most electric cars,” Farley told the AP when asked about competition from China. “We’re in a race to have a sustainable electric business that’s profitable, that customers love.

“And this new vehicle built in Louisville, Kentucky, is going to be a much better solution to anything that anyone can buy from China,” he added.",https://assets.lasvegassun.com/media/assets/images/icons/favicon-app.png,N,,2025-08-11 14:05:57.457303

The rights issue will amount to DKK 60 billion ($9.4B) in gross proceeds.
“The rights issue will strengthen Ørsted’s capital structure and provide financial robustness in the years 2025 through 2027,” Skole added.
Enabling a more value-accretive and flexible approach to the timing of partnerships and divestments related to offshore wind farms.
“The rights issue will reinforce our ability to realize the full value potential of our existing portfolio and capture future value-creating opportunities in offshore wind.”","The ripple effects of the Trump administration’s disdain for U.S. offshore wind development are crashing onto Danish shores.

Ørsted, the world’s largest offshore developer, watched its stock price plummet more than 25% on Monday morning, following the announcement of a $9.4 billion rights issue attributed to the crumbling U.S. market. According to the company, it is no longer possible to complete its planned partial divestment and associated non-recourse project financing of its Sunrise Wind project, currently being built off the coast of New York State, on terms that would adequately strengthen Ørsted’s capital structure and support its investment program and business plan. Therefore, Ørsted is required to fund the construction of the entire project on its balance sheet, which leads to an incremental funding requirement of approximately DKK 40 billion ($6.22B).

Based on this development, Ørsted’s Board of Directors has decided to discontinue the process for the partial divestment of Sunrise Wind and plans a rights issue with pre-emptive rights for existing shareholders. The rights issue will amount to DKK 60 billion ($9.4B) in gross proceeds. Existing shareholders will have a pre-emptive right to subscribe for their respective pro rata share of the capital increase in the rights issue and thereby retain the same relative ownership as they have today.

“Given the unprecedented regulatory development in the US, we have made a comprehensive assessment of all options, and Ørsted’s Board of Directors has concluded that the planned rights issue is the best path forward for the company and its stakeholders,” explained Lene Skole, Chair of Ørsted’s Board of Directors.

“The rights issue will strengthen Ørsted’s capital structure and provide financial robustness in the years 2025 through 2027,” Skole added. “The rights issue format treats all shareholders equally and provides all our shareholders with the opportunity to maintain their current ownership by subscribing for new shares, and I’m satisfied with the support from the Danish State as our majority shareholder.”

The Danish State has undertaken towards Ørsted to subscribe for its 50.1% pro rata share of the rights issue. Any shares not subscribed for by the existing shareholders by exercising their pre-emptive right or by other eligible investors are fully underwritten by Morgan Stanley & Co. International plc to provide certainty that the rights issue will be completed.

The proceeds will be used to strengthen Ørsted’s capital structure and provide financial flexibility to ensure an appropriate capitalization in the years 2025 through 2027, during which Ørsted will deliver its 8.1 gigawatt (GW) offshore wind construction portfolio, which includes Sunrise Wind, still slated to be completed in 2026.

The Northeast faces distinct challenges, including transportation electrification, aging infrastructure, renewable integration, grid modernization, and increasingly severe weather. DTECH® Northeast will assemble leading stakeholders to tackle these issues head-on, offering insights into cutting-edge technologies and strategies that ensure reliability, sustainability, and customer satisfaction. Join us in Boston, Massachusetts, from November 17-19, 2025!

By raising funds (that would’ve otherwise been brought in by the partial divestment of Sunrise), Ørsted says it will enhance its portfolio by:

Covering the incremental funding requirements from the full ownership of Sunrise Wind.

Strengthening the capital structure to preserve and optimize the value of its operational and construction portfolio.

Enabling a more value-accretive and flexible approach to the timing of partnerships and divestments related to offshore wind farms.

Reinforcing Ørsted’s position as a global leader in offshore wind by increasing the company’s financial robustness and flexibility, positioning Ørsted to pursue the most value-accretive investment opportunities in core offshore wind markets in Europe and select markets in APAC going forward.

As part of its ongoing program to strengthen its capital structure and sharpen the strategic focus on its core business, Ørsted says it continues to progress the previously announced farm-down processes for its Changhua 2 and Hornsea 3 offshore wind farms. In addition, Ørsted has launched a sales process for a potential full divestment of its European onshore business. Ørsted expects to raise more than DKK 35 billion ($5.44B) in proceeds from divestments from 2025 to 2026.

Ørsted will convene an extraordinary general meeting to be held on September 5, 2025, to propose that the general meeting authorize the Board of Directors to conduct the rights issue.

”Long-term, the fundamentals for offshore wind remain strong in our core markets in Europe. However, Ørsted and our industry are in an extraordinary situation with the adverse market development in the US on top of the past years’ macroeconomic and supply chain challenges,” detailed Rasmus Errboe, Group President and CEO of Ørsted. “The rights issue will reinforce our ability to realize the full value potential of our existing portfolio and capture future value-creating opportunities in offshore wind.”",https://www.renewableenergyworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/ChatGPT-Image-Aug-11-2025-12_00_12-PM.jpg,N,,2025-08-11 17:07:58.745067

This includes awards of up to $2.2 billion to two hubs in late 2024, with the Gulf Coast and Midwest hubs set to receive up to $1.2 billion and $1 billion respectively. The DOE also announced a $62 million investment in next-generation technologies in August 2024, including $40 million for four new fueling station projects and $8.5 million for advanced component development.

Across the Atlantic, the European Union approved €992 million for 15 renewable projects in May 2025. The REPowerEU plan added €200 million to double the number of Hydrogen Valleys by 2025, and the Clean Hydrogen Partnership's 2025 call for proposals had a budget of €184.5 million. The European Hydrogen Bank will hold another auction in late 2025, offering €1 billion to developers. Meanwhile, India's Ministry of New & Renewable Energy has a budgetary outlay of ₹496 crore (around $59 million) through 2026 for transport pilot projects.

Corporate Titans are Aggressively Scaling Production Capacity to Meet Demand

Key players in the hydrogen generator market are rapidly expanding their manufacturing capabilities. Norwegian firm Nel ASA is investing approximately NOK 260 million (about $25 million) to expand its PEM electrolyzer facility in Connecticut, targeting a 500 MW annual production capacity by 2025. Its Herøya facility in Norway is set to reach a 1 GW annual capacity in April 2024, with plans for a new U.S. Gigafactory boasting a potential capacity of up to 4 GW. UK-based ITM Power showcases similar ambition, with a contracted order backlog worth a healthy £135.3 million as of early 2025. The company has secured a significant 500 MW capacity reservation for its electrolyzer stacks from one customer until the end of 2028. Reinforcing this momentum, Shell reserved 100 MW of ITM's TRIDENT stacks for manufacture between 2025 and 2026. Shortly after launching its new 5MW Neptune V containerized electrolysers in May 2024, ITM Power promptly sold four units, signaling strong market reception.

A Powerful Project Pipeline Signals Unwavering Confidence in the Market

The global project pipeline is swelling, with a surge in final investment decisions. By the end of 2024, global installed electrolyzer capacity is projected to hit 5 GW. A remarkable testament to this growth occurred in July 2024, when six European hydrogen projects reached FID in a single month, representing nearly 1 GW of capacity. Major projects are advancing, including the 280 MW EWE AG project in Germany, expected online by 2027, and bp's 200 MW Castellón Refinery project in Spain, operational by 2026. The OranjeWind offshore wind farm will power 350 MW of electrolyzer capacity, becoming fully operational by 2028. These large-scale projects are crucial for the evolving hydrogen generator market.

Hydrogen Production Volumes Set for A Monumental Increase Globally

The real-world output of green hydrogen is scaling up significantly. In the U.S., Plug Power and Olin Corporation's joint venture in Louisiana will produce 15 tons of green hydrogen daily starting in 2025, with Plug Power aiming for a total liquid green hydrogen output of 500 tons per day by the end of that year. Air Products and AES Corporation's massive $4 billion Texas facility will produce over 200 metric tons of green hydrogen daily from 2027. Smaller, strategic projects are also contributing; Invenergy's Illinois plant will produce 52 tons per year from 2025, and Avina Clean Hydrogen's new California facility will add up to 4 metric tons per day. On a grander scale, the Hydrogen City project in South Texas plans to produce an enormous 280,000 tons annually from a 2.2 GW electrolyzer plant, a landmark development for the hydrogen generator market.

A Thriving Startup Ecosystem is Attracting Significant Venture Capital Investment

Innovation in the hydrogen generator market is being driven by a dynamic startup scene attracting massive investment. In the first four months of 2024 alone, hydrogen technology startups pulled in over $1 billion in venture capital. By September 2024, at least 23 startups had raised over $1.4 billion in equity funding for the year. Notable rounds include a $110 million Series B for Australian electrolyzer developer Hysata in May 2024 and a huge $246 million Series B for geologic hydrogen firm Koloma in early 2024, which brought its total funding to $403 million by July 2025. France's HysetCo, which manages a fleet of over 500 hydrogen vehicles and distributes nearly 30 tons of hydrogen monthly, raised $216 million in April 2024. Meanwhile, ZeroAvia, developing hydrogen-electric aircraft engines, extended its Series C funding to $150 million in September 2024.

The Race for Technological Supremacy is Evident in Patent Filings

The intense competition and innovation in the hydrogen generator market are reflected in patent activity. In the third quarter of 2024, a remarkable 1,558 hydrogen-related patent applications were filed within the oil and gas industry. Industry giants Toyota Motor and Air Liquide led the charge, each filing 34 patents, closely followed by Kawasaki Heavy Industries with 31 and Johnson Matthey with 22. The power industry saw 403 hydrogen-related patent applications in the same quarter. Here, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries led with 16 filings, while Siemens Energy filed 14. This flurry of R&D is producing tangible results; for instance, the Multi-SOFC project in Germany, a collaboration involving Hydrogenious and Bosch, aims to slash a hospital's carbon emissions by up to 40% in 2025, showcasing the practical application of advanced hydrogen technology.

Global Refueling Infrastructure is Expanding to Support Hydrogen Mobility Growth

A critical enabler for hydrogen mobility is the expansion of the global refueling network. By the end of 2024, approximately 1,160 hydrogen refueling stations were operational worldwide, with around 125 new stations having opened during the year. Asia leads with 748 stations, dominated by China with 384, followed by South Korea with 198 and Japan with 161. Europe had 294 stations, with Germany leading the continent at 113 locations, followed by France with 65. An alternative count from Interact Analysis puts the total at 1,369 deployed stations by year-end 2024. Looking ahead, there are concrete plans for at least 377 new station locations outside of China as of early 2025. Projections estimate a global total of 1,562 stations will be operating by 2025, bolstering the broader hydrogen generator market.

Market Concentration and Complex Economic Realities are Shaping the Industry

While the market is growing, certain players are capturing significant business. ITM Power's revenue for the first half of its 2025 fiscal year reached £15.5 million ($19.3 million), just shy of its entire 2024 fiscal year earnings. The company also dramatically improved its factory acceptance test pass rate from under 50% in 2023 to 98% in early 2025. Concentration is also visible in innovation, where the top five companies in oil and gas accounted for 9% of hydrogen patenting activity in Q3 2024, and the top five in power were responsible for 14%. However, economic hurdles remain. Despite a potential $3/kg U.S. subsidy, the average cost of green hydrogen remains high at $5/kg, compared to just $0.5/kg for grey hydrogen. The EU, which needs up to €470 billion in investments to meet its 2030 targets, has only disbursed €3 billion of its €21.4 billion in committed funds as of early 2025. This shows the financing gap in the hydrogen generator market.

Ambitious Regional Targets and Current Market Challenges Define the Future

Regional ambitions are high, but the path forward has challenges. The EU aims to produce 10 million tonnes of renewable hydrogen and import another 10 million tonnes by 2030, yet by early 2024, it had installed just 200 MW of electrolyzer capacity, only 3% of its interim goal. In contrast, China is a manufacturing powerhouse, accounting for 40% of the global electrolyzer supply as of September 2024. India’s National Green Hydrogen Mission is targeting 5 MMT of production capacity by 2030, and the Intermountain Power Project in Utah plans to run on a 30% hydrogen blend by 2025.

Despite this progress, project execution remains a hurdle. As of May 2024, less than 7% of announced global capacity had passed FID, with another report in April 2025 putting the figure at just 4% for 2024. Furthermore, one in four European projects faced delays or cancellation by mid-2025. Still, with Nel anticipating ""multiple gigawatts"" of capacity reaching FID before the end of 2025, the hydrogen generator market is poised to overcome these growing pains.

Now it’s got a brand-new microgrid to run the whole town for days on end without any onsite fossil fuels, just batteries and liquid hydrogen.

After disastrous conflagrations in 2017 and 2018, utility Pacific Gas & Electric began preemptively shutting off power lines to avoid sparking fires amid dangerously dry, windy conditions.

“We were the first community in all of PG&E’s network that was getting our power shut off to protect us,” said Calistoga City Council member Lisa Gift. ​“By 2019 we were one of the first communities to have a microgrid in all of PG&E’s network, and that was being powered by diesel generators.”

PG&E arranged a bank of truck-based diesel generators to sit in the town during fire season. When the utility cut grid power, the generators kicked on, belching smoke in a particularly beloved pocket of the 5,000-person community.

“We’re a small town, so they would come up and they’d be polluting the environment, taking up our dog park — loud, gross, noisy,” Gift recalled.

Now the diesel generators are gone and the park has been turned back over to Calistoga’s canine companions.

On a slim parcel of city land next door, publicly traded energy-storage company Energy Vault installed lithium-ion batteries and a 234-foot, reinforced-steel tank for liquid hydrogen (designed to withstand a roaring fire, should it ever come to that) that runs a bank of hydrogen fuel cells. Altogether, this compound should be able to meet Calistoga’s electricity needs without any power from the broader grid. It’s contracted to produce up to 8.5 megawatts for 48 hours, whenever PG&E shuts off grid power due to fire concerns. Refilling the hydrogen tank could let it run for several days more.

“Even though we’re taking elements — fuel cells, batteries, liquid hydrogen storage and distribution — that have been used before in commercial settings, they’re coming together for the first time as resiliency,” said Craig Horne, Energy Vault’s senior vice president for advanced energy solutions, in an interview before the project’s unveiling in early August.

Fans of hydrogen hail it as a solution to just about any entrenched decarbonization challenge, from heavy transport to steelmaking to on-demand power. But how hydrogen is produced makes a huge difference in its climate impact; seemingly clean sources can actually rack up major carbon emissions for negligible benefit. For now, the clean hydrogen economy remains largely speculative, with hardly any truly clean hydrogen being produced or any real projects using it. Many planned clean hydrogen projects have vanished without a trace, following a short-lived boom fueled by Biden-era support.

In Calistoga, Energy Vault has tapped hydrogen to deal with a very specific set of constraints — delivering energy without local emissions, over multiple days, in a tight footprint — but the cleanliness of that hydrogen is a more complicated issue than public descriptions of the microgrid suggest.

The key players all have a lot riding on the project.

Energy Vault, which previously raised several hundred million dollars in a singular bid to store energy with multi-story robotic cranes that stack blocks, wants to build a new long-duration storage business around this hydrogen microgrid showcase. Plug Power, the financially challenged hydrogen company, points to Calistoga as its largest deployment of hydrogen fuel cells (a beefy 8 megawatts, after 28 years of hard work). And PG&E has orders from regulators to add more clean energy microgrids in communities where it regularly cuts off power — Calistoga was its first delivery on that directive, after a few years of soliciting proposals and a couple more years of permitting and construction.

“Community microgrids are the future of the energy system,” said Craig Lewis, who advocates for such projects as executive director of the Clean Coalition nonprofit. The Calistoga microgrid is ​“a commercial-scale experiment, and I’m grateful for it.”

The results of that experiment will take time to analyze. It could unleash a new, replicable model for premium-priced community-level backup power. Or the quirkiness of the design and the murkiness of hydrogen’s supply chain and emissions could make it a quixotic outlier of questionable climate value.

Compact and cleaner backup power in a fire zone

The Calistoga microgrid poses an answer to the question of how to provide a few days of backup power to a small town in a small space, without worrying too much about cost. The limitations drove the design, which turned out quite unlike anything built thus far.

Energy Vault had to figure out how to pack 293 megawatt-hours of storage into just two-thirds of an acre. The lot used to hold debris from city works, like old bits of sidewalk and pipes, Horne said.

Lithium-ion batteries have proven themselves capable of storing power, be it as a Powerwall in someone’s garage or as a large-scale grid storage facility. But to store nearly 300 megawatt-hours, grid battery enclosures need more acreage than was available to lease from the city. Even if enough batteries could fit, the auxiliary power consumption for keeping them safely cooled would pose a challenge for a project that’s supposed to mostly sit around waiting for an emergency event.

Hydrogen gas can be liquefied by cooling it to ultra-low temperatures, which unlocks greater energy density. When converted back to gas and run through fuel cells, it produces a stream of electricity and no byproduct besides water vapor. That core technology powers hydrogen vehicles, though their cost and inconvenience make for a widely derided car-ownership experience. At Calistoga, the hydrogen flows directly to six Plug Power GenSure 1540 fuel cells, boxy containers with cooling units stacked on top, making them about two stories tall.

The engineers added a small lithium-ion battery (7.7 MW/11.6 MWh) to perform ​“black start,” the complicated and crucial task of rebooting an electrical system after a complete blackout, Horne noted. The battery also buffers the output of the system while the hydrogen gets up and running. Then the power flows to Calistoga’s grid, which, when PG&E shuts off the transmission lines, will be fully islanded from the surrounding network.

The hydrogen is stored onsite in an 80,000-gallon tank, manufactured in Minnesota by Chart Industries. The tank holds enough to power the fuel cells for about two days, but Energy Vault will try its best to keep the lights on beyond the contracted timeframe, Horne said. So the company made sure the tank can be refueled while it’s in active use.

“The task is to squeeze toothpaste into a toothpaste tube that was being squeezed,” Horne said. ​“That’s what we proved in our acceptance testing, running for multiple hours while the fuel cells were running and a tank trailer here in the driveway is pushing liquid hydrogen into the tank itself.”

Hydrogen trucked in from across the country

The microgrid’s promise as a clean energy breakthrough, of course, hinges on the supply of clean hydrogen, but supply chains are barely getting started. Almost all commercial hydrogen is currently made from methane gas, a fossil fuel, through a procedure called steam methane reforming that sends the carbon dioxide byproduct straight into the atmosphere.

For hydrogen to stake any claim as a climate solution, it needs to be made without massive carbon emissions. That usually involves an alternative production method called electrolysis, which separates hydrogen from water using electricity. But this method can produce even more emissions than the dirty methane version if the electrolyzers are drawing power from the grid rather than dedicated renewable sources like solar and wind (see this previous Canary Media coverage for a detailed account of why that’s the case).

Energy Vault describes the hydrogen it’s using in Calistoga as ​“clean,” which Horne clarified as meeting the federal standard of no more than four kilograms of carbon dioxide emitted per kilogram of hydrogen produced. But he declined to name the source. Notably, California has subsidized hydrogen fueling stations for over a decade but still hasn’t managed to develop a clean hydrogen supply in-state. So for Calistoga’s hydrogen to be clean, it must be coming from somewhere else.

During a tour of the microgrid, Deepesh Goyal, vice president of stationary power at Plug Power, told Canary Media that Plug Power currently supplies hydrogen from its electrolyzer site in Georgia, which runs on grid power. More than half of Georgia’s electricity comes from fossil fuels, so that electrolysis incurs substantial power-plant emissions. Plug Power buys credits for clean energy supply to compensate for this, Goyal said.

To meet the highest federal standard for clean hydrogen, producers need to obtain clean power matched to their consumption on an hourly basis in the areas where they operate. Plug Power did not respond in time for publication to questions clarifying what type of credits it buys. But a spokesperson for Energy Vault told Canary Media that currently there aren’t any facilities that could supply Calistoga with liquid hydrogen from electrolysis powered by time-matched, dedicated clean electricity, and the earliest such facility is targeting completion in 2026.

Goyal also said some of Calistoga’s hydrogen comes from an unnamed partner in Las Vegas that uses renewable natural gas (RNG) as its feedstock. As it happens, legacy gas supplier Air Liquide opened a steam methane reformer in that area a few years ago to serve California’s demand. Air Liquide says it can substitute RNG for the usual methane, which would make the resulting hydrogen carbon-negative according to the convoluted calculations of California’s clean fuels bureaucracy. It’s still hydrogen made by splitting methane and releasing carbon dioxide, but it looks good on paper thanks to controversial rules that privilege certain politically connected providers of RNG.

If someone were to design a climate solution from a blank slate, they probably wouldn’t run electrolyzers on grid power in Georgia in order to load the super-cooled hydrogen onto diesel-powered tankers and haul it more than 2,800 miles to Northern California, where it will sit around almost every day awaiting a utility power outage.

“We still have to truck in that hydrogen,” said Gift. ​“That’s not ideal, but we were trucking in the diesel, and we were trucking in the diesel sometimes three times a day and burning that diesel.”

One incontrovertible fact is that the microgrid doesn’t combust anything onsite, so the operations within the fenceline emit almost no carbon emissions and don’t impact air quality. But it will be hard to gauge the real climate impacts of such a project until a more verifiably clean and geographically localized hydrogen supply chain develops. Several companies have said they will build truly green hydrogen production in the coming years. That task has only grown more difficult with the Trump administration’s efforts to thwart renewables development and vastly curtail clean hydrogen tax credits.

Will other buyers accept the cost of liquid hydrogen backup?

The other make-or-break variable for hydrogen-backed resilience is how much it costs. Liquid hydrogen is an expensive, specialty fuel only produced by a handful of suppliers in the U.S., and clean liquid hydrogen is even rarer.

For this first project, Energy Vault didn’t need to worry about consumer price sensitivity. The city of Calistoga isn’t paying Energy Vault for backup power: PG&E is paying the company to provide this service, out of funds socialized across the utility customer base. In fact, Calistoga is making some money, since Energy Vault leased the land from the municipality for 10 years.

The project’s total price tag has not been made public. Regulators allocated up to $46.3 million for PG&E to spend on the endeavor. Energy Vault closed $28 million in project financing this spring to support construction. (The company also said on Thursday that it has raised $300 million to launch Asset Vault, a subsidiary that will build, own, and operate storage projects, with Calistoga as one of two anchor properties.) Horne allowed that the hydrogen microgrid costs more than diesel generators up front, but argued it can be competitive in terms of operating costs, given all the hassles associated with diesel.

“We can do more and waste less, and so that’s how we can be more cost effective,” he said.

The regulatory authorization paints a different picture. The California Public Utilities Commission explicitly allowed PG&E to spend more money than the diesel generators cost in order to test a new model for cleaner resilience.

“This project was supported by a CPUC plan that said we could build a solution that costs no more than twice what it would cost to deploy diesel generation over 10 years,” said Jeremy Donnell, a senior manager for microgrid strategy and implementation at PG&E. ​“It’s a bit of an arbitrary marker, but that’s what was laid out, and this project did come in under that threshold.”

“But still, we have a ways to go to bring the cost down,” Donnell added. ​“So hopefully, through implementation of this first project, Energy Vault learned a lot, the industry learned a lot on how to integrate these solutions in future projects.”

Energy Vault hopes to improve the project economics by upgrading the site to allow regular power exports to the grid. Currently, the system is configured to only push out power when PG&E has scheduled a shutoff event; that means the microgrid sits idle almost every day of the year (and is unavailable for unforeseen outages, like if a tree falls on a key line). But with the right permissions and technical tweaks in place, Energy Vault expects to use the battery, and potentially even the hydrogen, to send power to California’s grid at particularly lucrative times.

“We can now have a viable second revenue stream outside of providing that resiliency service, without compromising our ability to provide the resiliency service,” Horne said. PG&E amended its contract this summer to clarify that Energy Vault is allowed to pursue this, provided it does not interrupt delivery of the required resilience services.

For the people of Calistoga, the project softens the upheavals of living through climate change–induced extreme weather, without all the downsides of onsite fossil fuel combustion.

“Is it absolutely perfect? No,” Gift said. ​“But as a society, it is about making that next best right step. And for us in our community, this was that next best right step.”

For Energy Vault and the budding hydrogen industry, the next right step will be expanding hydrogen production that’s definitively low-emissions, and closing the 2,800-mile gap between supply and demand.

The power generated from Avangrid’s growing portfolio of energy projects demonstrates the company’s recognition of critical U.S. power needs and its commitment to investments that supply reliable and affordable energy for American homes and businesses, helping to achieve U.S. energy dominance and meet surging demand growth.

“Avangrid is leading the way to help meet the nation’s growing demand for electricity, driven in large part by the rapid expansion of data centers,” said Avangrid CEO Jose Antonio Miranda. “As we expand our investments in U.S. generation and grid infrastructure, we are strengthening American energy independence and powering long-term economic growth. We will continue working with our many stakeholders to bring new projects online, ensuring families and industries across America have access to safe, reliable, and affordable power.”

Avangrid has more than 10.5 Gigawatts (GW) of energy generation capacity, with 80 operating power plants stretching from coast to coast. Earlier this year, the company announced commercial operations at three new solar projects in Texas, California, and Ohio, representing about 600 Megawatts (MW) of new capacity. This helped boost Avangrid’s solar energy production by 125% compared to the first six months of 2024. Since 2015, Avangrid has increased its generating capacity by 66 percent.

Avangrid currently has 10 projects providing more than 1.5 GW of energy to data centers and the leading companies in technology and AI. The company has five more projects, totaling nearly 700 MW, currently under construction, helping these companies meet their urgent need for power.

In March 2025, Avangrid announced plans to invest an additional $20 billion in U.S. electrical grid infrastructure by 2030. This reflects the critical need to invest in energy infrastructure to meet growing demand, as well as the United States’ position as a top investment priority for Avangrid and Iberdrola.

Avangrid’s success has contributed to Iberdrola’s global production surpassing 66,000 GWh for the first half of 2025, a 2.3% increase compared to the same period from last year. Furthermore, Avangrid helped Iberdrola’s global generation capacity exceed 57,000 MW this year.",https://mms.businesswire.com/media/20250811649868/en/2549835/22/IBR_Copper_Crossing-4-7_%281%29.jpg,N,,2025-08-11 13:07:47.761402

It added, “The goal should be to scale local manufacturing without compromising access to affordable solar energy.
“There is an urgent need for single-window applications, clearer eligibility criteria, and renewable energy desks in key MDAs,” PwC stated.
It also called for dedicated renewable energy industrial zones, equipped with shared infrastructure, streamlined permitting processes, and proximity to ports and transport corridors to reduce logistics costs.","Inadequately trained technicians and quality assurance professionals have been identified as likely impediments to supporting local production of renewable energy panels in Nigeria.

A global consulting firm, PricewaterhouseCoopers, in a report said that solar manufacturing is not just about equipment, but also about people, and therefore urged the government to partner with universities, polytechnics, and vocational centres to create a national renewable energy skills framework.

“Manufacturing solar panels requires trained technicians, engineers, and quality assurance professionals. Without human capital development, local industry will struggle to compete,” PwC noted in that report.

It also advocated for stronger enforcement of product standards, urging agencies such as the Standards Organisation of Nigeria (SON) and Nigerian Electricity Management Services Agency(NEMA) to adopt and enforce International Electrotechnical Commission-aligned standards.

On finance, PwC noted that access to capital remains a major constraint for both manufacturers and consumers. To deepen solar access for off-grid households, the Bank of Industry (BoI) and Central Bank of Nigeria(CBN) should provide long-term green financing and support Pay-As-You-Go models.

PwC urged the government to engage the private sector, development partners like the World Bank and AfDB, and civil society to co-develop a coherent renewable energy roadmap.

“Establishing stakeholder feedback loops and publishing annual progress reports can drive transparency, track jobs created, cost reductions, and support mid-course corrections,” it said.

The consulting firm’s reports, reacting to the government’s proposed ban on solar panel imports, cautioned the country against implementing an immediate restriction on solar panel imports.

It warned that such a move could disrupt Nigeria’s fragile energy access gains and dampen investor confidence in the renewable energy sector.

The report, titled: “Rethinking Nigeria’s Proposed Solar Panel Import Policy,” noted that while the push for local manufacturing and industrialisation is commendable, a measured and phased approach is necessary to avoid unintended consequences.

The PwC said the plan, if not properly sequenced, risks stalling Nigeria’s clean energy momentum. In Q4 2024, Nigeria imported solar panels valued at approximately N237.3billion, but by Q1 2025, imports had dropped by about 89 per cent to N125.29billion.

“In 2023 alone, Nigeria imported over four million solar panels, valued at more than $200m. This is not just a reflection of our energy crisis, but also of the absence of adequate local manufacturing capacity,” the report said.

Rather than an outright restriction, PwC advised the government to implement a three—to five-year phased reduction in imports, which would allow local manufacturers to ramp up production capacity, meet demand, and establish quality control systems.

“The proposed import restriction policy reflects Nigeria’s energy security and industrial growth ambition. A measured and strategic approach is needed to avoid unintended disruptions.

“A tiered strategy that includes import quotas, progressive tariffs, or blended procurement models would ensure supply continuity while attracting long-term investments under a stable regulatory framework,” the report recommended.

It added, “The goal should be to scale local manufacturing without compromising access to affordable solar energy. Rather than an instant restriction, Nigeria should adopt a three to five-year phased reduction in solar panel imports.”

The firm acknowledged that the Nigerian government already offers incentives such as the Pioneer Status Incentive, import duty waivers, VAT exemptions, and green finance instruments. However, these remain underutilised due to bureaucratic red tape, fragmented application processes, and limited awareness.

“There is an urgent need for single-window applications, clearer eligibility criteria, and renewable energy desks in key MDAs,” PwC stated. It also called for dedicated renewable energy industrial zones, equipped with shared infrastructure, streamlined permitting processes, and proximity to ports and transport corridors to reduce logistics costs.

While acknowledging the government’s intent to spur industrialisation, PwC concluded that “a hasty restriction could stall momentum in Nigeria’s clean energy transition, reduce affordability, and shake investor confidence.”

“Nigeria must recalibrate its solar panel import policy with strategic sequencing, stakeholder alignment, and realism about the current state of local capacity,” the report stated.

It added, “Getting it right can help Nigeria meet its climate goals, boost local industry, and drive long-term economic growth. Getting it wrong could leave millions in the dark.”

These recommendations came in response to the government’s announcement of a ban on solar panel importation, citing the influx of substandard products. The Federal Government, through the Ministry of Science and Technology, had proposed a policy to restrict solar panel imports in a bid to localise production, conserve forex, and create jobs.",https://nationaleconomy.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/EGK4cPGq.jpeg,N,,2025-08-11 13:06:59.836662

That's right around where the pared-back Slate Truck will end up costing, but Ford made it clear that it's building something very different.

Ford is looking to save cost with both vehicle and manufacturing efficiencies.

Ford's EV revolution starts with a small pickup truck with a targeted base price of $30,000 when it goes on sale in 2027. This, of course, brings to mind the coming Slate Truck, which had a $20,000 price target before but the Trump Administration's ending of Federal EV incentives and tariffs ended that dream. Slate's truck is very pared-back, a modern take on an old-school pickup without standard power windows or an infotainment system. Ford's truck won't be the same.

""This is not going to be a stripped-down, old-school vehicle as a path to low cost,"" said Ford's EV chief Doug Field at an event announcing the truck today. He didn't elaborate on that point any further, but it's clear he's talking about the Slate here, a truck that makes a point of being back-to-basics. Field confirmed that the truck would have Ford's hands-free BlueCruise driver-assist system.

The way Ford is aiming to make such a low-cost EV profitable is through various efficiencies through better aerodynamics, lower rolling resistance, and a lighter, simpler set of components. Ford will build cars on its new Universal EV Platform introduced today, unlike any other cars, with three parallel lines that come together at the end for a complete vehicle. Ford is also using Tesla-style castings, which it calls ""unicastings.""

The comments emphasize that greenhouse gases differ fundamentally from traditional air pollutants regulated under the Clean Air Act.
Carbon dioxide cannot reasonably be considered an “air pollution agent” under the Clean Air Act’s definition requiring substances that “make or render impure or unclean.” “Congress designed the Clean Air Act to regulate substances that directly harm human health, not essential atmospheric gases that support all life on Earth,” said Hadzi-Antich.
“For 16 years, the Endangerment Finding and the regulations that rely upon it have imposed billions in costs to the economy—all without Congressional authorization,” added TPPF attorney Eric Heigis.
“The Endangerment Finding had legal flaws from its inception.","AUSTIN, Texas – The Texas Public Policy Foundation’s Center for the American Future recently submitted detailed comments strongly supporting the Environmental Protection Agency’s proposal to rescind the 2009 Greenhouse Gas Endangerment Finding, calling the rescission a necessary correction of legal violations and regulatory overreach that has imposed massive costs on American families and businesses.

The comments, filed on behalf of Liberty Packing Company LLC, Nuckles Oil Co. Inc. dba Merit Oil Company, Western States Trucking Association, and Construction Industry Air Quality Coalition, outline multiple fundamental flaws with the Obama-era finding that classified greenhouse gases as harmful “air pollutants” under the Clean Air Act.

“The Obama EPA violated federal law when it issued the Endangerment Finding without submitting it to the Science Advisory Board for required peer review,” said Ted Hadzi-Antich, senior attorney with the Texas Public Policy Foundation’s Center for the American Future. “This procedural violation alone justifies rescission, but the finding also lacks the clear congressional authorization required for decisions of such vast economic and political significance under the Supreme Court’s Major Questions Doctrine.”

The Foundation’s 35-page comment filing details how EPA violated 42 U.S.C. § 4365(c)(1) by failing to submit the proposed rule to the Science Advisory Board for peer review. The comments also demonstrate how the finding violates the Major Questions Doctrine established in West Virginia v. EPA, noting that Congress has repeatedly considered and rejected greenhouse gas legislation, never providing clear authorization for such sweeping regulatory authority.

“The science underlying the 2009 finding was flawed from the start and is now definitively obsolete,” said Dr. Brent Bennett, policy director for Life:Powered at the Texas Public Policy Foundation. “The EPA was never able to show empirically that the moderate warming being caused by greenhouse gas emissions is endangering the public health, instead relying on fatally flawed climate models and outright speculation. We applaud the EPA and the accompanying DOE climate change report for finally recognizing the facts.”

The Endangerment Finding triggered a cascade of regulations affecting mining, manufacturing, transportation, construction, agriculture, and energy production. Recent EPA vehicle regulations based on the finding require at least 45% of trucks and 70% of cars to be all-electric by 2032, while previous attempts like the Clean Power Plan sought to force electricity generators away from reliable fossil fuels.

TPPF’s comments document severe and widespread damage across virtually every sector of the American economy, imposing billions in compliance costs while providing negligible climate benefits. TPPF’s analysis shows that eliminating all U.S. CO₂ emissions by 2050 would reduce global temperatures by just 0.082°C by 2100, with vehicle emissions representing only a fraction of that minimal impact.

The comments emphasize that greenhouse gases differ fundamentally from traditional air pollutants regulated under the Clean Air Act. While pollutants like particulate matter cause direct harm to human health in local areas, CO₂ is essential to plant life, globally distributed, and affects climate indirectly over decades through uncertain mechanisms. Carbon dioxide cannot reasonably be considered an “air pollution agent” under the Clean Air Act’s definition requiring substances that “make or render impure or unclean.”

“Congress designed the Clean Air Act to regulate substances that directly harm human health, not essential atmospheric gases that support all life on Earth,” said Hadzi-Antich. “The finding represents an unprecedented expansion of federal regulatory power that Congress never authorized and the courts should not permit under current Supreme Court precedent.”

The comments also detail how EPA abdicated its scientific responsibilities by relying almost entirely on assessments from international organizations rather than conducting independent analysis. EPA acknowledged it “relied heavily” on work from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and other non-governmental organizations as the “primary scientific and technical basis” for the finding.

“For 16 years, the Endangerment Finding and the regulations that rely upon it have imposed billions in costs to the economy—all without Congressional authorization,” added TPPF attorney Eric Heigis. “The Endangerment Finding had legal flaws from its inception.

In just the past few weeks, the Trump administration instituted permitting reviews that threaten U.S. wind and solar developments. It imposed standards that would essentially prevent new developments on federal land. It rescinded Biden-era decisions earmarking coastal waters for future wind turbines. And on Wednesday, it yanked approval for a massive planned wind farm in Idaho.

The pace and range of strikes against renewables — alongside several other actions that serve to prop up fossil fuels and nuclear power — have whipsawed wind and solar developers that had grown accustomed to federal support. The policies have already helped contribute to the cancellation or delay of more than $22 billion in clean energy projects since January and the loss of thousands of jobs, a majority in Republican states, according to an analysis from the E2 advocacy group.

The actions have struck deeper than even some hardened industry players and observers anticipated — mirroring Trump's more aggressive approach on an array of fronts during his second term. Timothy Fox, managing director of ClearView Energy Partners, once believed the incoming administration might merely refocus government efforts to prioritize power from coal and gas instead of taking aim at renewables.

But that “refocus” path is now in the rearview. Instead, Fox said, “we’re in the retaliate scenario.”

Trump has repeatedly called green energy a “scam” while also touting his focus on “energy dominance” by relying on domestic sources of oil, natural gas and coal. Beyond the words, the actual crackdown on wind and solar comes at a precarious time in the United States. Electricity demand is rising quickly because of data centers and climbing use of artificial intelligence, contributing to bigger bills for Americans still stung by broader inflation.

Meantime, there’s a backlog in natural-gas turbines and new nuclear power is many years away. Some studies predict the attacks on renewables will shrink potential power generation and lead to higher energy costs.

Trump administration officials say the moves are justified to ensure the United States has an abundance of always-on power sources. Previous presidents gave too much preferential treatment to wind and solar ventures, Interior Secretary Doug Burgum said in announcing one policy shift: “Leveling the playing field in permitting supports energy development that’s reliable, affordable and built to last.”

The broadside against renewables began on Trump’s first day in office, when he froze offshore wind permitting. He’s moved to quickly reverse former President Joe Biden’s climate agenda, and the Republican-majority Congress surprised even some GOP onlookers when it phased out tax incentives for wind and solar projects.

The White House did not respond to a request for comment.

At the same time, the Environmental Protection Agency has proposed rescinding the endangerment finding, a determination that greenhouse gases harm public health and welfare, indicating the lengths it will go to in order to prop up fossil fuels at the expense of solar and wind.

Billions of dollars’ worth of new factories and clean energy projects have been canceled, delayed or scaled back since the start of the year, with $11.7 billion worth of investments located in GOP districts as of June, according to E2. More than 16,500 jobs have been lost, with nearly 12,000 of them in Republican districts, the analysis finds.

The French energy company Engie, meantime, says it’s on track to invest less than half its usual $2 billion to $3 billion in the United States this year.

The industry had expected a slowdown, including a leasing pause on federal land, and that newly proposed projects wouldn’t proceed, an energy company executive told Bloomberg earlier this year. But the scale of disruption, especially moves against fully permitted wind projects, took developers aback, said the executive who asked not to be named in order to speak more candidly.

For some businesses, the best strategy is to keep your head down and hope projects can wait out the next three and a half years, another energy industry executive told Bloomberg. Even so, the executive added, that keeps capital locked up and forfeits opportunities for other investment in the meantime.

“The proposed federal interference with private economic activity is unprecedented,” said the American Clean Power Association, a trade group for utility-scale wind and solar developers. The policies have created “a troubling challenge for critical infrastructure investment of any kind.”

Much of the administration’s assault on wind and solar power has run through the Interior Department, which has authority over hundreds of millions of acres of federal land and water, and is currently home to 4% of U.S. renewable energy generation. That figure was projected to increase to as much as 12.5% by 2035, according to a January Energy Department report.

Burgum issued a directive that requires him to personally sign off on 69 separate approvals for wind and solar projects on federal land. The move effectively serves to mire projects in red tape, requiring his review of thousands of documents, according to the American Clean Power Association.

However, industry experts say the new federal policy is also likely to block projects built on private land, too, because often there is a nexus between those projects and the agency, especially in the West where the federal government owns nearly half the land.

“It will have a far reach,” said Eric B. Beightel, who formerly served as executive director of the Federal Permitting Council during the Biden administration. “I do think the impacts will stretch beyond just the federal land.”

The Interior Department now considers energy capacity density as a key factor in evaluating energy proposals on public lands and waters, the agency told Bloomberg. Each project is reviewed on a case-by-case basis it said.

“Just because some want to frame this as playing politics doesn’t make it true. Evaluating land use efficiency and environmental impact isn’t partisan, it’s responsible governance,” an Interior spokesperson said.

Despite all the new hurdles, big clean energy developers are trying to show investors they can survive the tumult. NextEra Energy Inc. and AES Corp. both said during recent earnings calls that they believe most of their projects have locked in tax incentives.

“I think it will be more difficult for the smaller, less capitalized developers in this environment,” AES Chief Executive Officer Andres Gluski said on an investor call.","https://www.detroitnews.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/08/11/PDTN/85607377007-trumpenergybg-537-fnwwhhnf-47-oirmouapp-2-b-5-a.jpg?crop=3999,2250,x0,y133&width=3200&height=1801&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-08-11 13:08:15.816364

Contact: FHWA.PressOffice@dot.gov(link sends email)

WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Transportation Secretary Sean P. Duffy today unveiled revised guidance for the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure (NEVI) Formula Program. The updates streamline applications, provide states with more flexibility, and slash red tape left by the Biden-Buttigieg Administration. This will ensure charging stations are actually built, and federal funding is spent effectively and efficiently. The Interim Final Guidance is effective immediately while FHWA seeks comment on what further changes may be appropriate.

“If Congress is requiring the federal government to support charging stations, let’s cut the waste and do it right,” said U.S. Transportation Secretary Sean P. Duffy. “The Biden-Buttigieg Administration failed to deliver EV chargers despite their promises. Our revised NEVI guidance slashes red tape and makes it easier for states to efficiently build out this infrastructure. While I don’t agree with subsidizing green energy, we will respect Congress' will and make sure this program uses federal resources efficiently.”

NEVI was established to fund States’ deployment of EV charging infrastructure, but Biden and Buttigieg added requirements that were difficult to understand and implement.

Earlier this year, Secretary Duffy and the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) launched a review of the program’s guidance to make the NEVI program more efficient. At the time, 84% of NEVI Formula program funds remained unobligated – a clear signal of the program’s failure.

Under the Interim Final Guidance, States should submit their EV Infrastructure Deployment Plans within 30 days of the date of this guidance.

Findings of USDOT Review of Failed Implementation of EV Program:

In this unique program, Congress granted the Secretary authority to issue guidance for States and localities to strategically deploy electric vehicle charging infrastructure.

The Biden-Buttigieg Administration wasted time, money, and public trust in implementing the program.

The FHWA has worked to streamline the NEVI Formula Program Guidance to align with the Trump Administration’s priorities of safety, efficiency, and innovation.

During the review process: No new obligations occurred under the Program and reimbursement of existing obligations continued.

Updated Language:

Per Executive Order 14154 “Unleashing American Energy”, this new guidance document would eliminate previous mandates for EVs and potential burdens. In addition, it would rescind previous guidance documents and policies that are not required by clear and express statutory language, per the January 29, 2025, memorandum from the Secretary of Transportation on the Implementation of Executive Orders Addressing Energy, Climate Change, Diversity, and Gender.

Summary of Changes:

Minimizes the content in state plans to statutory and regulatory requirements.

Simplifies the state plan approval process.

Aligns community engagement with regulatory requirements and reduces consultation requirements to advance projects.

Provides states with flexibility to determine the appropriate distance between stations along alternative fuel corridors to allow for reasonable travel.

Minimizes requirements for states to consider electric grid integration and renewable energy

Accelerates project delivery by encouraging selection of charging locations where station owners are also the site host.

Eliminates requirements for states to address consumer protections, emergency evacuation plans, environmental siting, resilience and terrain considerations.

Provides states with more flexibility to determine when their system is built out allowing NEVI funds to be used on public roads statewide.

Examples of Rescinded Language:

Plans should be developed and updated through engagement with rural, underserved, and disadvantaged communities to ensure that diverse views are heard and considered throughout the planning process, and to ensure that the deployment, installation, operation, and use of EV charging infrastructure achieves equitable and fair distribution of benefits and services.

Plans should explain how the State will deliver projects under the NEVI Formula Program that, consistent with Executive Order (E.O) 14008 and the Interim Justice40 Guidance issued by the White House and USDOT, target at least 40 percent of the benefits towards disadvantaged communities.

The Plan should also demonstrate how the implementation will promote strong labor, safety, training, and installation standards as well as opportunities for the participation of small businesses, including minority-owned and women-owned small businesses.

The Plan should also address emergency and evacuation needs, snow removal and seasonal needs, and ways for EV charging to support those needs. The Plan should also describe strategies for resilience for operation during emergencies and extreme weather.

I took a tour through a few 10Q reports this week to get a sense of how EV makers like Rivian and Lucid (or even legacy automakers that also sell EVs) feel about the one-two punch of tariffs and the end of the federal tax credit. Although these documents are loaded with legalese, it’s clear that both economic developments are on the minds of their respective executive teams.

Rivian and Lucid both make specific and multiple mentions of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA) in the risk factors section of their 10Qs. The OBBBA eliminates certain tax credits for EV buyers and essentially devalues the zero-emissions regulatory credit market. Tariffs and trade policy risks also make cameos.

Lucid notes in its 10Q that it is assessing the impact of OBBBA. “If any of the Company’s suppliers, sub-suppliers or partners experience financial distress, insolvency or disruptions in operations, they may be unable to fulfill their obligations or meet the Company’s production and quality requirements.” Meanwhile, Rivian tries to strike a “glass half full” tone by noting that 45X tax credit for domestic battery production remains.

Ford and GM also make mention of the OBBBA, although both spend more time talking about the potential effects of tariffs. GM says it’s unable to estimate the financial impacts of the OBBBA, but notes it “could be material and may adversely affect electric vehicle profitability.”

Here’s the unfortunate upshot (and potential third punch): A new 100% import tariff on semiconductor chips could squeeze automakers even more. Anyone who paid attention during the COVID pandemic remembers how supply constraints on chips hurt automakers. Industry experts estimate that a modern vehicle contains more than 1,000 — and in some cases more than 3,000 — chips. None of these companies want to go through this again.

The question is how they will qualify for exemptions; the Trump administration said it will award them to companies that manufacture the chips domestically. Automakers don’t typically make chips, which means these companies may all turn to domestic suppliers. This is, of course, a TBD scenario since the administration has a history of changing policy, and it has yet to provide details on this 100% tariff and exactly how to secure an exemption.

The end result is uncertainty, the wet blanket of any enterprise.

A little bird

You would think that a trade war with China and concerns about protecting American technology would discourage Chinese companies from setting up shop in the U.S. But lately, I have heard some chatter from a few birds in the industry that Chinese companies, specifically those working on autonomous vehicle technology or adjacent tech, are repatriating to the United States. Stay tuned as I dig into this one.

Deals!

Remember Blade, the helicopter ride-share business? The urban air-mobility business, which went public via a merger with a blank-check company, enjoyed its fair share of buzz and controversy since its founding in 2014.

And now it’s owned by electric air-taxi developer Joby Aviation. The deal is worth up to $125 million and includes the Blade brand and its passenger business, which has operations in the United States and Europe. Blade’s medical division isn’t included in the transaction and will remain a separate company.

Blade founder and CEO Rob Wiesenthal will continue to lead the business, which will operate as a wholly owned subsidiary of Joby.

I wasn’t exactly expecting this deal, but it sure does make sense. Blade has sought partnerships with other electric aircraft companies, including Wisk. And Joby will need the infrastructure if it wants to ramp up commercial operations — once its electric aircraft receives the Type Certification from the Federal Aviation Administration.

The deal gives Joby instant access to a network of 12 terminals in key markets like New York City — notably, a dedicated lounge and terminal bases at John F. Kennedy International Airport and Newark Liberty International Airport, as well as in Manhattan’s West Side and East Side and on Wall Street.

Other deals that got my attention this week …

Drone startupDestinus, which supplies weapons to Ukraine, plans to buy Daedalean, a Swiss company developing autopilot systems for aviation. The deal is reportedly for $223 million in cash and stock.

Jeh Aerospace, an Indian aerospace component-manufacturing company with headquarters in Atlanta, raised $11 million in a Series A round led by Elevation Capital, with participation from General Catalyst.

Uzum, the Uzbekistan-based express food delivery and fintech startup, raised $65.5 million in a round co-led by China’s Tencent and the New York- and London-based VR Capital, with participation from U.S.-based FinSight Ventures.

Notable reads and other tidbits

Foxconn has sold a former GM factory (and surrounding land) for $88 million and machinery and equipment from its EV subsidiaries for around $287 million. Reminder: Foxconn never managed to scale production of EVs at the plant after three years of ownership. So what is to come of this factory? The buyer is reportedly SoftBank, and the plan is to turn this factory into an AI data center.

Lyft made a strategic partnership with Baidu to deploy the Chinese tech giant’s Apollo Go autonomous vehicles across several European markets. The companies want to launch robotaxi services in Germany and the United Kingdom in 2026.

Rivian filed a lawsuit to be able to sell its electric vehicles directly to consumers in Ohio. The company claims existing law unfairly benefits Tesla, which received a special exemption.

Read this: A stunning and data-rich report on Uber’s sexual assault problem.

Zoox has received an exemption from federal safety regulators to demonstrate its custom-built robotaxis on public roads. There is some considerable backstory here, so I recommend reading my article. TL;DR: This clears up a long-standing debate over whether Zoox robotaxis complied with federal motor vehicle safety standards. It also puts an end to a related investigation into whether the Amazon-owned company had sidestepped federal regulations.

The Tesla news cycle just won’t quit. And for some, it may feel contradictory. The company’s board of directors approved a new compensation package for CEO Elon Musk worth around $29 billion in shares, with the company citing the “ever-intensifying AI talent war and Tesla’s position at a critical inflection point” as reasons for the payout. Meanwhile, Tesla, which has seen automotive revenues drop, is pushing to turn its AI and autonomy ambitions into moneymakers.

Two developments this week have chipped away at those aspirations. First, Tesla has shuttered its Dojo supercomputer program, ending its bid to develop in-house chips for driverless technology. And separately, a jury found Tesla partly to blame for a fatal 2019 crash and ordered it to pay around $242.5 million in punitive and compensatory damages. It’s a notable case in which plaintiffs successfully argued there is a gap between how Tesla talks about its Autopilot driver-assistance system and its actual capabilities. (The Verge has an interesting interview with the attorney.)

Video Link: https://youtu.be/DCoig7HFHEE

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) just set in motion one of the most significant policy shifts in the auto industry in over a decade. On Tuesday, EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin announced a proposal to rescind the 2009 “Endangerment Finding,” the legal linchpin that’s been used for 16 years to justify federal greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions rules affecting every car, truck, and bus sold in America.

If finalized, the move would dismantle more than $1 trillion in regulatory mandates, including President Biden’s electric vehicle (EV) requirements, and restore consumer choice to a market long shaped by unelected regulators. It would also end unpopular mandates like engine start-stop systems and EV infrastructure requirements, changes automakers say have driven up costs for everyone.

Why this proposal matters

The 2009 Endangerment Finding gave the EPA sweeping authority under the Clean Air Act to regulate six greenhouse gases, including carbon dioxide, as a threat to public health and welfare. That finding opened the door for aggressive tailpipe emissions standards, which in turn pushed automakers toward EVs and away from traditional gasoline-powered models.

Biden’s 2024 rules require automakers to cut emissions in half by 2032 and predict that 35% to 56% of all new vehicles sold will be electric within a decade. Several states, led by California, have gone further, imposing bans on new gasoline-only vehicles by 2035.

Critics say these mandates amount to an EV requirement Congress never approved, relying on questionable climate models and flawed legal reasoning.

The $1 trillion question

The EPA estimates that rolling back the Endangerment Finding would eliminate over $1 trillion in compliance costs. For years, automakers have had to re-engineer vehicles to meet complex mandates, passing much of that cost on to buyers.

Industry groups like the American Trucking Association argue Biden’s electric truck mandate alone would have crippled supply chains, driven up delivery costs, and hurt American families.

Indiana Governor Mike Braun summed it up: “We can protect our environment and support American jobs at the same time. For too long, Washington has acted as if those two goals are mutually exclusive.”

Legal footing and next steps

The EPA says recent Supreme Court rulings, including West Virginia v. EPA and Loper Bright v. Raimondo, make clear that sweeping economic mandates must come from Congress, not agencies acting alone.

Here’s the road ahead:

• Public comments open until Sept. 21, 2025: Submit feedback at regulations.gov (Docket ID No. EPA-HQ-OAR-2025-0194).

• Final rulemaking: The proposal will be reviewed and must pass White House Office of Management and Budget approval.

• Legal challenges: Expect lawsuits from California, allied states, and environmental groups, which could push the fight to the Supreme Court.

What this could mean for drivers

If finalized and upheld in court, the change could:

• End Biden’s EV mandate.

• Lower vehicle costs by removing expensive compliance tech.

• Restore the freedom to choose gasoline, hybrid, or electric.

• Block California from enforcing stricter rules than federal standards.

Why your voice matters

This 45-day comment period is one of the few opportunities for everyday Americans to influence national auto policy. Whether you’re concerned about EV mandates, start-stop technology, or regulatory costs hidden in your next car payment, now is the time to speak up.

Submit your comments by Sept. 21 and make your voice part of the record. Details for the August 19–20 virtual hearings (with a possible August 21 session) are on the EPA website.

The bigger picture

The Endangerment Finding has underpinned every major GHG rule since 2009. Rescinding it wouldn’t end environmental protection, but it would shift authority back to Congress and the states.

Supporters say it’s about restoring accountability and market choice. Opponents say it will stall climate progress and vow to fight in court.

Either way, this decision could redefine the future of driving in America. The question is: will drivers have the final say?

Small modular reactor company NuScale Power aims to have “hard contracts” with “two or three major customers” by the end of 2025, CEO John Hopkins told investors and analysts on Thursday.

Hopkins’ comments came as the company reported a significant jump in expenses in its Q2 2025 earnings update. It attributed the change to “higher business development costs associated with NuScale’s transition from a research and development-based company to a commercial company.”

Though NuScale and its developer partner Entra1 have yet to finalize a deal, “we’re getting inundated now” with prospective customers following the Nuclear Regulatory Commission’s May 29 approval of NuScale’s 77-MW power module, Hopkins said.

Dive Insight:

NuScale’s 77-MW module supplanted an earlier 50-MW design the NRC approved in 2023. Some prospective customers had been in a holding pattern as the commission considered NuScale’s application for the uprated module, Hopkins said, adding, “It was accomplished. We’re there.”

NuScale Chief Financial Officer Ramsey Hamady said the May approval puts NuScale in a class by itself among advanced nuclear technology companies.“We’re the only company with two NRC approvals for small modular reactors. There’s no other company with even one … and there [were] a lot of people out there doubting [us], saying, ‘Hey, you’re not gonna get through.’”

For NuScale, the NRC decision amplified regulatory tailwinds supporting the wider nuclear industry, Hamady said.

In an investor presentation Thursday, NuScale executives said four executive orders President Donald Trump signed in May would shorten regulatory timelines for new reactor deployments, bolster domestic nuclear supply chains and enable reactor development on military and other government-owned lands.

The Trump administration “is pressed to get success stories quickly” on new nuclear deployments, Hopkins said, and it has “a limited period of time to make that happen.” That bodes well for NuScale and other advanced nuclear companies, he said.

Hopkins’ comments about notching one or more customer deals by the end of the year echo recent company guidance and his comments on NuScale’s two previous quarterly earnings calls.

In March, NuScale said it was in “advanced commercial dialogue with major technology and industrial companies, utilities, and national and local governments.” In May, Hopkins said the company was “in the process of submitting and negotiating term sheets” with potential customers.

Hopkins and Hamady said Thursday that customer interest has increased since May, led by large technology companies, utilities and the U.S. military. NuScale also continues early work as a subcontractor on Fluor Corp.’s proposed 462-MW power plant in Romania, though the timeline for that project has slipped; NuScale now expects a final investment decision in late 2026 or early 2027, Hopkins added.

Neither executive nor any of the stock analysts on the call mentioned an independent developer’s proposal to build a 462-MW nuclear power plant in southern Idaho using NuScale’s technology.

Sawtooth Energy and Development proposes using six of NuScale’s 77-MW modules to power the plant, according to local news reports and a draft environmental impact statement. Project manager Dan Adamson said in an email last month that the company had “talked with NuScale, and [we] like their equipment and design, but [we have] no written deal as of yet.”

A NuScale spokesperson told Utility Dive that “we are not engaged with Sawtooth Energy and Development Corp.” and that NuScale “remains committed to working with our exclusive partner, Entra1, to commercialize, deploy, and distribute” its reactors.

The relationship with Entra1 gives end users of NuScale technology more operational flexibility than they would have if they owned and operated their own power plants, Hopkins said Thursday. They can simply purchase power from Entra1 or through a utility, he said.

“It’s like buying a computer with an Intel chip,” Hamady added. “We’re the Intel chip inside — in this case, [inside] the power plants” that Entra1 builds and, in some cases, may own and operate, he said.

In that sense, it’s more accurate to say Entra1 is NuScale’s customer rather than an end user like a hyperscaler or a utility, Hamady said.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/yuhxhW9vGXomdrqx5tlvJbENad-JVT5wnJfJPePsQT8/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9UcnVja0lsbHVzdHJhdGlvbkZpbmFsX09yaWdpbmFsU2l6ZS5qcGc=.webp,N,,2025-08-11 13:07:57.582712

By Brenne Sheehan

On July 4, President Donald Trump signed the Republican-backed budget reconciliation bill known as the “One Big, Beautiful Bill Act” (OBBBA) into law.

The sweeping legislation includes hundreds of provisions aimed at reducing what Republicans describe as wasteful federal spending. The new law expands first-Trump-term-era tax cuts, slashes federal funding to programs like Medicaid and SNAP, and allocates hundreds of billions of funding to immigration and border patrol agencies.

The Congressional Budget Office projects the new law will add $3.4 trillion to the public debt and boost the USA’s GDP by 0.5% by 2034.

In the Adirondack Park, where 215,000 residents rely on Medicaid and 70,000 receive SNAP benefits—the “Big, Beautiful Bill” stands to bring sweeping changes.

Here’s a breakdown of some of the OBBBA’s biggest provisions, and what it could mean for the Adirondack Park.

Tax cuts

The “Big, Beautiful Bill” makes permanent several provisions from 2017 tax cuts, which were set to expire in 2025. These include the 37% top individual tax rate, the nearly doubled standard deduction, the estate & gift tax exemptions, and the 20% qualified business income deduction.

The law also temporarily raises the current $10,000 cap on state and local tax (SALT) deductions to $40,000—benefiting mostly high-income taxpayers who itemize their deductions. It increases the child tax credit from $2,000 to $2,200 per child and adds a new $6,000 standard deduction for seniors.

The bill allows workers earning under $150,000 annually to deduct up to $25,000 in tips and overtime pay from their taxable income, though this provision expires in 2028.

Car buyers who purchase vehicles manufactured in the U.S. can now deduct up to $10,000 in auto loan interest annually, through 2028. It also eliminates a $200 tax placed on suppressors and short-barreled rifles, which was passed in the 1934 National Firearms Act.

At a town hall event held July 20 in Plattsburgh, U.S. Rep Paul Tonko criticized the tax cuts, saying they will only benefit the wealthy in the long run.

“When it comes to taxes, the contrast couldn’t be starker. Permanent tax cuts for the rich while working families get temporary crumbs that barely make a difference,” Tonko said. “No tax on tips, no tax on overtime just to live around for two to three years. That’s unfair. Those billionaires are going to have their tax cut forever.”

Cuts to Medicaid

The OBBBA introduces new work requirements and reapplication timeframes that will reduce the amount of Medicaid recipients. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates the law will reduce federal Medicaid spending by $911 billion, leaving 11.8 million people uninsured by 2034. An additional 5.1 million people could lose coverage due to other policy changes, including the expiration of enhanced ACA premium tax credits. A report by the Kaiser Family Foundation predicts federal Medicaid spending in rural areas will decrease by $155 billion over the next 10 years.

About 215,000 North Country residents living in the 21st Congressional District are beneficiaries of Medicaid.

Under the new law, adults under the age of 65 must complete 80 hours per month of work, education or community service. Previously, there was no work requirement to be eligible.

There are exceptions for special circumstances, such as people with physical disabilities, pregnant women and parents with children under 14. States will now have to check recipients’ eligibility every six months instead of once a year.

Under the “Big, Beautiful Bill,” families earning 100–138% of the federal poverty level (which is about $15,460 per person in 2025) can now be charged up to $35 per medical service covered by Medicaid.

The new law also reduces the cap on state Medicaid provider taxes from 6% to 3.5% by 2031, which limits a state’s ability to make up lost revenue from federal spending.

Local healthcare providers, such as CEOs from the park’s three rural hospitals, and HCNC director John Rugge have warned the cuts to Medicaid would be devastating for the region, which is relatively older and lower-income.

Hospital officials find hope in the law’s Rural Healthcare Program, which allocates $10 billion annually for the next ten years across all 50 states to fund rural hospitals, outpatient programs and other expenses — specifically $10 billion annually from 2026-2030 ($50 billion total over five years).

In a previous statement to Adirondack Explorer, a spokesperson for Stefanik said the changes to Medicaid aren’t cuts at all — but rather, changes to eliminate wasteful spending for undocumented immigrants with emergency Medicaid.

Cuts to SNAP

Changes in eligibility requirements and redistributed federal funding cut $187 billion from SNAP by 2035, potentially affecting over 3 million participants, according to the CBO.

Similar to Medicaid eligibility, SNAP recipients ages 18–64 will have to work 80 hours per month to keep benefits, up from the previous age cap of 54. There are exceptions for parents with children under 14, pregnant women and people with certain disabilities.

States with error rates above 6% — meaning over- or under-payment to recipients — must now cover up to 15% more of SNAP costs.. New York had an error rate of 14% in 2024.

The Fiscal Policy Institute reports that New York will need to spend an additional $2.1 billion annually to maintain current SNAP benefits. The “Big, Beautiful Bill” could jeopardize SNAP benefits for more than 1 million New Yorkers including 363,000 children, according to FPI.

New York Gov. Kathy Hochul has said that she plans to make cuts to state agencies in order to backfill $750 million in losses to healthcare and SNAP benefits.

Food banks in Northeastern New York are concerned that the cuts to SNAP will worsen the North Country’s existing food insecurity. Republicans who voted in favor of the bill, such as U.S. Rep. Elise Stefanik, who represents New York’s 21st congressional district which includes the Adirondack Park, says the bill cuts “wasteful and fraudulent spending.”

Phasing out green tax credits

Some green tax credits for wind, solar and electric vehicle projects outlined in the Biden-era Inflation Reduction act will be phased out by 2030, which could present additional challenges for renewable energy developers in the Adirondacks.

The law’s electric vehicle tax credit will be phased out by September 2025. Credits for EV charging stations will be phased out by next summer. Wind and solar projects that begin construction by June or start operating by the end of 2027 will qualify for tax credits; projects after those deadlines won’t.

Stefanik said the OBBBA will “unleash American energy dominance” in a July 3 press release.

Spending on immigration and defense agencies

The “Big, Beautiful Bill” boosts federal spending by $320 billion—$170 billion for Immigration and Customs Enforcement and border patrol, and $150 billion for military and defense.The OBBBA allocates $170 billion for ICE and border patrol over multiple years, with ICE’s budget projected to exceed $100 billion by 2029, making it the most heavily funded law enforcement agency in U.S. history.

Stefanik highlighted the spending increase in a press release, where she said the increase would “support hiring 10,000 new ICE officers to deport illegal aliens from sanctuary cities.”

The OBBBA also introduces several new fees for immigrant documentation.

It imposes a $100 fee to apply for asylum, a form of international protection for individuals fleeing persecution in their home countries. In addition, there is a $550 fee to apply for employment authorization for asylum seekers and immigrants on humanitarian parole, as well as a $500 fee to apply for Temporary Protected Status. It also increases travel visa fees to $250, from $185.

Affordable housing benefits

The OBBBA will make it easier for developers to develop affordable housing projects, with a permanent expansion of the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit and a reduction to the bond test threshold.

Starting in 2026, states will receive a 12% increase in their annual 9% housing credit allocations, which expands the opportunity for housing projects to receive federal funding. The new law also lowers the bond financing threshold from 50% to 25% — meaning developers can now qualify for the 4% low-income housing tax credit with less of the project’s cost paid for using tax-exempt bonds.

Novogradac estimates the new law could oversee 1.22 million additional affordable rental homes by 2035.

Additional provisions

The OBBBA includes hundreds of provisions. Think a provision not mentioned here might affect the Adirondack Park? Let us know: editor@adirondackexplorer.org.

An overarching goal is to get data center developers to put their money where their mouth is.","Amid rising electric bills, states are under pressure to insulate regular household and business ratepayers from the costs of feeding Big Tech‘s energy-hungry data centers.

It’s not clear that any state has a solution and the actual effect of data centers on electricity bills is difficult to pin down. Some critics question whether states have the spine to take a hard line against tech behemoths like Microsoft, Google, Amazon and Meta.

But more than a dozen states have begun taking steps as data centers drive a rapid build-out of power plants and transmission lines.

That has meant pressuring the nation’s biggest power grid operator to clamp down on price increases, studying the effect of data centers on electricity bills or pushing data center owners to pay a larger share of local transmission costs.

Rising power bills are “something legislators have been hearing a lot about. It’s something we’ve been hearing a lot about. More people are speaking out at the public utility commission in the past year than I’ve ever seen before,” said Charlotte Shuff of the Oregon Citizens’ Utility Board, a consumer advocacy group. “There’s a massive outcry.”

Not the typical electric customer

Some data centers could require more electricity than cities the size of Pittsburgh, Cleveland or New Orleans, and make huge factories look tiny by comparison. That’s pushing policymakers to rethink a system that, historically, has spread transmission costs among classes of consumers that are proportional to electricity use.

“A lot of this infrastructure, billions of dollars of it, is being built just for a few customers and a few facilities and these happen to be the wealthiest companies in the world,” said Ari Peskoe, who directs the Electricity Law Initiative at Harvard University. “I think some of the fundamental assumptions behind all this just kind of breaks down.”

A fix, Peskoe said, is a “can of worms” that pits ratepayer classes against one another.

Some officials downplay the role of data centers in pushing up electric bills.

Tricia Pridemore, who sits on Georgia’s Public Service Commission and is president of the National Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners, pointed to an already tightened electricity supply and increasing costs for power lines, utility poles, transformers and generators as utilities replace aging equipment or harden it against extreme weather.

The data centers needed to accommodate the artificial intelligence boom are still in the regulatory planning stages, Pridemore said, and the Data Center Coalition, which represents Big Tech firms and data center developers, has said its members are committed to paying their fair share.

But growing evidence suggests that the electricity bills of some Americans are rising to subsidize the massive energy needs of Big Tech as the U.S. competes in a race against China for artificial intelligence superiority.

Data and analytics firm Wood Mackenzie published a report in recent weeks that suggested 20 proposed or effective specialized rates for data centers in 16 states it studied aren’t nearly enough to cover the cost of a new natural gas power plant.

In other words, unless utilities negotiate higher specialized rates, other ratepayer classes — residential, commercial and industrial — are likely paying for data center power needs.

Meanwhile, Monitoring Analytics, the independent market watchdog for the mid-Atlantic grid, produced research in June showing that 70% — or $9.3 billion — of last year’s increased electricity cost was the result of data center demand.

States are responding

Last year, five governors led by Pennsylvania’s Josh Shapiro began pushing back against power prices set by the mid-Atlantic grid operator, PJM Interconnection, after that amount spiked nearly sevenfold. They warned of customers “paying billions more than is necessary.”

PJM has yet to propose ways to guarantee that data centers pay their freight, but Monitoring Analytics is floating the idea that data centers should be required to procure their own power.

In a filing last month, it said that would avoid a “massive wealth transfer” from average people to tech companies.

At least a dozen states are eyeing ways to make data centers pay higher local transmission costs.

In Oregon, a data center hot spot, lawmakers passed legislation in June ordering state utility regulators to develop new — presumably higher — power rates for data centers.

The Oregon Citizens’ Utility Board says there is clear evidence that costs to serve data centers are being spread across all customers — at a time when some electric bills there are up 50% over the past four years and utilities are disconnecting more people than ever.

New Jersey’s governor signed legislation last month commissioning state utility regulators to study whether ratepayers are being hit with “unreasonable rate increases” to connect data centers and to develop a specialized rate to charge data centers.

In some other states, like Texas and Utah, governors and lawmakers are trying to avoid a supply-and-demand crisis that leaves ratepayers on the hook — or in the dark.

Doubts about states protecting ratepayers

In Indiana, state utility regulators approved a settlement between Indiana Michigan Power Co., Amazon, Google, Microsoft and consumer advocates that set parameters for data center payments for service.

Kerwin Olsen, of the Citizens Action Council of Indiana, a consumer advocacy group, signed the settlement and called it a “pretty good deal” that contained more consumer protections than what state lawmakers passed.

But, he said, state law doesn’t force large power users like data centers to publicly reveal their electric usage, so pinning down whether they’re paying their fair share of transmission costs “will be a challenge.”

In a March report, the Environmental and Energy Law Program at Harvard University questioned the motivation of utilities and regulators to shield ratepayers from footing the cost of electricity for data centers.

Both utilities and states have incentives to attract big customers like data centers, it said.

To do it, utilities — which must get their rates approved by regulators — can offer “special deals to favored customers” like a data center and effectively shift the costs of those discounts to regular ratepayers, the authors wrote. Many state laws can shield disclosure of those rates, they said.

In Pennsylvania, an emerging data center hot spot, the state utility commission is drafting a model rate structure for utilities to consider adopting. An overarching goal is to get data center developers to put their money where their mouth is.

“We’re talking about real transmission upgrades, potentially hundreds of millions of dollars,” commission chairman Stephen DeFrank said. “And that’s what you don’t want the ratepayer to get stuck paying for.”

Minnesota Power, a utility division of ALLETE, Inc., announced plans last week to construct Longspur Wind, a 200 megawatt (MW) project in North Dakota, as part of its “EnergyForward” transition toward a carbon-free energy future. The 45-turbine project is in Morton and Mercer counties near Minnesota Power’s Bison Wind Energy Center. The wind site will tie into existing Minnesota Power infrastructure in the area and utilize the company’s 465-mile high-voltage, direct-current (HVDC) transmission line to deliver renewable wind energy from North Dakota to northern Minnesota.

The project is one of many, including two large regional solar projects and a number of significant transmission projects, that Minnesota Power and ALLETE are investing in to achieve 90% renewable energy by 2035 and meet Minnesota’s carbon-free energy standard.

“The enormous scope and scale of a successful energy transition require significant investment in new infrastructure and generation both to reduce carbon and to safeguard the reliable service that powers homes, schools, hospitals, businesses and our regional economy,” said ALLETE CEO Bethany Owen. “Longspur is part of the approximately $5B in investments we will be making over the next five years to serve our region.”

“This exciting project illustrates the importance of our proposed acquisition by experienced long-term investors CPP Investments and GIP,” Owen added. “These investors’ commitment to provide capital as part of this transaction will help us build projects like Longspur and secure our ability to achieve a truly sustainable clean-energy future.”

Construction is expected to begin in 2026, contingent on regulatory approvals in North Dakota and Minnesota. Projected to be operational in late 2027. Minnesota Power says Longspur will be eligible for full federal production tax credits.

The Longspur project was chosen in an open process from competitive bids in Minnesota Power’s 2024 wind request for proposals. An independent evaluator monitored the process and concurred with the selection as the most cost-competitive for Minnesota Power customers.

“This project highlights Minnesota Power’s EnergyForward commitment to customers to keep bills as low as possible as we advance a reliable, resilient sustainable clean-energy transition,” stated Josh Skelton, ALLETE vice president and Minnesota Power chief operating officer. “Longspur Wind’s use of existing infrastructure, such as a substation and transmission line, also reduces costs for customers now and in the future.”

Longspur Wind is expected to generate significant economic benefits for the region. During construction, the project will create hundreds of union jobs, providing a boost to local economies. Once operational, it will contribute millions of dollars in tax revenue to support local schools, infrastructure, and community services. Additionally, Minnesota Power says all participating landowners will receive consistent payments, creating a steady source of income for rural communities.

Public meetings and information sessions will be held to provide updates on Longspur and gather feedback from community members and local stakeholders throughout the development and construction process.

Minnesota Power became the first electric utility in Minnesota to deliver 50% renewable energy to customers in 2020. The addition of 200 MW of wind energy will help the utility meet its EnergyForward target of delivering 80% renewable energy by 2030, further solidifying its leadership in renewable energy development in the Upper Midwest.

ALLETE’s Acquisition

In May 2024, ALLETE entered into an agreement to be acquired by a partnership led by Canada Pension Plan Investment Board (CPPIB) and Global Infrastructure Partners (GIP) to advance its ‘sustainability-in-action’ strategy. The deal is expected to close later this year, subject to approval by the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission and other customary closing conditions.

ALLETE and the Minnesota Department of Commerce recently entered into a settlement agreement related to the transaction that has been submitted to the MPUC for consideration as part of its overall review of the acquisition. The transaction has achieved all other required approvals, including from ALLETE shareholders, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, and the Public Service Commission of Wisconsin (PSC).

The process works by introducing billions of nanobubbles into liquid coatings during thin-film manufacturing.
Moleaer claims this approach stabilizes inks, improves dispersion, and optimizes pore size distribution, resulting in films with consistent porosity and finer particle sizes.
“Nanobubbles act like invisible scaffolding,” said Dr. Mohamed Abdelrahman, Senior R&D Application Engineer at Moleaer.
The process is compatible with existing coating techniques, which the company says will allow for straightforward adoption.","Moleaer has announced a patent-pending method that integrates nanobubbles into the fabrication of thin films used in lithium-ion batteries, proton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cells, and electrolyzers. According to Moleaer, this chemical-free, non-invasive process increases the porosity and uniformity of thin films, directly impacting the efficiency, durability, and power output of devices critical to electric vehicles and clean energy systems.

The process works by introducing billions of nanobubbles into liquid coatings during thin-film manufacturing. Moleaer claims this approach stabilizes inks, improves dispersion, and optimizes pore size distribution, resulting in films with consistent porosity and finer particle sizes. For PEM fuel cell cathode catalyst layers—relevant to electric vehicle powertrains and portable systems—the technique reportedly enables up to 20 percent more power output from the same active area, supporting reduced component size and cost per watt.

Moleaer says performance gains extend to other applications: PEM electrolyzer anode catalyst layers for green hydrogen production demonstrated a 17 percent improvement in current density at operational voltages, while lithium-ion nickel-manganese-cobalt (NMC) cathodes showed improved capacity retention and high-rate performance. The technology also delivered a 66 percent increase in permeability for ultrafiltration membranes, which could reduce energy consumption in water treatment.

“Thin films are foundational to clean energy and water technologies, yet traditional manufacturing methods limit how much performance we can unlock from them,” said Nick Dyner, CEO of Moleaer. “Our nanobubble-enabled process addresses those limitations, without changing formulas or processes, delivering gains in power, efficiency, and sustainability.”

Moleaer reports that the process has been independently validated and peer-reviewed, confirming reliable integration of nanobubbles into production lines and improved nanoscale material organization. “Nanobubbles act like invisible scaffolding,” said Dr. Mohamed Abdelrahman, Senior R&D Application Engineer at Moleaer. “They improve how materials self-organize during fabrication, leading to higher-performing films with less waste and fewer defects.”

Europe’s gas prices peaked at ten times their long-term average, and US gas prices at around triple their long-term average.
Germany, Europe’s largest economy, has been in a recession for more than two years, with high energy prices a chief culprit.
Climate technologies that are already commercially viable could help, of course.
According to Bernd Heid, a senior partner at McKinsey & Company who leads its Platform for Climate Technologies, around 90% of climate technologies will be in the money by 2030 with a $100 carbon price.","For all the uncertainties generated by Donald Trump’s administration over the past six months, one thing is clear: “climate” technologies are out, and “energy” technologies are in. But while going along with this rhetorical shift may appease some, it should be recognized for what it is: a change in wording. The fundamental economic and technological forces that are pushing the world away from oil, coal, and gas and toward low-carbon, high-efficiency technologies have not abated.

Over the past two decades, climate change has been a leading item on the global agenda, driving efforts to deploy technologies that will reduce carbon dioxide emissions. Those efforts are now facing headwinds, and not just in the United States. Geopolitical developments elsewhere, like Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, have called attention to the importance of energy affordability and security over other considerations.

Policymakers in the US, Europe, and elsewhere initially responded to the war by doubling down on the shift from fossil fuels, and for good reason. Oil, coal, and gas are commodities whose prices will always be linked to geopolitical vagaries (that goes for not only global oil markets but also regional gas markets, which are increasingly linked by trade in liquefied natural gas).

As a case in point, the summer of 2022 brought massive inflation, largely driven by fossil-fuel price spikes. Europe’s gas prices peaked at ten times their long-term average, and US gas prices at around triple their long-term average. While the US Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 is widely considered a misnomer, history will judge the name kindly: The only permanent way to address such bouts with “fossilflation” is to stop using fossil fuels.

Though the blowback against climate policies has been particularly strong at the federal level in the US, Europe, too, has undergone a retrenchment. This is somewhat understandable, even if it is shortsighted. Germany, Europe’s largest economy, has been in a recession for more than two years, with high energy prices a chief culprit. Climate technologies that are already commercially viable could help, of course. But taking full advantage of the lower prices of solar, wind, and (increasingly) batteries requires a willingness to reform power markets and pass these savings to households and industrial consumers. It also calls for more upfront public investment, an area where climate priorities compete with other priorities like national security that are often perceived to be more immediate.

In grappling with these tradeoffs, the European Union delivered the kinds of efficiency measures that Trump’s “Department of Government Efficiency” (DOGE) had promised but failed to achieve. For example, Europe dialed back its carbon border adjustment mechanism by requiring 90% fewer companies to comply.

On the surface, this seems like a decisive blow to the goal of establishing a carbon tariff for imports, commensurate with Trump’s DOGE hatchet. But unlike Trump and Elon Musk, the EU ensured that the remaining 10% of importers still accounted for over 90% of emissions. This outcome is far from ideal when viewed solely through a climate lens. But viewed from a broader climate-economic perspective, it is exactly the kind of surgical intervention that DOGE promised but never delivered.

Still, fiddling at the climate-policy margins ignores the bigger picture. While Europe and America are taking steps back, China is leaping forward. It alone accounted for over 40% of the record $2.1 trillion of global investment in the energy transition last year – more than the EU, the United Kingdom, and the US combined.

The balance is even more lopsided for specific clean-energy technologies. China produces around 75% of the world’s solar panels and 80% of its lithium-ion batteries. That dominance is the result of a concerted green industrial policy, in which innovation plays a key role. The claim that China only manufactures and assembles is woefully outdated. China’s electric vehicles, for example, are second to none. BYD, the country’s leading carmaker, recently unveiled a groundbreaking charging system capable of adding 470 kilometers (292 miles) of range in just five minutes, putting the company in a league of its own globally.

China’s dominance extends to technologies that are not yet competitive without price support. LONGi, one of the world’s top solar manufacturers, formed LONGi Hydrogen in 2021 to pursue green hydrogen production. It now leads the world in electrolyzer manufacturing capacity.

These are not isolated examples. China’s ambitious industrial policy has helped lift five other Chinese hydrogen companies into the global top ten. Have Europe and the US already lost this race for the future?

While the US now seems hellbent on turning itself into a petrostate, the EU has a chance to revive its clean-energy fortunes. It is even starting with a significant policy advantage: a CO2 price hovering around $100 per metric ton means that most low-carbon technologies – from clean electrons and electrification to clean molecules like biofuels – are already economically viable. Others, like green hydrogen, will need further support to help climb the learning curve and slide down the cost curve. According to Bernd Heid, a senior partner at McKinsey & Company who leads its Platform for Climate Technologies, around 90% of climate technologies will be in the money by 2030 with a $100 carbon price.

While China dominates with six top-ten global players, three of the others are European. The Swedish startup Stegra is building the world’s first low-carbon steel plant using electrolyzers made by ThyssenKrupp Nucera, in which the German steelmaker has a majority stake.

Despite recent political developments, the US, too, has shown that rapid change is possible. Although breaking China’s solar manufacturing dominance will be difficult, the US has made significant inroads just over the past three years. Earlier this year, it exceeded 50 gigawatts of panel manufacturing capacity, a fivefold increase since 2022. These 50 GW in panel supply roughly matched US demand.

True, onshoring the solar supply chain comes with costs that can be justified only by priorities other than the climate, such as national security or promoting domestic manufacturing. But that is the point. If political conditions require stronger emphasis on technologies like geothermal and nuclear, and if technologies formerly known as “climate tech” must be relabeled as more neutral-sounding “energy tech,” so be it. The larger forces propelling us toward decarbonization remain the same.",https://business.columbia.edu/sites/default/files-efs/articles/images_upload/shutterstock_2488159045.jpg,N,,2025-08-11 12:07:36.598510

Rare earth elements are a group of 17 metallic elements used in a wide array of technologies.
China, which dominates the global production of rare earth elements, recently imposed export controls on seven elements, limiting U.S. access.
SEIA noted that there are no rare earth elements used directly in solar panels.
Without its own supply chain, the United States will remain vulnerable to geopolitical tensions and supply disruptions, it said.","Rare earth elements have been in the spotlight in recent U.S.-China trade negotiations. Rare earth elements are a group of 17 metallic elements used in a wide array of technologies.

As of 2024, the U.S. depends on imports for about 80% of its domestic demand. About 70% of those imports come directly from China.

China, which dominates the global production of rare earth elements, recently imposed export controls on seven elements, limiting U.S. access.

The lack of rare earth element access forced the United States to the negotiation table, leading to the states easing restrictions on China’s access to advanced data chips.

The Solar Energy Industry Association (SEIA) said the United States remains heavily dependent on China for access to these materials, many of which play important roles in the systems that support clean energy, like battery storage, inverters and grid technologies.

“While the two nations aim to temporarily ease export restrictions, this moment also highlights that America’s long-term energy security depends on building out our own rare earth mining and processing capabilities,” said SEIA in a statement.

SEIA noted that there are no rare earth elements used directly in solar panels. However, they are key components of inverters that convert electricity from DC to AC. It said specifically, yttrium, lanthanum and sometimes cerium oxide are used in ceramic capacitors, and neodymium is used in magnets for internal sensors and fans.

Grid-scale batteries use advanced cooling systems that include neodymium and dysprosium in the magnets that power fans and pumps for cooling. Other elements, like cerium and lanthanum, are used in sensors that monitor and manage battery temperature, said SEIA. It noted that while these elements are used in small amounts, with weights in the grams or milligrams, they remain important for grid-scale battery energy storage.

For grid infrastructure, rare earth elements play a role in sensors and actuators, motorized switches and tap changers, and in smart grid systems, substations and high-performance magnets. SEIA said despite limited applications, rare earth elements play an important role in grid modernization.

“China not only dominates the production of rare earths, but it also controls many of the refining and processing steps needed to turn raw minerals into usable components,” said SEIA. “In fact, even the one active, commercial-scale [rare earth element] mine in the U.S. — Mountain Pass Mine owned by MP Materials in California — still sends some of its output to China for final processing.”

SEIA said the recent trade talks in Stockholm between the United States and China may provide some short-term relief with the eased export restrictions. However, SEIA said the negotiations do not address the “central problem” that the United States lacks a reliable domestic supply chain that includes mining, refining and processing. Without its own supply chain, the United States will remain vulnerable to geopolitical tensions and supply disruptions, it said.

“The Trump administration has already taken steps to mobilize resources and expedite permitting for REE production, but more investment is needed to aggressively scale up,” said SEIA in a statement. “In the meantime, securing access to these materials through a trade agreement is essential to ensure the U.S. can continue manufacturing the technologies that power our electric grid, support national security, and drive economic growth.”",https://pv-magazine-usa.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/08/Rareearthoxides.jpg,N,,2025-08-11 12:07:40.007723

Sign up for our free newsletters.

HARRISBURG — Renewable energy developers say that the rollback of billions in tax credits for their industry will lead to higher costs for consumers, especially as the influx of data centers into Pennsylvania increases demand for power.

In July, President Donald Trump signed “big, beautiful” legislation that extended tax breaks to high earners by cutting federal funding for Medicaid and other social services.

The law also rolled back Biden-era tax credits for the renewable energy industry and homeowners making energy-efficient renovations.

Two of the largest tax credits — for building clean energy projects or generating power with low emissions — are now set to expire by the end of 2027, rather than nearly a decade later.

Experts say this will slow the growth of renewable energy projects and reduce the amount of power generated in the state, resulting in higher electricity bills for consumers. One report projected an annual increase of $130 per Pennsylvania household by 2030.

Rolling back these tax credits is just one part of the Trump administration’s move to crack down on the clean energy industry. Recently, Trump directed his U.S. Treasury secretary to issue guidance on the tax credit rollback process, and clean energy developers fear this will make it harder to claim the credits before they expire.

Currently, developers can claim credits for existing projects that begin construction before the end of 2026 or start operating before the end of 2027. And while those who spoke with Spotlight PA were hopeful about the industry’s long-term growth, developers said increased upfront construction costs in the short term will drive away business.

Aaron Nichols, a research and policy expert at Exact Solar, a Bucks County solar panel installation company, said the repeal of the tax credits is “less than ideal for clean energy companies.”

His company focuses on small-scale residential and commercial installations. Nichols said business has surged since the passage of the federal bill, driven by individuals rushing to claim a tax credit for residential installation before it expires at the end of the year.

“Homeowners who were kind of on the fence to invest in home solar are now doing it just as fast as they possibly can,” Nichols told Spotlight PA.

For long-term stability, his company is shifting its focus to tax credits with greater longevity. For instance, it is expanding its leasing program. The project lets companies pay the upfront construction costs of setting up solar panels on residential homes; homeowners get cheaper monthly electricity costs, and businesses can claim the production and investment tax credits.

Nichols predicted that the solar industry will continue to grow with or without tax credits, due to a significant rise in energy demand. Although the rollback of tax credits may temporarily slow business, Nichols thinks it won’t halt the industry’s growth.

“I think there’s going to be a short period where a lack of incentives is going to matter,” Nichols said of the tax credits. “And then I think we’re just going to keep going.”

Large-scale energy developers who build solar farms face a different set of challenges. They say the tax credit rollbacks won’t affect current projects but will make financing future work more difficult.

Edward Shelton, vice president of development at Vesper Energy, a Texas-based renewables developer that generates power for the grid, expects fundraising to become trickier. With tax credits available, developers need less initial funding to start a project.

“I can’t say that it won’t slow things down,” Shelton said. “Will it completely stifle the industry? It remains to be seen.”

Vesper is currently developing a solar farm in Bradford County that is expected to generate dozens of megawatts of power — roughly enough energy to power 120,000 homes for a year. The company also operates four other solar projects in the state. Shelton said the Bradford project is on track to break ground in time to qualify for the tax credit.

Developing projects takes five to six years, Shelton explained, during which the economic incentive landscape can shift. Tax credits could be reinstated, or equipment prices could fluctuate, making financing difficult to predict.

“If the tax credits were there, would we site even more projects? We probably would,” Shelton told Spotlight PA. “But it’s not like we are just stopping development of any early-stage project that we have.”

Matt Litchfield, vice president of external and regulatory affairs at Maryland-based natural gas and renewable energy developer Competitive Power Ventures, echoed Shelton, saying that tax credits will influence financing rather than project planning.

“It changes the pool of who and where is investing in the project, but it doesn’t change the overall investment figures themselves,” Litchfield said.

He noted that similar tax credits have expired before only to return a few years later, and said he has “no reason to think that will be any different” in this case. Considering increased energy demand from data centers, Litchfield said, he doesn’t think that “anyone is going to be choosy when they’re going to power their data centers,” regardless of any changes from the rollback.

Consumer electricity prices are already increasing as demand outstrips supply.

Sunsetting the tax credits further handicaps the industry at a time when the state needs more energy, said Evan Vaughan, the executive director of the Mid-Atlantic Renewable Energy Coalition, an organization representing utility-scale developers. He added that the increased costs to developers will be “baked in” to electricity prices for consumers for “several years to come.”

“It’s not a ‘sky is falling’ moment for wind and solar, but it does introduce new challenges and new uncertainty,” Vaughn told Spotlight PA. “We need certainty around building more energy if we’re going to win the AI race and if we’re going to keep prices reasonable for consumers.”",https://www.centredaily.com/public/latest-news/jsym9z/picture311663142/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1140/01k9-zzzz-np6z-hx63%20(2).jpeg,N,,2025-08-11 12:07:43.365806

They were concerned concrete dust and truck traffic would damage their quality of life and impede residential redevelopment in the area that borders North Corktown, just west of the Woodbridge neighborhood.

Residents mobilized against the proposed crusher. This is the story of how they stopped it.

One Detroit Senior Producer Bill Kubota and One Detroit Contributor Nicole Macdonald produced a documentary — shot over two years from late 2022 to 2024 — showing how residents and activists worked together to keep the concrete crusher out and prevent heavy industry from coming into the neighborhood in the future.

Health and environmental concerns

Core City is within eyeshot view of downtown Detroit, not far from The Station at Michigan Central, the iconic railroad depot recently restored by Ford Motor Company in Corktown.

There are many open fields on empty streets where houses used to be as well as urban farms, homes occupied by longtime residents and new homes with owners moving into the area.

In late 2022, residents were concerned about the environmental impact a crusher could have so they started a campaign to stop it from coming to Core City. Concrete crushing facilities are important for recycling materials that can be used to build new roads. Crushers in other neighborhoods have emitted dust, causing health concerns for nearby residents.

Kenneth Rosenman, MD, a professor of Occupational Medicine at Michigan State University, said being near facilities like concrete crushers could exacerbate health conditions such as asthma and emphysema.

“These should not be by schools, they should not be … in residential neighborhoods,” he said.

Other people nearby could also be impacted. Emissions from concrete facilities can travel one to two miles, BridgeDetroit reporter Jena Brooker said.

“It’s not just going to affect whatever neighborhood it’s going to go into,” she said. “It’s going to affect multiple neighborhoods.”

Campaign against the crusher underway

Vanessa Serna, a native of Toronto, Canada, moved to the Core City neighborhood in 2022.

“People like me move here,” Serna said. “And then this happens.”

She, like many others, didn’t want to live near a concrete crushing operation. Serna was instrumental in the fight to stop the crusher from coming to the neighborhood.

Core City residents got help from people in Detroit’s Grandmont Rosedale neighborhoods who successfully stopped an asphalt plant from operating there in 2021.

Pam Weinstein, a Grandmont Rosedale resident, said she contacted Serna when she learned about the proposed crusher in Core City.

“I wanted to share with her as many of the lessons that we had learned,” she said. “And as many of the strategies that worked for us.”

Stakeholders make their case

Others invested in the Core City community like urban farmer Andy Chae were also involved in the effort to keep to the crusher out.

Chae grows crops in Core City that he delivers to Detroit area restaurants.

“People always ask us: ‘Is the soil safe? What about the air pollution?’” Chae recounted. “These are all valid questions.”

Eleanor Parnell has been a Core City resident all her life. She lives about 600 feet away from the proposed crusher site and worried about noise and increased traffic.

Speaking at a rally in April 2023, Parnell said there are other things the neighborhood needed.

“We’re still attempting to get new housing and new stores and new businesses that are going to be beneficial for our neighborhood,” she said.

City officials respond

In July 2023, residents and activists boarded a bus headed for city hall. They appeared before Detroit’s Board of Zoning Appeals, arguing officials should deny an operating permit for the proposed concrete crusher.

“I’m happy you all showed up,” said Board of Zoning Appeals member Robert Thomas. “Typically, when people do not engage and they don’t show up, it could go the other way.”

While many Core City residents testified, nobody appeared in support of the crusher.

The board denied the permit, but the fight wasn’t over. Residents wanted to end any possibility the crusher could operate near them – now or in the future.

They campaigned to get their neighborhood rezoned. The change they pushed for, called downzoning, would permit light industry and residential properties and prohibit all heavy industry, including concrete crushers.

Ultimately, their strategy worked.

In April 2024, the Detroit City Planning Commission voted in favor of downzoning Core City. Five months later, in September 2024, Detroit City Council also approved the change, making it official.

People associated with the proposed crusher didn’t return messages left by One Detroit.

Reporter Jena Brooker, who has covered environmental issues for One Detroit’s media partner BridgeDetroit, said she has noticed residents are fighting back more lately against heavy industry.

“I do think that residents are becoming less tolerant of living so close to industry,” she said.

Core City moves forward

Since the zoning change, Core City has seen new development, including the opening of the acclaimed restaurant, Puma.

Chef Javier Bardauil, a native of Argentina and now a Core City resident, runs it and another restaurant nearby.

“I think it’s crazy to have a concrete crusher in the neighborhood,” he said.

Serna, who helped organize a campaign against the crusher, has since moved from Detroit. She said she’s not someone who likes to stay in one place too long.

Before leaving for the west coast in 2024, she talked about the fight to keep heavy industry out of Core City and said she hopes it sets a precedent.

“If you want to attract more people to come live here … then this is a no brainer,” she said.

Sandy Hopkins still lives nearby, proud of the campaign she was part of that Serna helped lead.

“Sometimes all it takes is one voice to inspire a community to give them confidence to fight for their own lives,” she said.

“We’re working on everything from vans to SUVs down to B-segment vehicles,” added Doug Field, head of EV operations at Ford.
Longer term, Farley has said on prior occasions, simplifying the EV manufacturing process will translate into reduced employment.
It is clear that the concepts underlying the Universal EV will, if successful, be adopted elsewhere within the company’s vast design, engineering, and manufacturing empire.
What’s yet to become clear is whether it will also show up at the Ford BlueOval City manufacturing complex in Tennessee.","More than a century after Henry Ford revolutionized the auto industry with the world’s first moving assembly line, the Detroit automaker announced Monday it has come up with a completely new way of designing, engineering and, yes, manufacturing automobiles.

The work of a small “skunkworks” team based out of Long Beach, Calif., the project was put in motion by Ford CEO Jim Farley last year in a desperate bid to slash the cost of bringing new EVs to market. And, if the $5 billion “Universal EV” project lives up to its billing, the automaker will begin rolling out a midsize battery-electric pickup in 2027 for about $30,000 — half the price of today’s typical EVs.

“We took a radical approach to a very hard challenge: Create affordable vehicles that delight customers in every way that matters — design, innovation, flexibility, space, driving pleasure, and cost of ownership — and do it with American workers,” Farley said Monday ahead of a news conference revealing the new EV program.

What’s New

An automobile is a complex product to design, engineer, and then assemble. It typically consists of tens of thousands of parts, everything from sheet metal to powertrains, and the countless fasteners needed to hold everything together.

And ever since Henry Ford switched on his first moving assembly line in Highland Park, Mich., in 1913, that “build of materials,” or BOM, has been put together one piece at a time as each vehicle rolls along a conveyor belt. There have been plenty of subtle tweaks to the process, occasionally big ones, like the Toyota Manufacturing System. But the one-piece-at-a-time approach continues to dominate.

Until now, anyway. Ford’s skunkworks team started by rethinking the EV itself, in key areas replacing dozens of individual steel parts with large aluminum “unicastings.” By repeating that process over and over, Ford claimed in a news release, it has come up with a system that “reduces parts by 20% versus a typical vehicle, with 25% fewer fasteners, 40% fewer workstations dock-to-dock in the plant, and 15% faster assembly time.”

Universal EV Platform

Ford’s approach isn’t entirely unique. The California-based team spent a lot of time benchmarking competitors ranging from Tesla — which has its own, large-scale “gigacasting” process — to China’s BYD. The trick is to combine it all together, as Ford is doing with its “Universal EV platform.”

Consider two examples:

By adopting a new electrical “architecture,” with centralized computer processing, the wiring harness sheds more than 4,000 feet of copper, saving weight and cost.

The battery pack uses lithium-iron-phosphate, or LFP, chemistry, rather than lithium-ion. There’s a small sacrifice in range but big savings in cost — and the chemistry is less prone to fire.

The Universal EV Production System

One of the biggest changes will take place at Ford’s old assembly plant in Louisville, Ky., which will undergo a $2 billion makeover. (Another $3 billion is going into the automaker’s new BlueOval Battery Park in Marshall, Mich.)

Instead of having a single moving assembly line, vehicles will start coming together on three adjacent sub-assemblies — one for the front of the vehicle, one for the rear, and a third for the battery pack — that only merge together relatively late in the manufacturing process.

And there’ll be other big changes. The LFP pack here becomes a structural part of the vehicle, further reducing complexity. Seats, carpets, consoles, and other parts will be assembled onto the upper part of the pack, which becomes the EV’s load floor.

The combined approach, said Ford, “could” mean the Kentucky plant will be able to roll out the midsize pickup “40% faster than Louisville Assembly Plant’s current vehicles,” which include the Ford Escape and Lincoln Corsair. But by adding other operations to the plant currently done elsewhere, the final production rate will be about 15% faster.

Ford Products in the Works

“We live and breathe continuous improvement, but sometimes you need a dramatic leap forward. We expect ergonomic breakthroughs and complexity reduction — through elimination of parts, connectors, and wire — will flow through to significant quality and cost wins,” said Bryce Currie, Ford vice president, Americas Manufacturing.

The project will get off the ground sometime in 2027, according to Alan Clarke, a former Tesla executive now leading Ford’s Advanced EV Development team, with what he described as a midsize pickup. That term is actually a bit misleading, however, as he added it will have an exterior footprint closer to that of a compact Ford Maverick but “more interior space than a (Toyota) RAV4.” And that’s before factoring in the Ford EV’s frunk and cargo bed.

Ford CEO Jim Farley went on to tell us that this new electric pickup “will be faster than a twin-turbo Mustang (EcoBoost)” and “be able to power your home for 6 days.”

The Universal EV Platform, meanwhile, will have the capability of being stretched or compressed in every dimension. Ford indicates the truck will be followed by various two- and three-row EVs, for starters. “We’re working on everything from vans to SUVs down to B-segment vehicles,” added Doug Field, head of EV operations at Ford.

They should start following a year or so after the pickup, several sources indicated, depending upon demand and whether Ford can avoid the sort of startup challenges it has faced on other recent programs.

Faster & Leaner = Fewer Jobs?

Ford said the new project will “create or secure” at least 4,000 jobs. The Louisville plant itself currently has more than 2,800 hourly workers on the payroll, and that will be cut to 2,200, Ford officials told GearJunkie. The others, explained spokesman Mark Truby, may take buyouts or move to other Ford facilities, such as the nearby Louisville Truck Plant.

Longer term, Farley has said on prior occasions, simplifying the EV manufacturing process will translate into reduced employment. It is clear that the concepts underlying the Universal EV will, if successful, be adopted elsewhere within the company’s vast design, engineering, and manufacturing empire.

What’s yet to become clear is whether it will also show up at the Ford BlueOval City manufacturing complex in Tennessee. That $5.6 billion project, announced four years ago, was intended to start operating about now, initially rolling out a replacement for the Ford F-150 Lightning. That EV has now been pushed back to 2028, the automaker confirmed last week.",https://s3.amazonaws.com/images.gearjunkie.com/uploads/2025/08/Ford-Universal-Vehicle-Graphic.jpg,N,,2025-08-11 13:10:06.298566

To match its legendary ancestor, Ford's new EV needs more than a low price

In a fit of marketing swagger, Ford Motor Company is calling Monday, August 11’s unveiling of its new EV “a Model T moment.” The words come from Ford President and CEO Jim Farley, uttered during Ford’s most recent earnings call. ""We will be in Kentucky to share more about our plans to design and build a breakthrough electric vehicle and a platform in the U.S.,"" Farley said on the call, which was first reported by InsideEVs.

The vehicle is the result of work done by Ford at the company’s Electric Vehicle Development Center, a 250,000 square-foot design and innovation hub based in Long Beach, California, and housed in a facility built 95 years ago to expand Ford Model A production. Ford considers it a skunkworks operation, even though the operation does consult with team members in Dearborn, Michigan, and Palo Alto, California.

With federal tax credits expiring on September 30th and EV sales growth slowing, Ford is delaying the launch of the next-generation F-150 Lightning and the E-Transit van to concentrate on more affordable vehicles, according to a report in the Detroit Free Press. That may make this announcement seem ill-timed, but it isn’t. Consider that Ford is opening its BlueOval Battery Park in Michigan, and will start producing affordable lithium iron phosphate (LFP) automotive batteries next year. While not much is yet known about the self-proclaimed “breakthrough vehicle” Ford plans to unveil, Farley’s Model T reference does hold some important clues.

A low price is a must

In the broadest sense, this vehicle has to be affordable for most buyers. Affordability remains a huge hurdle for most Americans, and few, if any, automakers are truly addressing it, particularly in the EV market. Yet the Model T teaches an important lesson. Initially costing $850 when introduced in 1908, or $26,700 adjusted for inflation, the Ford Model T's price dropped to as low as $260 in 1924, or $4,893 today. Even then, other automakers had a hard time competing with Ford’s price, which is why the company held an estimated 57% of the U.S. new-car market in 1920.

By comparison, the average transaction price for a new electric vehicle in the U.S. in June 2025 was $56,910, according to Cox Automotive, 15% higher than the average transaction price of a new vehicle during the same period and more than 72% higher than the cost of a new 1908 Model T when adjusted for inflation. Currently, the cheapest new EV sold in the U.S. is the 2025 Nissan Leaf, starting at $29,280, and the most affordable new Ford EV is the Ford Mustang Mach-E Select, starting at $37,995, or 26% more. So, Ford has a long way to go just to match the Nissan Leaf’s price, let alone surpass it. But it could happen, and here’s why. If Ford’s EV is a true “breakthrough vehicle” in the mold of the Model T, it will clearly approach its design differently, just as the Model T did.

It must be innovative

The T's design helped ensure a low price, which is why Henry Ford designed its engine block and crankcase cast as a single unit, a first in any automobile. It was also the first to have a removable cylinder head for easy access, and the first to make such extensive use of lightweight vanadium steel. The Model T also used a planetary transmission, which proved to be simple, reliable, and easy to operate compared to the more complex manual transmission used by other automakers. It had a high ground clearance, as there were only approximately 144 miles of paved roads out of the 24 million miles of public roads in the United States in 1908, according to the Federal Highway Administration. Finally, the Model T's sheer ubiquity standardized that American cars would have their steering wheel on the left side at a time when automakers hadn’t formally decided on which side it would be placed.

For Ford’s new EV to match the Model T in innovation, it must have similar out-of-the-box thinking, both in terms of low-cost manufacturing, ease of use, reliability, and ease of repair. Given Ford’s recent record of recalls, those last two items remain to be seen.

It also has to have a similar cultural impact, something that seems far less likely and might be too much to expect. The Ford Model T allowed the average worker to afford a car, usually for the first time. In fact, it led Henry Ford to pay his workers $5 a day – double the prevailing rate – so they could afford the cars they were building. The Model T revolutionized manufacturing with the moving assembly line, allowing more cars to be produced at a lower cost, which then passed on to its customers. It also changed the way Americans travelled. In 1908, there were more than 190,000 registered cars and trucks in the United States, as most people travelled by train or trolley. Twenty years later, there were 21.3 million cars, as people chose personal transportation over public transportation.

Final thoughts

We look forward to Ford’s newest EV, and hope that Jim Farley’s pronouncement is more than marketing babble. We truly hope that it has the groundbreaking engineering, innovative thinking, and rock-solid reliability that characterized Ford’s Tin Lizzie. Affordable EVs remain beyond the grasp of many automakers, as they fall victim to design presumptions that hinder their progress. Hopefully, the folks at Ford’s skunkworks have truly rethought the EV equation, considering what’s essential and what’s not, as well as what design works and what needs rethinking. A radical rethink of what a modern car “must” have is overdue, and the result could very well lead to a car that costs less, in terms of environmental impact and price, but delivers more of what most buyers want. Whether the Ford will meet that moment will be revealed on Monday.

“To stay competitive, GM will temporarily source these packs from similar suppliers to power our most affordable EV model,”

The Detroit automaker added that it sells 12 EVs in the United States with domestically-produced battery cells, and in 2027 will bring LFP production to the U.S.

The Wall Street Journal earlier reported GM’s plans to import the batteries.

Global automakers are facing stiff competition from Chinese EV makers and a trade war impacting imports of crucial parts, including rare earth materials, which has pushed production costs higher. U.S. President Donald Trump has broadly used tariffs with the goal of increasing jobs and manufacturing power in the U.S. Still, automakers are continuing to import parts and full vehicles due to lower production costs or more advanced technology in other countries.

CATL didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.

GM’s crosstown rival Ford (F.N), is also making battery cells using technology from CATL to help reduce costs on EV batteries. Ford’s Michigan battery factory came under scrutiny for its ties to the Chinese company. Still, the automaker is forging ahead and said it is on “on track” to receive federal production tax credits under recently revised rules. It is expected to begin production in 2026.

LOUISVILLE (Reuters) -Ford plans to start rolling out its new family of affordable electric vehicles in 2027, including a midsize pickup truck with a target starting price of $30,000, the company said on Monday, as it aspires to the cost efficiency of Chinese rivals.

The new midsize four-door pickup will be assembled at the automaker's Louisville, Kentucky, plant. Ford is investing nearly $2 billion in the plant, which produces the Escape and Lincoln Corsair, retaining at least 2,200 jobs, it said in a statement.

Chinese carmakers such as BYD have streamlined their supply chain and production system to produce EVs at a fraction of the cost of Western automakers. While these vehicles have yet to enter the U.S. market, Ford CEO Jim Farley said they set a new standard that companies like Ford must match.

""I can't tell you with 100% certainty that this will all go just right,"" Farley told a crowd at Ford's Louisville assembly plant on Monday, noting that past efforts by U.S. automakers to build affordable cars had fizzled. ""It is a bet. There is risk.""

Ford has been developing its affordable EVs through its so-called skunkworks team, filled with talent from EV rivals Tesla and Rivian. The California-based group, led by former Tesla executive Alan Clarke, has set itself so much apart from the larger Ford enterprise that Farley said even his badge could not get him into its building for some time.

EVs sold for an average of about $47,000 in June, J.D. Power data showed. Many Chinese models sell for $10,000 to $25,000.

Affordability is a top concern of EV shoppers, auto executives have said, and the global competition for delivering cheaper electric models is heating up.

EV startup Slate, backed by Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, is aiming for a starting price in the mid-$20,000s for its electric pickup. Tesla has teased a cheaper model, with production ramping up later this year. Rivian and Lucid are also planning to roll out lower-priced models for their lineups, although price points are in the $40,000s to $50,000s.

Since rolling out plans earlier this decade to push hard into EVs, Ford has pulled back as the losses piled up. It has scaled back many of its EV goals, canceled an electric three-row SUV, and axed a program to develop a more advanced electrical architecture for future models.

Ford last year announced it would start building its midsize truck from the skunkworks team in 2027.

The automaker earlier this year estimated losing up to $5.5 billion on its EV and software division. It lost nearly $10 billion combined on those operations from 2023 to 2024.

Cutting costs on battery-powered models has been one of the primary goals of Farley, who has said he expects this new family of EVs to be profitable within one year.

Ford sells three EVs in the U.S.: the Mustang Mach-E SUV, E-Transit van, and F-150 Lightning pickup. Sales of those vehicles fell 12% in the first half from the year-ago period. Meanwhile, interest in hybrids has surged, with sales up 27% over the same window. Ford recently pushed back production of its next-generation F-150 Lightning and E-Transit to 2028.

The elimination of a $7,500 consumer tax credit, loosening regulations on emissions and reduced funding for charging infrastructure are expected to further dampen demand.

All this makes it more important for automakers to pick their lanes, Farley has said.

""The pure EV market in the U.S. seems to us very clear: small vehicles used for commuting and around town,"" Farley told analysts on an earnings call last month.

By contrast, crosstown rival General Motors has electrified vehicles across its entire lineup, from the hulking Hummer to the smaller Equinox SUV. GM spent more time upfront building a ground-up platform as a base for its EV models.

Meanwhile, Ford has reconfigured many of its popular gasoline-powered vehicles with batteries to get to market sooner, delaying the development and launch of a unified EV platform, details of which it unveiled on Monday.

While being out front has exposed Ford to more EV demand fluctuations over the past two years, it has also learned more about the market, Farley has said.

Ford is using lithium-iron-phosphate, or LFP batteries, for the forthcoming family of EVs. The batteries are produced in Marshall, Michigan, using technology from Chinese EV-battery maker CATL that has helped to bring down the sticker price of electric cars.

The government has confirmed 13 more models to be eligible for its new Electric Car Grant (ECG), including EVs from Renault, Nissan and Vauxhall - having announced that six electric Citroëns were eligible earlier this week.

The ECG is applicable to certain electric cars priced at £37,000 or under, depending on the emissions output of the countries where they are built, and awards discounts of either £1500 or £3750. This first batch of confirmed cars have received the lower amount, but some are among the cheapest EVs on sale already, making a £1500 discount all the more significant.

First 19 ECG cars: what they cost now

Alpine A290: £32,000

Citroën e-Berlingo: £29,740

Citroën e-C3: £20,595

Citroën e-C3 Aircross:£21,595

Citroën e-C4: £26,150

Citroën e-C4 X: £27,215

Citroën e-C5 Aircross: £32,565

Renault Mégane: £30,995

Renault Scenic: £35,495

Nissan Micra: £21,495

Nissan Ariya: TBC

Vauxhall Corsa Electric: £26,005

Vauxhall Combo Life Electric: £30,690

Vauxhall Astra Electric: £33,505

Vauxhall Mokka Electric: £31,005

Vauxhall Frontera Electric: £22,495

Vauxhall Grandland Electric: £35,455

The Nissan Ariya is currently priced from £39,645 in entry-level Evolve trim, and so it will need a price cut to come in under the £37k threshold. Nissan says it will reveal pricing changes on Wednesday 13 August but it is not clear whether the SUV will receive a cheaper new trim level to take it below that point or simply have its on-paper price reduced.

Nissan GB managing director James Taylor hailed the ECG as ""a clear signal to both customers and manufacturers that they are prioritising the uptake of electric vehicles in the UK, and on providing affordable options to consumers"".

He also noted that the Japanese firm has three new EVs on the way, referring to the Sunderland-built electric Juke, Qashqai and Leaf - the last of which is due imminently and is in a ""very strong position"" to benefit from the maximum £3750 grant.

Meanwhile, the UK-built Citroën e-Berlingo and Vauxhall Combo Life Electric have been awarded the lower discount. This is likely to be because their batteries come from abroad, while the Nissan Leaf's battery will be supplied by the AESC factory next to Nissan's Sunderland plant.

The government has not given any indication of when to expect the next batch of ECG-eligible EVs, but many sub-£37k EVs – including many from Asia that are unlikely to be deemed eligible on the basis of their manufacturing and export CO2 footprints – have already been discounted by their makers.

Unlike with the previous Plug-in Car Grant (PiCG), buyers don't need to register for the discount; instead, the ECG is automatically applied to the sale price of the eligible models.

Transport secretary Heidi Alexander said: “This summer, we’re making owning an electric car cheaper, easier and a reality for thousands more people across the UK.”

To qualify for the grant, car manufacturers' models must meet science-backed emission-footprint criteria, while the individual model lines must be priced under £37,000 in entry-level trim.

Which discount a model receives – either £1500 or £3750 – is determined by its environmental impact: how much CO2 is emitted in an EV's production and assembly, along with the emissions footprint of its battery manufacture. Threshold levels have yet to be made public.

While any manufacturer can apply for their car to be included in the scheme, it's thought that, due to this criteria, cars produced in Asian countries will not be eligible for the ECG.

Worries about manipulation of the scheme have already been raised. For instance, sources have revealed to Autocar that car makers will be able to self-register EVs to receive the ECG.

Pivotal Manufacturing has acquired 140 acres where a scandal-ridden nuclear plant was abandoned 40% into construction with more than $2.6 billion in debt. It has signed a long-term ground lease with Highland Materials for a polysilicon advanced manufacturing facility and a campus of other energy projects.

According to the US Department of Energy (DOE), Highland’s manufacturing facility will have an initial annual capacity of 16,000 MT of solar-grade polysilicon at “less than standard cost.” At full capacity, The DOE said the facility will produce 20,000 metric tons after four years, which is the equivalent of 11 GW of solar cells.

Much of the critical infrastructure, such as a high-voltage interconnect, flexible zoning and a development-friendly permitting environment are heirlooms of an incomplete nuclear power facility that had amassed more than $2.6 billion and was just 40% complete when it was canceled.

US-based Highland Materials, a purified polysilicon, and aluminum and silicon alloy manufacturer, said it is developing a next-generation production platform designed to meet rising domestic and international demand for such critical technologies.

In April 2024, Highland Materials said it had secured $255.6 million in Qualifying Advanced Energy Project Credit (48C) tax credits to build a polysilicon plant in the United States.

The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) expanded the 48C credits to provide an additional credit allocation of $10 billion, with $4 billion set aside for projects in designated energy communities. The 48C credit is an tax credit of up to 30% of qualified investments for qualifying projects, provided they meet prevailing wage and apprenticeship requirements.

When it awarded the tax credits, the DOE said Highland was working closely with Northeast State Community College to develop and implement workforce development including Department of Labor-certified apprenticeship programs, along with other community support programs.

Highland said it chose Phipps Bend for its exceptional power infrastructure, strategic location within the TVA region, and development-ready environment capable of supporting large-scale, high-precision manufacturing.

Pivotal and Highland said they are working closely with local, regional, and federal stakeholders – including Hawkins County, the Tennessee Valley Authority, Holston Electric Cooperative, and the State of Tennessee – to deliver infrastructure, incentives, and economic development to support both near-term and long-term phases of the campus. The project will provide over 400 high-paying full-time manufacturing jobs, according to Highland.

The advanced manufacturing facility will comprise just a portion of the property. The 140-acre site, “The Phipps Bend Advanced Manufacturing & Technology Campus” is planned to be a heavy-infrastructure location for operators who require high-power infrastructure and scale, Pivotal Partners said.

The campus has direct on-site access to a regional transmission interconnect owned by the Tennessee Valley Authority, a federally owned electric utility corporation.

Much of the critical infrastructure, such as a high-voltage interconnect, flexible zoning and a development-friendly permitting environment are heirlooms of an incomplete nuclear power facility that amassed more than $2.6 billion to reach just 40% of its construction when it was canceled.

While no reactors were ever brought online, Pivotal Partners said the site retains a “powerful legacy”: significant utility infrastructure, a strategic location within the TVA transmission network and a regional development mindset rooted in energy-intensive industry. “Today, those attributes provide a differentiated foundation for advanced manufacturing and critical-technology operations,” Pivotal Partners said.

Highland said its energy-efficient process “has a much smaller footprint than that of other silicon manufacturing methods and a much lower power consumption per kg produced.” Its process can produce one kilogram of silicon with 20 to 40 kWh per kilogram, according to Highland.

The plant will use a scaled-up version of an aluminum-silicon alloy system that smelts the impure raw silicon with pure aluminum. This has a lower melting temperature than traditional methods, which enables the process to require less energy, Highland said.

The land first began to be put to use for renewable energy in 2017 when United Renewable Energy installed a 1 MW solar project beside the towers of nuclear project’s 35-year-old concrete ruins.

Pivotal Manufacturing Partners is a real estate investment platform built to support the rapidly growing reshoring trend in U.S. advanced manufacturing and critical technologies.

(AP) — Ford Motor Co. will invest nearly $2 billion retooling a Kentucky factory to produce electric vehicles that it says will be more affordable, more profitable to build, and will outcompete rival models.

The automaker’s top executive unveiled the new EV strategy Monday at Ford’s Louisville Assembly Plant which, after producing gas-powered vehicles for 70 years, will be converted to manufacture electric vehicles.

“We took a radical approach to solve a very hard challenge: Create affordable vehicles that are breakthrough in every way that matters — design, technology, performance, space and cost of ownership — and do it with American workers,” Ford CEO Jim Farley said in a release.

The Big Detroit automakers have continued to transition from internal combustion engines to EV technology even as President Donald Trump’s administration unwinds incentives for automakers to go electric. Trump’s massive tax and spending law targets EV incentives, including the imminent removal of a credit that saves buyers up to $7,500 on a new electric car.

Yet Farley and other top executives in the auto industry say that electric vehicles are the future and there is no going back.

The first EV to roll off the revamped Louisville assembly line will be a midsize, four-door electric pickup truck in 2027 for domestic and international markets, the company said Monday.

The new electric trucks will be powered by lower-cost batteries made at a Ford factory in Michigan. The Detroit automaker previously announced a $3 billion investment to build the battery factory.

The automaker sees this as a “Model T moment” for its EV business — a reference to the mass-produced vehicle that launched the venerable automaker more than a century ago. But Ford says it’s also a nod to the future and the vastly different way Ford says it will build electric vehicles.

The company said it will use a universal platform and production system for its EVs, essentially the underpinning of a vehicle that can be applied across a wide range of models, from sedans to SUV, and include both electric internal combustion vehicles.

The Louisville factory — one of two Ford assembly plants in Kentucky’s largest city — will be revamped to cut production costs and make assembly time faster as it’s prepared to churn out electric vehicles.

The result will be “an affordable electric vehicle that we expect to be profitable,” Farley said in an interview with The Associated Press ahead of the announcement. “This is an example of us rejuvenating our U.S. plants with the most modern manufacturing techniques.”

The new platform enables a lineup of affordable vehicles to be produced at scale, Ford said. It will reduce parts by 20% versus a typical vehicle, with 25% fewer fasteners, 40% fewer workstations dock-to-dock in the plant and a 15% faster assembly time, Ford said. The traditional assembly line will be transformed into an “assembly tree” at the Louisville plant, it said. Instead of one long conveyor, three sub-assembly lines will operate simultaneously and then join together, it said.

“Nobody wants to see another good college try by a Detroit automaker to make an affordable vehicle that ends up with idled plants, layoffs and uncertainty,” Farley said in the release. “So, this has to be a good business. From Day 1, we knew there was no incremental path to success. … We reinvented the moving assembly line.”

Other specifications for the midsize electric truck – including its reveal date, starting price, EPA-estimated battery range, battery sizes and charge times — will be announced later, the company said. Ford revealed in its release that the truck will have a targeted starting price of about $30,000.

Ford said its investment in the Louisville plant will secure 2,200 hourly jobs.

Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear said Monday that the automaker’s plans for the Louisville plant will strengthen a more than century-old partnership between Ford and the Bluegrass State.

“This announcement not only represents one of the largest investments on record in our state, it also boosts Kentucky’s position at the center of EV-related innovation and solidifies Louisville Assembly Plant as an important part of Ford’s future,” Beshear said.

Ford said its combined investment of about $5 billion at the Kentucky assembly plant and Michigan battery plant is expected to create or secure nearly 4,000 direct jobs between the two plants while strengthening the domestic supply chain with dozens of new U.S.-based suppliers.

Ford previously forecast weaker earnings growth for this year and further losses in its electric vehicles business as it works to control costs. Model e, Ford’s electric vehicle business, posted a full-year loss of $5.08 billion for 2024 as revenue fell 35% to $3.9 billion.

Ford’s new EV strategy comes as Chinese automakers are quickly expanding across the globe, offering relatively affordable electric vehicles.

“We’re not in a race to build the most electric cars,” Farley told the AP when asked about competition from China. “We’re in a race to have a sustainable electric business that’s profitable, that customers love.

“And this new vehicle built in Louisville, Kentucky, is going to be a much better solution to anything that anyone can buy from China,” he added.",https://www.louisianafirstnews.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/80/2025/08/689a00f1e13722.25975328.jpeg?w=1280,N,,2025-08-11 12:12:52.828265

While the Louisville plant expansion will initially employ fewer workers than currently, Ford anticipates future growth and no layoffs, with some workers potentially taking buyouts or transferring.

Ford's new ""assembly tree"" production system aims to increase production speed by up to 40% compared to current models.

This story has been updated with additional information.

Ford Motor Co. continues to make big bets on an electric vehicle future.

The automaker plans to invest $5 billion and have roughly 4,000 jobs focused on EV production across the Louisville Assembly Plant and the BlueOval Battery Park in Michigan, Ford CEO Jim Farley announced in Louisville on Aug. 11.

""We took a radical approach to a very hard challenge: Create affordable vehicles that delight customers in every way that matters — design, innovation, flexibility, space, driving pleasure, and cost of ownership — and do it with American workers,"" Farley said.

Utilizing a new universal EV platform built with a new assembly line model, the first vehicle to roll off the line will be a midsize four-door EV pickup truck with a $30,000 starting price coming to consumers in 2027.

Farley called the announcement a ""Model-T moment"" for the company — a reference to the historic Ford vehicle that essentially launched the automaker 120 years ago. He likened the affordability and adaptability of the Model-T to the newly announced EV platform that the company has worked on for the last three years and said its implications on the market could be just as seismic.

The upcoming production shifts at LAP, which currently builds the Ford Escape and Lincoln Corsair SUVs, appear to lessen the number of jobs on site from 2,800 to 2,200 hourly workers, Ford spokesman Mark Truby told the Detroit Free Press.

Some of those 600 workers may take a buyout offer if they are ready to retire while others can transfer to nearby plants such as Kentucky Truck Plant, but there are no plans for layoffs, Truby said, adding there is ""room to grow” with EV production.

The Aug. 11 announcement comes after Ford reported a recent loss of $1.3 billion in the second quarter on the EV unit of the company and announced a further delay in the production of two EV products to 2028.

Farley acknowledged the new ""radical approach"" and massive investment was a gamble amid a technology crossroads for the automotive industry and international competition.

""The automotive industry has a graveyard littered with affordable vehicles that were launched in our country with all good intentions and they fizzled out with idle plants, laid off workers and red ink,"" he said. ""At Ford three years ago, we set out to break that cycle ... we're talking about a vehicle that can sustain itself, have strong profits, so all of our workers and the community here has actually a sustainable future.""

Here's what we know about the historic EV investment from Ford:

What is Ford's Universal EV Platform?

Ford is creating a new Universal EV Platform that will allow a family of ""affordable"" vehicles to be produced and scaled to meet customer demand.

The new EV platform will allow for a reduction in parts compared to a typical vehicle, create a need for fewer workstations in the plant and improve assembly time by 15%.

Farley said Ford will be the first automaker to use prismatic LFP batteries to power the EVs. This battery type allows for both space and weight savings while being cheaper than other battery types currently on the market.

""Twenty-to-thirty percent less parts, 40% less time in assembly. It's just a radical approach,"" he said. ""We've never built a car this way. There are no guarantees. We have a busy 18 months until we start building this vehicle, but what I am confident about is we've done all the cost of ownership, and it is a radically better proposition for some customers.""

What new EVs will Ford make?

The first vehicle expected to be launched from this new universal platform is a midsize four-door EV pickup truck. The automaker is targeting a starting price of $30,000 and the truck will be assembled at the Louisville Assembly Plant off Fern Valley Road.

Ford executives said the vehicle should be profitable within 12 months of launch and will be affordable to consumers not just when compared to EVs but compared to all products on the market.

The truck is expected to be available to customers in the U.S. and overseas in 2027. Ford said the new-to-market truck will be ""as fast as a Mustang EcoBoost"" and have more passenger space than the competitor Toyota RAV4. Like many EVs, the truck will also feature a ""frunk"" or front trunk and have a truck bed.

Ford will also deploy a new assembly line model, more than a century after the company first pioneered the moving assembly line. The new Universal EV Production System is expected to simplify vehicle assembly for ""safety, quality and speed.""

The new assembly line is being coined an ""assembly tree"" and will feature three sub-assembly lines that run down their own lines at the same time and then join together to make the final product.

The new method, and reduction of parts, has allowed Ford to develop a way for the front and rear of the vehicles to be assembled separately and then combined later down the line with the structural battery, which will be the vehicle's floor.

Parts will now be moved down the assembly tree to workers in a kit that will contain all parts and tools needed, along with instructions for proper use, making the job simpler for employees.

Bryce Currie, vice president of Americas manufacturing at Ford, said the assembly tree model is expected to enhance the quality of the vehicles, thanks, in part, to the reduction of the number of parts used during assembly.

""When you look at what can stop a line or can cause even initial warranty issues, it's the elimination of that,"" Currie said.

Ford expects this new assembly model to increase production speeds at LAP by up to 40% when compared to the speed of production of the current Ford Escape and Lincoln Corsair, which are currently built on site.

The assembly tree model and universal EV production platform are seen as key components for the future of the automaker that can be married into existing facilities. However, Currie said the universal platform will not be used for big internal combustion vehicles such as the Super Duty trucks made at Kentucky Truck Plant.

What investment is Ford making in Louisville?

With its new $1.9 billion project, Ford will expand LAP by 52,000 square feet and upgrade the plant's digital infrastructure. This will make LAP the fastest network with the most access points for quality control scans of any Ford plant across the globe.

The Courier Journal previously reported Ford had filed plans to Louisville Metro Planning and Design Services in June that detailed the addition of new docks and large EV charging station.

The project, the third-largest economic development project in the state's history, secured $120 million in tax-based incentives at a special meeting Aug. 11 of The Kentucky Economic Development Finance Authority.

This supplemental project adds to an existing Kentucky Jobs Retention Act program agreement between state government and the company. The performance-based incentive allows the company to recover up to a cumulative $550 million based on the company’s overall $5.55 billion-plus investment.

By hitting annual investment and job targets, the company can be eligible to keep some of the new tax revenue it generates by claiming eligible incentives against its income tax liability and/or wage assessments, according to the state.

Will Louisville see new Ford jobs?

Currently, LAP has 2,800 hourly workers and 200 salaried workers, a Ford spokesperson said.The announcement from Aug. 11 indicates the EV project at LAP will start with 2,200 employees — 600 fewer hourly jobs than are there currently.

Ford spokesperson Mark Truby said the company is not planning layoffs but instead some workers will likely take a buyout offer while others will have the option to transfer to the Kentucky Truck Plant or “other plants in the area.”“This project will start with 2,200 hourly workers, so 600 fewer workers than we have today, but it’s a lot of headroom to grow,” Truby said. “There’s nothing to say today that this is the only top hat to be built in Louisville, but we’re focused on this product today and there is room to grow.”

Why is the Louisville Assembly Plant getting a new EV product?

During the 2023 contract negotiations with the UAW, which eventually led to Ford workers across the country being called out on strike, the union and automaker struck a deal that some claimed put Louisville ""truly at the center of the universe for EV production and EV innovation,"" The Courier Journal reported in 2023.

The UAW and Ford agreed to pump major investments and changes into the Louisville Assembly Plant following the end of the production lifecycle of the Ford Escape and Lincoln Corsair.

LAP was promised a $1.2 billion investment over the life of the 2023 contract and an ""all-new EV product.""

The EV industry has sprouted up quickly across Kentucky, largely due to Ford's investment in the state. Todd Dunn, the president of UAW Local 862, which represents workers at LAP and the Kentucky Truck Plant where Super Duty trucks are made, previously said ""Kentucky is the new Michigan,"" due to the growth of the EV sector in the state.

In June, documents filed with Louisville Metro Government showed Ford is already in the early stages of retooling LAP to go from producing gas powered vehicles to EVs with the planned addition of 12,000 square feet of canopy to shelter 16 charging units and a substation, The Courier Journal first reported.

Dunn and International UAW President Shawn Fain have previously shared excitement over maintaining a product commitment for LAP and job security for workers.

Priced around $25,000, this vehicle is not just a product—it is the culmination of a radical rethinking of EV design, manufacturing, and battery technology. By leveraging a secretive “skunkworks” team, a modular platform, and cost-effective lithium-iron-phosphate (LFP) batteries, Ford aims to outmaneuver Chinese EV rivals and Tesla in the race for mass-market adoption. For investors, this represents a pivotal moment in the automotive industry's transition to electrification.

A Manufacturing Revolution: From Silos to Synergy

Ford's Long Beach, California-based skunkworks team, led by ex-Tesla engineering chief Alan Clarke, is dismantling traditional automotive silos. By integrating aerodynamicists with designers, closures engineers with chassis engineers, and body engineers with powertrain specialists, the team has eliminated redundant parts and streamlined production. This cross-disciplinary approach reduces costs by up to 20% while maintaining performance and quality. The result is a vehicle that balances affordability with utility—a critical factor in a market where price-sensitive buyers dominate.

The team's agile methodology, inspired by Tesla's rapid iteration cycles, accelerates time-to-market. Unlike traditional automakers, which take years to move from design to production, Ford's concurrent development process ensures that the 2027 truck will reach consumers faster than competitors. This speed is essential in a sector where first-mover advantage is fleeting.

Battery Breakthroughs: LFP and Vertical Integration

Ford's Marshall, Michigan battery plant, a $3.5 billion investment, is the linchpin of its affordability strategy. By producing LFP batteries—a chemistry known for its low cost and safety—the company avoids the premium associated with nickel-based cells. LFP's energy density, while lower than lithium-ion, is offset by Ford's advanced battery control algorithms and aerodynamic design, which together extend range. The plant's proximity to assembly lines further reduces supply chain costs, a critical edge in a market where battery expenses account for 40% of an EV's total cost.

The collaboration with Chinese battery giant CATL has drawn scrutiny, but Ford has structured the partnership to ensure full operational control. American workers will staff the plant, and the licensing agreement includes safeguards against unilateral production halts. This vertical integration not only secures Ford's supply chain but also qualifies it for Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) tax credits, which could reduce battery costs by up to 30%.

The TE1 Platform: A Foundation for Scalability

Ford's new TE1 platform, designed exclusively for electric trucks, is a game-changer. Unlike the F-150 Lightning's modified gasoline chassis, the TE1 is built from the ground up for electrification. This allows for optimized weight distribution, improved aerodynamics, and a 420-mile EPA-estimated range—100 miles more than the F-150 Lightning. The platform's modularity means it can underpin multiple models, from compact SUVs to commercial vans, reducing R&D costs and enabling rapid scaling.

The truck's design also incorporates deployable aerodynamics and regenerative braking systems, maximizing energy efficiency. These features, combined with NACS compatibility (enabling access to 15,000 Tesla Superchargers), position the vehicle as a practical alternative to the Tesla Model 2 and Chinese EVs like the BYD Atto 3.

Strategic Pricing and Market Positioning

Ford's target price of $25,000–$30,000 is aggressive but achievable. By reducing the number of vehicle designs (“top hats”) and focusing on high-volume models, the company minimizes production complexity. CEO Jim Farley has emphasized that the truck must be profitable within 12 months of launch—a goal achievable through cost discipline and IRA incentives.

The vehicle's utility is another differentiator. With a midsize frame (closer to the Ranger than the Maverick), it balances towing capacity with urban practicality. Bidirectional charging and software-defined features like BlueCruise further enhance its value proposition, appealing to both daily commuters and small businesses.

Risks and Opportunities

While Ford's strategy is compelling, risks remain. Political concerns over CATL's involvement could delay production or trigger regulatory hurdles. Additionally, the company's shift to hybrid SUVs may alienate EV purists, though it aligns with current cost realities for larger vehicles.

However, Ford's BlueOval City in Memphis—set to produce 500,000 units annually—provides a scalable foundation. The plant's integration of battery production, assembly, and supplier parks ensures flexibility as demand evolves. For investors, this infrastructure represents a long-term asset, capable of supporting multiple product lines and capturing market share in both retail and commercial segments.

Investment Thesis

Ford's 2027 electric truck is more than a product—it is a blueprint for dominating the affordable EV market. By combining manufacturing agility, battery innovation, and strategic pricing, the company is addressing the core barriers to EV adoption: cost, range, and utility. The TE1 platform and LFP battery strategy position Ford to undercut Chinese competitors while maintaining profitability, a rare feat in the EV sector.

For investors, the key metrics to watch are Ford's production ramp at BlueOval City, battery cost trends, and the truck's market penetration rate. If the company meets its 2027 launch timeline and achieves its pricing targets, shares could see a 30%–50% upside over the next 18 months.

An overarching goal is to get data center developers to put their money where their mouth is.","HARRISBURG, Pa. (AP) — Amid rising electric bills, states are under pressure to insulate regular household and business ratepayers from the costs of feeding Big Tech’s energy-hungry data centers.

It’s not clear that any state has a solution and the actual effect of data centers on electricity bills is difficult to pin down. Some critics question whether states have the spine to take a hard line against tech behemoths like Microsoft, Google, Amazon and Meta, which has a data center slated to be completed this year in Kuna. Several other data centers have been constructed in Idaho, as well.

But more than a dozen states have begun taking steps as data centers drive a rapid build-out of power plants and transmission lines.

That has meant pressuring the nation’s biggest power grid operator to clamp down on price increases, studying the effect of data centers on electricity bills or pushing data center owners to pay a larger share of local transmission costs.

Rising power bills are “something legislators have been hearing a lot about. It’s something we’ve been hearing a lot about. More people are speaking out at the public utility commission in the past year than I’ve ever seen before,” said Charlotte Shuff of the Oregon Citizens’ Utility Board, a consumer advocacy group. “There’s a massive outcry.”

Not the typical electric customer

Some data centers could require more electricity than cities the size of Pittsburgh, Cleveland or New Orleans, and make huge factories look tiny by comparison. That’s pushing policymakers to rethink a system that, historically, has spread transmission costs among classes of consumers that are proportional to electricity use.

“A lot of this infrastructure, billions of dollars of it, is being built just for a few customers and a few facilities and these happen to be the wealthiest companies in the world,” said Ari Peskoe, who directs the Electricity Law Initiative at Harvard University. “I think some of the fundamental assumptions behind all this just kind of breaks down.”

A fix, Peskoe said, is a “can of worms” that pits ratepayer classes against one another.

Some officials downplay the role of data centers in pushing up electric bills.

Tricia Pridemore, who sits on Georgia’s Public Service Commission and is president of the National Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners, pointed to an already tightened electricity supply and increasing costs for power lines, utility poles, transformers and generators as utilities replace aging equipment or harden it against extreme weather.

The data centers needed to accommodate the artificial intelligence boom are still in the regulatory planning stages, Pridemore said, and the Data Center Coalition, which represents Big Tech firms and data center developers, has said its members are committed to paying their fair share.

But growing evidence suggests that the electricity bills of some Americans are rising to subsidize the massive energy needs of Big Tech as the U.S. competes in a race against China for artificial intelligence superiority.

Data and analytics firm Wood Mackenzie published a report in recent weeks that suggested 20 proposed or effective specialized rates for data centers in 16 states it studied aren’t nearly enough to cover the cost of a new natural gas power plant.

In other words, unless utilities negotiate higher specialized rates, other ratepayer classes — residential, commercial and industrial — are likely paying for data center power needs.

Meanwhile, Monitoring Analytics, the independent market watchdog for the mid-Atlantic grid, produced research in June showing that 70% — or $9.3 billion — of last year’s increased electricity cost was the result of data center demand.

States are responding

Last year, five governors led by Pennsylvania’s Josh Shapiro began pushing back against power prices set by the mid-Atlantic grid operator, PJM Interconnection, after that amount spiked nearly sevenfold. They warned of customers “paying billions more than is necessary.”

PJM has yet to propose ways to guarantee that data centers pay their freight, but Monitoring Analytics is floating the idea that data centers should be required to procure their own power.

In a filing last month, it said that would avoid a “massive wealth transfer” from average people to tech companies.

At least a dozen states are eyeing ways to make data centers pay higher local transmission costs.

In Oregon, a data center hot spot, lawmakers passed legislation in June ordering state utility regulators to develop new — presumably higher — power rates for data centers.

The Oregon Citizens’ Utility Board says there is clear evidence that costs to serve data centers are being spread across all customers — at a time when some electric bills there are up 50% over the past four years and utilities are disconnecting more people than ever.

New Jersey’s governor signed legislation last month commissioning state utility regulators to study whether ratepayers are being hit with “unreasonable rate increases” to connect data centers and to develop a specialized rate to charge data centers.

In some other states, like Texas and Utah, governors and lawmakers are trying to avoid a supply-and-demand crisis that leaves ratepayers on the hook — or in the dark.

Doubts about states protecting ratepayers

In Indiana, state utility regulators approved a settlement between Indiana Michigan Power Co., Amazon, Google, Microsoft and consumer advocates that set parameters for data center payments for service.

Kerwin Olsen, of the Citizens Action Council of Indiana, a consumer advocacy group, signed the settlement and called it a “pretty good deal” that contained more consumer protections than what state lawmakers passed.

But, he said, state law doesn’t force large power users like data centers to publicly reveal their electric usage, so pinning down whether they’re paying their fair share of transmission costs “will be a challenge.”

In a March report, the Environmental and Energy Law Program at Harvard University questioned the motivation of utilities and regulators to shield ratepayers from footing the cost of electricity for data centers.

Both utilities and states have incentives to attract big customers like data centers, it said.

To do it, utilities — which must get their rates approved by regulators — can offer “special deals to favored customers” like a data center and effectively shift the costs of those discounts to regular ratepayers, the authors wrote. Many state laws can shield disclosure of those rates, they said.

In Pennsylvania, an emerging data center hot spot, the state utility commission is drafting a model rate structure for utilities to consider adopting. An overarching goal is to get data center developers to put their money where their mouth is.

“We’re talking about real transmission upgrades, potentially hundreds of millions of dollars,” commission chairman Stephen DeFrank said. “And that’s what you don’t want the ratepayer to get stuck paying for.”",https://idahobusinessreview.com/files/2024/10/FOCUS-CONSTRUCTION-Meta-1.jpg,N,,2025-08-11 12:10:35.173066

Ford said Monday it will invest $5 billion into a new assembly line and battery production to build EVs, including for a new, unnamed model that Ford says will be the most affordable electric pickup truck on the market. Ford said this announcement will add or “secure” 4,000 US jobs.

“We took inspiration from the Model T – the universal car that changed the world,” Doug Field, Ford’s chief EV digital and design officer, said Monday. “We think today will be a turning point for Ford Motor Company and the auto industry.”

Ford says about $2 billion of the investment will secure 2,200 hourly jobs at its Louisville assembly plant to build the company’s next generation of electric vehicles. However Ford said the conversion at the plant from gas powered SUVs to electric vehicle will require about 600 fewer jobs than it currently needs, at least partly because the new assembly line will be more efficient. Ford may also produce fewer cars.

The other jobs and investment will be directed to a Michigan battery plant, which Ford has been planning since 2023.

Ford is the latest company to announce a large investment in US operations as it faces steep tariffs on imports and demands by the Trump administration to shift manufacturing back to the United States. Ford already builds more cars in America than any automaker. But the company said Monday it does not plan to shift production of one of its electric models, the Ford Mustang Mach-E, from a plant in Cuautitlan, Mexico.

Ford’s announcement also introduced a new battery design, which will be smaller and lighter than its previous versions. The new battery will allow the company to price a new EV pickup at $30,000, making it one of the most affordable available. By comparison, the Ford F-150 Lightning pickup has a starting price of about $55,000. The new line will be up and running in 2027, the company said Monday.

But the Trump administration has cut federal government support for electric vehicles by doing away with tax credits to help buyers, as well as rolling back emissions regulations put in place by the Biden administration.

And Ford is currently losing money on its EVs. While its EV revenue nearly tripled in the first half of this year compared to a year ago, it still lost $2.2 billion in the EV segment during the same time period.

Ford said the most significant change will be a different design for its assembly line, which has basically been in a straight line since its founder Henry Ford started the first auto assembly line in 1913.

The automaker said its new assembly line will be a tree layout rather than a straight line, with several lines feeding vehicle parts into one another. Ford said the new design will lower costs while making production faster and less difficult for workers on the line.

Dubbing it the company's ""Model T"" moment, CEO Jim Farley said the company would build a new electric truck on a new assembly deck.

Big picture view:

Ford is building a new pickup truck that marks the beginning of a new era for the automaker as its leadership strives to electrify more of its fleet while keeping costs down for those considering a new vehicle.

When it arrives, it will come in the form of a $30,000 midsize electric pickup truck. It will arrive in 2027, assembled at its Louisville Assembly Plant, and come with a frunk and a bed.

The $5 billion investment also includes a ""universal EV platform"" which will support a fleet of future electic cars.

Ford's new EV platform

Workers assembling future models will do less ""twisting, reaching, and bending"" as the company throws out the playbook on how it builds a vehicle.

According to a news release, the company's reimagining of how it builds vehicles includes making it easier on those working in assembly plants. The goal is to make it cheaper, easier, and faster to put together cars and trucks.

Dig deeper:

While the new affordable electric truck headlined Ford's announcement, the company spent more time on its retooling of the assembly line. The change will make it cheaper and quicker to put a car or truck together.

Farley called it a ""Model T moment"" because it represents a monumental shift in how a car is put together.

Anchoring that change is its new EV platform. The company said the platform:

20% fewer parts in the vehicle

40% fewer workstations at the plant

15% faster assembly line.

The next fleet will use lithium-ion phosphate prismatic batteries, which are smaller than current batteries and a lot lighter.

The company plans to assemble its future models in three parts: the front, the rear, and then the structural battery. The vehicle itself will be combined with the platform, which will be assembled with the seats, consoles, and carpeting.

This will take place through an ""assembly tree,"" which is the company's evolution from the assembly line.",https://images.foxtv.com/static.fox2detroit.com/www.fox2detroit.com/content/uploads/2025/08/1280/720/ford-ev-truck_getty_generic-scaled.jpg?ve=1&tl=1,N,,2025-08-11 13:08:41.189848

Future of N.B.
network François-Guy Haché, N.B.","Jean-Marc Robichaud finally bought a fully electric vehicle in 2021.

His Hyundai Kona, the type of low-emissions car he'd wanted for over a decade, was cheaper thanks to federal and provincial electric vehicle incentives.

Robichaud received $5,000 from the federal government and another $5,000 from the province after his purchase, dropping the total for the car to $43,500.

His wife enjoyed the switch to electric so much she bought herself a Kona a year later. Once again they received $10,000 in incentives after their purchase, knocking the final price down to $51,295.

Robichaud was happy to get the incentives, despite already having his sights set on going electric.

""'Sweet, this is available,' that's how it was. More than sweet, really, it was excellent,"" he said.

The incentive programs were created to help drivers make the move from gas- and diesel-powered vehicles to electric and hybrids, in a bid to lower greenhouse gas emissions.

June 30 was the last day to buy an EV and be eligible for compensation from the province. The last day New Brunswickers could apply to get the incentive was July 30.

The program issued 6,000 EV rebates and 1,300 home charger rebates over its four-year lifespan, with more still being processed.

People receiving an incentive were also eligible for up to $750 to install a home charger.

Roughly $28 million was spent on the program since its launch in July 2021.

The federal government paused their version of the program in January when it ran out of funds, but announced in June it'll soon make a comeback.

Energy Minister René Legacy declined an interview about the future of the incentive program.

David Kelly, a spokesperson for Legacy, provided an emailed statement instead.

""With prices for electric vehicles becoming more affordable, the decision was made to wrap up New Brunswick's electric vehicle incentive and focus on adding to the province's charging infrastructure, which has been identified as a main concern by those looking to make the transition to an EV,"" the statement said.

The province hopes a stronger charging network ""will continue to fuel EV sales,"" but could not provide CBC News with data about the number of chargers it needs to meet demand.

As a speaker and consultant on sustainability based in New Brunswick, Carl Duivenvoorden pays close attention to incentives and hopes they'll be available for consumers again soon.

""The loss of the incentive, I think, will set back a bit our transition over to EVs, and that's too bad,"" he said.

Duivenvoorden feels the incentives were a way to give people ""that little nudge,"" since a difference in sticker prices still remains between EVs and comparable gas-powered vehicles.

'Shifting its focus'

When New Brunswick announced was ending in its program, a March news release from the province said it was ""shifting its focus to addressing the need for more charging infrastructure.""

The release also called the program a success, saying it achieved its goal of EVs making up six per cent of new light-duty vehicle sales by this year. More than 7,400 electric vehicles have been registered in New Brunswick, according to the provincial Energy Department.

According to a Department of Natural Resources report, Canada will need about 679,000 public chargers by 2040. There are 38,696 chargers in the country now.

Duivenvoorden has taken his 2019 Chevrolet Bolt coast to coast, and said New Brunswick's charging network is very good and ranks ""towards the top end of the middle of the pack.""

He has found Quebec and British Columbia are the best while the prairies, southern Ontario, P.E.I and Newfoundland are good. He calls Nova Scotia and northern Ontario's networks ""fairly weak.""

Duivenvoorden said N.B. Power's eCharge Network has evolved over the years, and its only weakness now is that some locations only have one charger. With one plug, that leaves drivers waiting or tracking down the next charger on their route.

Duivenvoorden and Robichaud both said around 90 per cent of their charging is done at home.

""You're not charging anywhere except if you go on a trip. Then all of a sudden those chargers become important. Very important,"" said Robichaud, who has seen public charging improve since 2021.

His trip to Quebec used to take him 12 hours and now, because of new chargers along the western border of New Brunswick, his trip is down to 10 hours.

According to Kelly, between N.B. Power and third-party stations, the province had 187 Level 2 chargers and 85 fast chargers at the start of 2023.

Today, there are 349 Level 2 chargers and 151 fast chargers.

N.B. Power's website says a Level 2 charger can fully charge an all-electric vehicle in six to 12 hours, while a fast charger takes less than an hour.

The province has budgeted $4 million to improve its charging network this fiscal year and will install 16 new chargers, including eight 320 kW fast chargers, which can charge two vehicles at the same time.

Future of N.B. network

François-Guy Haché, N.B. Power's electric mobility lead, said range anxiety is ""one of the main barriers"" for people considering buying EVs.

Haché said N.B. Power is focused on putting chargers along main highways to deal with that fear and allow drivers to ""travel further without having big gaps in the province.""

According to Haché, the province's utility company is ""well positioned grid-wise"" and will have to keep monitoring how EV chargers are used as more are installed.

N.B. Power is seeing the number of charging sessions ""almost doubling year over year,"" he added.

Haché said the utility plans to build with demand as more EVs hit the road.

Olivier Trescases, a professor at the University of Toronto and director of the university's EV Research Centre, describes the vehicle charging conundrum as a ""chicken and egg problem"": it's difficult, he says, to know how many chargers we actually need.

He said having Crown corporations operate chargers can help keep costs down.

For now, Trescases thinks education is important if people are going to choose electric without incentives.

""Every new technology has to stand on its own legs and we've seen that with all major technologies,"" he said.

""It's very, very difficult to get on to the mass adoption phase, and I think we're getting there soon.""",https://i.cbc.ca/1.7603447.1754588945!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpeg_gen/derivatives/16x9_1180/ev-charger-lincoln.jpeg?im=Resize%3D620,N,,2025-08-11 12:11:27.548923

An invasive species known as the Asian Moon jellyfish, native to the Pacific Northwest, was first sighted in the North Sea in 2020.

The invasive jellyfish are not considered a threat, as they do not have a poisonous sting.","Four reactors at France’s Gravelines nuclear power plant were shut down late Sunday due to a swarm of jellyfish in the cooling systems, operator EDF said on Monday, likely due to rising water temperatures because of global warming.

The plant in northern France is one of the largest in the country and cooled from a canal connected to the North Sea. Its six units produce 900 megawatts of power each, or 5.4 gigawatts in total.

The entire plant has now temporarily halted production as the other two units are offline for planned maintenance, EDF data showed.

The beaches around Gravelines, between the major cities of Dunkirk and Calais, have seen an increase in jellyfish in recent years due to warming waters and the introduction of invasive species.

“Jellyfish breed faster when water is warmer, and because areas like the North Sea are becoming warmer, the reproductive window is getting wider and wider,” said Derek Wright, marine biology consultant at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Fisheries.

“Jellyfish can also hitch rides on tanker ships, entering the ships’ ballast tank in one port and often getting pumped out into waters halfway across the globe,” he said.

An invasive species known as the Asian Moon jellyfish, native to the Pacific Northwest, was first sighted in the North Sea in 2020.

The species, which prefers still water with high levels of animal plankton like ports and canals, has caused similar problems in ports and at nuclear plants in China, Japan and India.

“Everyone talks about nuclear being clean but we don’t think about the unintended consequences of heat pollution,” Derek said.

EDF did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Reactors 2, 3, and 4 at Gravelines stopped automatically just before midnight when the filter drums of the pumping stations became packed with a “massive and unpredictable” swarm of jellyfish, and reactor 6 went offline several hours later, the EDF notice said.

The event did not affect the safety of the facilities, staff or the environment, it said.

The nuclear plant is also near beaches that have become hotspots for migrants attempting to cross into Britain. The invasive jellyfish are not considered a threat, as they do not have a poisonous sting.","https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/gettyimages-2173180802.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill",N,,2025-08-11 14:04:23.848595

Initial work has repurposed and upcycled nearly 27,000 tons of food waste

RE:CIRCLE Ontario, a RE:CIRCLE Solutions company and a leader in organic waste recycling, diversion strategies and feed production, today announced the publication of its inaugural sustainability report for full year 2024. The report details the company’s continued advancement of its environmental efforts in organic waste recycling in California to reduce landfill dependency and maximize resource recovery for grocery retailers, food and beverage producers and other key players in the food ecosystem to be compliant with state law.

The U.S. foodservice industry spends an estimated $162 billion per year on wasted pre-consumer food which not only is a burden to industry but also to the environment. In addition, combined with high targets in California, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has announced domestic goals to reduce food loss and waste by 50% by 2030. These goals create a challenge for grocers, producers and retailers with regulatory compliance, but organics repurposing is the path to success.

“We are thrilled to announce our inaugural sustainability report to showcase the enormous progress RE:CIRCLE Solutions has made in diverting waste from landfills,” said Clemens Stockreiter, Founder of RE:CIRCLE Solutions. “As a leader in organic waste management, we feel an immense responsibility to show to California the significant opportunities that exist to be more effective in sustainability efforts as well as the value that our innovative strategies can provide. We’re very pleased with the progress that we have made in achieving these key metrics which are the very foundation of our success, and we look forward to continuing our sustainability journey to promote a cleaner and healthier planet for all.”

Key Highlights:

In 2024, RE:CIRCLE Ontario diverted approximately 27,000 metric tons from landfills and repurposed into recycled products such as animal feed, biofuel, and other sustainable outputs.

The company’s operations generated a total of 1,781 metric tons of CO₂e in 2024, comprising:

Scope 1 (direct emissions): 597 metric tons

Scope 2 (indirect emissions from purchased energy): 33 metric tons

Scope 3 (other indirect emissions): 1,151 metric tons

Through its circular model, RE:CIRCLE Ontario achieved a total greenhouse gas avoidance of 13,861 metric tons of CO₂e or nearly eight times the emissions generated.

The company operates a dedicated manufacturing and processing site and maintains a fleet of 10 owned trucks and trailers, enabling seamless, end-to-end system integration with a focus on low-carbon energy and fuel consumption.

RE:CIRCLE Ontario serves a growing network of 100+ customers and collaborates with 10+ commodity recycling partners across Southern California

The investment comes on top of $3 billion already planned for a battery park in Michigan. Together the facilities will create or secure nearly 4,000 new jobs, Ford said in a news release.

""We took a radical approach to a very hard challenge: Create affordable vehicles that delight customers in every way that matters – design, innovation, flexibility, space, driving pleasure, and cost of ownership – and do it with American workers,"" Ford CEO Jim Farley said in the release.

The Detroit automaker's new ""Universal EV Program"" centered around low-cost EVs will start with a midsize, four-door electric pickup, produced at the Louisville Assembly Plant. That vehicle launch is slated for 2027.

Executives had teased the announcement on the company's latest earnings call as its next ""Model T moment."" Ford said the starting price of the new EV truck, $30,000, will be roughly the same as the famed Model T, when adjusted for inflation.

Ford noted that new lithium iron phosphate (LFP) batteries for the new family of EVs will be assembled in the U.S. and not imported from China.

Farley said during an event in Louisville on Monday that the announcement comes as the automotive industry sits is at a crossroads due to new technology and new competition.

""We knew that the Chinese would be the major player for us globally, companies like BYD, new startups from around the world, big technology has their ambition in the auto space. They're all coming for us, legacy automotive companies,"" Farley said. ""We needed a radical approach and a really tough challenge to create an affordable vehicle.""

The changes also come as Ford and other U.S. manufacturers are navigating changing EV policies under President Donald Trump, including an end to EV tax credits that will take effect after Sept. 30.

Ford said Monday the Louisville plant will ""secure"" about 2,200 jobs, but noted that once it's retooled for EV production, it will employ about 600 fewer workers than in its current configuration.

According to the Ford website, the plant employed over 3,000 employees as of April 2024.

Farley told CNBC's Phil LeBeau during an interview with ""Squawk on the Street"" that the automaker continues to add new jobs elsewhere.

""Ford's the only car company in America that's added 13,000 jobs since the recession. We're not going to stop,"" Farley said.

Ford reveals new affordable Universal EV platform

Ford’s big bet is about to pay off. The company is preparing to launch a family of affordable electric vehicles based on the new Ford Universal EV Platform.

The first vehicle based on the platform will be the promised midsize four-door electric pickup. Ford’s new EV pickup will start at around $30,000 and will be assembled at its Louisville Assembly Plant.

Based on the new Ford Universal EV Platform, it will also have more passenger space than the latest Toyota RAV4.

“We took a radical approach to a very hard challenge: Create affordable electric vehicles that delight customers in every way that matters – design, innovation, flexibility, space, driving pleasure, and cost of ownership,” Ford’s CEO Jim Farley said during the event in Kentucky.

According to Farley, Ford is done with the “good college tries” from other Detroit automakers to make affordable EVs, promising the company’s new platform will change the game by lowering costs and optimizing efficiency.

Ford is the first automaker to build prismatic LFP batteries in the US, which will not only cut costs but also free up interior space.

Farley explained that the new platform reduces parts by 20% compared to the average vehicle. It also has 25% fewer fasteners, 40% fewer worstations dock-to-dock in the plant, and 15% faster assembly time.

Perhaps, most importantly, Ford’s leader explained that it will help reduce costs for owners. Farley claimed that the new Ford Universal EV platform will enable “lower cost of ownership over five years than a three-year-old used Tesla Model Y.”

How so? For one, it’s significantly more efficient than the first-gen Ford EVs. The wiring harness alone in the new midsize truck will be 4,000 feet shorter and 10 kg lighter.

The LFP batteries lie flat under the floor, which improves handling, creates a quiet ride, and “provides a surprising amount of interior space,” Ford said. In fact, it will have more passenger room than the latest Toyota RAV4. And that’s not even including the added Frunk and truck bed.

Doug Field, Ford’s Chief EV, digital, and design officer, said the company took inspiration from the Model T to make it more than just a utility vehicle.

Ford promises that the new electric pickup will also be fun to drive, with a targeted 0 to 60 mph time as fast as the Mustang EcoBoost, and even more downforce.

The company will release additional information for the midsize electric pickup soon, including a reveal date, final prices, range, battery sizes, and charge times.

Ford said it’s aiming for a starting price of around $30,000, with customer deliveries set to begin in 2027. The company invested around $5 billion into its Louisville Assembly Complex, creating nearly 4,000 jobs to deliver its new EV pickup and LFP batteries.",https://i0.wp.com/electrek.co/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/08/Fords-midsize-EV-pickup-name.jpeg?resize=1200%2C628&quality=82&strip=all&ssl=1,N,,2025-08-11 12:09:19.687674

HARRISBURG, Pa. (AP) — Amid rising electric bills, states are under pressure to insulate regular household and business ratepayers from the costs of feeding Big Tech’s energy-hungry data centers.

It’s not clear that any state has a solution and the actual effect of data centers on electricity bills is difficult to pin down. Some critics question whether states have the spine to take a hard line against tech behemoths like Microsoft, Google, Amazon and Meta.

But more than a dozen states have begun taking steps as data centers drive a rapid build-out of power plants and transmission lines.

That has meant pressuring the nation’s biggest power grid operator to clamp down on price increases, studying the effect of data centers on electricity bills or pushing data center owners to pay a larger share of local transmission costs.

Rising power bills are “something legislators have been hearing a lot about. It’s something we’ve been hearing a lot about. More people are speaking out at the public utility commission in the past year than I’ve ever seen before,” said Charlotte Shuff of the Oregon Citizens’ Utility Board, a consumer advocacy group. “There’s a massive outcry.”

Not the typical electric customer

Some data centers could require more electricity than cities the size of Pittsburgh, Cleveland or New Orleans, and make huge factories look tiny by comparison. That’s pushing policymakers to rethink a system that, historically, has spread transmission costs among classes of consumers that are proportional to electricity use.

“A lot of this infrastructure, billions of dollars of it, is being built just for a few customers and a few facilities and these happen to be the wealthiest companies in the world,” said Ari Peskoe, who directs the Electricity Law Initiative at Harvard University. “I think some of the fundamental assumptions behind all this just kind of breaks down.”

A fix, Peskoe said, is a “can of worms” that pits ratepayer classes against one another.

Some officials downplay the role of data centers in pushing up electric bills.

Tricia Pridemore, who sits on Georgia’s Public Service Commission and is president of the National Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners, pointed to an already tightened electricity supply and increasing costs for power lines, utility poles, transformers and generators as utilities replace aging equipment or harden it against extreme weather.

The data centers needed to accommodate the artificial intelligence boom are still in the regulatory planning stages, Pridemore said, and the Data Center Coalition, which represents Big Tech firms and data center developers, has said its members are committed to paying their fair share.

But growing evidence suggests that the electricity bills of some Americans are rising to subsidize the massive energy needs of Big Tech as the U.S. competes in a race against China for artificial intelligence superiority.

Data and analytics firm Wood Mackenzie published a report in recent weeks that suggested 20 proposed or effective specialized rates for data centers in 16 states it studied aren’t nearly enough to cover the cost of a new natural gas power plant.

In other words, unless utilities negotiate higher specialized rates, other ratepayer classes — residential, commercial and industrial — are likely paying for data center power needs.

Meanwhile, Monitoring Analytics, the independent market watchdog for the mid-Atlantic grid, produced research in June showing that 70% — or $9.3 billion — of last year’s increased electricity cost was the result of data center demand.

States are responding

Last year, five governors led by Pennsylvania’s Josh Shapiro began pushing back against power prices set by the mid-Atlantic grid operator, PJM Interconnection, after that amount spiked nearly sevenfold. They warned of customers “paying billions more than is necessary.”

PJM has yet to propose ways to guarantee that data centers pay their freight, but Monitoring Analytics is floating the idea that data centers should be required to procure their own power.

In a filing last month, it said that would avoid a “massive wealth transfer” from average people to tech companies.

At least a dozen states are eyeing ways to make data centers pay higher local transmission costs.

In Oregon, a data center hot spot, lawmakers passed legislation in June ordering state utility regulators to develop new — presumably higher — power rates for data centers.

The Oregon Citizens’ Utility Board says there is clear evidence that costs to serve data centers are being spread across all customers — at a time when some electric bills there are up 50% over the past four years and utilities are disconnecting more people than ever.

New Jersey’s governor signed legislation last month commissioning state utility regulators to study whether ratepayers are being hit with “unreasonable rate increases” to connect data centers and to develop a specialized rate to charge data centers.

In some other states, like Texas and Utah, governors and lawmakers are trying to avoid a supply-and-demand crisis that leaves ratepayers on the hook — or in the dark.

Doubts about states protecting ratepayers

In Indiana, state utility regulators approved a settlement between Indiana Michigan Power Co., Amazon, Google, Microsoft and consumer advocates that set parameters for data center payments for service.

Kerwin Olsen, of the Citizens Action Council of Indiana, a consumer advocacy group, signed the settlement and called it a “pretty good deal” that contained more consumer protections than what state lawmakers passed.

But, he said, state law doesn’t force large power users like data centers to publicly reveal their electric usage, so pinning down whether they’re paying their fair share of transmission costs “will be a challenge.”

In a March report, the Environmental and Energy Law Program at Harvard University questioned the motivation of utilities and regulators to shield ratepayers from footing the cost of electricity for data centers.

Both utilities and states have incentives to attract big customers like data centers, it said.

To do it, utilities — which must get their rates approved by regulators — can offer “special deals to favored customers” like a data center and effectively shift the costs of those discounts to regular ratepayers, the authors wrote. Many state laws can shield disclosure of those rates, they said.

In Pennsylvania, an emerging data center hot spot, the state utility commission is drafting a model rate structure for utilities to consider adopting. An overarching goal is to get data center developers to put their money where their mouth is.

“We’re talking about real transmission upgrades, potentially hundreds of millions of dollars,” commission chairman Stephen DeFrank said. “And that’s what you don’t want the ratepayer to get stuck paying for.”",https://www.power-eng.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/google-data-center.webp,N,,2025-08-11 12:08:05.142622

Ford stated that the integration between the Ford Universal EV Production System and Platform, assembly of the 2027 electric truck “could be up to 40% faster than Louisville Assembly Plant’s current vehicles.”

“We have all lived through far too many ‘good college tries’ by Detroit automakers to make affordable vehicles that ends up with idled plants, layoffs and uncertainty. So, this had to be a strong, sustainable and profitable business,” Farley added.

In the short term, automakers may be pivoting hard toward hybrids over fully electric vehicles, but Ford Motor Company is still investing significant time, money and marketing strategy into its next-generation EVs. In fact, the company just announced its new Universal EV Platform and accompanying production system, meant to create a “new family of affordable, electric, software-defined vehicles.”

The first of these vehicles, says Ford President and CEO Jim Farley, will be a midsize, four-door electric pickup. The company did not actually show any product Monday, but that gives us a small taster of what to expect. Supposedly, the Blue Oval will revive its long-defunct “Ranchero” name for this project, though Farley nor any of the other executives on stage confirmed that part of the plan at this point. Typically, neither Ford nor any other major automaker will comment on product beyond what they actually share in their release, and they did not share an actual name for this truck yet.

What Ford did share, in addition to the body type, is that this new truck will be assembled at Ford’s Louisville plant, and will launch around 2027. As part of the speculation surrounding the company’s application for a new Ranchero trademark last week, this date is more or less what we expected. A new revelation emerged, though: Ford is targeting a starting price of about $30,000. In other words, thousands of dollars lower than even the gas-powered Ranger. (I think I know what your reaction is there, and we’ll get to that in a moment.)

A more significant portion of today’s news, however, is that the Universal EV Platform will underpin a variety of vehicles, from trucks to small crossovers and most things in-between.

Strangely, and particularly in the interest of Ford touting “affordable” vehicles from this platform, its morphing graphic (shown below) does not seem to show a sedan of any sort. That’s in keeping with its decision to can your typical four-door passenger car from the lineup years ago, as Ford appears committed to sticking with crossovers/SUVs, vans and trucks. Again, we don’t have any confirmed product beyond the truck just yet, so we’ll have to see what else the company has up its sleeve in due time.

Ford says it’s investing $5 billion and creating nearly 4,000 jobs between expanding the Louisville Assembly Plant’s status quo of building internal combustion vehicles — and physically enlarging the plant by 52,000 square feet — as well as the BlueOval Battery Park Michigan plant that will supply lithium iron phosphate (LFP) batteries to support the electric side of the operation.

Farley did speak a little bit to the midsize truck we’re expecting and the platform its built on in some technical terms. For example, the new Universal EV Platform will reduce overall parts content by 20% versus a typical vehicle, use 25% fewer fasteners, have 40% fewer dock-to-dock workstations within the plant (to help scale production), and take 15% less assembly time per vehicle. Read: Vehicles will be less complex and be faster and cheaper to build. This vehicle will also supposedly have more interior space than a Toyota RAV4 and get from 0-60 as quickly as a Ford Mustang EcoBoost.

The company even plans to use single-piece aluminum “unicastings” in place of dozens of smaller parts. Ford says that enables the front and rear of the vehicle to be assembled separately, and that also offers up flexibility to build different kinds of EVs, all on the same platform, in the same facility. Other claims for this truck include 4,000 feet in wiring reduction and 10 kilograms in weight savings over its first-generation electric SUV.

An absolute winner, or too good to be true?

Instead of your traditional assembly line — which Ford pioneered with the Model T 122 years ago, hence the reference — the automaker plans to create an “assembly tree”. This process breaks out one long conveyor into three sub-assemblies that can run their own lines simultaneously, then join back together later on in the manufacturing process. Parts will travel down the assembly tree to operators as a full kit, with the fasteners, scanners and power tools needed for the job included, in the proper orientation for their specific task. Ford also touts ergonomic improvements as part of this process, reducing strain on workers and “allowing them to focus on the job at hand.”

Throughout the company’s announcement, reducing complexity through elimination of parts, connectors and wiring were a strong theme. By doing all that and breaking out the assembly process, the automaker contends they can boost quality and reduce costs at the same time, while delivering the most affordable vehicles that bring all the features its customers demand.

And if you were keeping score, those are all big and bold promises. In Louisville alone, Ford plans to invest nearly $2 billion (on top of the $3 billion for the Michigan battery plant) to bring the midsize electric truck and a future range of electric vehicles to life. In doing so, it will also secure 2,200 hourly jobs for Kentuckians working at the plant. To actually see it through and provide that shot in the arm for the local economy, Ford says the project is being supported by an incentive offer from the Kentucky Economic Development Finance Authority, though no further specifics were given with today’s announcement.

While one of Farley’s primary goals has been to improve Ford’s build quality over his nearly half-decade tenure, the company still has an uphill battle. So far this year, the automaker has grappled with 94 recalls of varying size and severity — more than the subsequent five manufacturers combined.

Its premise to offer a $30,000-ish vehicle with a lower five-year cost-of-ownership than a used Tesla Model Y that is practical, tech-forward, quick and easier to scale on a different process than what they’ve done for more than a century is certainly a bold move. The onus is on Ford to actually deliver, though, and we will keep a close eye on these developments to see when — and if — it can hit all those targets with its upcoming midsize truck by the targeted 2027 on-sale date.",https://tflcar.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Ford-Universal-EV-News-3.webp,N,,2025-08-11 12:09:27.726925

LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) — Ford Motor Co. will invest nearly $2 billion retooling a Kentucky factory to produce electric vehicles that it says will be more affordable, more profitable to build, and will outcompete rival models.

The automaker’s top executive unveiled the new EV strategy Monday at Ford’s Louisville Assembly Plant which, after producing gas-powered vehicles for 70 years, will be converted to manufacture electric vehicles.

“We took a radical approach to solve a very hard challenge: Create affordable vehicles that are breakthrough in every way that matters — design, technology, performance, space and cost of ownership — and do it with American workers,” Ford CEO Jim Farley said in a release.

The Big Detroit automakers have continued to transition from internal combustion engines to EV technology even as President Donald Trump’s administration unwinds incentives for automakers to go electric. Trump’s massive tax and spending law targets EV incentives, including the imminent removal of a credit that saves buyers up to $7,500 on a new electric car.

Yet Farley and other top executives in the auto industry say that electric vehicles are the future and there is no going back.

The first EV to roll off the revamped Louisville assembly line will be a midsize, four-door electric pickup truck in 2027 for domestic and international markets, the company said Monday.

The new electric trucks will be powered by lower-cost batteries made at a Ford factory in Michigan. The Detroit automaker previously announced a $3 billion investment to build the battery factory.

The automaker sees this as a “Model T moment” for its EV business — a reference to the mass-produced vehicle that launched the venerable automaker more than a century ago. But Ford says it’s also a nod to the future and the vastly different way Ford says it will build electric vehicles.

The company said it will use a universal platform and production system for its EVs, essentially the underpinning of a vehicle that can be applied across a wide range of models, from sedans to SUV, and include both electric internal combustion vehicles.

The Louisville factory — one of two Ford assembly plants in Kentucky’s largest city — will be revamped to cut production costs and make assembly time faster as it’s prepared to churn out electric vehicles.

The result will be “an affordable electric vehicle that we expect to be profitable,” Farley said in an interview with The Associated Press ahead of the announcement. “This is an example of us rejuvenating our U.S. plants with the most modern manufacturing techniques.”

The new platform enables a lineup of affordable vehicles to be produced at scale, Ford said. It will reduce parts by 20% versus a typical vehicle, with 25% fewer fasteners, 40% fewer workstations dock-to-dock in the plant and a 15% faster assembly time, Ford said. The traditional assembly line will be transformed into an “assembly tree” at the Louisville plant, it said. Instead of one long conveyor, three sub-assembly lines will operate simultaneously and then join together, it said.

“Nobody wants to see another good college try by a Detroit automaker to make an affordable vehicle that ends up with idled plants, layoffs and uncertainty,” Farley said in the release. “So, this has to be a good business. From Day 1, we knew there was no incremental path to success. … We reinvented the moving assembly line.”

Other specifications for the midsize electric truck – including its reveal date, starting price, EPA-estimated battery range, battery sizes and charge times — will be announced later, the company said. Ford revealed in its release that the truck will have a targeted starting price of about $30,000.

Ford said its investment in the Louisville plant will secure 2,200 hourly jobs.

Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear said Monday that the automaker’s plans for the Louisville plant will strengthen a more than century-old partnership between Ford and the Bluegrass State.

“This announcement not only represents one of the largest investments on record in our state, it also boosts Kentucky’s position at the center of EV-related innovation and solidifies Louisville Assembly Plant as an important part of Ford’s future,” Beshear said.

Ford said its combined investment of about $5 billion at the Kentucky assembly plant and Michigan battery plant is expected to create or secure nearly 4,000 direct jobs between the two plants while strengthening the domestic supply chain with dozens of new U.S.-based suppliers.

Ford previously forecast weaker earnings growth for this year and further losses in its electric vehicles business as it works to control costs. Model e, Ford’s electric vehicle business, posted a full-year loss of $5.08 billion for 2024 as revenue fell 35% to $3.9 billion.

Ford’s new EV strategy comes as Chinese automakers are quickly expanding across the globe, offering relatively affordable electric vehicles.

“We’re not in a race to build the most electric cars,” Farley told the AP when asked about competition from China. “We’re in a race to have a sustainable electric business that’s profitable, that customers love.

“And this new vehicle built in Louisville, Kentucky, is going to be a much better solution to anything that anyone can buy from China,” he added.",https://www.advocate-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Ford-Electric_Vehicles_49016.jpg?w=1024&h=682,N,,2025-08-11 12:09:36.158916

LOUISVILLE (Reuters) -Ford plans to start rolling out its new family of affordable electric vehicles in 2027, including a midsize pickup truck with a target starting price of $30,000, the company said on Monday, as it aspires to the cost efficiency of Chinese rivals.

The new midsize four-door pickup will be assembled at the automaker's Louisville, Kentucky, plant. Ford is investing nearly $2 billion in the plant, which produces the Escape and Lincoln Corsair, retaining at least 2,200 jobs, it said in a statement.

Chinese carmakers such as BYD have streamlined their supply chain and production system to produce EVs at a fraction of the cost of Western automakers. While these vehicles have yet to enter the U.S. market, Ford CEO Jim Farley said they set a new standard that companies like Ford must match.

""I can't tell you with 100% certainty that this will all go just right,"" Farley told a crowd at Ford's Louisville assembly plant on Monday, noting that past efforts by U.S. automakers to build affordable cars had fizzled. ""It is a bet. There is risk.""

Ford has been developing its affordable EVs through its so-called skunkworks team, filled with talent from EV rivals Tesla and Rivian. The California-based group, led by former Tesla executive Alan Clarke, has set itself so much apart from the larger Ford enterprise that Farley said even his badge could not get him into its building for some time.

EVs sold for an average of about $47,000 in June, J.D. Power data showed. Many Chinese models sell for $10,000 to $25,000.

Affordability is a top concern of EV shoppers, auto executives have said, and the global competition for delivering cheaper electric models is heating up.

EV startup Slate, backed by Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, is aiming for a starting price in the mid-$20,000s for its electric pickup. Tesla has teased a cheaper model, with production ramping up later this year. Rivian and Lucid are also planning to roll out lower-priced models for their lineups, although price points are in the $40,000s to $50,000s.

Since rolling out plans earlier this decade to push hard into EVs, Ford has pulled back as the losses piled up. It has scaled back many of its EV goals, canceled an electric three-row SUV, and axed a program to develop a more advanced electrical architecture for future models.

Ford last year announced it would start building its midsize truck from the skunkworks team in 2027.

The automaker earlier this year estimated losing up to $5.5 billion on its EV and software division. It lost nearly $10 billion combined on those operations from 2023 to 2024.

Cutting costs on battery-powered models has been one of the primary goals of Farley, who has said he expects this new family of EVs to be profitable within one year.

Ford sells three EVs in the U.S.: the Mustang Mach-E SUV, E-Transit van, and F-150 Lightning pickup. Sales of those vehicles fell 12% in the first half from the year-ago period. Meanwhile, interest in hybrids has surged, with sales up 27% over the same window. Ford recently pushed back production of its next-generation F-150 Lightning and E-Transit to 2028.

The elimination of a $7,500 consumer tax credit, loosening regulations on emissions and reduced funding for charging infrastructure are expected to further dampen demand.

All this makes it more important for automakers to pick their lanes, Farley has said.

""The pure EV market in the U.S. seems to us very clear: small vehicles used for commuting and around town,"" Farley told analysts on an earnings call last month.

By contrast, crosstown rival General Motors has electrified vehicles across its entire lineup, from the hulking Hummer to the smaller Equinox SUV. GM spent more time upfront building a ground-up platform as a base for its EV models.

Meanwhile, Ford has reconfigured many of its popular gasoline-powered vehicles with batteries to get to market sooner, delaying the development and launch of a unified EV platform, details of which it unveiled on Monday.

While being out front has exposed Ford to more EV demand fluctuations over the past two years, it has also learned more about the market, Farley has said.

Ford is using lithium-iron-phosphate, or LFP batteries, for the forthcoming family of EVs. The batteries are produced in Marshall, Michigan, using technology from Chinese EV-battery maker CATL that has helped to bring down the sticker price of electric cars.

Some of the investment, nearly $2 billion, will go toward the automaker’s Louisville Assembly Plant.

The factory is to make a new midsize electric truck, a production that will secure 2,200 jobs. Ford officials said the Louisville factory will expand by 52,000 square feet and have some digital infrastructure upgrades.

The rest of the automaker’s investment is going into its BlueOval Battery Park in Michigan.

Joined by other Ford executives and Kentucky officials, CEO Jim Farley said its electric vehicle strategy will create or ensure 4,000 total jobs at its assembly plant in Louisville and its BlueOval Battery Park in Michigan.

The strategy has two parts: The Ford Universal EV Production System and Ford Universal EV Platform will simplify production in order to make a family of vehicles at scale.

The first in that line is a midsize, four-door electric pickup assembled at the Louisville Assembly Plant starting in 2027, officials said. The starting price is approximately $30,000.

“We took a radical approach to a very hard challenge: Create affordable vehicles that delight customers in every way that matters — design, innovation, flexibility, space, driving pleasure and cost of ownership,” Farley said.

“We have all lived through far too many ‘good college tries’ by Detroit automakers to make affordable vehicles that ends up with idled plants, layoffs and uncertainty,” he said.

He added: “So, this had to be a strong, sustainable and profitable business. From Day 1, we knew there was no incremental path to success. We empowered a tiny skunkworks team three time zones away from Detroit. We tore up the moving assembly line concept and designed a better one. And we found a path to be the first automaker to make prismatic LFP (lithium iron phosphate) batteries in the U.S.”

Monday’s electric vehicle strategy has been teased by Ford executives for weeks: Farley called it the company’s next “Model T moment” during its second-quarter earnings call at the end of July.

The automaker continues to delay the launch of new-generation electric vehicles in favor of smaller, affordable and profitable models. At the start of the year in reviewing its fourth quarter and full-year results from 2024, Ford projected electric vehicle losses of up to $5.5 billion in 2025.

The Ford Universal EV Platform

The new platform enables a family of affordable vehicles to be produced at scale. Officials described them as electric, fun to drive and digitally advanced with “over-the-air” updates that will keep improving the vehicle.

Farley said the platform reduces parts by 20% versus a typical vehicle. It has 25% fewer fasteners, 40% fewer workstations dock-to-dock in the plant and a 15% faster assembly time, officials said.

Batteries in the platform enable space and weight savings, while “delivering cost reduction and durability for customers,” officials said.

The new midsize truck is forecasted to have more passenger room than the latest Toyota RAV4. The electric vehicle platform has a low center of gravity from the battery, instant torque from electric motors and other features.

The Ford Universal EV Production System

The system, which is meant to increase manufacturing efficiency, will simplify production and ease operations for workers, officials said.

Instead of one long conveyor, three sub-assemblies run down lines simultaneously and then join together.

Because of the integration of the production system and the platform, officials project the assembly of the midsize truck could be up to 40% faster than the Louisville Assembly Plant’s current vehicles.",https://www.mcclatchy-wires.com/public/incoming/kwdj8k/picture311633118/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1140/e90efcd4-4ba3-4feb-9127-a1f17030e155,N,,2025-08-11 12:12:25.777040

Nuclear power in the U.S. remains substantial, providing about 20 percent of the nation's power supply.
As of 2024, the United States is home to 54 commercial nuclear power plants housing 94 operating nuclear power reactors.
Nuclear energy is both expensive and dangerous, and just because nuclear pollution is invisible doesn’t mean it’s clean,” the organization said.","WASHINGTON, August 11, 2025 – It was a sunny day in Washington. Music by Joni Mitchell, Graham Nash, and Jackson Browne hummed through the streets–but it was nearly drowned out by the roar of the crowd: “No more nukes! No more nukes! No more nukes! No more nukes! No more nukes!”

The chant echoed across the National Mall in May 1979, just weeks after the nuclear meltdown at Three Mile Island. The protest became one of the largest anti-nuclear demonstrations in American history – a day when environmental activists marched together as a unified voice of opposition.

Widespread anti-nuclear protests left a lasting impression, transforming nuclear energy into a source of fear.

And with the memory of Three Mile Island still fresh, the Chernobyl disaster in Ukraine in 1986 soon reinforced the worst of those fears. Even in Western democracies, that same hesitancy was reignited when an earthquake and tsunami caused a cooling malfunction at the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant in Ōkuma, Fukushima, Japan, in 2011. Continuing public fear surrounding nuclear plants has contributed to the shutdown of many facilities across the country.

Yet history proves public memory fades quickly.

In the rising age of artificial intelligence, where energy demand is higher than ever, the nation– including environmental-focused voters–appears willing to accept the risks posed by nuclear energy.

Is there still vocal opposition by environmentalists?

But unlike the last nuclear surge, opposition from environmentalists is noticeably quieter this time around. The politics around clean energy appear to have changed, both in perceptions about what is environmentally friendly, and in the reaction from environmental groups themselves.

Has environmentalism made its peace with big technology companies? The narrative from Silicon Valley increasingly seems to view growing energy demands as inevitable. In this worldview, nuclear power appears to be the lesser evil to oil, natural gas and other fossil fuels.

There's no doubt Americans are relying on AI more than ever. A Gallup report from January 2025 found that eight in ten Americans had used five AI-enabled products within the past seven days.

But few realize the significant energy these AI functions consume.

A Washington Post study, conducted with researchers at the University of California, Riverside, found that running a single AI task–like asking OpenAI’s ChatGPT-4 model to write a quick email–uses 17.54 fluid ounces of water, roughly the amount of a Desani water bottle.

Given this reality, many federal and state government initiatives appear to be turning back to nuclear energy to meet this growing demand.

A second nuclear age?

In July, the U.S. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission announced it opened the door for Holtec International, a nuclear and solar energy company, to revive Michigan’s 800-megawatt Palisades Nuclear Plant, which shut down in 2022. If successful, it would be the first decommissioned nuclear plant to be revived in the U.S.

“This is a proud and historic moment for our team, for Michigan, and for the United States,” said Holtec International President Kelly Trice. “The NRC’s approval to transition Palisades back to an operating license represents an unprecedented milestone in U.S. nuclear energy. Our mission remains clear: to restart Palisades safely, securely, reliably, and in support of America’s energy future – while supporting local jobs and economic growth for decades to come.”

Other states are following suit.

In Pennsylvania, the infamous Three Mile Island, which sparked such controversy in the past, may also be revived under a new name, the Crane Clean Energy Center. Its original Reactor 2 was destroyed during the 1979 meltdown after a cooling malfunction caused part of the reactor's core to melt. The new project, supported by a 20-year power purchase agreement signed in September 2024 between Constellation Energy and Microsoft, plans to restart an adjacent reactor.

In Iowa, NextEra Energy Resources is evaluating nuclear construction at the former Duane Arnold Energy Center, which shut down in August 2020.

And in Idaho, Sawtooth Energy and Development is eyeing 320 acres of public rangeland in northwest Jerome County – an area nearly 40 percent the size of Central Park in Manhattan – for a commercial nuclear facility.

Cleaner than fossil fuels, but scarier than wind or solar?

Nuclear power in the U.S. remains substantial, providing about 20 percent of the nation's power supply. As of 2024, the United States is home to 54 commercial nuclear power plants housing 94 operating nuclear power reactors. But deployment and plants closing still make it a high-profile worry.

Some experts argue nuclear is a cleaner alternative to fossil fuels and more practical than wind or solar.

Dan Adamson, the Project Manager of the proposed Idaho Plant, promoted nuclear for both its minimal footprint and efficiency. He pointed out that nuclear’s footprint is significantly smaller than other methods, and that nuclear reactors run 90 percent more of the time than wind.

Justin Hayes, the Idaho Conservation League Executive Director, hesitantly echoed Adamson’s endorsement, including the Small Modular Reactors (SMRs) that many are touting as less risky than full-scale nuclear power plants.

“We’re open to exploring all technologies that can help Idaho reduce emissions, strengthen grid reliability, and provide affordable electricity,” Hayes said. “Nuclear energy — particularly SMRs — could play a role. But before moving forward, we must ask the right questions.”

Those questions aren’t new.

The U.S. Department of Energy outlined several dangers associated with nuclear energy in 2022.According to the department, spent nuclear fuel remains highly radioactive and continues generating heat long after use. Initially stored in steel-lined pools filled with water, the fuel is eventually transferred to dry storage casks made of steel and concrete for long-term containment. However, if this material is not properly cooled or shielded, it presents significant radiation risks.

Other dangers include core meltdowns from cooling system failures—like those at Three Mile Island, Chernobyl, and Fukushima Daiichi.

Have the risks of nuclear power changed?

Despite lessons learned and technological advances, critics argue that the risks haven’t disappeared.

​“The zombie reactor restart scheme is unneeded, insanely expensive for the public, and extremely high risk for health, safety, security, and the environment,” Kevin Kamps of Beyond Nuclear, a small non-profit, wrote in a response to the Palisades revival.

The global environmental organization Greenpeace USA, also voiced opposition.

“Nuclear energy has no place in a safe, clean, sustainable future. Nuclear energy is both expensive and dangerous, and just because nuclear pollution is invisible doesn’t mean it’s clean,” the organization said. “Renewable energy is better for the environment, the economy, and doesn’t come with the risk of a nuclear meltdown.”

The Sierra Club, a national non-profit environmental organization, also opposes “the licensing, construction and operation of new nuclear reactors utilizing the fission process.”

Yet what is most notable today is the sound of silence: The lack of protests filling the National Mall with chants of “No more nukes!” For example, Advanced Energy United, Greenpeace USA and the Sierra Club all did not respond to Broadband Breakfast’s request for comment about their attitude towards the new push for nuclear power.",https://broadbandbreakfast.com/content/images/2025/08/495306029_1246078086879758_6034138527979727773_n-1.jpg,N,,2025-08-11 11:04:50.236624

Batteries now support efforts to ensure low-cost, domestic energy production. At the U.S. Department of Energy’s (DOE) Argonne National Laboratory, researchers are advancing breakthroughs at every stage in the energy storage lifecycle. From discovering substitutes for scarce, critical materials to pioneering new, real-world applications to making end-of-life recycling more cost effective.

“Batteries are a foundation for American energy abundance, and Argonne researchers can help ensure that tomorrow’s energy storage technologies are safe, efficient, long-lasting and domestically produced.” — Venkat Srinivasan, director of the Argonne Collaborative Center for Energy Storage Science (ACCESS) and the Low-cost Earth-abundant Na-ion Storage (LENS) Consortium

Energy storage, critical elements and supply chains

Energy storage offers many benefits, but it also is complicated by supply chain challenges that affect how technologies are developed and used. Over the last few decades, scientists have dramatically improved lithium-ion batteries in terms of how much energy they can store and how long they last.

As a result, they are now widely used in appliances, vehicles and on the grid. They enable the grid to be more dependable in the face of rising electricity demand and natural disasters. Lithium-ion batteries, however, rely heavily on critical elements like lithium, cobalt and nickel, which are predominantly found abroad. Consequently, battery supply chains are often vulnerable to disruption.

DOE and the national laboratories are working to protect energy infrastructure from potential supply shocks — whether from market fluctuations or national security threats. This requires safe and low-cost energy storage solutions that utilize domestic materials. To meet this need, researchers are working to improve the performance and lifespan of sodium-ion and water-based battery alternatives.

Argonne’s approach

Argonne has long served as a global leader in battery science. Most notably, Argonne researchers played a key role in the development of the nickel-manganese-cobalt oxide (NMC) cathode, which is in many electric vehicles today.

Currently, the laboratory is deploying artificial intelligence (AI) for materials discovery, testing cutting-edge chemistries and supporting U.S. innovation ecosystems to ensure that Argonne innovations match what the market demands.

“Batteries are a foundation for American energy abundance, and Argonne researchers can help ensure that tomorrow’s energy storage technologies are safe, efficient, long-lasting and domestically produced,” said Venkat Srinivasan, director of the Argonne Collaborative Center for Energy Storage Science (ACCESS) and the Low-cost Earth-abundant Na-ion Storage (LENS) Consortium.

“Rooted in fundamental science, our approach supports the U.S. energy storage landscape through practical innovations that use a wide array of battery materials. We’re also harnessing the power of AI to accelerate the pace of discovery and leapfrog current energy storage paradigms.”

To support early-stage energy storage research, Argonne leads the Energy Storage Research Alliance (ESRA), a DOE Energy Innovation Hub that includes Lawrence Berkeley and Pacific Northwest national laboratories and eleven universities across the U.S. Leveraging decades of national investment in basic sciences, ESRA seeks to enable transformative discoveries in materials chemistry and gain a fundamental understanding of electrochemical phenomena at the atomic scale. From there, the hub aims to accelerate technology commercialization, prioritize the development of battery materials that protect the U.S. from supply chain risks and train a next-generation battery workforce for future manufacturing needs.

Argonne also leads the LENS Consortium, convening 14 partners — including six national labs and eight universities — to pioneer safe, affordable and U.S.-sourced sodium-ion batteries as an alternative to lithium-ion systems. Argonne scientists are working to decrease the cost and increase how much energy sodium-ion batteries can store, without compromising safety or lifespan.

Across the laboratory, ACCESS brings together top scientists and engineers to tackle energy storage challenges across various disciplines. To date, the network has supported more than 240 patents, from advanced cathodes to novel electrolytes, helping industries, ranging from automotive to aerospace, move technology from the lab to the global market.

Finally, Argonne is home to the ReCell Center, a national collaboration that unites industry, academia and national laboratories to spur effective battery recycling. Advances in this area can extract more value out of batteries at the end of their initial use, reducing their costs as well as U.S. reliance on foreign raw materials for battery manufacturing.

What’s next

With nationwide electricity demand projected to soar in the years ahead, and 21st century threats challenging 20th century infrastructure, Argonne is scaling its capabilities to meet the energy demands of a new era.

The lab’s upgraded Advanced Photon Source (APS) and Aurora exascale supercomputer, part of the Argonne Leadership Computing Facility (ALCF), serve as leading tools for real-time materials discovery, modeling, and testing and are available for use by Argonne researchers, partner institutions and private companies. APS and ALCF are DOE Office of Science user facilities. Across the lab, researchers are exploring electrified aviation, aqueous grid storage and solid-state lithium-sulfur systems that could double electric vehicle range.

She points to initiatives like New York’s Build Public Renewables Act as stronger models, enabling public utilities to directly develop renewable energy.
Globally, she cautions that energy transitions must be considered within an interconnected system, warning against shifting emissions overseas through exports of fossil fuels.
Looking ahead, Cha stresses that neither the energy transition nor its “just” character is inevitable.","In her new book A Just Transition for All: Workers and Communities for a Carbon-Free Future, climate policy researcher J. Mijin Cha tackles the challenge of moving away from fossil fuels without abandoning the workers and communities tied to these industries. Cha reframes “just transition” as an ongoing process rather than a fixed prescription, arguing that it must address structural inequities while adapting to the specific needs of each community. She outlines a framework of “four-plus pillars” — strong governmental support, dedicated funding, economic diversification, strong coalitions, and an added emphasis on “non-reformist reforms” that dismantle extractive systems while building regenerative alternatives.

Through examples such as Germany’s Ruhr region and the planned (but delayed) closure of California’s Diablo Canyon nuclear power plant, Cha illustrates how the pillars can guide more equitable transitions. The Ruhr benefited from long-term government planning, dedicated funding, and economic diversification, while Diablo Canyon demonstrated the power of strong and diverse coalitions to secure better outcomes. Cha contrasts these cases with the instability in U.S. transition funding — even programs like the Black Lung Fund face recurring budget fights — which hinders the development of new, sustainable industries.

Cha also critiques current U.S. climate policy, notably the Inflation Reduction Act, for overreliance on private sector incentives and underutilization of public sector capacity. She points to initiatives like New York’s Build Public Renewables Act as stronger models, enabling public utilities to directly develop renewable energy. Public ownership, she argues, can facilitate a managed decline of fossil fuels and reinvest revenues into communities. Globally, she cautions that energy transitions must be considered within an interconnected system, warning against shifting emissions overseas through exports of fossil fuels.

Looking ahead, Cha stresses that neither the energy transition nor its “just” character is inevitable. She calls for building broad-based, justice-centered coalitions that address economic inequality alongside climate action, emphasizing that people will not prioritize climate goals if they are struggling to meet basic needs. In her view, the climate movement must evolve into a social justice movement, centering community voices and delivering tangible benefits that make everyone a climate advocate.",https://www.planetizen.com/files/images/AdobeStock_380140085.jpeg,N,,2025-08-11 11:04:59.622894

Well, today is the big day, and as it turns out, the reveal of what Ford is calling the Universal EV Platform and Universal EV Production System means the answer will likely be ""all of the above."" But the first vehicle we'll see is a mid-size electric truck.

According to Ford, the still-yet-unnamed four-door truck will have ""a targeted starting price of about $30,000"" and go on sale in 2027.

It'll also be built at Ford's Louisville Assembly Plant and allegedly offer a lower cost of ownership than a Tesla Model Y.

Exact pricing and other specs won't be revealed until a later date, so we still don't know what kind of range this truck will have, but we do know it will use lithium iron phosphate batteries that are both nickel and cobalt-free. That should be better for the planet, but according to Ford, it's also better for manufacturing and ownership, since the battery pack can be lighter and smaller, freeing up more space for passengers and reducing vehicle weight. Plus, they should be cheaper to build and also last longer than the traditional batteries used in EVs.

From the sound of it, the new Universal EV Platform and Universal EV Production System are actually pretty big steps forward, too. Ford says the new platform uses 20% fewer parts compared to a typical vehicle and 25% fewer fasteners, while assembly requires 40% fewer workstations and can be completed 15% faster. The wiring harness on the new truck will also be 4,000 feet shorter and 22 pounds lighter than the one found in the Mach-E. Part of reducing that part count is Ford's use of large, single-piece aluminum castings, which eliminates the need to weld a bunch of smaller parts together and will allow Ford to assemble the front and rear of the truck separately.

That process will also allow Ford to build its upcoming truck on three different sub-assembly lines instead of one giant one, and according to Ford, the new assembly lines also improve ergonomics for workers. That will allow it to build vehicles 40% faster, although Ford says some of that saved time will be reinvested elsewhere to improve quality and reduce cost, which will still net a 15% faster total assembly time.

It all sounds great, but we're still going to have to see the final specs and also actually drive the new truck before we have any idea how successful (or unsuccessful) Ford's actually been here. It's easy to talk a big game, but it's a lot harder to deliver the first in a series of vehicles that you claim qualifies as your ""next Model T moment."" After all, remember how much Infiniti talked about how important the launch of the Infiniti QX50 was, only to launch an underwhelming product that failed to meet the moment?

For now, though, we'll allow Ford to talk itself up, especially since this is ultimately a $5 billion investment in its future that could provide thousands of jobs. In a statement, Ford President and CEO Jim Farley said:

We took a radical approach to a very hard challenge: Create affordable vehicles that delight customers in every way that matters – design, innovation, flexibility, space, driving pleasure, and cost of ownership – and do it with American workers. We have all lived through far too many 'good college tries' by Detroit automakers to make affordable vehicles that ends up with idled plants, layoffs and uncertainty. So, this had to be a strong, sustainable and profitable business. From Day 1, we knew there was no incremental path to success. We empowered a tiny skunkworks team three time zones away from Detroit. We tore up the moving assembly line concept and designed a better one. And we found a path to be the first automaker to make prismatic LFP batteries in the U.S.""

The LFP batteries, especially, sound like they have a lot of potential, and a $30,000 electric truck would be a big deal, but now it's time for Ford to actually deliver on these big promises. Especially the part where it insists quality will improve, since it's been having a hell of a time with recalls lately. The Mach-E was a solid start, and the new truck sounds promising, but will it actually sell? And what about the other vehicles Ford plans to build on the new platform? Hopefully, we at least get an answer to some of these questions soon.",https://www.jalopnik.com/img/gallery/fords-next-model-t-moment-starts-with-a-30000-mid-size-electric-truck/l-intro-1754922975.jpg,N,,2025-08-11 13:08:46.082626

The Universal EV Platform is the product of much touted skunkworks that Ford established in Long Beach, California to develop its next generation of electric vehicles.
When it was announced, the Slate truck was touted as starting under $20,000 after the federal EV tax credits.
This time, Ford has apparently learned a lot from the way Tesla and many Chinese automakers are building electric vehicles.
Ford is likely to be the first legacy automaker to take this approach to building electric vehicles.","Back in 2019, a startup called Lordstown Motors showed off a full-size electric pickup truck that it planned to build in a former GM assembly plant in Ohio. In spring 2021, Ford showed a small group of analysts and media the F-150 Lightning and all prospects for Lordstown to succeed were immediately dashed. With the announcements being made at Ford’s Louisville Assembly Plant today, the Dearborn automaker may have just done the same to another startup, Slate that made a huge media splash this spring. In 2026, Ford will spend $5 billion to retool the Louisville plant to build vehicles based on what it is now calling its Universal EV Platform.

The Universal EV Platform is the product of much touted skunkworks that Ford established in Long Beach, California to develop its next generation of electric vehicles. If Ford is actually able to execute on its plan, the first product from this platform could be the death knell for Slate. When it was announced, the Slate truck was touted as starting under $20,000 after the federal EV tax credits. Unfortunately for Slate, just a couple of months after the introduction, the US Congress passed a tax and spending bill that kills those federal incentives for buying an EV less than two months from now while the truck won’t arrive until late 2026.

That means buyers will be spending at least $27,000 (as it’s currently priced although that could change) for a two-door, unpainted pickup with manual windows and no infotainment system. Most customers will probably end up paying prices closer to the mid-$30,000 range. Those are prices comparable to Ford’s already popular Maverick compact that has four doors and can seat four (or five in a pinch).

The first product from the Ford Universal EV Platform is a mid-size pickup truck that the company announced about a year ago when it also announced it was cancelling a three-row electric SUV program and to focus on the new platform. That truck is now planned to start production around the end of 2026 and go on sale to customers in 2027.

At the moment, Ford is saying the new electric truck will have a starting price of about $30,000, placing it right between the $28,145 starting price of a Maverick and the $33,350 entry point for the mid-size Ranger. We haven’t seen what it looks like, but Ford says it will have more interior space than the Toyota Rav4 which has 98.3 cubic feet in the 2025 model. The current Ranger has 98.9 cubic feet of passenger space so we can assume the new truck will be somewhere around 100 cubic feet although Ford says that it will have a footprint closer in size to the Maverick which is about 200-inches long. Like the Lightning the new truck will have a frunk as well for enclosed storage.

What we can also assume is that while the new Ford will probably be fairly minimalist, following the pattern of Tesla and Chinese automakers in moving as much as possible into the touchscreen interface, it won’t follow the Slate route. It will be painted and will have an infotainment system plus we already know it has four seats that will be much more appealing to consumers. Even in base form, Ford will almost certainly offer more than Slate, including range.

Ford spokesperson Emma Berg added, “We do not believe that you need to strip out features, functionality, screens or even seats to make a vehicle affordable. We will achieve affordability by radically simplifying parts and process. Our four-door midsize electric truck – when bought brand new at launch – is forecasted to have a better five-year total cost of ownership than a three-year-old used Model Y.”

How are they getting cost down?

When it launched the Lightning, Ford promised a starting price for the work truck of $40,000, but within months, the Russian invasion of Ukraine caused a spike in mineral prices that led to higher battery costs and a corresponding increase in the price of the trucks. This time, Ford has apparently learned a lot from the way Tesla and many Chinese automakers are building electric vehicles. In 2022, Tesla was the first automaker to adopt an architecture consisting of two large aluminum die castings for the front and rear structure and a structural battery pack that comprises the floor.

The Universal platform is doing the same thing. That means this won’t be a body-on-frame truck like the Ranger or F-Series, but will be more like the Maverick albeit a bit larger. Instead of a floor panel in the body in the white, the battery pack itself will make up the floor of the truck.

When we visited the still under construction Blue Oval Battery Park factory in Marshall, Michigan in June, we learned that Ford is not only producing lithium iron phosphate cells but full battery packs there. These structural packs will be shipped to Louisville for vehicle assembly. The Marshall plant has a capacity of 20 GWh per year and is scheduled to supply eight different models comprising 240,000 units per year in the coming years. That’s an average of 83 kWh per vehicle.

The battery is being manufactured in a different way from Ford’s other packs. Instead of pouch cells using a nickel-manganese-cobalt (NMC) cathode chemistry, the new cells are rectangular prismatic cans with lithium iron phosphate (LFP) chemistry. LFP has about 30% less energy density than NMC, but it is much more stable and safer. That means the cells don’t need to be packed into separate modules to isolate them and try to prevent thermal runaway if they are damaged or defective. The prismatic LFP cells can be packed directly into the outer battery case allowing more cells to be installed. The result is fewer parts, and twice as much of the pack volume being active cell material that stores energy. The combination of LFP being about 30-40% cheaper per kWh than NMC and the simplified back architecture should probably yield about a 50% cost reduction compared to the batteries currently used in the Mustang Mach-E and Lightning.

Ford is emphasizing the efficiency gains in this new platform which includes advancements in motor and power electronics that should enable this truck to deliver close to 300 miles of range on a charge if it has a battery in that 83-kWh area although Ford isn’t giving any specs at the moment. One thing Ford has revealed is that the platform has a 400V architecture, another cost saving measure compared to some of the 800V systems on the market, but that should still enable charging speeds approaching 200-kW.

How are they building it?

The Louisville plant currently builds the Ford Escape and Lincoln Corsair on traditional transfer lines. In this process, the body is loaded on one end of the line and components and systems are gradually added as the line moves until a complete vehicle rolls off the other end. It’s not a fundamentally different concept from the way the Model T was built a century ago.

Starting late this year, production of the Escape and Corsair will end in Louisville and Ford will be removing the traditional assembly line and replacing it with what it calls an assembly tree. The Ford Universal EV Production System will consist of three parallel sub-assembly lines. These will be used to assemble the front structure, rear structure and the battery and interior. Like other leaders in the EV space, Ford is adopting large scale aluminum die castings that replace dozens or hundreds of smaller stamped and cast components that have to be welded together. Tesla calls this “gigacasting”, but that is just a marketing term with no inherent meaning.

Like Tesla, Xpeng and others, the carpet, seats and most of the interior will be installed directly onto the top of the structural battery case. This will make assembly much easier since those components don’t have to be maneuvered through the door openings. Ford is also using a simplified zonal electrical/electronic architecture. This is a separate development project from a similar system called FNV4 that Ford cancelled earlier this year. Instead of a complex wiring harness with dozens or upwards of 100 electronic control units, a zonal system is more consolidated with just a small handful of ECUs. Last year Rivian adopted a similar system for the revamped R1 series that reduced the system down to four main ECUs and three zone controllers. Ford’s executive director of Advanced EV Development Alan Clarke has stated that the new platform will eliminate 4,000 ft of wiring.

At the end of the three sub-assembly lines, the structures are joined together to produce the complete vehicle. This approach will make it easier to utilize different variants of the front and rear structures for different vehicle form factors like SUVs and perhaps even cars. In total, Ford is investing $2 billion in Louisville along with the $3 billion around being invested in Marshall and other facilities.

Ford is likely to be the first legacy automaker to take this approach to building electric vehicles. If it can execute on its plans (something that is much easier said than done), it has the potential to significantly undercut both traditional competition like GM and Stellantis as well as Tesla, Slate and others. Even without federal tax incentives, these are vehicles that are price competitive with internal combustion vehicles and could even be profitable. If electric vehicles are to succeed in a US market that has one side of the political spectrum fighting to kill the technology, this approach needs to work for Ford. The future competitiveness of the US auto industry depends on it.",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/6899f506810d0432ba1249ba/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,N,,2025-08-11 12:06:51.660025

The European Union is looking to ban sales of new internal-combustion cars starting in a decade.","Happy Monday! It's August 11, 2025, and this is The Morning Shift — your daily roundup of the top automotive headlines from around the world, in one place. This is where you'll find the most important stories that are shaping the way Americans drive and get around.

In this morning's edition, we're looking at a peak amidst Tesla's tumbling, as well as Mercedes' puppy-dog eyes to the EU over continued ICE development. We'll also look at the temporary pausing of a lithium mine in China, and an NHTSA investigation into Kia.

In economics, there's something called a ""dead cat bounce."" When a company is tumbling down, it'll often have a brief period where everything starts looking good — the stock rises, there's a brief rally to combat the inexorable decline, and people swear that this is the beginning of a new era. It never is. Even a dead cat will bounce once, and so many companies do the same. In related news, Tesla — an automaker that's hemorrhaged sales month over month, quarter after quarter, in response to its CEO's meddling in U.S. politics — is showing longer waits for vehicle deliveries as the EV tax credit draws to a close. From Barron's:

Tesla recently increased its estimated wait times for its most popular electric vehicle, the Model Y, to four to six weeks from a recent range of one to three weeks. It's a signal of more order activity.

Higher demand is good news, but there is a catch. This is the last quarter buyers can qualify for the federal purchase tax credit worth up to $7,500. That benefit was eliminated in President Donald Trump's tax and spending bill, passed on July 4.

No one knows exactly what will happen to EV pricing and demand in the fourth quarter when the credit goes away. Tesla CEO Elon Musk warned of some ""rough quarters"" ahead on his company's second quarter earnings conference call, referring to the loss of the credit at a time when Tesla's driverless technology was ramping up.

Does Tesla meet the technical definition for a dead cat bounce? Almost certainly not, given that the stock's been trading relatively flat since May. But it's an interesting comparison on the sales side, seeing a flagging company suddenly have an influx of business. I wonder how many it has left in it.

The European Union is looking to ban sales of new internal-combustion cars starting in a decade. This is a very slow baby step towards preserving the habitability of some amount of our planet, yet for companies that sell internal-combustion cars it's beyond the pale. Take Ola Kaellenius, CEO of Mercedes-Benz, who said the ban needs a ""reality check. From Reuters:

The CEO of Mercedes-Benz criticised the European Union's plan to ban CO2-emitting vehicles from 2035 in a media interview on Monday, joining a chorus of voices calling the target into question as it comes up for review this year.

The ban, which supporters say is crucial to Europe's green ambitions, is up for review in the second half of 2025, with critics saying it would handicap European carmakers already struggling with weak demand, Chinese competition and disappointing electric vehicle sales.

""We need a reality check. Otherwise we are heading at full speed against a wall,"" Mercedes CEO Ola Kaellenius told the Handelsblatt business daily of the 2035 goal, adding that Europe's car market could ""collapse"" if it goes ahead.

...

""Of course we have to decarbonise, but it has to be done in a technology-neutral way. We must not lose sight of our economy,"" Kaellenius said.

Remember that when companies talk about ""the economy,"" they mean their own profits. What Kaellenius is saying here is that keeping the planet habitable is important, but doing so should never impinge on Mercedes' ability to rake in that sweet sweet cash. I imagine asbestos insulation manufacturers and makers of leaded gasoline probably tried similar lines, and we're objectively better off without those too. You shouldn't get to run roughshod over the planet just because it makes you, personally, money.

Speaking of the other side of things, though, massive battery supplier Contemporary Amperex Technology Co. Limited (CATL) is finding itself in a bit of a pinch. It operates a number of lithium mines, where it gathers the raw materials for EV batteries, but that number just dropped by one as crucial permits expired at one site — the Jianxiawo mine is shuttered, and likely will be for months before the paperwork can be sorted out. From Bloomberg:

Battery giant Contemporary Amperex Technology Co. Ltd. has suspended production at a major lithium mine in China's Jiangxi province for at least three months, according to people familiar with the matter.

CATL, the world's largest manufacturer of electric-vehicle batteries, has announced internally that the Jianxiawo mine would be temporarily halting operations, they said. One of the people said the suspension came after the company failed to extend a key mining permit which expired on Aug. 9.

...

A second person briefed on the matter said affiliated refineries in nearby Yichun had been informed of the closure. The first person added the company was still in talks with government agencies to secure a renewal but was preparing for the halt to last months. The people asked not to be named as they are not authorized to speak publicly.

CATL supplies batteries to major names like BMW and Mercedes-Benz, and a hitch in its supply chain hurts manufacturers downstream. Hopefully, the company can meet demand with lithium from its other minds without the sort of supply shortage that would skyrocket prices for lithium — and for lithium-heavy electric cars.

Back in Februaty, Kia recalled 2021 to 2023 Seltos and Soul models for an issue with the piston rings. Now, NHTSA is investigating the repair, with the thought that the cars may need a round of revisions before they're truly safe and reliable. From Reuters:

The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said it had opened an audit into 137,256 Kia America vehicles on Friday to assess the effectiveness of the automaker's remedy for defective piston oil rings in some Seltos and Soul models.

In February, Kia America launched a recall of the said Seltos and Soul vehicles, model year 2021-2023, over concerns that piston oil rings may have been manufactured incorrectly, which can result in engine damage causing a loss of motive power or an increased fire risk.

(NHTSA administrator voice) You're lucky that shot of regular gasoline didn't blow the welds on the intake.

“The Commissioners have a choice – and a chance to prove them wrong,” she added.
Transmission costs will add approximately $2 billion more in costs to the project overall.
While Entergy claims publicly that Meta will cover the costs of the power plants over the course of their agreement, the contract between Entergy and Meta is for only 15 years – the average lifespan of a gas-fired power plant is between 30 to 45 years.
As Louisiana’s only dedicated Watchdog we monitor, educate, and participate in state and city utility regulation to ensure the public's best interests.","On Thursday Entergy requested the Louisiana Public Service Commission (LPSC) proceed with a vote at their August 20 meeting on whether to grant final, expedited approval of Entergy Louisiana’s proposal to provide 2.3 gigawatts (GW) for a data center being constructed in Richland Parish for Meta, the Silicon Valley corporation that owns social media entities such as Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp.

After being announced by Meta and Governor Jeff Landry in December of 2024 along with vague and unverifiable claims that the data center would create thousands of jobs, Entergy initiated the regulatory process required for approval of a proposal for three new, gas-fired power plants and significant new transmission infrastructure.

Already, this process was being expedited under the auspices of serving the “public interest” – namely, Entergy was allowed to bypass entirely the Request for Proposal competitive bidding process that is normally required for projects of this scale, which would ensure that customers are being provided the least cost form of generation for costs that they will be required to pay.

Now, after rushing through a process that has not even been completed, Entergy and Meta are pressuring the LPSC to include final decision-making on the Meta docket at the August 20th Business & Executive (B&E) meeting – previously, final decision-making was to take place in October of this year, moving potential approval of the project up by two months.

“The push to force through approval of the Meta proposal is illustrative of our greatest concern – that corporate utilities believe the Louisiana Public Service Commission answers first and foremost to them, not Louisiana ratepayers,” said Logan Atkinson Burke, Executive Director of The Alliance.

“The Commissioners have a choice – and a chance to prove them wrong,” she added.

“At no point in this process have ratepayers been given a fair shake, or even the opportunity to fully understand what their regulators are agreeing to on their behalf,” Burke said. “And what regulators will be deciding will have consequences for decades to come – likely resulting in ever greater increases on monthly electric bills for Entergy customers, not only in North Louisiana, but across the state.”

The proposed 2.3 GWs represents approximately twice the amount of electricity demanded by New Orleans each summer, with costs for the gas-fired power plants expected to be $3.2 billion alone. Transmission costs will add approximately $2 billion more in costs to the project overall.

While Entergy claims publicly that Meta will cover the costs of the power plants over the course of their agreement, the contract between Entergy and Meta is for only 15 years – the average lifespan of a gas-fired power plant is between 30 to 45 years. Because Meta is not a formal party to the regulatory process, all details of their agreement have been kept confidential and away from public scrutiny – including how much other customers will be on the hook for paying to power Meta alone.

“There is so much that we do not know about what this project will mean for Louisiana’s ratepayers – from small businesses to working families, industrial customers to churches and schools,” said Alaina DiLaura, LPSC Policy Coordinator for The Alliance. “By rushing this process, our questions are even less likely to be answered, and ratepayers may not know what’s coming until it's too late, and they see their already expensive monthly electric bills skyrocket.”

“That’s exactly why we need our regulators to slow things down – there is no reason to rush approval of this docket other than to avoid having to answer hard questions,” DiLaura added.

We’ll take a look at the week ahead and look back on what you may have missed last week.

A HAMSTRUNG BPU — POLITICO’s Ry Rivard: The New Jersey Board of Public Utilities is scheduled to hold its first meeting Wednesday since the abrupt departure of Republican member Marian Abdou, who said last month she was leaving to tend to her family.

Now, the three-member board — which is designed to have five members — will have two Democrats and one Republican. And, to do anything, all of its votes must be unanimous.

The board is operating under these conditions: Three affirmative votes, constituting a majority of the authorized membership of the board, is required for the board to act on any matter that comes before it. A quorum of two of the three is required to meet, but just two members can’t act.

The board’s composition isn’t exactly conducive to moving a progressive energy agenda. Though Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy did nominate every member of the current board, one of them is a Republican and one of the two Democrats is Zenon Christodoulou, who in April balked at approving solar energy subsidies and criticized the way the BPU operates.

IN THE SPOTLIGHT — New Jersey gubernatorial candidates Jack Ciattarelli and Mikie Sherrill are sparring on social media over, of all things, regional grid operator PJM.

“Your energy prices aren’t going up because of some regional nonprofit organization you’ve likely never heard of,” Ciattarelli said. “It’s a bunch of BS.”

The Republican pinned blame on the Murphy administration for being “obsessed” with offshore wind, an industry that was supposed to be a major source of in-state power but was obviously not ready for prime time.

Democrats, including Sherrill, have tried to villainize PJM because the auction it holds to secure power supplies has increased utility bills across New Jersey by some $25 per month.

Ciattarelli’s video prompted a reply from Sherrill who pointed out that Republican governors from Tennessee and Virginia have also called out PJM for threatening affordability across the 13-state region, which includes some of the reddest states in the country, like West Virginia.

She blamed Republicans for nixing policies that would have helped develop clean energy and said bringing down energy prices would be a top priority. “But you can’t do that if you’re completely unwilling to stand up to the people raising New Jerseyans’ energy costs,” she posted on X. — Ry Rivard

PJM, PART 2 — Governors have agreed on two names to fill vacancies on the board of PJM.

An energy official familiar with the agreement told POLITICO that they have settled on a pair of former Federal Energy Regulatory Commission members: Allison Clements and Mark Christie. Clements, a lawyer based in D.C., served on the FERC board during the Biden administration, and Christie was named in January by President Donald Trump to be commission chair.

If approved by PJM, Clements and Christie would fill the nine-member voting board while also giving states more representation as they push for reforms amid rising energy costs for customers.

“We think these two candidates are going to meet the moment,” the energy official said.

Last month, a bipartisan group of nine state governors sent a letter to PJM calling for fundamental changes and to appoint new leadership. — Dustin Racioppi

What you may have missed

SOLAR TERMINATED — POLITICO’s Alex Guillén: EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin on Thursday announced he will terminate the agency’s $7 billion Solar for All program, calling it a “green slush fund” that has been repealed by Congress.

— New York expected to receive nearly $250 million from the Solar for All federal program — the largest for a single state. Some of the money was earmarked for New York City to support a program for 5,000 households to get solar, along with solar for affordable housing. The anticipated federal money was one justification cited by the Public Service Commission in April when it reduced the ratepayer-funded budget for solar subsidies by about $150 million. The state is on track to hit a 10 gigawatt distributed solar target before 2030. New Jersey was also awarded $156 million, which officials said would support 175 megawatts of solar for 22,000 households.

WIND WOES — POLITICO’s Kelsey Tamborrino: The Trump administration is escalating its onslaught of actions against U.S. offshore wind development — this time launching a full-scale review of its regulations to see if they mesh with President Donald Trump’s priorities and existing law.

CLIMATE SCIENTIST FOR CONGRESS — POLITICO’s Matt Friedman: A climate scientist who until recently worked for the U.S. Department of Agriculture announced her candidacy for Congress in the 7th District on Thursday, joining an extremely crowded field of Democrats hoping to take on Republican Rep. Tom Kean next year.

SOIL SCRAMBLE — Commercial real estate developers in New Jersey are scrambling to comply with new soil remediation and redevelopment standards the Department of Environmental Protection released. The new standards, meant to align with previously published groundwater quality standards, took effect immediately, with some exceptions. They are meant to protect water supplies by requiring soil to have fewer chemicals that leach into water. The chemicals include benzene, cyanide and vinyl chloride.

Emily Lamond, a lawyer at Cole Schotz who represents brownfield developers, said DEP was making “drastic, substantive” changes to the soil standard that skirted the administrative procedures process, will drive up costs and could disrupt active deals. Without redevelopment, sites could otherwise remain vacant and contaminated. “DEP is pulling the rug out from underneath developers and frustrating the well-established process in the commercial real estate industry that gets money to clean up contaminated properties that would otherwise be abandoned,” Lamond said.

DEP pointed to the language in its notice that said the soil standards are incorporated by reference in the ground water rule. “Accordingly, the Remediation Standards announced in the listserv were not subject to the formal [Administrative Procedures Act] process in accordance with the Remediation Standards,” the department said. — Ry Rivard

CAP AND INVEST COST CONCERNS: Gov. Kathy Hochul acknowledged the reason she delayed a cap-and-trade program she once championed was about cost. “Cap and invest has been a tool. But I also cannot ignore the fact that the disruptions in our economy that have occurred since the laws went into place, but also even since we even supported this, that need to be examined in terms of what has happened to people’s pocketbooks,” Hochul told reporters on Wednesday. “I believe that is the right way to go, but I also have to moderate and make sure that I’m not doing something that’s going to drive up cost for consumers right now, and the data shows at this time it would.”

In January, she said she wanted to “get it right” and the state needed additional information from polluters — without bringing up affordability at all. Environmental groups are suing over the delay as New York is not on track to meet its climate goals. Although state officials finished drafting the entire package of rules before Hochul punted, her administration has yet to give any updated timeline for full implementation or even when anything will be released except the reporting regulations. The state hasn’t released any public modeling of the potential costs of a cap-and-invest program since January 2024, which showed cost increases for those with fossil fuel heating and gas cars. Studies backed by environmental groups indicated higher carbon prices would reap more benefits for low-income households.

New York’s draft energy plan indicates Hochul’s officials don’t expect to meet the state’s emissions reduction requirements on schedule, instead outlining what they’ve described as a more achievable approach. The elimination of federal support for electric vehicles, heat pumps and renewables is expected to make achieving progress on New York’s emissions reduction goals more challenging and costly. — Marie J. French

NUCLEAR SUBSIDIES STRETCH ON — POLITICO’s Marie J. French: Gov. Kathy Hochul’s administration wants to keep New York’s aging upstate nuclear plants online for decades to come.

The Department of Public Service proposed extending the current subsidy program for Constellation’s four nuclear reactors from the current end date of 2029 through 2049. The payments would come from ratepayers and could cost more than $30 billion, according to one estimate from a group opposed to the program. The state estimates it would cost about half that amount.

“We really need to ask ourselves, as a state, whether this is a good use of our money and if the opportunity costs are worth it,” said Jessica Azulay, executive director of the Alliance for a Green Economy.

Why it matters: Supporters of keeping the nuclear plants online say it’s a good deal for emissions-free power to meet growing energy demand. New York’s 2019 climate law requires a zero-emissions grid by 2040, although the state doesn’t have a definitive plan to meet that goal.

HOW TO COUNT A SETTLEMENT — Reporters, investors and the public were presented with competing numbers for the size of an inarguably massive PFAS-related settlement New Jersey reached with DuPont and its related companies.

State officials said the settlement was “valued at over $2 billion” and was “the largest environmental settlement ever achieved by a single state.”

By contrast, the DuPont companies (Chemours Company, DuPont de Nemours, Inc. and Corteva, Inc.) said “settlement payments will total $875 million.”

Both sides were obviously counting differently. They were also talking to a different audience: the company needs to keep investors happy, the state wants to assure people it’s dealing with widespread contamination from “forever chemicals” that pose a threat to public health.

The two sides’ public statements partly align: They both talked about the $875 million to resolve PFAS claims across the state. They also both described a $475 million fund the DuPont companies created (a “backstop,” in the state’s parlance; a “reserve fund” in the companies’ telling) to be extra sure there is money around to clean up four current and former DuPont sites in the state.

But the biggest ticket item in the state’s telling is the creation of the main fund to clean up those four sites, “a remediation funding source of up to $1.2 billion.”

In a press release by DuPont, no such figure was given. DuPont companies instead talked about the settlement’s establishment of “a process for determining the amount of the Remediation Funding Source (‘RFS’) at the four current and former operating sites and the initial range for each, as well as other mechanisms to secure future remediation at the sites.”

The money and the process where the statements didn’t align relates to the companies’ commitment to fund cleanup at four specific current or former DuPont sites. Two of them — Chambers Works in Salem County and Parlin in Middlesex County — are PFAS-related sites. Two are not: Pompton Lakes in Passaic County and a site in Gloucester County known as Repauno.

In the 108-page proposed settlement, the two sides create an elaborate process to determine how much those sites will cost to clean up and provide assurances to the state that the companies are good for the money. The initial high end of that range is about $1.2 billion, while the low end is about $232 million. To the state, the point is to make clear there’s enough money around for the cleanup. Part of the reason for that caution is the very existence of Chemours, a company that the state and others allege was created by DuPont in an attempt to avoid liabilities.

Like all settlements, there’s something for everyone in these figures and in the telling.

For the state, an eye-popping upper end recovery is a trophy for the state after years of litigation by Gov. Phil Murphy’s administration, particularly Attorney General Matthew Platkin and Department of Environmental Protection Commissioner Shawn LaTourette.

The biggest slice of the $875 million is $525 million that can be spent across the state to support water quality infrastructure. Of the rest, $225 million will be spent in the region around the four industrial sites and $125 million is for things like attorneys’ fees and for punitive damages and penalties.

The value the state officials could announce is big — bigger than any other environmental deal of its kind. (Of course, there is a caveat: Louisiana received more than $8 billion after the Deepwater Horizon explosion. But that was the result of various legal settlements and fines, including litigation involving the federal government and other states. New Jersey’s deal with the DuPont companies comes from multiple lawsuits and administrative actions and resolves even future claims, but all of them state’s own.)

For the companies, there is now certainty about their liability in New Jersey, which has been suing DuPont and its related companies for years over pollution in the state. In a Tuesday earnings call, executives from DuPont de Nemours told investors and analysts that their share of the $875 million isn’t material to the company since it can be paid over the next quarter century.

The executives also focused on the amount of the settlement specifically related to PFAS-laden firefighting foam — $4.125 million. The company still faces a volume of litigation from the foam, which was used at airports and other non-DuPont sites across the country. Being able to talk about the foam-related costs as being only a few percent of the overall settlement with New Jersey was a win for the company. — Ry Rivard

RA, PJM, PSEG — PSEG CEO Ralph LaRossa said the company is advocating for “some decisions to be made by the state” about how the state supplies itself with power. He wants to drive that decision by talking with the Murphy administration and “having conversations with the potential gubernatorial candidates.”

“Within the confines of PJM, it’s hard to see the path to new generation through existing market signals, which may require the consideration of a new approach to procuring capacity and resource planning,” LaRossa said during a Tuesday earnings call.

Elsewhere in the state, the Board of Public Utilities was holding a day-long resource adequacy technical conference on some of those same issues, including one where PSEG senior vice president Joseph Accardo Jr. was making some of the LaRossa’s same points. The company wants to know the forecast, reliability, affordability and environmental targets the state wants.

During the earnings call, LaRossa flagged the bill that would allow regulated utilities to compete for in-state generation projects.

But the idea of giving regulated utilities back the same authority they once had to build power plants got a chilly reception from some of the panelists at the BPU event. Glen Thomas, the head of the PJM Power Providers Group, which advocates for competitive power players, called vertically integrated utilities clunky, inefficient and costly. Former BPU general counsel Abraham Silverman, now a researcher at Johns Hopkins University, talked up the advantages of competitive bidding for generation projects and warned of rushing into “self-build” projects.

LaRossa also publicly repeated that the company expects rates to be “near flat” following the PJM capacity auction last month. That’s because while the price for having power plants on standby jumped, the power to produce the power has fallen. — Ry Rivard",https://static.politico.com/3d/ee/f4d549cf4e548af6712990ce5b9e/politico-cms-shared-graphic-1120x629.jpg,N,,2025-08-11 11:06:50.990125

Ford Universal EV Platform: New platform enables a family of affordable vehicles to be produced at scale for customers – electric, fun to drive and digitally advanced with over-the-air updates that will keep improving the vehicle.

Breakthrough product: The first will be a midsize four-door electric pickup with a targeted starting price of about $30,000, assembled at Louisville Assembly Plant and reaching customers in 2027. As fast as a Mustang EcoBoost. More passenger space than the latest Toyota RAV4 – with a frunk and a bed.

A better assembly line: More than a century after the invention of the moving assembly line, Ford combines its industrial know-how with a start-up mentality to create the new Ford Universal EV Production System, radically simplifying vehicle assembly for safety, quality and speed.

LOUISVILLE, Ky., Aug. 11, 2025 – Ford Motor Company is once again taking a revolutionary leap forward in engineering and manufacturing to bring a new family of affordable, high-quality electric vehicles within reach for millions around the world.

The new Ford Universal EV Platform and Ford Universal EV Production System introduced today were born from a team that combines the discipline, expertise and scale of a company with 122 years of experience with the speed, innovation and first-principles thinking of a California-based electric vehicle hardware and software skunkworks team.

The result: a simple, efficient, flexible ecosystem to deliver a family of affordable, electric, software-defined vehicles – the first of which is a midsize, four-door electric pickup that will be assembled at Ford’s Louisville Assembly Plant for U.S. and export markets. Its launch is scheduled for 2027.

“We took a radical approach to a very hard challenge: Create affordable vehicles that delight customers in every way that matters – design, innovation, flexibility, space, driving pleasure, and cost of ownership – and do it with American workers,” said Ford President and CEO Jim Farley.

“We have all lived through far too many ‘good college tries’ by Detroit automakers to make affordable vehicles that ends up with idled plants, layoffs and uncertainty. So, this had to be a strong, sustainable and profitable business. From Day 1, we knew there was no incremental path to success. We empowered a tiny skunkworks team three time zones away from Detroit. We tore up the moving assembly line concept and designed a better one. And we found a path to be the first automaker to make prismatic LFP batteries in the U.S.”

The Ford Universal EV Platform

The numbers tell the story, Farley said. The platform reduces parts by 20% versus a typical vehicle, with 25% fewer fasteners, 40% fewer workstations dock-to-dock in the plant and 15% faster assembly time. Lower cost of ownership over five years than a three-year-old used Tesla Model Y.

Take for instance the wiring harness in the new midsize truck; it will be more than 4,000 feet (1.3 kilometers) shorter and 10 kilograms lighter than the one used in our first-gen electric SUV.

Lithium iron phosphate (LFP) prismatic batteries also enable space and weight savings, while delivering cost reduction and durability for customers. The platform’s cobalt-free and nickel-free LFP battery pack is a structural sub-assembly that also serves as the vehicle’s floor. This low center of gravity improves handling, creates a quiet cabin, and provides a surprising amount of interior space.

The new midsize truck is forecasted to have more passenger room than the latest Toyota RAV4, even before you include the frunk and the truck bed. You can lock your surfboards or other gear in that bed – no roof rack or trailer hitch racks required.

But it’s not just about space and utility. Ford makes passion products – and this electric vehicle platform with a low center of gravity from the battery, instant torque from electric motors and obsessive chassis engineering will make it fun to drive. The midsize truck will have a targeted 0-60 time as fast as a Mustang EcoBoost, with more downforce.

“We took inspiration from the Model T – the universal car that changed the world,” said Doug Field, Ford chief EV, digital and design officer. “We assembled a really brilliant collection of minds across Ford and unleashed them to find new solutions to old problems. We applied first‑principles engineering, pushing to the limits of physics to make it fun to drive and compete on affordability. Our new zonal electric architecture unlocks capabilities the industry has never seen. This isn’t a stripped‑down, old‑school vehicle.”

Additional specifications for the midsize electric truck – including reveal date, starting price, EPA-estimated battery range, battery sizes and charge times – will be communicated later.

The Ford Universal EV Production System

The Ford team obsessed about efficiency in manufacturing, too, transforming the traditional assembly line into an “assembly tree”. Instead of one long conveyor, three sub-assemblies run down their own lines simultaneously and then join together.

Large single-piece aluminum unicastings replace dozens of smaller parts, enabling the front and rear of the vehicle to be assembled separately.

The front and rear are then combined with the third sub-assembly, the structural battery, which is independently assembled with seats, consoles and carpeting, to form the vehicle.

Parts travel down the assembly tree to operators in a kit. Within that kit, all fasteners, scanners and power tools required for the job are included – and in the correct orientation for use.

The Ford Universal EV Production System dramatically improves ergonomics for employees by reducing twisting, reaching and bending, allowing them to focus on the job at hand.

Because of the integration between the Ford Universal EV Production System and Platform, assembly of the midsize electric truck could be up to 40% faster than Louisville Assembly Plant’s current vehicles. Some of that time will be reinvested into insourcing and automation to improve quality and cost, ultimately netting a 15% speed improvement.

“We put our employees at the center and re-created the factory from scratch,” said Bryce Currie, Ford vice president, Americas Manufacturing. “We live and breathe continuous improvement, but sometimes you need a dramatic leap forward. We expect ergonomic breakthroughs and complexity reduction – through elimination of parts, connectors and wire – will flow through to significant quality and cost wins.”

Continued Investment in American Manufacturing

Ford builds on its strong legacy of investing in U.S. vehicle assembly, planning to invest nearly $2 billion in Louisville Assembly Plant to assemble the midsize electric truck, securing 2,200 hourly jobs.

The project is supported by an incentive offer from the Kentucky Economic Development Finance Authority.

“Today, Ford and Team Kentucky are introducing the world to the future of automotive production with nearly $2 billion being invested to transform the Louisville Assembly Plant, which will also secure 2,200 jobs for Kentuckians,” said Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear. “This announcement not only represents one of the largest investments on record in our state, it also boosts Kentucky’s position at the center of EV-related innovation and solidifies Louisville Assembly Plant as an important part of Ford’s future. Thanks to Ford’s leaders for their continued faith in Kentucky and our incredible workforce. Ford and Kentucky have been a tremendous team for more than 100 years, and that partnership has never been stronger than it is today.”

Louisville Assembly Plant will expand by 52,000 square feet in order to move material more efficiently. Digital infrastructure upgrades will give Louisville Assembly Plant the fastest network with the most access points out of any Ford plant globally, enabling more quality scans.

Ford’s investment in Louisville Assembly Plant is in addition to its previously announced $3 billion investment in BlueOval Battery Park Michigan, which will build the prismatic LFP batteries for the midsize electric truck starting next year. Together, the investments total approximately $5 billion, and between the two plants, Ford expects to create or secure nearly 4,000 direct jobs while strengthening the domestic supply chain with dozens of new U.S.-based suppliers.",https://www.fromtheroad.ford.com/dam/fordmediasite/us/en/library/2025/ford-universal-ev-production-system-and-platform/Ford_Universal_Vehicle_Logo_16x9.png,N,,2025-08-11 12:09:44.739061

Ford is introducing its new “Universal EV Platform” alongside the “Ford Universal EV Production System” that’ll underpin several affordable electric vehicles, starting with a mid-size truck set to launch in 2027.

Ford hasn’t named the new four-door pickup, although the automaker did recently apply to trademark the Ranchero nameplate. The truck, which Ford aims to make as quick as an EcoBoost Mustang (high 4.0-second range) and offer more passenger space than a RAV4, before including the front truck or bed, will have a starting price of around $30,000.

The truck will use “advanced” prismatic lithium iron phosphate batteries, which will serve as the vehicle’s structural sub-assembly and floor. The battery technology is free of cobalt and nickel, saving space, weight, and cost. It also lowers the vehicle’s center of gravity, improves handling, and contributes to a roomy cabin.

This all comes as growth of EV sales has slowed in the United States. The Trump administration also has taken actions to dismantle greenhouse gas emission regulations and consumer EV incentives that he has characterized as an ""EV mandate.""

Ford already has canceled an EV program for a larger, three-row SUV, and has delayed to 2028 production of its next-generation electric commercial van and pickup truck. The midsize, four-door pickup truck similar in exterior size to the Ford Maverick will launch in 2027 for the United States and export markets and is expected to start around $30,000 ― addressing a ""horribly underserved"" market under $40,000, said Jim Baumbuck, vice president of advanced product development, cycle planning and programs.

With the start of the transition of Louisville Assembly at the end of the year, Ford Escape and Lincoln Corsair production will end, though vehicles are expected to be available into 2026. The investment secures 2,200 hourly jobs. Louisville Assembly as of April 2024 employed more than 3,000 hourly workers, according to Ford's website.

The Ford Universal EV Platform is a simplified product of the California-based EV hardware and software ""skunkworks"" team that executives have emphasized for months will be revolutionary. More than 500 engineers are working out of Ford's new Long Beach development center. The company emphasized the work of 122 years of experience and the mentality of a Silicon Valley startup.

“We took a radical approach to a very hard challenge: Create affordable vehicles that delight customers in every way that matters — design, innovation, flexibility, space, driving pleasure, and cost of ownership — and do it with American workers,” Farley said.

Meanwhile, the Ford Universal EV Production System incorporates an assembly tree with three sub-assemblies that eventually combine instead of the one long conveyor that has been the hallmark of mass vehicle assembly since Henry Ford introduced it at the Highland Park plant in 1913 for Model T, a vehicle that could be owned by the masses.

Large, single-piece aluminum unicastings replace dozens of smaller parts, so that the front and rear of the vehicle can be assembled separately. They then combine with the structural battery, which is assembled independently with seats, consoles and carpeting.

The midsize truck will use batteries from the $3 billion BlueOval Battery Park Michigan in Marshall that is expected to begin production next year. The plant will produce lithium-iron-phosphate batteries, which don't use cobalt or nickel, making them less expensive than traditional EV batteries. They also are less likely to catch fire, though less energy dense.

In a move that's drawn scrutiny, Ford is licensing technology from Chinese battery maker Contemporary Amperex Technology Co. Ltd. to produce the batteries in the United States rather than importing them from China. Crosstown rival General Motors Co. plans to import LFP batteries from CATL in China for the Chevrolet Bolt until LFP production with its South Korean partner, LG Energy Solution, begins in Tennessee in 2027.

The EV platform reduces parts by 20% compared to a ""typical vehicle,"" with 25% fewer fasteners, 40% fewer workstations dock-to-dock in the plant and 15% faster assembly time, Ford said. The wiring harness is 4,000 feet shorter than the Mustang Mach-E's and much lighter.

The company characterized the platform as having a lower cost of ownership over five years than a 3-year-old used Tesla Model Y. Farley has said the platform will have a ""handful"" of top hats to support multiple models. A video in a media press kit shows seven top hats, though Ford says it's too early to say exactly how many models the platform will support.

Ford described the midsize truck as having more passenger room than the latest Toyota RAV4, even before including the frunk and the truck bed. The RAV4 has a total passenger volume of 98.9 cubic feet. Ford expects a 0-60 mph time on the truck to be as fast as the Mustang EcoBoost with more downforce.

Further details on the midsize truck, including its reveal date, exact starting price, battery range and charge times will be shared later, Ford said.

The Louisville investment will secure 2,200 hourly jobs. The Kentucky Economic Development Finance Authority is supporting the project. Ford will expand the plant by 52,000 square feet and upgrade the digital infrastructure for more quality scans.

“This announcement not only represents one of the largest investments on record in our state,"" Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear said in a statement, ""it also boosts Kentucky’s position at the center of EV-related innovation and solidifies Louisville Assembly Plant as an important part of Ford’s future.""

In the new assembly tree, parts travel to line workers in a kit. All fasteners, scanners and power tools are there to use, reducing twisting, reaching and bending for workers. Assembly could be 40% faster compared to the vehicle currently built in Louisville. Some of that time, however, will be reinvested into insourcing and automation, ultimately netting a 15% speed improvement, Ford said.

Quality has been a large focus at Ford over the past few years. The company last month disclosed a single recall is costing it $570 million, contributing to a second-quarter earnings loss. The Blue Oval in 2025 already has set a record for recalls in a single year from any automaker, though details show improvement for its newest model years.

Kentucky is significant for Ford. In addition to Louisville Assembly, Kentucky Truck Plant is home to the Super Duty pickup as well as the Ford Expedition and Lincoln Navigator, making it the company's most profitable plant. In 2021, Ford also announced a $5.8 billion investment with Korean battery partner SK On Ltd. for two EV battery plants. The first is set to begin production this year, while the other has been delayed.

The next EV to market will be a midsize pickup to be assembled at Ford's Louisville Assembly Plant in Kentucky.

The BlueOval Battery Park in Michigan will make the batteries for the midsized EV pickup.

Ford Motor Co. is announcing the creation of a new electric vehicle production system and a new EV platform that will allow the automaker to more efficiently bring several lower-cost EVs to market, the first of which will be a midsize, four-door electric pickup that seats five, to launch in 2027.

That pickup, which is expected to start around $30,000, will be assembled at Ford’s Louisville Assembly Plant for U.S. and export markets. The Dearborn-based automaker said it will invest $2 billion to retool the Louisville plant starting later this year.

The plant, which currently builds the Ford Escape and Lincoln Corsair SUVs, employs 2,800 hourly and 200 salaried workers. This midsized electric truck ensures the jobs of 2,200 hourly workers, so about 600 fewer jobs than exist today, said Ford spokesman Mark Truby. He said some of those 600 will take a buyout offer if they are ready to retire, others can transfer to nearby plants such as Kentucky Truck Plant, but there are no plans for layoffs.

Truby indicated that there may be more EVs built at Louisville in the future to grow jobs there.

Ford's investment in Louisville Assembly is in addition to Ford's previously announced $3 billion commitment for BlueOval Battery Park in Marshall, Michigan, where Ford will make the prismatic LFP batteries, starting next year, for the midsize electric pickup.

Together, the nearly $5 billion investments mean Ford expects to create or secure nearly 4,000 direct jobs while strengthening the domestic supply chain with dozens of new U.S.-based suppliers.

Ford executives and Kentucky officials also introduced on Aug. 11 the new Ford Universal EV Production System, which they said will simplify production and ease operations for workers.

Ford leaders also announced the creation of the Ford Universal Electric Vehicle Platform, which will enable the development of ""a family of affordable electric vehicles produced at scale."" The vehicles will be software-defined with over-the-air updates to keep improving the vehicles over time.

“We took a radical approach to solve a very hard challenge: Create affordable vehicles that are breakthrough in every way that matters ― design, technology, performance, space and cost of ownership ― and do it with American workers,” Ford CEO Jim Farley said in a statement. “Nobody wants to see another good college try by a Detroit automaker to make an affordable vehicle that ends up with idled plants, layoffs and uncertainty.""

Farley has teased this announcement since Ford's second-quarter earnings when he said Ford would have a ""Model-T moment"" on Aug. 11. He's referring to the classic vehicle that helped turn Ford into a mass market automaker and perfect the assembly line process. At that time, Farley said it was critical that Ford unveil an EV strategy that would position it to make money selling the electric cars and effectively compete against the Chinese, who are known for making high-quality, desirable and affordable EVs.

""So, this has to be a good business,"" Farley said of Ford's investments in the new process and platform. ""From Day 1, we knew there was no incremental path to success. We empowered a tiny skunkworks team three time zones away from Detroit. We reinvented the line. And we are on a path to be the first automaker to make prismatic LFP batteries in the U.S. We will not rely on imports.”

Ford's Skunkworks division is made up of a team of whiz kids in California who are tasked with developing a new EV.

LFP, or lithium iron phosphate, batteries are increasingly being used in EVs, particularly in China because they are known to be safe, have a long lifespan and are cheaper to make.

Ford Universal EV platform

Farley said the new Universal EV Platform will be efficient. For example, it reduces parts by 20% compared with platforms that support a ""typical vehicle"" with 25% fewer fasteners, 40% fewer workstations in the plant and a 15% faster assembly time.

Farley said the result will be a midsize pickup EV, sized close to the current Ford Maverick, with a lower cost of ownership over five years than a 3-year-old used Tesla Model Y.

""Take for instance the wiring harness in the new midsize truck; it will be more than 4,000 feet (1.3 kilometers) shorter and 10 kilograms lighter than the one used in our first-gen electric SUV,"" Farley said in a statement. ""Lithium iron phosphate (LFP) prismatic batteries also enable space and weight savings, while delivering cost reduction and durability for customers. The platform’s cobalt-free and nickel-free LFP battery pack is a structural sub-assembly that also serves as the vehicle’s floor.""

The announcements come after Ford informed suppliers and employees in June that a full-size electric pickup, which is to be the successor to the F-150 Lightning, will be delayed to 2028. Ford plans to make that vehicle at its BlueOval City Assembly Plant in Tennessee. Additionally, Ford is delaying production of its E-transit van, to be built at its Ohio Assembly Plant in Avon Lake, Ohio, from 2026 to 2028.

Ford spokesman Dan Barbossa said Ford will continue to make the F-150 Lightning full-size electric pickup, which is made in Ford's Rouge Assembly complex in Dearborn. Ford assembles the Mach-E in Mexico and has no plans to move production to the United States to lessen the impact of President Donald Trump's 25% tariffs on imported vehicles, Kumar Galhotra, COO, told reporters on a media call on Aug. 11.

As for the new midsize EV pickup, Ford did not provide any specifications, including reveal date, starting price other than it will be about $30,000, EPA-estimated battery range, battery sizes and charge time.

But it said the assembly of the midsize EV pickup is expected to be faster than the Louisville Assembly's current vehicles because of Ford's integration between the Universal EV Production System and the Universal Platform.

Performance and inspiration from Model T

The midsize EV pickup will have a low center of gravity that improves handling, offers a quiet cabin and ample interior space, according to the company. Farley said the truck is forecast to have more passenger room than the Toyota RAV4, before including the frunk and the truck bed.

The midsize truck will have a targeted zero-to-60 time as fast as a Mustang EcoBoost, which is 4.5 seconds, with more downforce.

“We took inspiration from the Model T ― the universal car that changed the world,” said Doug Field, Ford chief EV, digital and design officer. ""We applied first‑principles engineering, pushing to the limits of physics to make it fun to drive and compete on affordability. Our new zonal electric architecture unlocks capabilities the industry has never seen. This isn’t a stripped‑down, old‑school vehicle.”

Ford Universal EV Production System

Ford is also transforming the traditional assembly line into an “assembly tree."" That means instead of one long conveyor, there will be three sub-assemblies that run down their own lines simultaneously and then join together.

Ford said a large single-piece aluminum unicasting replaces dozens of smaller parts, enabling the front and rear of the vehicle to be assembled separately. The front and rear are then combined with the third subassembly, the structural battery, which is independently assembled with seats, consoles and carpeting, to form the vehicle.

Farley said the parts will travel down the assembly tree to operators in a kit, which will included fasteners, scanners and power tools to do the job all in the correct orientation for use to avoid mistakes.

Ford said this Universal EV Production System will also dramatically improve ergonomics for employees by reducing twisting, reaching and bending.“We put our employees at the center and re-created the factory from scratch,” Bryce Currie, Ford vice president of Americas Manufacturing, said in a statement. “We expect ergonomic breakthroughs and complexity reduction ― through elimination of parts, connectors and wire ― will flow through to significant quality and cost wins.”

Farley said the $2 billion investment in Louisville Assembly Plant for upgrades to assemble the midsize electric truck will secure 2,200 hourly jobs. Farley said the project is supported by an incentive offer from the Kentucky Economic Development Finance Authority.","https://www.freep.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/08/11/PDTF/85608935007-img-2306.jpg?crop=5707,3212,x0,y0&width=3200&height=1802&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-08-11 12:09:51.658939

sold more than 46,000 electric vehicles, second only to Tesla and more than twice as many as Ford.","Just four years ago, Ford Motor seemed poised to give Tesla a real run for its money in electric vehicles.

In 2021, the company introduced a stylish electric sport-utility vehicle, the Mustang Mach-E, and quickly followed it a year later with a battery-powered version of its best-selling pickup, the F-150, and an electric van. The three new models gave Ford a jump on other established automakers like General Motors.

But then the growth of electric car sales slowed and Tesla started slashing car prices. At the same time, higher material costs made it harder for established carmakers to make money on electric vehicles.

Over the last two and a half years, Ford’s electric vehicle division has lost $12 billion, including $2.2 billion in the first half of this year. This year, sales of its electric models have stalled, falling 12 percent in the first six months.

Now Ford has come up with a new plan. On Monday, the automaker said that it has developed new, lower-cost electric vehicle components that will allow it to sell more affordable cars. The first will be a medium, four-door pickup truck that can seat five, have a front trunk in addition to its bed and have a starting price of $30,000, Ford said. That truck is expected to arrive in showrooms in 2027, while a new large electric pickup will be delayed by a year to 2028.

The company also said it has developed a new manufacturing process that should also lower costs while improving quality.

“We tore up the moving assembly line that you see here today and we came up with a brand-new concept,” Ford’s chief executive, Jim Farley, said Monday at a company factory in Louisville, Ky. “This is the most radical redesign of how we manufacture cars since the Model T.”

Ford, G.M. and other automakers are facing a serious competitive threat from Chinese companies like BYD that now sell far more electric vehicles than Western manufacturers, often producing them at a fraction of European and American costs.

Turning around Ford’s electric vehicle business and catching up to Chinese producers is a key task for Mr. Farley. He was named to the post in 2020, and promised a new era of growth and profitability for a company that struggled under two previous chief executives.

Mr. Farley has made some progress. The company’s European operation is performing better financially than before he took over, as are its joint-ventures in China. Its stopped selling money-losing cars in India.

But Ford is still grappling with significant issues. In addition to its money-losing electric vehicle business, the company has spent billions of dollars in recent years to recall and repair gasoline-powered cars.

As a result, profits from Ford’s main business of selling internal-combustion trucks and S.U.V.s have slumped in recent quarters. In the first half of this year, Ford’s division that makes gasoline cars and trucks for individual buyers made $757 million, down from $2.1 billion in the same period in 2024.

Mr. Farley previously scaled back some of Ford’s electric vehicle efforts, lowering investments and putting on hold one of four new battery plants the company had planned. And he cautioned that there were “no guarantees” with the new manufacturing approach the company is now taking.

“We are doing so many new things I can’t tell you with 100 percent certainty that it will all go just right,” he said.

Ford’s troubles stand in contrast to what has been happening at G.M., which took a slower path on electric vehicles by taking time to develop standardized batteries that helped lower costs. G.M. also formed joint ventures that relatively quickly built two factories to churn out batteries. For the last few years, G.M. has reported near-record profits, although in the second quarter its profit fell by about a third to $1.9 billion in part because of high costs related to tariffs imposed by President Trump.

In the second quarter, G.M. sold more than 46,000 electric vehicles, second only to Tesla and more than twice as many as Ford. G.M. also has more than 10 electric models on sale, ranging from the $35,000 Chevrolet Equinox EV to the $130,000 Cadillac Escalade IQ.

Ford executives are counting on a new $3 billion battery plant it has built in Marshall, Mich., about 100 miles west of Detroit, to help revive its electric vehicle business. The plant will make batteries cells using lithium, iron and phosphate, a combination referred to as LFP. Such batteries costs less than those most commonly found in U.S. electric vehicles because they do not use nickel and cobalt, which are relatively expensive.

Ford licensed the LFP technology from a Chinese company, CATL, the world’s largest battery maker. Ford and SK On, a South Korean company, are also building two battery factories, one in Kentucky and the other in Tennessee.

The electric vehicle assembly process that Ford has developed is modification of the moving assembly line that was first pioneered a century ago by its founder, Henry Ford. Instead of using one long assembly line, the new process has three: one to build the front end of the electric pickup, one for the back and one for the battery pack and cab.

Ford said the three branches come together into a single line where the three pieces are joined. The company estimated that will reduce the time it takes to assemble a pickup by 15 percent.

The new line will be set up at Ford’s Louisville factory where the company plans to invest $1.9 billion. The factory will stop making the Ford Escape and Lincoln Corsair small S.U.V.s next year.

Ford said that once production in Louisville ends, it will no longer offer the Escape. That model was introduced in 2000 and has been one of the company’s best-selling S.U.V.s.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/08/11/multimedia/11BIZ-FORD-EV-03-jzbm/11BIZ-FORD-EV-03-jzbm-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-08-11 12:09:57.086451

Now Is A Great Time to Take Advantage of Cost-Saving Clean Energy Tax Credits and Incentives

Tens of Thousands of Dollars in Federal Rebates and Tax Credits Available to Help Residents Realize Savings From Purchasing EVs, Heat Pumps, Rooftop Solar, and More

(HARTFORD)—Thinking about buying an electric vehicle? Want to save money on cooling and heating costs by installing solar panels or a heat pump? The Connecticut Department of Energy and Environmental Protection (DEEP) is reminding residents that there are tens of thousands of dollars in federal and state incentives available to help you save on the purchase cost of these items, and to help you start realizing the savings that can be had from driving an EV or installing an efficient heat pump in your home or business.

Affordability is top of mind for most people these days. Many Connecticut residents are already enjoying the lower maintenance costs and savings on gas that come with owning an all-electric vehicle (EV) or a plug-in hybrid electric vehicle (PHEV), as well as the greater efficiency and lower energy bills that come from using a heat pump to cool and heat your home or through installing other types of efficiency and weatherization measures. If you want to realize these benefits for yourself, now is a good time to do so, as federal clean energy tax credits will be expiring before the end of the year following the recent passage of the Congressional budget reconciliation bill.

Under the budget reconciliation bill, tax credits for electric vehicles, residential solar, and home energy efficiency will expire in September and December of this year, so it’s important to act now to see what you might be eligible for. Some of the tax credits can be combined with state incentives, offering consumers even bigger savings.

EVs

Until September 30, consumers can save up to $7,500 on new EV and PHEV purchases with a federal tax credit, plus $500 with a standard rebate, and an additional $1,500(PHEV)/$3,000(EV) for income qualifying individuals through Connecticut’s CHEAPR program. Used 2023 or older model year EVs and PHEVs are eligible for up to $4,000 with a federal tax credit and an additional $5,000(EV)/$3,000(PHEV) through CHEAPR for income-eligible individuals.

Energy Efficiency

Through the end of this year, consumers can save thousands of dollars on a long list of home energy and efficiency upgrades, in addition to existing state and local home energy and efficiency incentives. Homeowners and renters can identify federal energy savings opportunities and their end dates using Rewiring America’s calculator. More information about state energy efficiency savings opportunities is available at EnergizeCT.

State Incentives

Despite this federal uncertainty, popular state incentives will continue to be available to Connecticut residents and businesses interested in these technologies. DEEP will be working with key stakeholder groups like the CHEAPR board and the Energy Efficiency Board to continue to provide robust support for these measures after the federal tax credits expire. For example, DEEP has temporarily reduced the popular CHEAPR standard rebate from $1500 to $500 for the next two months to ensure thatpreserve the state CHEAPR funding to support CT residents interested in EV purchases after the federal tax credits expire. As we approach the end of September, DEEP and the CHEAPR board will look at potentially increasing the standard rebate above $1500 after the federal tax credits expire. While we continue to assess these options, it is clear that the best time to buy is now, when CT residents and businesses can take advantage of the full federal and state incentives available.

“If you’ve been thinking about buying an EV, or getting a heat pump or rooftop solar installed to help reduce your gas and utility bills, now is a great time to take advantage of the significant savings offered by federal clean energy tax credits before they expire,” DEEP Commissioner Katie Dykes said. “Connecticut consumers have shown that they’re interested in these clean technologies with demand for heat pumps doubling in Connecticut since 2019 and recent demand for electric vehicle rebates up 30%. Since these tax credit changes were announced, we’re seeing more people buying EVs, heat pumps, and weatherizing their homes and businesses.”

Next Steps

Use the chart below to find a list of available federal tax credits, when they expire, and more information about eligible projects, equipment, and any limits on who can use the tax credit, including income limits. Residents can also find a link to state-sponsored programs that in most cases can provide additional savings on top of the federal tax credit.

Here are few fast facts to help get you started on your journey to savings:

New and Used Electric vehicle (EV) and Plug-in Hybrid Electric vehicles (PHEV) tax credits expire first on September 30, 2025 and most of the energy-related credits expire at the end of the year (December 31, 2025).

Residents are encouraged to check their eligibility for each tax credit because they may have income limits for single and joint filers.

Residents should keep in mind these tax credits help to reduce taxes that are owed, including any estimated taxes that have already been paid from paycheck withholding for example. But in most cases, they cannot reimburse the taxpayer beyond the amount of taxes owed. For example, an individual who purchases a new EV and a heat pump could reduce their 2025 taxes by up to $9,500.

To get started, you can find a contractor for many home energy upgrades here, or if you’re interested in an electric vehicle talk to a dealer about eligible vehicles.

Circuit came after U.S. District Judge Emmet Sullivan ruled last month that the administration must restore the database.","A federal appeals court on Saturday ordered the Trump administration to restore a public database showing how federal funding is apportioned.

The administration disabled the database in March as it stared down several lawsuits challenging funding freezes, claiming Congress’s mandate to make the data public infringed on President Trump’s core executive authority.

“To hear the Government tell it, the separation of powers hangs in the balance and only this Court can set things right. But when it comes to appropriations, our Constitution has made plain that congressional power is at its zenith,” U.S. Circuit Judge Karen Henderson wrote.

The order to restore the database takes effect Friday, though the administration could still attempt to seek emergency relief from the Supreme Court.

The Hill has reached out to the Justice Department for comment.

The three-judge panel on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit was unanimous in its ruling.

An appointee of former President George H. W. Bush, Henderson was the panel’s sole judge appointed by a Republican president. She was joined by Robert Wilkins, an appointee of former President Obama, and Brad Garcia, an appointee of former President Biden.

Henderson decried the administration in her 25-page statement, which Wilkins joined. It began with a reference to an English Civil War in the 17th century between the Stuart monarchs and Parliament.

“By the end of the upheaval, Parliament emerged supreme in matters of taxation and spending. Our Constitution followed suit, granting the Congress plenary control over the public fisc,” Henderson wrote.

“Recently, the Executive has once again locked horns in a struggle for control over the purse strings.”

Two private groups that regularly sue the Trump administration, Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington and Protect Democracy, challenged the takedown in April. They cited two recent congressional spending deals that require the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to make apportionment decisions publicly available within two business days.

“They will be deprived of information that the Founding generation—from Franklin to Jefferson to Madison to Mason—all thought vital to our Republic,” Henderson wrote in her ruling.

Trump has faced bipartisan pressure to restore the tracker, but the administration contends it contains sensitive information that could pose a national security threat. The Justice Department also argued the two groups have no right to sue, and the requirement to post the data is unconstitutional.

The integration of AI into grid systems promises enhanced efficiency and reliability, but it also brings a host of new challenges.

To address these challenges, the Idaho National Laboratory (INL) has launched the Testing for AI Grid Resilience (TAIGR) initiative, a first-of-its-kind effort aimed at identifying and mitigating the risks of AI-enhanced grid management systems.

AI and Advanced Automation in Grid Systems

For years, utilities have relied on statistical methods and algorithms to manage maintenance planning, load forecasting and grid monitoring. Now, AI is taking these efforts to a new level. By analyzing extensive historical data, including specific control records, AI can predict outages and suggest real-time actions for operators to take.

However, these advancements are accompanied by significant risks, including believable AI hallucinations, plausible yet incorrect recommendations, and adversarial cyberattacks that manipulate data or model architectures. These risks could potentially result in incorrect decisions that destabilize the grid.

“AI can rapidly analyze mountains of history from operator logs and trend forecasting to suggest the optimal use of generation sources such as natural gas, nuclear, wind or a combination of all,” said Andy Bochman, INL’s senior grid strategist. “But AI can also hallucinate, recommending actions that human experts would know not to take.”

TAIGR’s Mission

To address these emerging issues, TAIGR brings together industry stakeholders, operators, owners, suppliers, regulators and researchers to bridge the gaps between these communities and create a collaborative environment for addressing AI-related challenges specific to grid operations.

Earlier this year, INL hosted an inaugural workshop to engage stakeholders across the energy sector, marking TAIGR’s first significant step forward. Representatives from utilities, vendors, federal regulators and academic institutions participated in two days of in-depth discussions on AI’s role in grid management. The workshop highlighted both an urgent need for action and a knowledge gap in the industry.

While vendors and equipment manufacturers are eager to bring AI-powered tools to market, many acknowledged the lack of a systematic method to evaluate the associated risks. Alex Jenkins, a senior AI solutions engineer at grid systems supplier Aveva, suggested that future researcher-industry collaborations include supplier input to broaden the exchange of ideas and perspectives on AI safety.

Informed by feedback from the workshop, INL researchers and industry partners launched the AMARANTH (Artificial Intelligence Management and Research for Advanced Networked Testbed Hub) project. Funded by the Department of Energy (DOE) Grid Deployment Office, AMARANTH focuses on addressing critical industry concerns about AI safety and resilience.

Patience Yockey, a research data scientist at INL, emphasized the importance of thoroughly testing AI systems to ensure their reliability and predictability. “We need to understand any possible weaknesses, not just in the data but in the AI’s design and implementation as well,” Yocky said. “We want to ensure that AI systems can be trusted to help produce consistent power under any conditions.”

Building a Model and a Community

TAIGR is modeled after DOE’s successful CyTRICS (Cyber Testing for Resilient Industrial Control Systems) program. CyTRICS enhances the cybersecurity of critical infrastructure by rigorously testing and evaluating industrial control systems and supply chains for vulnerabilities. Similarly, TAIGR will operate as a voluntary and collaborative program with a transparent methodology vetted by experts from across the utility industry, national laboratories and federal government.

Discussions with key industry trade groups like the Edison Electric Institute, the North American Electric Reliability Corporation and the Electric Power Research Institute are helping shape the parameters, Bochman said. There’s a strong interest in collaborative efforts to address AI-related challenges.

“They all want to engage and contribute,” he said.

Scott Aaronson, senior vice president of Energy Security & Industry Operations at Edison Electric Institute, emphasized the importance of INL’s role.

“Edison Electric Institute and our member electric companies are committed to exploring the full capabilities of advanced AI systems and to engaging with the full range of stakeholders who are developing, enhancing, and ensuring safe and secure integration of those systems,” Aaronson said. “INL’s work with TAIGR is an essential part of the process, helping us all better understand how to leverage the benefits of these systems while mitigating the risks.”

The Testing Advantage

TAIGR projects also benefit from INL’s one-of-a-kind infrastructure, including a full-scale power grid testbed designed to safely stress-test energy systems. “This is why national labs exist,” Bochman added. “To solve hard problems that require expertise and infrastructure you won’t find anywhere else.”

INL has a long history of leadership in evaluating and testing critical energy systems at scale. The laboratory’s dedicated test grid can handle up to 138 kilovolts and supports advanced power load testing, smart grid assessments and energy storage experiments. This state-of-the-art infrastructure will now support the testing and demonstration of AI-enhanced grid technologies in a controlled environment.

Looking ahead, TAIGR’s working groups will develop testing approaches and procedures that attract the participation of asset owners and vendors. This collaborative effort aims to accelerate the safe and reliable adoption of AI solutions in the energy sector.

The Path Forward

TAIGR is a meet-the-moment initiative designed to help the energy sector balance the benefits of AI with its inherent risks. Ensuring the nation’s power systems remain robust and secure even as AI technologies become more integrated into grid operations is paramount. TAIGER isn’t about resisting AI, but preparing for it responsibly.

Given the grid’s critical role in the economy, national security and public safety, it’s essential to understand how AI-enhanced technology could impact it, both positively and negatively.

“AI is too efficient to overlook, too helpful to ignore,” Bochman said. “Yet when AI is fed bad data or its results go unchecked, it may become unreliable, and that’s not acceptable, especially when dealing with critical infrastructure.”",https://inl.gov/content/uploads/2025/08/25-50015-31_TAIGR-banner_R0-1-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-08-11 11:06:41.927251

The Solar For All program is a $7 billion clean energy initiative authorized by Congress as part of the Inflation Reduction Act in 2022. It’s meant to fund single-family and multifamily rooftop and community solar garden installations as well as solar job training. In Colorado, the funding was projected to help 20,000 moderate-to-low-income families access cleaner, cheaper, solar electricity.

The Trump administration signaled its intention to terminate the program last week.

“The Trump Administration is seeking to rip cost-saving solutions out of the hands of hardworking Coloradans and push us backwards into an over reliance on non-renewable resources,” Governor Jared Polis said in a press release. “In Colorado, we will continue exploring avenues to fight this illegal termination of congressionally appropriated and duly obligated funds.”

This is not the first time the Trump administration has tried to interfere with Biden-era clean energy investments. Earlier this year, funding for the program and several other clean energy initiatives were temporarily frozen, and key federal renewable energy tax credits were eliminated with the passage of the Big Beautiful Bill. The new tariff regime is also expected to impact the industry.

“What we see is a targeted effort by the administration to slow down and try to stymie the installation of the lowest cost sources of electricity that are and cleanest sources of electricity that are available,” said Will Toor, executive director of the Colorado Energy Office.

KC Becker, CEO of the Colorado Solar and Storage Association, calls the move an attack on clean energy.

“It’s just one more step in a long line of attacks on renewable energy,” said KC Becker, CEO of the Colorado Solar and Storage Association. “Which has the impact of destroying jobs, leading to higher bills and ceding energy dominance to China. It's just such a bad policy all around. Renewable energy is cheap. It's a waste of taxpayer dollars to stop it. Communities were really going to benefit from lower cost, affordable, clean energy.”

The Colorado Energy Office spent the last year building a new team to administer the grants and making initial plans for how to spend it.

“We hired seven new staff. We just finalized our workforce development plan,” said Ida Mae Isaac, the Colorado Solar For All director. “We have three large grant solicitations that we are ready to go out the door.”

Those solicitations will have to wait, for now. Which means tens of thousands of Colorado families will have to wait on power from the sun.

“We've seen the appetite for it,” said Yesenia Rivera, vice President of solar access and affordability at the national nonprofit Solar United Neighbors. “People that thought they would never be able to access solar because of cost suddenly have access to solar because of programs like this.”

Rivera said losing the program would be a major blow to solar expansion in Colorado and nationwide.

“(Solar For All) was meant to change the market,” she said. “It was meant to throw this infusion and change the way we access solar, installing solar at such a pace that it would reduce the cost of going solar for a lot of families, so that at the end of the day, they wouldn't even need the incentives or the assistance to go solar.”

Most likely, the courts will decide the ultimate fate of Solar For All. According to Toor, the termination is illegal. The state already has a legally binding, signed contract for the Solar For All funding dating back to July 2024.",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/0a43aa6/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4192x2201+0+179/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F2a%2F66%2F9f27fbf64068a6d7ce4627c9146e%2Fimg-0626-edit.jpg,N,,2025-08-11 11:05:09.825090

They align climate goals with industrial policy, investors, utilities and developers all know that using Chinese cells means forfeiting the credit.
Safe harbor rules should be updated to reflect OBBBA’s higher domestic content thresholds, and projects relying on the old 5 percent rule should face stricter documentation and auditing.","America’s clean energy boom still runs on imported batteries. In 2024 roughly 90 percent of the lithium iron phosphate cells used in U.S. grid storage came from China.

This year President Trump took two steps to change that: he championed the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA) and slapped sweeping “Liberation Day” tariffs on imports.

Together these moves create an opportunity to build a domestic battery industry, if policymakers close loopholes that could blunt their impact.

The tariffs are already changing the economics of storage. China’s lithium ion cells, which dominate the U.S. market, now face an import tax of roughly 65 percent, rising to more than 80 percent by 2026. When imports become that costly, manufacturers have a stark choice: invest at home or lose business.

OBBBA amplifies that message by tying tax credits directly to domestic content. The law bars firms tied to “prohibited foreign entities,” essentially Chinese battery companies and their affiliates, from receiving investment or production tax credits. For energy storage, it increases the minimum share of U.S. or allied nation content from 40 percent to 55 percent by 2028. The base 30 percent investment tax credit now applies only if a project’s cells come from a non prohibited manufacturer, and a 10 point bonus rewards projects that meet the rising domestic content thresholds. In effect, the credit is binary: use U.S. made or allied nation cells and get 40 percent off your project costs, use Chinese cells and get zero.

That simple rule is spurring investment. Our Next Energy (ONE) is building a high capacity LFP cell factory in Michigan and licensing technology to Pomega in Türkiye, a NATO ally whose cells aren’t subject to foreign entity restrictions. As a result, customers are shifting orders toward U.S. and allied suppliers. With most projects still dependent on China, ONE is the only U.S.-owned firm ready to supply utility scale storage, and our Turkish partnership gives buyers a credible non China option.

The danger lies in a quirk of tax law known as the 5 percent safe harbor. To qualify for a credit under long standing rules, developers can either start substantial physical work or incur just 5 percent of a project’s total cost. OBBBA did not change those rules, President Trump’s July 7 executive order merely directs the Treasury to tighten them. Without new guidance, a developer could spend a token 5 percent today, lock in pre OBBBA rules and continue using Chinese cells for years while claiming the old credits. Several advisers even encourage spending slightly more as a cushion. That loophole could allow Chinese components to dominate U.S. projects until the late 2020s, exactly when the new domestic content requirements are supposed to bite.

Safe harbor abuse isn’t theoretical. Tax experts warn that developers often claim the 5 percent rule without making meaningful progress. Consultants expect Treasury to insist that a substantial portion of a facility actually be built before credits are locked in. Yet until formal guidance arrives, some developers are rushing to “start” projects on paper, threatening to lock in Chinese supply chains just as domestic factories come online.

As a systems change researcher, I view OBBBA and the tariffs as tools to rewire an entire supply chain. They align climate goals with industrial policy, investors, utilities and developers all know that using Chinese cells means forfeiting the credit. But systems change fails when loopholes persist. Congress and the Treasury must act quickly.

Guidance should require genuine physical progress or firm commitments to domestic or allied sourced cells before a project can lock in its credit. Safe harbor rules should be updated to reflect OBBBA’s higher domestic content thresholds, and projects relying on the old 5 percent rule should face stricter documentation and auditing.

With these tweaks, high tariffs and the binary credit can attract investment, accelerate manufacturing and protect supply chains. Our Next Energy and our partners stand ready to build the cells America needs. But if policymakers allow a technicality to keep Chinese batteries flowing, we will squander a rare chance to secure jobs, cut emissions and gain energy independence. The window is open, we must close the loopholes before it shuts.

If approved, it would enable Tesla to compete with a host of big energy firms that currently supply the vital utility to properties across England, Wales and Scotland.

The application to UK energy regulator Ofgem was lodged at the end of last month by Tesla Energy Ventures Limited, which is based in Manchester. The official document was signed off by Andrew Payne, who is cited as the company’s director. His LinkedIn page shows him as listed as head of energy for the EMEA region of Tesla.

As well as being the world’s most recognized maker of electric cars, Tesla has a business supplying battery storage and solar energy.

Last year, the firm saw its revenue from the sale of solar cells, batteries and other energy products nearly double, rising $1.5 billion or 93% compared to a year earlier.

Musk, one of the world’s richest people, was last week awarded a $29 billion pay package from the firm. Tesla, of which he is the CEO, already supplies electricity to residential properties in Texas.

The application comes at a time when the firm’s main business – car sales – is on the decline. Tesla’s (TSLA) auto revenue fell 16% from April to June and overall revenue was down 12%, according to its earnings report. Sales of its best-selling Model Y and Model 3 fell 12% compared with a year ago, while sales of its more expensive models, including the Cybertruck, plunged 52%.

Sales of new Teslas fell by 60% in July in the UK compared to a year ago, according to the Society of Motor Manufactures and Traders (SMMT). Meanwhile, yearly sales dropped by 22% across Europe, according to June figures from the European Automobile Manufacturers’ Association.

The significant drop in sales, not only in the US but around the world, are widely perceived to have been a backlash to Musk’s political activities, as well as the growing competition from other electric vehicle makers, most notably from China.

Back in 2023 Tesla advertised on LinkedIn for a head of operations to run Tesla Electric in the UK. The listing said that Tesla was venturing into electricity to “accelerate the transition to sustainable energy.”

It said: “We believe strongly that simplifying and improving the customer experience around retail electricity and virtual power plants is necessary to drive significant adoption amongst consumers. Delivering a seamless, simple customer experience will ensure that small scale residential flexibility can be fully utilized to support the transition of the entire electricity grid to 100% renewables.”

CNN has approached Tesla for comment.

Two of the largest tax credits — for building clean energy projects or generating power with low emissions — are now set to expire by the end of 2027, rather than nearly a decade later.

Experts say this will slow the growth of renewable energy projects and reduce the amount of power generated in the state, resulting in higher electricity bills for consumers. One report projected an annual increase of $130 per Pennsylvania household by 2030.

Rolling back these tax credits is just one part of the Trump administration's move to crack down on the clean energy industry. Recently, Trump directed his U.S. Treasury secretary to issue guidance on the tax credit rollback process, and clean energy developers fear this will make it harder to claim the credits before they expire.

Currently, developers can claim credits for existing projects that begin construction before the end of 2026 or start operating before the end of 2027. And while those who spoke with Spotlight PA were hopeful about the industry’s long-term growth, developers said increased upfront construction costs in the short term will drive away business.

Aaron Nichols, a research and policy expert at Exact Solar, a Bucks County solar panel installation company, said the repeal of the tax credits is “less than ideal for clean energy companies.”

His company focuses on small-scale residential and commercial installations. Nichols said business has surged since the passage of the federal bill, driven by individuals rushing to claim a tax credit for residential installation before it expires at the end of the year.

“Homeowners who were kind of on the fence to invest in home solar are now doing it just as fast as they possibly can,” Nichols told Spotlight PA.

For long-term stability, his company is shifting its focus to tax credits with greater longevity. For instance, it is expanding its leasing program. The project lets companies pay the upfront construction costs of setting up solar panels on residential homes; homeowners get cheaper monthly electricity costs, and businesses can claim the production and investment tax credits.

Nichols predicted that the solar industry will continue to grow with or without tax credits, due to a significant rise in energy demand. Although the rollback of tax credits may temporarily slow business, Nichols thinks it won’t halt the industry’s growth.

“I think there's going to be a short period where a lack of incentives is going to matter,” Nichols said of the tax credits. “And then I think we're just going to keep going.”

Large-scale energy developers who build solar farms face a different set of challenges. They say the tax credit rollbacks won’t affect current projects but will make financing future work more difficult.

Edward Shelton, vice president of development at Vesper Energy, a Texas-based renewables developer that generates power for the grid, expects fundraising to become trickier. With tax credits available, developers need less initial funding to start a project.

“I can’t say that it won’t slow things down,” Shelton said. “Will it completely stifle the industry? It remains to be seen.”

Vesper is currently developing a solar farm in Bradford County that is expected to generate dozens of megawatts of power — roughly enough energy to power 120,000 homes for a year. The company also operates four other solar projects in the state. Shelton said the Bradford project is on track to break ground in time to qualify for the tax credit.

Developing projects takes five to six years, Shelton explained, during which the economic incentive landscape can shift. Tax credits could be reinstated, or equipment prices could fluctuate, making financing difficult to predict.

“If the tax credits were there, would we site even more projects? We probably would,” Shelton told Spotlight PA. “But it's not like we are just stopping development of any early-stage project that we have.”

Matt Litchfield, vice president of external and regulatory affairs at Maryland-based natural gas and renewable energy developer Competitive Power Ventures, echoed Shelton, saying that tax credits will influence financing rather than project planning.

“It changes the pool of who and where is investing in the project, but it doesn’t change the overall investment figures themselves,” Litchfield said.

He noted that similar tax credits have expired before only to return a few years later, and said he has “no reason to think that will be any different” in this case. Considering increased energy demand from data centers, Litchfield said, he doesn’t think that “anyone is going to be choosy when they’re going to power their data centers,” regardless of any changes from the rollback.

Consumer electricity prices are already increasing as demand outstrips supply.

Sunsetting the tax credits further handicaps the industry at a time when the state needs more energy, said Evan Vaughan, the executive director of the Mid-Atlantic Renewable Energy Coalition, an organization representing utility-scale developers. He added that the increased costs to developers will be “baked in” to electricity prices for consumers for “several years to come.”

“It’s not a ‘sky is falling’ moment for wind and solar, but it does introduce new challenges and new uncertainty,” Vaughn told Spotlight PA. “We need certainty around building more energy if we're going to win the AI race and if we're going to keep prices reasonable for consumers.”",https://www.spotlightpa.org/imgproxy/insecure/rt:fill/w:1200/h:900/g:sm/el:1/q:75/MjAyNC8wNy8wMWs5LXp6enotbnA2ei1oeDYzLmpwZWc=.jpeg,N,,2025-08-11 12:10:23.065858

Lost homes, rising insurance premiums, unhealthy outdoor working conditions, business interruptions and damaged infrastructure are all effects of a worsening climate.","This piece was originally published in the Scientific American.

Last week, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) announced a sweeping effort to do away with the endangerment finding, a proposal that not only disregards science but also has huge consequences for stemming the climate crisis.

This 2009 legal determination is based on extensive scientific evidence that says heat-trapping emissions from activities like the burning of fossil fuels are driving climate change and posing a threat to human health and welfare. This scientific finding, which followed a 2007 Supreme Court ruling that heat-trapping emissions are pollutants covered under the Clean Air Act, firmly established EPA’s authority and responsibility to regulate greenhouse gas emissions from vehicles, power plants, oil and gas operations, and other sources of these pollutants.

Undoing this finding is a blatant attempt to evade that responsibility and pander to fossil fuel interests. In addition to proposing to repeal the endangerment finding, EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin has also proposed repealing greenhouse gas standards for vehicles and power plants, the two largest sources of U.S. global warming emissions. The vehicles standards were projected to reduce planet-warming emissions by more than seven billion tons over the next three decades, and the power plant carbon pollution standards were projected to limit emissions by 1.38 billion metric tons of carbon dioxide through 2047.

As such, if the finding is successfully rescinded, EPA will have actively and intentionally walked away from its responsibility to address climate change. This abdication, coupled with actions the Trump administration and Congress are taking that hamper federal clean energy policies and investments and boost fossil fuels, are a huge blow to U.S. climate action, and will likely mean the nation’s emissions will continue to rise at a time when the science is clear that they must urgently be lowered.

Zeldin has based the rollback of the endangerment finding on a Department of Energy (DOE)–commissioned report that purports to be a “critical review of the impacts of greenhouse gas emissions on the U.S. climate,” per the title. But in addition to being crafted by five known climate contrarians, the report is riddled with climate denial tropes, cherry-picked evidence, and distortions of the indisputably well-established facts on climate change. For example, the report claims that rising carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere are good for agriculture without acknowledging the significant negative impacts of climate-driven heat, drought and floods on crops.

Multiple scientists whose papers were cited in the report slammed the misrepresentation of their findings, pointing out how the DOE report often stated the opposite of what the peer-reviewed studies actually concluded. Ben Santer, who is among those scientists, said that the DOE report contradicted his findings while citing his research on climate “fingerprinting.” Within a day of being released, the report was already well and thoroughly on its way to being completely debunked.

But meanwhile we are watching the very agency created to protect public health and the environment completely abandon its mission and instead embrace a pro–fossil fuel agenda. Even more alarming, we are witnessing the U.S. government adopt fringe climate denial talking points as its official position over what scientific evidence has made abundantly clear. This is a dangerous moment for our nation as disinformation and lies replace facts.

Here’s the reality: since 2009 when the endangerment finding was released, the scientific evidence around fossil fuel–driven climate change and its impacts on people and the planet has only become clearer and more sobering. More than 99 percent of peer-reviewed scientific literature and every major scientific body in the world agrees on the core facts that climate change is happening with clear consequences playing out now, and that our burning of fossil fuels is primarily to blame.

Sharply cutting those emissions is crucial to limiting dangerous climate change. Hundreds of scientists have come together to write major globally relevant reports, including the U.S. Fifth National Climate Assessment (NCA5) and the Sixth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (AR6), documenting the latest science. These reports draw on the work of thousands of underlying research papers and have undergone a rigorous and transparent review process.

As scientific methods have advanced, attribution science is another arena of rapid progress. Scientists can now determine the climate contribution to the probability or severity of individual extreme weather events such as Hurricane Helene, as well as estimate how much the emissions that come from major fossil fuel and cement companies contribute to the climate crisis.

At a time when people worldwide are reeling from extreme heat waves, worsening flooding and extreme rainfall, intensifying tropical cyclones and catastrophic wildfire seasons, it’s frankly cruel to deny the that these extreme disasters affect people’s health and well-being. Extreme weather kills, as is clear from the deaths of so many young children to floods in Kerrville, Tex., and eastern Pakistan in just the last month.

These climate extremes are ruining livelihoods and harming the economy too. Lost homes, rising insurance premiums, unhealthy outdoor working conditions, business interruptions and damaged infrastructure are all effects of a worsening climate.

With the world about to fully breach the 1.5 degrees Celsius mark after briefly crossing it in 2024—global climate goals are increasingly at risk. There’s no time to lose. We must quickly shift away from fossil fuels to clean energy. We must rapidly bend the global emissions curve. Yet, the U.S.—the world’s largest historical emitter—is shamefully and purposefully stepping away from the fight, and we will all suffer for it.

As scientists, and as people who care about the future of this planet and its amazing life-forms and ecosystems, we must speak up! Submit comments to the EPA and DOE pushing back against their destructive actions. Urge your representatives in Congress to defend the interests of their constituents and hold this administration accountable.

Burying facts and replacing them with propaganda is a hallmark of authoritarian governments. What’s ultimately at stake here goes far beyond any one scientific discipline or policy outcome.",https://blog.ucs.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/blog-thumbnail-extreme-heat-paper-sign.jpg,N,,2025-08-11 11:06:46.536262

With net sales surging 74% year-over-year to $191.9 million and net income jumping 138% to $51.2 million, the company's results reflect not just operational excellence but a strategic alignment with the seismic shifts reshaping global energy markets. For investors, this is more than a stock story; it is a signal to position for a sector poised to outperform in the coming decade.

The Power Systems Boom: A Sector-Wide Tailwind

The $83.8 million surge in power systems revenue—driven by data centers and oil and gas—highlights a critical inflection point. Data centers, now the backbone of artificial intelligence (AI) and cloud computing, are projected to add 44 GW of electricity demand by 2030, per Deloitte. This demand is not abstract: Tech giants are signing multi-gigawatt power purchase agreements (PPAs) for renewables, creating a direct pipeline for companies like Power Solutions. The firm's focus on modular, scalable power systems positions it to capitalize on this demand, as AI-driven infrastructure requires rapid deployment and flexibility.

Meanwhile, the oil and gas sector's pivot to decarbonization—via hydrogen production and carbon capture—has created a new frontier for power systems. Power Solutions' ability to adapt its technology to these applications underscores its relevance in a transitioning energy landscape. The company's gross profit of $54.1 million, despite a 28.2% margin (down from 31.8% in 2024), demonstrates its capacity to scale while maintaining profitability, a critical factor in capital-intensive sectors.

Regulatory Tailwinds: Policy as a Profit Multiplier

The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) has turbocharged clean energy demand, offering $27 billion in grants and tax credits to accelerate renewable deployment. Power Solutions' $29.2 million tax benefit from deferred tax asset adjustments—a direct result of the IRA's incentives—illustrates how policy is now a profit driver. This is not an isolated case: The IRA has spurred $71 billion in cleantech manufacturing investments in Q3 2024 alone, creating a virtuous cycle of supply and demand.

Regulatory clarity is also accelerating. The recent bipartisan push for permitting reforms—aimed at fast-tracking renewable projects—addresses a key bottleneck. For Power Solutions, this means shorter lead times for clients and a broader addressable market. The company's debt refinancing, which extended its credit facility to 2027 and increased borrowing capacity to $135 million, further insulates it from regulatory uncertainty, allowing it to focus on growth.

The AI-Driven Energy Transition: A New Paradigm

Artificial intelligence is not just a consumer of clean energy—it is a catalyst for its deployment. AI optimizes grid stability, streamlines supply chains, and accelerates the development of technologies like green hydrogen and long-duration storage. Power Solutions' strategic pivot to AI-compatible infrastructure aligns with this trend. For instance, its modular systems can integrate with AI-driven energy management platforms, enabling real-time efficiency gains for data centers and industrial clients.

The U.S. Department of Energy's $7 billion investment in hydrogen hubs and the rise of enhanced geothermal systems (EGS) further validate the sector's trajectory. Power Solutions' ability to adapt its power systems to these emerging technologies—such as hydrogen electrolysis or geothermal heat pumps—positions it as a key enabler of the next phase of the energy transition.

Investment Case: Positioning for Compounding Growth

The data is unequivocal: Clean energy infrastructure is entering a phase of compounding growth. Power Solutions' Q2 results—74% revenue growth, 138% net income increase, and a 136% EPS jump—signal a company that is not just riding the wave but shaping it. Its inclusion in the Russell 3000 and Russell 2000 indexes in June 2025 is a testament to its institutional credibility and scalability.

For investors, the question is not whether to participate but when. The sector's current valuation multiples, while elevated, are justified by the magnitude of demand and policy support. Power Solutions' debt reduction ($15 million in Q2) and $49.5 million in cash reserves provide a buffer against volatility, making it a safer bet in a sector prone to regulatory shifts.

Conclusion: A Defining Moment in Energy History

Power Solutions' Q2 performance is a microcosm of the clean energy sector's broader momentum. As data centers, AI, and carbon management drive demand, and as policy frameworks solidify, the sector is transitioning from hype to hypergrowth. For investors, the time to act is now—not to chase a stock but to stake a claim in a paradigm shift. The next decade will be defined by companies that can bridge the gap between clean energy and digital infrastructure. Power Solutions, with its strategic agility and financial discipline, is leading the charge.

The clean energy rally is no longer speculative—it is structural. Position accordingly.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-08-11 13:09:07.637774

Later, however, the value of the strike price can change significantly depending on the changes of the input parameters.
For more information on this new CfD scheme, contact your CMS client partner or these CMS experts: Kostadin Sirleshtov, Borislava Piperkova.","The European Commission with Regulation 2024/1747 has introduced the two-way Contract for Difference (CfD) as a direct price-support scheme to facilitate the transition to renewable and nuclear energy and expedite net neutrality. The two-way CfDs are expected to stimulate energy investments by shielding producers from price volatility, thus ensuring the realisation of investments while maintaining acceptable electricity costs for consumers. Analysts are declaring CfDs a crucial tool for the development of nuclear and renewable energy.

The design of the CfD is based on a strike price, which reflects the lowest price the project would be feasible to implement. The winning projects and the respective lowest strike price are determined through a competitive bidding procedure (e.g. a tender or auction). Another important element of the CfD design is the reference price, which indicates the electricity market price. The mechanism of the contract requires a payout by the state when the strike price is above the reference market price and a clawback by the producer when the reference price rises above the strike price.

The benefits of CfD lay in that it preserves the market economy by not interfering with electricity market prices, thus preventing consumers from incurring additional costs while developing clean energy generation projects with the necessary technologies.

Such mechanisms have been discussed or implemented in central and eastern European markets such as Romania, Czech Republic and Poland. Although national circumstances justify implementation of the direct price support scheme, there are other underlying reasons for the state to consider CfDs. The countries may be planning to phase out and decommission high-carbon electricity generation plants. States may be concerned with becoming a net importer of electricity and not able to meet increasing electricity demands, thus raising concerns about energy security.

The design of the CfD varies.

The Romania’s scheme is focused predominantly on supporting solar and onshore wind development via two rounds of auctioning in 2024 and 2025 with the total capacity of 5 GW. Applicant are ranked based on their proposed strike price and are selected according to the lowest bid until the auction volume is reached. The strike price can be adjusted to reflect the economic impact of changes throughout the 15-year contract period. A maximum strike price is set for each competitive bidding process to ensure proportionality.

The Czech Republic supports the Dukovany II nuclear power plant project through a purchase contract with a remuneration formula that has the same effect as a CfD. The strike price is initially determined by the contract based on a financial model submitted by the state. Later, however, the value of the strike price can change significantly depending on the changes of the input parameters. A support period of 60 years is expected.

Poland also envisages the introduction of a CfD to ensure the financing of the Lubiatowo-Kopalino nuclear power plant. A 60-year CfD is planned corresponding with the expected lifetime of the asset. The initial strike price is set by the national regulatory authority. Although not explicitly indicated, a mechanism for the strike price’s formation is provided based on incurred costs and can vary according to changes in the parameters (e.g. reduction in the capital expenditure compared to the base scenario, postponing the start of operation, variation in the exchange rate). The strike price will be adjusted prior to the start of operation. Taking into account the market volatility risk, a two-way load factor strike price adjustment mechanism will be used.

Currently, only Poland awaits a decision by the European Commission concerning state aid.

He also spoke about his company’s operations in India and the U.S., and on the need for India to foster a battery manufacturing ecosystem for energy storage.

Please give us an introduction to Vyomaa Energy and your service offerings.

We operate in India and the U.S. In India, we are primarily into rooftop solar for the commercial and industrial sector. In the U.S., we cater to the residential market.

Vyomaa installs rooftop solar onsite at our customer facilities. Our business model is currently in the commercial and industrial sector.

What is your market size in terms of capacity?

We have about 8 MW operating capacity, and we have closed about another 10 MW that is shovel-ready. Vyomaa has a target of 25 MW by March 31, 2026.

For the C&I segment, our order book is full.

Which segments of the industry do your clients come from?

Our customer base is the educational sector, the wood processing sector, and the automotive industry sector. We also have leases from data centers, software companies, and large malls. But our portfolio is mainly educational and the healthcare sector.

Most of our capacity, which is about 4.5 MW, is in Karnataka. The capacity is split between the education and food processing sectors.

The majority of the opportunities in the education sector lie in Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, and Tamil Nadu. In West Bengal, the power-hungry food processing industry is rapidly expanding. Educational institutions are a daytime industry, and they are the ones that tap into renewable energy power first. And now, they are operating 24/7, with all their hostels and lab facilities for which we must provide battery solutions.

Going forward, are you also getting into other verticals like the independent power producer segment?

We are venturing into storage, and at every rooftop facility, we are integrating energy storage, which gives added value to our clients, helping them secure access to 24/7 power at cheaper rates.

What kind of challenges and opportunities do you see in the C&I rooftop solar space?

The project construction activity is pretty straightforward. But grid synchronization and grid stabilization are major challenges. The process improvements have to come from both policymakers and developers. They have to work together to speed up grid synchronization.

What is your module sourcing strategy?

We have our vendor partners, major domestic module manufacturers from whom we source tier one modules.

Since our PPA tenures are for 25 years, our modules have to sustain for the entire duration. We source carefully, because we deliver quality. In the C&I segment, only those who provide quality will sustain.

When we procure the modules, we take a linear performance warranty for 10-15 years, after which the product warranty kicks in.

You are also participating in government tenders. You recently won a project from SECI.

We actively participate in government tenders, and primarily in SECI tenders. Recently, we won two projects, one in North India and one in the South. These are challenging projects for us. The challenges lie in identifying the roof space and meeting the growing demands of clients. They have their own energy mix and operational expenditure. Customer needs change as we talk to them.

We are working towards commissioning them by the end of this year.

From your experience, which model do C&I businesses prefer between solar open access and rooftop solar?

In solar open access, the availability of land is a major issue. Open access rules also differ from state to state. That’s a challenge for us. On the other hand, in the rooftop model, if the client has rooftop space, we can provide a solution.

Businesses have to choose between these two solutions.

What model does Vyomaa employ – CAPEX or OPEX – in your rooftop solar projects?

We go with the OPEX model. We sign PPAs for 20 to 25 years. With zero investment from the customer, we install the rooftop. We bring the capital, and we deploy the project on the client’s facility.

We have been in this domain for about 12 years. We raise equity, and we have equity partners from overseas as well as in Indian markets. We also tap into project finance debt providers. Initially, it was very tough to explain to banks how this model works. But now, more and more banks are learning and developing different product segmentations for financing.

What are Vyomaa Energy’s expansion plans?

Right now, we are mainly focused on a few states in India. We have won a project in Delhi, which allows us to expand into northern markets as well.

We are also in talks with clients in the U.S. and exploring opportunities in the data center and global capability center market.

What kind of policy prescriptions do you suggest to make business in India easier?

We need a common policy across states for grid synchronization to expedite project commissioning.

I feel the C&I segment is yet to take off in a big way. In utility scale, we are adding about 20 GW a year. We need to see the same scale in the C&I sector.

Policy changes can address some of the bottlenecks in C&I project commissioning. With battery technology coming into play, we should be able to supply round-the-clock power onsite at the customer facility.

The government has been incorporating 10% energy storage in solar tenders. What more needs to be done to give an impetus to the storage sector?

One thing India lacks is enough manufacturers locally. We have to rely on outside manufacturers. While mandating energy storage definitely increases demand, the technology must originate from within India. That is a challenge.

But eventually, as the market picks up, we will have more battery manufacturers coming into play.

Do you have plans to participate in BESS tenders floated by government agencies?

That’s an ongoing activity for us. Any tender that comes in the size and scale that we can participate in, we are into it. As I speak, my tendering team is participating in at least four different tenders. Some of them have battery storage as well.

The EPA said Republicans eliminated the federal fund that distributed the program’s money in the “one big, beautiful” law President Donald Trump signed on July 4.
On Thursday, EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin said on social media the law terminated the agency’s legal ability to distribute the funds.
“The federal funding has already been obligated to Oregon, and the Oregon Solar for All Coalition,” the department statement read.
The Solar for All fund was meant to bring the benefits of solar power to 900,000 households in low-income communities, while reducing greenhouse gas emissions.","Several congressional Democrats on Friday slammed the Trump administration’s announcement it will cancel nearly $7 billion in grants to fund solar energy projects for low-income households, saying the move was illegal and would raise families’ energy prices if allowed to proceed.

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency sent notices to states and other recipients of grants through the Solar for All program, which Democrats created in their massive 2022 taxes, energy and domestic policy law, that the agency was canceling all unspent funds from the initiative.

The EPA said Republicans eliminated the federal fund that distributed the program’s money in the “one big, beautiful” law President Donald Trump signed on July 4.

On Thursday, EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin said on social media the law terminated the agency’s legal ability to distribute the funds.

“The bottom line again is this: EPA no longer has the authority to administer the program or the appropriated funds to keep this boondoggle alive,” Zeldin said in a video posted to X. “With clear language and intent from Congress in the one big, beautiful bill, EPA is taking action to end this program for good. We are committed to the rule of law and being a good steward of taxpayer dollars.”

The move sparked a backlash from Democrats in Congress and the states, who said that rescinding the already-obligated funding violated the law.

“We are appalled and outraged at the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) blatant and unlawful termination of $7 billion in federal funding for the 60 organizations that received awards through the Solar for All program,” the five Democratic members of Oregon’s congressional delegation wrote in a Friday letter to Zeldin and White House Budget Director Russell Vought.

“Solar for All funding has been approved by Congress and signed into law, and cancelling or rescinding these obligated funds is a violation of the law and the Constitution.”

Letters to 60 states, organizations

The 60 recipients of the grant awards, mostly state governments but also tribes and some multistate projects, received letters from the EPA on Thursday informing them the grants were being cancelled.

The letter sent to Oregon’s Department of Energy said the reconciliation bill Trump signed on July 4 rescinded the authorization and appropriations for the fund.

“Any attempt to continue the program’s administration, in the absence of any authorizing legislation or appropriated funds for that purpose, is no longer legally permissible,” the letter said.

“The EPA has been weighing options for the future of the Solar for All program and has made the decision to terminate the SFA program and existing grants because the EPA no longer has a statutory basis or dedicated funding to continue administering and overseeing the nearly $7 billion outlay to approximately 60 grant recipients.”

The letter said the EPA realized that recipients “may have begun to rely” on the program for preliminary budgeting and staffing decisions. But it said that “due to the early nature of such expenditures, we expect any harms to interests suffered to be remedied and remediable.”

In a statement Friday, the Oregon Department of Energy said it had already spent “significant administrative funds” to launch the program later this year, and hinted a legal challenge may come soon.

“The federal funding has already been obligated to Oregon, and the Oregon Solar for All Coalition,” the department statement read. “We are surprised and disappointed to hear the U.S. EPA is moving to rescind these already-obligated funds. ODOE will work with our partners, the Governor’s Office, and Oregon’s Attorney General to consider next steps to ensure these funds continue to serve Oregonians as intended.”

‘A betrayal’

Like the Oregon Democrats, New Jersey Democratic Rep. Frank Pallone, the ranking member on the powerful House Energy and Commerce Committee, said the move was illegal and predicted it would raise energy prices.

“The Trump Administration is stealing from working families in broad daylight,” Pallone said in an early Friday statement. “This money was intended for our constituents and communities to help lower energy bills. Clawing these funds back isn’t just brazenly illegal – it’s a betrayal by this Administration of working families who will now pay higher energy bills just so Republicans can grind their axe against clean energy.”

Other Democrats, including Arizona Gov. Katie Hobbs, also focused on the economic impact.

“President Trump ran on lowering costs and creating jobs,” Hobbs wrote on X. “Gutting Solar for All will do the exact opposite. It makes our air dirtier, our energy bills higher, and our economy weaker. I will continue to fight for the clean and affordable energy future Arizonans want and deserve.”

Democrats created the Solar for All fund as part of the $27 billion Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund in the law they passed without any GOP support in either chamber and President Joe Biden signed in August 2022.

The Solar for All fund was meant to bring the benefits of solar power to 900,000 households in low-income communities, while reducing greenhouse gas emissions.

According to a list on the EPA website, the awardees included the Executive Office of the State of New Hampshire; Rhode Island Office of Energy Resources; the Maine Governor’s Energy Office; the Alaska Energy Authority; the Oregon Department of Energy; Washington State Department of Commerce; Bonneville Environmental Foundation in Idaho; Tanana Chiefs Conference in Alaska; New Jersey Board of Public Utilities; Maryland Clean Energy Center; Pennsylvania Energy Development Authority; Virginia Department of Energy; West Virginia Office of Energy; Department of Environment and Conservation Tennessee; Kentucky Energy and Environment Cabinet; North Carolina Department of Environmental Quality; South Carolina Office of Resilience; the Solar and Energy Loan Fund of St. Lucie County, Inc., in Florida; the Capital Good Fund in Georgia; Minnesota Department of Commerce; the State of Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes and Energy; the State of Ohio Office of Budget and Management State Accounting; Wisconsin Economic Development Corporation; Indiana Community Action Association Inc.; New Mexico Energy, Minerals, & Natural Resources Department; State of Louisiana Department of Natural Resources; Hope Enterprise Corporation in Arkansas; the Missouri Environmental Improvement and Energy Resources Authority; the Center for Rural Affairs in Nebraska; Colorado Energy Office; Utah Office of Energy Development; Bonneville Environmental Foundation in Montana; Coalition for Green Capital in North Dakota; Coalition for Green Capital in South Dakota; Executive Office of the State of Arizona; Nevada Clean Energy Fund; Hopi Utilities Corporation in Arizona; and other programs that covered multiple states and tribes.",https://portlandtribune.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2025/07/a68eecfddfa85889b2d9545823dedc5e.jpg,N,,2025-08-11 11:05:56.281960

According to Bernd Heid, a senior partner at McKinsey & Company who leads its Platform for Climate Technologies, around 90% of climate technologies will be in the money by 2030 with a $100 carbon price.","NEW YORK – For all the uncertainties generated by Donald Trump’s administration over the past six months, one thing is clear: “climate” technologies are out, and “energy” technologies are in. But while going along with this rhetorical shift may appease some, it should be recognized for what it is: a change in wording. The fundamental economic and technological forces that are pushing the world away from oil, coal, and gas and toward low-carbon, high-efficiency technologies have not abated.

Over the past two decades, climate change has been a leading item on the global agenda, driving efforts to deploy technologies that will reduce carbon dioxide emissions. Those efforts are now facing headwinds, and not just in the United States. Geopolitical developments elsewhere, like Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, have called attention to the importance of energy affordability and security over other considerations.

Policymakers in the US, Europe, and elsewhere initially responded to the war by doubling down on the shift from fossil fuels, and for good reason. Oil, coal, and gas are commodities whose prices will always be linked to geopolitical vagaries (that goes for not only global oil markets but also regional gas markets, which are increasingly linked by trade in liquefied natural gas).

As a case in point, the summer of 2022 brought massive inflation, largely driven by fossil-fuel price spikes. Europe’s gas prices peaked at ten times their long-term average, and US gas prices at around triple their long-term average. While the US Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 is widely considered a misnomer, history will judge the name kindly: The only permanent way to address such bouts with “fossilflation” is to stop using fossil fuels.

Though the blowback against climate policies has been particularly strong at the federal level in the US, Europe, too, has undergone a retrenchment. This is somewhat understandable, even if it is shortsighted. Germany, Europe’s largest economy, has been in a recession for more than two years, with high energy prices a chief culprit. Climate technologies that are already commercially viable could help, of course. But taking full advantage of the lower prices of solar, wind, and (increasingly) batteries requires a willingness to reform power markets and pass these savings to households and industrial consumers. It also calls for more upfront public investment, an area where climate priorities compete with other priorities like national security that are often perceived to be more immediate.

In grappling with these tradeoffs, the European Union delivered the kinds of efficiency measures that Trump’s “Department of Government Efficiency” (DOGE) had promised but failed to achieve. For example, Europe dialed back its carbon border adjustment mechanism by requiring 90% fewer companies to comply.

On the surface, this seems like a decisive blow to the goal of establishing a carbon tariff for imports, commensurate with Trump’s DOGE hatchet. But unlike Trump and Elon Musk, the EU ensured that the remaining 10% of importers still accounted for over 90% of emissions. This outcome is far from ideal when viewed solely through a climate lens. But viewed from a broader climate-economic perspective, it is exactly the kind of surgical intervention that DOGE promised but never delivered.

Still, fiddling at the climate-policy margins ignores the bigger picture. While Europe and America are taking steps back, China is leaping forward. It alone accounted for over 40% of the record $2.1 trillion of global investment in the energy transition last year – more than the EU, the United Kingdom, and the US combined.

The balance is even more lopsided for specific clean-energy technologies. China produces around 75% of the world’s solar panels and 80% of its lithium-ion batteries. That dominance is the result of a concerted green industrial policy, in which innovation plays a key role. The claim that China only manufactures and assembles is woefully outdated. China’s electric vehicles, for example, are second to none. BYD, the country’s leading carmaker, recently unveiled a groundbreaking charging system capable of adding 470 kilometers (292 miles) of range in just five minutes, putting the company in a league of its own globally.

China’s dominance extends to technologies that are not yet competitive without price support. LONGi, one of the world’s top solar manufacturers, formed LONGi Hydrogen in 2021 to pursue green hydrogen production. It now leads the world in electrolyzer manufacturing capacity.

These are not isolated examples. China’s ambitious industrial policy has helped lift five other Chinese hydrogen companies into the global top ten. Have Europe and the US already lost this race for the future?

While the US now seems hellbent on turning itself into a petrostate, the EU has a chance to revive its clean-energy fortunes. It is even starting with a significant policy advantage: a CO2 price hovering around $100 per metric ton means that most low-carbon technologies – from clean electrons and electrification to clean molecules like biofuels – are already economically viable. Others, like green hydrogen, will need further support to help climb the learning curve and slide down the cost curve. According to Bernd Heid, a senior partner at McKinsey & Company who leads its Platform for Climate Technologies, around 90% of climate technologies will be in the money by 2030 with a $100 carbon price.

While China dominates with six top-ten global players, three of the others are European. The Swedish startup Stegra is building the world’s first low-carbon steel plant using electrolyzers made by ThyssenKrupp Nucera, in which the German steelmaker has a majority stake.

Despite recent political developments, the US, too, has shown that rapid change is possible. Although breaking China’s solar manufacturing dominance will be difficult, the US has made significant inroads just over the past three years. Earlier this year, it exceeded 50 gigawatts of panel manufacturing capacity, a fivefold increase since 2022. These 50 GW in panel supply roughly matched US demand.

True, onshoring the solar supply chain comes with costs that can be justified only by priorities other than the climate, such as national security or promoting domestic manufacturing. But that is the point. If political conditions require stronger emphasis on technologies like geothermal and nuclear, and if technologies formerly known as “climate tech” must be relabeled as more neutral-sounding “energy tech,” so be it. The larger forces propelling us toward decarbonization remain the same.",https://webapi.project-syndicate.org/library/35b90dec60b6fafa3fadb393b852fa04.2-1-super.1.jpg,N,,2025-08-11 11:06:00.807024

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), and U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) provided different types of financial assistance to improve drinking water and wastewater infrastructure in fiscal years 2014 through 2023. Specifically, 14 of the agencies’ programs provided $35 billion in grants (at least 22,000 projects) and $29 billion in direct loans (about 4,800 projects) during this period.

EPA, FEMA, and USDA took steps to reduce barriers to financial assistance faced by vulnerable communities—those likely to face challenges preparing for and recovering from disasters, such as rural and low-income areas. In this report, GAO used the term “vulnerable communities” to refer to communities defined in some programs’ authorizing statutes that may receive additional assistance under these programs. These statutes were not affected by recent executive orders or actions. Agencies provided technical assistance and allowed grantees to use assistance from other federal programs to meet requirements to provide matching funds, known as nonfederal cost share. However, FEMA has not adequately communicated about the option to use assistance from USDA programs to meet cost-share requirements in certain cases.

EPA, FEMA, and USDA used national or state measures to assess the extent to which vulnerable communities benefitted from certain programs. However, EPA, FEMA, and USDA officials said that limited data about the geographical areas served by drinking water and wastewater utilities made it difficult to accurately assess who benefited from their programs. EPA created a mapping tool with the geographical service areas of drinking water systems, which may differ from municipal boundaries (see fig.). EPA plans to complete a similar tool for wastewater service areas in summer 2025. Using EPA’s mapping tools could enable EPA, FEMA, and USDA to more accurately identify the communities, including vulnerable communities, their programs are benefiting.

Why GAO Did This Study

Drinking water and wastewater utilities have experienced disruption or failure after disasters, threatening public health. For example, disasters in Mississippi in 2022 and North Carolina in 2024 left residents without potable water for weeks. Federal agencies provide assistance for utilities to build resilience against natural disasters—including communities in rural and low-income areas vulnerable to disasters.

This report examines, among other things, (1) financial assistance that EPA, FEMA, and USDA provided to improve water infrastructure; (2) the extent to which these agencies addressed barriers vulnerable communities face accessing and participating in selected programs; and (3) how these agencies assessed the extent to which assistance reached vulnerable communities.

GAO analyzed fiscal year 2014–2023 data for EPA, FEMA, and USDA programs that provided financial assistance for water infrastructure projects—the most recent data available during the review. GAO also reviewed relevant executive orders and agencies’ plans and actions taken to address barriers faced by vulnerable communities. Finally, GAO interviewed a nongeneralizable sample of 14 utilities selected based on factors including vulnerability and disaster experience.",https://www.gao.gov/themes/custom/gao_uswds/dist/gao-img/gao-gov-icon-800-mod.jpg,N,,2025-08-11 10:02:45.845750

Inside a nondescript building off North Loop Drive, where longtime farmland sits adjacent to new housing developments, Girisha Ganjegunte is one of several Texas A&M University researchers studying how to save – or maybe just prolong – agriculture in the Lower Valley.

He talks about math formulas and soil chemistry, and pulls up graphs on his computer indicating some of his experiments have shown promise at reducing salt levels in pecan orchards, one of many things bedeviling farmers in the El Paso region.

Farmers, he said, don’t always care to know the mathematical details of his work. They just want to know how to maintain their pecan orchards or crop farms with the salty groundwater they’re forced to use when the Rio Grande only flows for a couple of months like it is this year – hardly long enough to sustain a crop.

Ultimately, it’s all about fighting off drought so that farmers can keep farming and pass on the practice to future generations instead of selling their land to urban developers.

“Farmers want to do one thing most of all: They want to make sure that the ground is in good shape so their family can keep farming in the future,” said Isaiah Ulmer, a farmer who grows pecans on several hundred acres in Canutillo, near the New Mexico-Texas state line. “It’s just that simple.”

Borderland researchers such as Ganjegunte – a professor of water resources salinity management with Texas A&M’s AgriLife Research Center in El Paso – are trying to help farmers here sustain and innovate in the face of drought, escalating temperatures and increasingly salty groundwater.

Ganjegunte said the idea of selling land becomes more alluring to growers as environmental challenges mount and land prices increase to as high as almost $1 million per acre for plots near Interstate 10, he said.

“Then put it in the bank and just retire. Why fight with lack of water, salinity and an uncertain future?” Ganjegunte said during an interview at his office at Texas A&M’s research farm in Socorro. “It’s uncertainty that’s kind of making people worried about agriculture.”

This year, farmers have been grappling with a brief river season – the Rio Grande began flowing in June and will run only through August – about five months shorter than a typical season. And when the river doesn’t supply enough water to grow a crop, farmers have to spend money to pump groundwater with higher salinity that some crops such as pecans don’t like.

Researchers have a confluence of factors to untangle: water use, the cultural history of farming in the region, and the economic importance of agriculture in the borderland – one of the major pecan-growing areas in the United States.

A water future for residents and farmers?

The challenge facing agriculture – and especially pecan growers – in El Paso is clear.

Growers in the Upper and Lower valleys rely on water flowing through the Rio Grande to irrigate their crops.

The length of time that the Rio Grande flows in any year – and the amount of water available for farmers – depends on how much snow packs up in the mountains of southern Colorado and northern New Mexico and then melts and flows into Elephant Butte in New Mexico.

Elephant Butte, about 120 miles north of El Paso, was built in the 1920s to control the flow of water to prevent flooding and so that planners could divide the water. Over the last 20 years, drought has led to consistently low levels of water stored in the reservoir – especially compared with the 1980s and 1990s.

In recent years, that’s left farmers far more reliant on pumping the region’s salty groundwater to sustain their crops. For pecans, salty water can lead to smaller nuts and lower yields, which makes farming less economical.

“From when I was born, it was the golden years – until I was 21 or 22, it was only surface water, no groundwater,” said Shannon Ivey, a 45-year-old fourth-generation pecan farmer in Tornillo in far East El Paso County.

In the early 2000s, Ivey’s father salvaged old wells on the family’s farm to start pumping groundwater as the drought that persists today first set in.

“My entire life, I had never seen (wells on the farm) because, sometime in the ’70s, when the drought had broken, my dad had pulled the motors, engine blocks, pump, column pipe, everything, and stored a lot of it or sold a lot of it,” Ivey said. “And they were capped with just covers on a hole in the ground.”

Short river seasons could become the norm.

Researchers at the University of Texas at El Paso have used computer models to predict water levels at Elephant Butte based on snowfall trends at the head of the Rio Grande watershed.

“It does look like there’ll be less water – substantially less water – and that the number of consecutive years where we’re below the full (river) allocation will increase,” said UTEP professor Alex Mayer, director of the university’s Center for Environmental Resource Management. “And that’s primarily due to climate change in the headwaters.”

Less river water means farmers shift to rely on the underground aquifers that El Paso and Ciudad Juárez also tap for drinking water supplies.

Mayer said it’s difficult to measure how much water is stored in either the Mesilla Bolson aquifer west of the Franklin Mountains or the larger Hueco Bolson that’s on the east side of the mountain range, where water sits deep below the surface in between particles of sand and rock.

But from his calculations, he said there’s only “a matter of decades of fresh water left in the Hueco Bolson.”

In recent years, city-owned El Paso Water has dialed back its groundwater pumping to preserve the aquifers. And water managers with the utility say there’s still a vast amount of brackish – or slightly salty – groundwater available to meet the city’s water needs for many years to come.

That’s why El Paso Water built the Kay Bailey Hutchison Desalination plant near El Paso International Airport in 2007, which it’s expanding to produce as much as 33.5 million gallons per day. That’s equal to about 30% of the average amount of water the utility’s customers use every day.

Still, Mayer warned that El Pasoans have no control over how much water residents use in Juárez – which doesn’t get any water from the Rio Grande.

“It’s quite clear that the aquifers are being overdrawn,” Mayer said. “The brackish water, you could say there’s a lot and that it’ll never be threatened. But I think that’s what we thought about the freshwater, too.”

El Paso Water is also reducing its reliance on the Rio Grande for drinking water so that, if no water flows through the river in any given year, it could still meet the city’s demand and avoid a water shortage.

In addition to desalinating groundwater, El Paso Water is building the cutting-edge Pure Water Center near the Ysleta-Zaragoza Port of Entry to treat wastewater to drinkable standards and pump as much as 10 million gallons per day back into the city’s drinking water system.

Longer-term, El Paso Water plans to pipe in water from the aquifers beneath Dell City, Texas, about 90 miles east of El Paso.

While El Paso’s water supply appears secure for decades into the future, water bills will continue to rise. Pumping and treating an acre-foot (about 326,000 gallons) of groundwater costs El Paso Water roughly $250, and an acre-foot of river water costs about $340 to produce.

An acre-foot of water from the desalination plant or the Pure Water Center will cost about $500 for the utility to produce, while importing water from Dell City could cost around $1,300 per acre-foot.

“El Paso Water has demonstrated that they can diversify,” Mayer said. “But there’s a consequence to that. That’s the cost to consumers.”

Solutions to sustain pecan crops in El Paso

A future with shorter river seasons and more aquifer pumping appears bleak. But farmers and researchers aren’t giving up on agriculture in El Paso – and for good reason.

Several novel and innovative techniques have shown promise to help sustain farming here by increasing water efficiency – essentially, helping trees drink up more of the water used in irrigation. There’s also emerging ideas about how to reduce salinity levels in the water that results from using brackish groundwater, especially in the Lower Valley.

Soil and groundwater in the Upper Valley generally contain lower levels of salt; groundwater becomes saltier the further east you are of the Franklin Mountains.

When farmers flood irrigate with brackish water, it leaves a hard-crust on the soil surface that’s hard for water to permeate to reach pecan tree roots. That can lead to “stunted growth and lower nut production,” in pecan trees, said Kimberly Cervantes, an assistant professor and extension horticulture specialist with Texas A&M’s AgriLife Research Center in El Paso.

There are a lot of ideas about how to stop salt from building up, or how to break up the salty, hard soil. Some ideas are higher-tech than others.

“While these strategies cannot fully eliminate the risks of saline water, they significantly improve the soil’s resilience and help mitigate negative effects on trees,” Cervantes said.

Both Cervantes and Ganjegunte said farmers can implement different tillage practices – essentially, turning up the earth – to help mitigate the salt accumulation.

“Tillage practices like excavation can help stir and overturn the soil by breaking down clay particles,” which improves water infiltration, Cervantes said.

Ganjegunte developed his own method of mixing a certain kind of powdered polymer with irrigation water, which reduces salinity in the soil and improves trees’ water intake.

Sodium “makes the soil so impervious it will just pond,” Ganjegunte said. Applying the polymer can allow a farmer to excavate their land every four or five years instead of every year or two, he said.

“We need to make the farmer’s life better,” he said.

Ivey said a private company is operating a kind of pilot lab on 65 acres of his 600-acre property, where they’re experimenting with using micro-algae that is “basically, creating an environment that’s less sodic, which increases leachability and permeability and better soil health,” he said.

While optimistic, Ivey said new technology and practices come with limitations – especially at a big scale.

Introducing the polymer Ganjegunte developed into irrigation is still too costly – as much as $1,000 per acre. Instead of using the polymer, the material gypsum has helped reduce salt levels and increase soil porosity, but farmers have to buy huge quantities.

And the micro-algae has to be developed to fit the specific soil profile where it will be applied. Implementing the micro-algae also requires electricity, water and an on-site lab. But more research on farms could yield results in the future.

“To mitigate salts,” Ivey said, “I’m open to anything and everything.”

Perhaps the most promising change for pecan farmers is simply allowing vegetation to grow on orchard floors instead of mowing and clearing them constantly.

So-called cover crops – a variety of different grasses and plants, including sunflowers – that sprawl across orchards generally aren’t a source of revenue for farmers. But they help in the orchards in several ways, Ivey said, including by avoiding the cost of cleaning them with machinery.

“There’s more benefits, in my opinion, than cons to allowing the vegetation. Chief amongst those is you’ve got cooler soil temperatures,” he said, “you’ve got longer soil moisture retention, and then you’ve got better permeability.”

Ulmer said allowing cover crops to grow in orchards is the best way to mitigate the record-setting heat El Paso has experienced in recent years, which stresses trees.

“Planting cover crops out there, one of the number one things it did that I was just blown away by … It grew quicker than the weeds could, so it over-competed with the weeds,” he said. “We reduced our broad leaf weed population, I would say, by somewhere between 80% and 90%. Which means we weren’t using any Roundup.”

Orchards with cover crops also feature more biodiversity, which helps trees grow and remain healthy, Ulmer said.

“We’re creating our own little microclimates in those orchards,” he said. “You walk into an orchard with a cover crop, and the humidity index is noticeably higher.”

Farmers and academics don’t always agree. Researchers have said farmers should shift to drip irrigation systems instead of flood irrigation, which results in water lost to evaporation. But the infrastructure can be costly and not necessarily more water-efficient, Ivey argued.

Other ideas include gradually planting pomegranate trees on more acreage, or introducing quinoa, which is valuable and highly tolerant to salt. But the economics of alternative crops and how to set up a supply chain to get the product to market still has to be evaluated.

That already exists for pecans in this region. Ivey uses a pecan-shelling plant a short drive from his farm, which also includes a massive cold-storage facility where hundreds of tons of pecans are stacked in massive sacks waiting for forklifts to haul them off. Growers can hold nuts there if they’re waiting for a buyer or for prices to rise.

Mayer, the UTEP water professor, said farmers will likely need to convert to different crops that require less water than pecans or plan to convert the farmland to other uses.

“I think it’s time that we really sit down and consider what to do in the next several decades to help farmers convert to something different,” he said.

Agricultural researchers are also trying to sustain farming here to preserve the region’s culture, an unquantifiable element that’s hard to parse out with data and formulas.

But for the rural, largely Spanish-speaking communities surrounding El Paso that have for decades relied on farming as a way of life, maintaining the culture of growing is as important as anything else.

“Sustaining the pecan industry is not just about economics – it’s also about preserving a way of life and a vital part of West Texas’ cultural heritage,” she said. “With innovation, stewardship and community support, pecan farming in El Paso can remain a vibrant and sustainable industry for generations to come.”

Ulmer acknowledged the “problems” such as rising heat and greater reliance on brackish groundwater may force some local farmers out of business in the coming years. But he said those challenges also create opportunities for pecan growers.

“The farmers that I know are working their butts off every single day to stretch these resources,” Ulmer said. “And they’ve been doing it for years now, working with less and less and figuring it out and producing some pretty decent crops.”

“A lot of guys will sit around and cuss the heat,” Ulmer said, “and say ‘Man, we’ve got all of these problems.’”

“But, for some guys out there, we might just get really lucky and live through this thing,” he said. “And, if we’ll really listen to what the environment is telling us, to change what we’re doing and implement some really positive changes, they might just help us do things better.”",https://i0.wp.com/elpasomatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/CB_IveyPecanFarm-12.jpg?fit=1500%2C1000&ssl=1,N,,2025-08-11 10:03:48.641047

“But Michigan legislators gave in to the demands of its big utilities to gut its electricity competition program, and today Michigan’s rates across the board are higher than in Ohio, Indiana, Wisconsin and Illinois.”

The commercial electricity rate in Michigan was 14.05 cents per kilowatt hour as of February, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Ohio’s rate during the same month was 11.19 cents per kilowatt hour. The national commercial average was 13.08 cents per kilowatt hour.

The regulatory environment in Michigan and Ohio vary in significant ways.

Ohio has energy choice. Michigan has a strictly limited choice program that is out of reach for most customers.

Ohio’s law, in the words of that state’s regulators, lets households and large industrial companies alike “shop for energy options from a diverse group of competitive suppliers.” In Michigan, most customers have no choice in the company that generates or supplies electricity to them. Rates are set by the Michigan Public Service Commission, whose members are appointed by the governor. Regulators have approved rate increases each year in the current decade.

Peja Breuler is a candidate at St. John’s University School of Law and a summer associate at Anderson Kill.

Over the last decade, the United States has made significant strides in renewable energy development, driven by state mandates and federal incentives that have spurred innovation. From 2014 to 2023, the U.S. added more than 121 GW of utility and small-scale solar capacity — a 688% increase — and 83 GW of wind capacity — a 130% increase of 130%, according to a 2024 analysis by Climate Central.

Continued progress has been thrown in doubt, however, by the actions of the Trump administration and the 119th Congress that took office this January. Most notably, the so-called One Big Beautiful Bill Act, or OBBBA, which passed both houses of Congress on a strict party-line vote and was signed into law by President Donald Trump on July 4 could have a significant impact on further renewable energy development in the U.S. OBBBA Subtitle VII, Chapter 5 repeals or restricts most major clean energy tax credits enacted under the Inflation Reduction Act which was signed into law by President Joe Biden in August 2022.

Even before OBBBA’s passage, a Trump executive order pausing the development of offshore wind projects, coupled with various Trump administration actions pausing or withdrawing approval for alternative energy projects, had generated considerable political risk for developers of such projects. In this political climate, companies initiating or seeking to continue development of alternative energy sources need to look both to their contracts and their insurance portfolios for risk management, while keeping communication channels open at all levels of government. Political risk insurance, or PRI, and amended force majeure contract provisions are key elements in mitigating political risks.

U.S. political risk: repealed credits and paused projects

In terms of manufacturing, the OBBBA repeals Clean Electricity Production Credit (Section 70512) and Clean Electricity Investment Credit (Section 70513) for projects that begin construction more than 60 days after enactment or are placed in service after 2028. The bill also imposes a Foreign Entity of Concern (FEOC) on buyers of transferable tax credits. Several other green tax credits, subject to narrow exceptions, are terminated for tax years after 2025, including the Energy Efficient Home Improvement Credit (Section 70505), Clean Vehicle Credit (Section 70502) and New Energy Efficient Home Credit (Section 70508).

The Trump administration has also intervened to abruptly pause projects already approved, funded and in progress. Most notably, Empire Wind 1 is a major offshore wind project off the coast of New York. Construction began in early 2024 with the goal of generating 810 MW by late 2026, enough to power 500,000 homes. On April 16, the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management ordered Empire Offshore Wind to halt all ongoing activities related to the project — purportedly to ensure that previously authorized activities would be “carried out in a manner that provides for protection of the environment.” On May 19, the Trump administration reversed this unexpected stop-work order, averting a major setback for New York’s clean energy plans. The project is now back on track and expected to be fully operational by the end of 2026.

The temporary suspension led to substantial costs for project stakeholders, however, including expenses from barges stranded in ports and disrupted supply chains. These delays highlight the vulnerabilities of large-scale renewable energy projects to regulatory interruptions.

The administration’s regulatory action led to a more dire outcome for Atlantic Shores Offshore Wind, the developer of a 1.5-GW project offshore New Jersey. On June 4, Atlantic Shores filed a petition asking to terminate the project’s offshore renewable energy credits and be released from all obligations, asserting that the project was no longer viable under its 2021 Offshore Wind Renewable Energy Certificate. The withdrawal follows the EPA’s remanding of the project’s Clean Air Act certificate. The petition for withdrawal cites that remand, along with Trump’s executive order pausing offshore development “and other actions taken by the current administration more generally” that undercut the project’s viability in its current form.

PRI and renewable energy projects

Given the heightened risk of government intervention in alternative energy projects, companies engaged in such projects should consider purchasing political risk insurance. PRI is a specialized coverage that protects businesses from financial losses incurred because of political changes or government instability.

Using PRI is not unheard of in the scope of renewable energy projects as it helps derisk projects in politically or economically unstable countries. In April 2024, Marsh, an insurance broker and risk advisor, arranged a PRI package for a $36 million renewable energy project powering a lithium mine in Mali, which covered the plant and potential government interference.

Additionally, the World Bank Group’s new $150 million energy program for Sri Lanka includes $40 million in guarantees in its first phase to lower risks for private investors and energy producers. The International Finance Corporation and Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency will provide complementary support for the program through direct investments and political risk insurance.

While generally thought of as a tool for companies operating in developing countries, PRI is available for projects in the developed world as well. Dan Riordan, head of political risk and credit, MSIG USA, estimates that about three quarters of demand for PRI is in the developing world, but asserts that “We’re seeing there’s strong interest in many of the developed markets, even in North America.” Along with coverage for actions such as nationalization or confiscation, PRI can cover “contract frustration due to political events,” as AIG puts it.

PRI coverage can be as short as 30 days but can extend for several years when covering a major infrastructure development. PRI may respond to occurrences including abrupt repeal of renewable energy incentives (though that horse has largely left the U.S. barn), or regulatory action impeding long-term renewable energy. PRI could mitigate losses from the accelerated expiration of various tax PRI and may help developers with remobilization efforts should the political climate shift.

Negotiations for regulatory relief

As the Empire Offshore Wind saga illustrates, few governments, including the current administration in the U.S., are impervious to the interests of major investors of capital or stakeholders such as state governments. Even Atlantic Shores, while petitioning for release from its obligations, asserted that the project is seeking a “reset period” — and that may happen. Major alternative energy projects are afoot in U.S. states governed by both parties. Negotiation with relevant federal agencies in the wake of regulatory roadblocks may sometimes bear fruit.

Force majeure language

To strengthen contractual resilience, companies should consider revising their force majeure clauses, particularly in jurisdictions like New York, where such clauses are narrowly interpreted. The New York Court of Appeals in Kel Kim Corp. v. Central Markets held that a force majeure defense is only valid if the clause explicitly includes the specific event preventing performance. This narrow interpretation underscores the need for precise and comprehensive clause drafting.

To address uncertainties in today’s volatile environment, companies should amend force majeure clauses to explicitly include “political risks” as a qualifying event. Examples of political risks include changes in government policy, regulatory shifts, trade restrictions, or other governmental actions that materially impact contract performance. By incorporating such language, companies can enhance their flexibility to suspend or terminate obligations when unforeseen political events render performance impractical or financially unviable.

For projects like Atlantic Shores Offshore Wind, a force majeure clause that explicitly lists political risks could provide a stronger basis for the developer to seek relief from performance obligations. For instance, if new regulations or policy shifts significantly increase costs or delay project timelines, a well-drafted clause could support a claim that performance is no longer commercially feasible, provided the clause clearly identifies such risks as excusable events.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/HyccmH_t24H44v0QSxJAZvFc3hfOYGqwcMIfKnYfxJ8/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9HZXR0eUltYWdlcy0xMTMzNjg2Nzg2LmpwZw==.webp,N,,2025-08-11 10:02:32.733842

New investment secured and capital raise underway

Vast has entered into a termsheet for US$3.5 million of convertible notes from two of its largest and longest-standing investors, Nabors Industries and Canberra Airport Group. The financing is expected to close by the end of August. This continued backing reflects strong investor confidence in Vast’s differentiated technology and commercial readiness.

In parallel, Vast has launched a capital raise targeting leading institutional and strategic investors, with Rennie Advisory appointed to lead the process. Vast is also advancing a collaboration with a major player in the renewable energy sector with deep manufacturing capability and proven delivery of large-scale projects in comparable technologies. This partnership is focused on accelerating deployment of Vast’s technology in key global markets and unlocking additional commercial opportunities alongside the current project pipeline.

“The continued support from two of our long-term investors is a powerful endorsement of Vast’s technology and a strong vote of confidence in VS1,” said Craig Wood, CEO of Vast. “This new funding keeps us on track to break ground on VS1 later this year, while our broader capital raise will enable delivery of VS1 and accelerate the rollout of our global project pipeline.”

Port Augusta Green Energy Hub progressing towards construction

Located in South Australia, the Port Augusta Green Energy Hub will be home to a suite of integrated projects designed to deliver clean, dispatchable energy and enable decarbonisation of transport and industry:

VS1: A 30MW concentrated solar thermal plant with 8 hours of storage, VS1 has secured up to A$290 million in conditional Australian Government support, including a A$180 million ARENA grant. The project will deliver low-cost, low-carbon power on demand, and is on track for construction to begin later this year.

140MW / 2-hour lithium-ion battery: Developed in partnership with 1414 Degrees, this project provides critical storage and grid stability and is also on track to commence construction later this year.

South Australian Solar Fuels (SASF): A green fuels demonstration facility that aims to produce low-carbon hydrogen-derived fuels for aviation and shipping. With the pre-FEED stage now complete, MB Energy will conclude its involvement as the project progresses to FEED. Vast continues to lead development, supported by the award of A$700,000 in funding announced in March from the Australia-Singapore Low Emissions Technologies (ASLET) initiative for maritime and port operations.

Significant development milestones have been achieved across the Hub, including:

EPBC referral decision confirming the Hub is not a controlled action under national environmental law

Technical acceptance for VS1’s grid connection application

The big question now is how Congress will react — to the vetoes, the provisional measure, and the government’s new bill.
The president vetoed 63 of those provisions — 16% of the total, a high percentage.
The technical and legal review to prepare the vetoes and the alternative wording was meticulous.
It’s unclear how much (or whether) the government has negotiated the text with the House and Senate.","The presidential vetoes and the new bill drafted by the Executive to amend the General Environmental Licensing Law correct most of the problematic provisions approved by the Chamber of Deputies in July, ease tensions within the Cabinet, meet demands from productive sectors, and aim to build dialogue with Congress. This is a remarkable step in avoiding the worst and finding consensus amid divergent views. The positive aspects of the new text even surprised some of those who had called for a full veto of what environmentalists dubbed the “Destruction Bill.” Still, there remains one exposed wire — and one big question.

The provisional measure (MP) 1,308, in effect since Friday and dealing with special licensing for strategic projects, is the discordant note in the view of Suely Araújo, former president of environmental regulator IBAMA, who has followed licensing debates for over 30 years. “But there are many positive points in the text, and the vetoes were significant,” she says.

The big question now is how Congress will react — to the vetoes, the provisional measure, and the government’s new bill.

The coming days will demand an enormous political effort from the administration to persuade lawmakers, who could once again jeopardize everything — climate and biodiversity, traditional peoples and urban populations. The stakes also include economic damage, the potential collapse of the EU–Mercosur trade deal, threats to food production, rising prices, and inflation.

It was no coincidence that Executive Secretary of the Office of Chief of Staff Miriam Belchior, during the press conference announcing the presidential vetoes, stressed that this is “a government project, not a ministry project.” She noted that President Lula devoted five hours of his time to reviewing the vetoes.

“The government cared about the issue — and that is an important signal,” says Marcio Astrini, executive secretary of Observatório do Clima, the largest network of environmental organizations and social movements concerned with climate and the environment. “The government looked at licensing in a way it hadn’t during the entire congressional process.”

63 Provisions Vetoed

The version approved by the House had 66 articles and 398 provisions. The president vetoed 63 of those provisions — 16% of the total, a high percentage. Of those, 26 were completely struck from the law, including the provision that weakened special protections for the Atlantic Forest and another that limited the requirement for consultation with Funai and the Palmares Foundation in projects affecting Indigenous and quilombola communities. Mr. Lula axed these controversial measures entirely.

The other 37 vetoes came with alternative wording. The government used two instruments: the provisional measure on the Special Environmental License (LAE) and a bill with urgent status, which means Congress must review it quickly. After 45 days without a vote, it would block the legislative agenda. The new licensing law will take effect in 180 days.

The technical and legal review to prepare the vetoes and the alternative wording was meticulous. Both Ms. Belchior and Environment Minister Marina Silva emphasized that the text preserves the integrity of the licensing process, protects Indigenous and quilombola rights, ensures legal certainty, and incorporates innovations to make licensing faster — a recognition of some positive aspects of the bill that had passed Congress.

The government’s bill revised the License by Adhesion and Commitment (LAC), restricting it to low-impact projects only. As passed by the House, the LAC could have allowed high-risk projects — such as the dams in the Mariana and Brumadinho disasters — to be self-licensed by developers, with only random inspections by environmental agencies. “This was the biggest problem on the list,” says Ms. Araújo. “It would have been like pressing a button and having the license printed instantly.”

Another key change was the veto of provisions that would have allowed states and municipalities, without standardization, to set their own licensing criteria, such as project size and pollution potential. This would have encouraged an anti-environmental “race to the bottom” between states. The government also vetoed the article that would have stripped conservation agencies’ opinions of binding authority in projects affecting protected areas.

The government did not challenge agribusiness — nor was it expected to. Licensing exemptions for crop cultivation remain, except for medium- and large-scale intensive livestock operations. “A 20,000-hectare soybean or eucalyptus plantation is exempt,” notes Ms. Araújo, who also coordinates public policy at Observatório do Clima.

The “Alcolumbre Amendment”

In Ms. Araújo’s view, the sticking point is the provisional measure, which in practice modifies what became known as the “Alcolumbre Amendment,” named after Senate president Davi Alcolumbre (Brazil Union of Amapá). In May, he proposed the Special Environmental License (LAE) for projects deemed strategic by the government’s council, with a 12-month deadline for the process and a single-phase procedure — skipping the usual preliminary, installation, and operating licenses.

The reference to single-phase licensing was removed from the Executive’s version — a sign of internal negotiation, since infrastructure-linked ministries supported the original congressional text. “The LAE was a concession to Senator Alcolumbre, and the wording, even with the change, is still poor,” Ms. Araújo says. “In practice, it doesn’t include all three phases common to large hydro, road, or mining projects. The text says there may be stages, but only one license is issued — the LAE,” she stresses. “It’s still single-phase because it’s just one license.”

“In reality, this created a simplified license with a one-year deadline. That’s impossible — you can’t complete all the studies or have a project fully matured in that time,” she says. “In practice, the LAE remains the fast track that Senator Alcolumbre envisioned. In my view, the LAE shouldn’t exist at all. What could exist is a provision allowing the Government Council to list priority projects for review. Ibama already prioritizes projects flagged by the Civil House, whether or not they’re in the Growth Acceleration Program (PAC). But the government is now streamlining exactly the kinds of projects with major environmental impacts. This will trigger lawsuits. The provisional measure was the bargaining chip with Congress.”

At the press conference, the government sought to preempt criticism. “The LAE is an important innovation from Congress, and the government believes it should be preserved because it identifies strategic projects,” said Marcos Rogério de Souza, Special Legal Secretary at the Office of Chief of Staff. He insisted the licensing would not be single-phase. “And the 12 months are for completing the licensing process — it doesn’t mean the answer will be ‘yes,’” added Environment Minister Marina Silva.

The real knot in both the provisional measure and the bill is what Congress will do — it could overturn the vetoes in less than 45 days if it chooses. It’s unclear how much (or whether) the government has negotiated the text with the House and Senate. “There’s no guarantee the final outcome will be positive,” Ms. Araújo admits.

SYDNEY, Aug. 11, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Vast Renewables (“Vast” or the “Company”), a leading Australian clean energy technology company, today announced that it has secured new funding from existing shareholders and launched a capital raise to support the delivery of its flagship Port Augusta Green Energy Hub and growing international project pipeline. Vast also shared several major milestones for its flagship project, Vast Solar 1 (“VS1”), including environmental approvals and grid connection progress.

New investment secured and capital raise underway

Vast has entered into a termsheet for US$3.5 million of convertible notes from two of its largest and longest-standing investors, Nabors Industries and Canberra Airport Group. The financing is expected to close by the end of August. This continued backing reflects strong investor confidence in Vast’s differentiated technology and commercial readiness.

In parallel, Vast has launched a capital raise targeting leading institutional and strategic investors, with Rennie Advisory appointed to lead the process. Vast is also advancing a collaboration with a major player in the renewable energy sector with deep manufacturing capability and proven delivery of large-scale projects in comparable technologies. This partnership is focused on accelerating deployment of Vast’s technology in key global markets and unlocking additional commercial opportunities alongside the current project pipeline.

“The continued support from two of our long-term investors is a powerful endorsement of Vast’s technology and a strong vote of confidence in VS1,” said Craig Wood, CEO of Vast. “This new funding keeps us on track to break ground on VS1 later this year, while our broader capital raise will enable delivery of VS1 and accelerate the rollout of our global project pipeline.”

Port Augusta Green Energy Hub progressing towards construction

Located in South Australia, the Port Augusta Green Energy Hub will be home to a suite of integrated projects designed to deliver clean, dispatchable energy and enable decarbonisation of transport and industry:

VS1: A 30MW concentrated solar thermal plant with 8 hours of storage, VS1 has secured up to A$290 million in conditional Australian Government support, including a A$180 million ARENA grant. The project will deliver low-cost, low-carbon power on demand, and is on track for construction to begin later this year.

140MW / 2-hour lithium-ion battery: Developed in partnership with 1414 Degrees, this project provides critical storage and grid stability and is also on track to commence construction later this year.

South Australian Solar Fuels (SASF): A green fuels demonstration facility that aims to produce low-carbon hydrogen-derived fuels for aviation and shipping. With the pre-FEED stage now complete, MB Energy will conclude its involvement as the project progresses to FEED. Vast continues to lead development, supported by the award of A$700,000 in funding announced in March from the Australia-Singapore Low Emissions Technologies (ASLET) initiative for maritime and port operations.

Significant development milestones have been achieved across the Hub, including:

EPBC referral decision confirming the Hub is not a controlled action under national environmental law

Technical acceptance for VS1’s grid connection application

Generator Performance Standards approval for the battery energy storage system

By removing this cornerstone, Trump’s EPA is repudiating federal authority to limit greenhouse gases, our most powerful tool for fighting climate change.

The question isn’t whether we’ll eventually return to responsible climate policy — we will because we must.
She was counselor for energy and climate change during the Obama administration and wrote this for the Los Angeles Times.","President Donald Trump has been trying to eliminate climate regulations since his first day back in office, when he signed an executive order declaring the primacy of fossil fuels.

But his administration’s most radical step came last month, when the Environmental Protection Agency unveiled a proposal that would rescind its 2009 “endangerment finding” — the scientific conclusion that greenhouse gases contribute to global warming and harm human health and well-being.

This isn’t just another regulatory rollback. It’s an assault on the foundation of all federal climate policy.

The endangerment finding originally applied to vehicle emissions, but it also underpins every major federal climate rule in America: car and truck emissions standards, power plant regulations and limits on oil and gas facilities. By removing this cornerstone, Trump’s EPA is repudiating federal authority to limit greenhouse gases, our most powerful tool for fighting climate change.

The irony is that no industry asked for this step. Car makers need stable rules to compete globally. Power companies have invested billions in renewable energy, which regulatory uncertainty puts at risk. Even most oil and gas companies support a national approach to limiting methane. Companies may stay quiet to avoid crossing a vengeful administration, but they know climate change is real and that some federal regulation makes business sense.

As the federal government retreats, states such as California will try to fill the void. But Trump is trying to block them too, directing the Justice Department to challenge state climate policies.

The foundation the administration is attacking seemed unshakable. The Clean Air Act requires the EPA to regulate pollutants that endanger human health. In 2007, in Massachusetts vs. EPA, the Supreme Court ruled 5-4 that greenhouse gases are air pollutants, and that the endangerment decision must be based on science.

Two years later, after the EPA reviewed studies by the National Climate Assessment, the National Research Council and the U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, it found that greenhouse gases accumulating in the atmosphere are a danger, pointing to higher temperatures, worse air quality, extreme weather, spreading drought and more food- and water-borne pathogens. Following the process set out in the Clean Air Act, the agency then established national emission standards for the sources in each sector of the U.S. economy that contribute to this problem.

To unravel all of this, the Trump administration proposal offers a medley of strained legal and scientific arguments.

First, it claims that greenhouse gases are not pollutants because they have global, not local, effects. This argument is hard to square with the Supreme Court’s ruling, but they are trying it anyway. The proposal also asserts that U.S. emissions don’t contribute to harms from climate change because climate impacts are too remote and American emissions are too small a share of the global total to matter.

The proposal also folds policy objections into the scientific assessment, asserting that regulating greenhouse gases simply costs too much and accomplishes too little. But this muddles the issues. Whether climate change is harmful is a purely scientific assessment. How stringently to regulate is a separate question that must weigh both costs and benefits.

In all, the proposal’s scattershot justifications seem designed to offer the conservative supermajority on the Supreme Court — where the issue will likely land — a variety of ways to agree.

As EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin put it in announcing the proposal, the administration is “driving a dagger through the heart of climate change religion.” But climate change isn’t a religion — it’s physics and chemistry. And science doesn’t care about politics. We can’t solve climate change with regulation alone. But we certainly can’t solve it by pretending the problem doesn’t exist.

The administration’s assault on climate action won’t change the evidence or reality of climate change. As scientists have predicted, storms are growing more intense, heat waves more deadly, wildfires more destructive. We spend billions annually on disaster response while other countries surge ahead in clean-energy innovation and manufacturing. China now dominates solar panel and electric vehicle production; Europe leads in offshore wind.

The question isn’t whether we’ll eventually return to responsible climate policy — we will because we must. The question is how much time we’ll lose, and how much damage we’ll suffer, while politics masquerades as good policy.

On President Donald Trump's first day in office, he signed an executive order aiming to eliminate the ""electric vehicle mandate"" and remove subsidies that favor EVs. Since then, his administration has taken steps to do exactly that, while automakers are left figuring out the impact on their bottom lines.

Late last month, the Environmental Protection Agency proposed rescinding a landmark finding from 2009 establishing that greenhouse gases pose a threat to public health. The implication is that automakers would no longer be required to measure, control or report their greenhouse gas emissions.

That action follows the recent passage of Trump's tax and spending bill, under which the $7,500 tax credit for new EVs and $4,000 credit for used EVs that automakers had benefited from is set to end after Sept. 30.

The new legislation will also end a provision that U.S. EV makers such as Tesla and Rivian have relied on as a key revenue source. Typically, traditional automakers that sell gas-powered cars buy regulatory credits from EV makers to make up for the emissions that come from their tailpipes. Under the new law, however, automakers will no longer have any reason to buy the regulatory credits — marking a win for gas-guzzlers and a loss for EV makers.

As a result of this changing EV landscape, U.S. automakers are evaluating their product lineups and calculating the dollar impacts. Here's a roundup of what U.S. automakers have said on their latest earnings calls about the softer regulations.

Tesla

On Tesla's July 23 earnings call, CEO Elon Musk said that Tesla is in a ""weird transition period"" as it deals with losing EV incentives in the U.S.

""Does that mean like we could have a few rough quarters? Yeah, we probably could have a few rough quarters,"" he told analysts.

CFO Vaibhav Taneja said Tesla is focused on building and delivering as many vehicles as possible in the U.S. before the tax credits expire this fall. As a result of this renewed focus, the ramping of Tesla's lower-cost model will happen slower than expected next quarter, Taneja said.

Taneja added that while Tesla has never planned its business around selling regulatory credits to other automakers, it will see lower revenue as a result of those changes.

General Motors

CFO Paul Jacobson said on the company's July 22 earnings call that General Motors is anticipating headwinds to EV profitability as a result of the government removing incentives.

He said he expects a rush on EVs before the tax credits expire, but then slower demand after that. However, Jacobson said he expects the change in legislation to have a minimal impact on the automaker's 2025 results.

Despite the company touting its portfolio, electric vehicles make up a relatively small portion of GM's total vehicle sales — amounting to 46,300 for the second quarter compared with total vehicle sales of 974,000.

Jacobson said last month that GM has an ""inherent advantage"" over Tesla because it has more flexibility to adapt to changing EV demand through the diversity of its gas and electric offerings.

Ford Motor

Ford CEO Jim Farley said on the company's July 30 call with analysts that it has had to change its EV spending and capital allocation ""pretty massively"" as a result of softer regulations, including by moving out launches and canceling some products.

He said Ford is focused on offering a full range of hybrids across its lineup because of the reality of the EV market today.

""We think that's a much better move than a $60,000 to $70,000 all-electric crossover. We think that that's really what customers are going to want long term,"" he said of Ford's hybrid strategy.

CFO Sherry House added that as a result of tax credits going away, Ford could possibly pull back some of its EV production from the U.S. into other areas, such as leaning more heavily on Europe or moving into internal combustion engine products.

Rivian

Rivian does not expect to earn any revenue from regulatory tax credits for the rest of 2025, CFO Claire McDonough told analysts during its Tuesday call. As a result, the EV maker brought its outlook for regulatory credit sales down to $160 million for the rest of 2025, from its prior outlook of $300 million.

CEO RJ Scaringe added that the regulatory credit changes mark a short-term reduction in positive cash for Rivian.

However, he said that the changes could also mean less long-term competition in the EV space, considering that there will be fewer incentives for traditional manufacturers to make investments toward electrification.

""When we look at all those things together, there's of course some puts and some takes,"" Scaringe said.",https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/108114359-1741726191606-gettyimages-2203994817-AFP_36ZP7WX.jpeg?v=1742351374&w=1920&h=1080,N,,2025-08-11 10:02:50.615571

Northvolt had been seen as Europe’s best chance of creating its own auto battery manufacturing hub. This acquisition by Lyten could resurrect the continent’s potential to have a major automotive battery supplier within its economic bloc to service domestic automakers.

Northvolt fell on hard times and ultimately filed for bankruptcy due to the loss of key automaker contracts, as consumer demand for battery-electric vehicles slowed, and it faced increasing competition from cheaper cells supplied by Chinese manufacturers, such as CATL and BYD, who are the global leaders in automotive propulsion batteries.

In a company statement Lyten, which counts Stellantis and the U.S. delivery service FedEx as its financial backers, says it has acquired the rights to Northvolt’s energy storage products, Voltpack Mobile Systems (VMS), Voltrack and future Battery Energy Storage System (BESS) products currently in development.

It adds that this is its third Northvolt-related acquisition since November 2024, when it acquired Northvolt’s Cuberg battery manufacturing facility in California. Earlier in July, Lyten announced plans to acquire Northvolt Dwa, Europe’s largest BESS manufacturing facility, located in Gdansk, Poland, a deal it expects to close in the third quarter of 2025.

The deal is confirmed by Northvolt’s existing website, which states Lyten’s acquisition includes its other physical properties Northvolt Ett and Ett Expansion, at Skelleftea, Sweden; Northvolt Labs at Västeras, Sweden; and Northvolt Drei at Heide, Germany. Additionally, Lyten is acquiring all remaining Northvolt intellectual property.

Now the core members of Northvolt’s energy storage engineering team will be joining Lyten in Stockholm, Sweden, and VMS and future BESS products will be manufactured in the Polish facility.

In a statement, Northvolt's bankruptcy trustee, Mikael Kubu, says: “During the bankruptcy process, the risk of a complete shutdown was very real, which would have resulted in significant destruction of value.”

Lyten, a Silicon Valley startup established in 2015, employs lithium-sulfur battery chemistry claiming to be environmentally cleaner than the traditional and widespread lithium-ion battery chemistry of nickel manganese cobalt (NMC).

The company is benefiting from securing more than $200 million in additional equity investment from backers, bringing total investments into its operations of more than $625 million.

It says it intends to raise additional capital to accelerate an acquisition strategy and expansion plans in both the U.S. and Europe.

Dan Cook, Lyten CEO and co-founder, says in a statement that the moves are driven by a desire by both companies and governments in the West for energy independence from Chinese battery supply chains.

“Drones, defense, data centers and BESS are all markets seeking battery solutions independent of Chinese supply chains,” he explains, adding, “This capital is focused on rapid, capital-efficient expansion of manufacturing and onboarding world-leading talent in both the U.S. and European markets.”",https://eu-images.contentstack.com/v3/assets/blt7121b6ec5c11097b/bltd743298214f849a4/68966cc2ffce793a6804394a/Lyten_battery_download.jpg?disable=upscale&width=1200&height=630&fit=crop,N,,2025-08-11 11:04:24.115392

Tata’s Agratas To Add 60GWh Battery Capacity By FY27

Powering Tata’s EV plans, Agratas to build 60GWh battery capacity in the UK and India.

Agratas plans to establish 60GWh of production capacity across two gigafactories in the UK and India. The facilities will primarily supply Jaguar Land Rover and Tata Motors, marking a step in the group’s electric mobility strategy.

The UK site in Somerset, announced in 2024, will have a capacity of 40GWh, while the Sanand, Gujarat plant will add another 20GWh. The Indian facility is expected to begin production by December 2026, with both plants scheduled to commence phased operations from FY27. The projects are supported by dedicated R&D centres in Bengaluru and Oxford.

The capacity expansion aligns with Tata Sons’ broader diversification under chairman N. Chandrasekaran, who has steered the conglomerate into new sectors including aviation, semiconductors, digital commerce, and high-quality battery manufacturing. Funding for these ventures has come from dividends, share buybacks, and partial stake sales in Tata Consultancy Services.

The global electric vehicle market is witnessing capacity growth, with the 2024 EV fleet alone requiring an estimated 864GWh of batteries. Agratas’ initiative positions India to play a larger role in this supply chain, reducing import dependency and bolstering domestic EV adoption.

The move also comes amid rising competition in the battery sector. Japanese-founded AESC, now owned by China’s Envision, operates 10 gigafactories worldwide and counts major automakers like BMW, Mercedes-Benz, Renault, Nissan, Honda, Mazda, and Mitsubishi among its clients. With over 12GWh of current capacity and a target of 80GWh by 2030, AESC exemplifies the scale and global partnerships Agratas will compete against.

By building integrated capacity and leveraging captive demand, Agratas aims to establish itself as a key player in the global battery market, while contributing to India’s transition toward sustainable mobility.

Under the new initiative, Cornerstone will act as the hub for open access to the US Environmentally-Extended Input-Output model (USEEIO), the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) model for carbon accounting, and for Watershed’s global carbon accounting model, the Comprehensive Environmental Data Archive (CEDA).

According to Watershed, USEEIO and CEDA are two most widely used models for value chain, or Scope 3, carbon accounting and for policy research, citing CDP data indicating that the models are used to calculate around 65% of Scope 3 corporate carbon measurements globally.

Cornerstone will include former EPA lead and architect of the USEEIO model Dr. Wesley Ingwersen as Technical Director. Ingwersen was let go from the EPA in July after signing a letter asking Administrator Lee Zeldin to reconsider the new direction of the agency. The agency has subsequently reportedly announced that it will no longer update the database.

Other leaders of the initiative will include Dr. Sangwon Suh, Head of Science at Watershed and developer of CEDA, and Dr. Steve Davis, Professor at the Stanford Doerr School of Sustainability, as Technical Advisors.

CEDA was created by environmental database provider VitalMetrics, which Watershed acquired in 2023. Earlier this year, Watershed launched an open and free version of CEDA in a move aimed at enabling organizations and companies to make more accurate decarbonization decisions.

Under the new initiative, USEEIO and CEDA will merge into a single global open multi-regional input output model managed by Cornerstone in the coming months, providing a new model aimed at driving significant improvements in Scope 3 measurement, as well as expanding beyond greenhouse gas emissions to assess regional air and water quality, water use, and waste generation. The Stanford Sustainability Lab will lead research applying the model to identify and prioritize solutions to pressing sustainability challenges in energy and food systems, in addition to supporting ongoing model development. Watershed added that Cornerstone will onboard additional open source contributors over time.

“We had a [Chevrolet] Silverado EV for sale, which is my new second-favorite EV,” Riggin said.
“New EV sales might struggle without the tax credit, at least until they adjust their pricing,” Riggin said.
“A lot of new EV trucks are still $80,000 to $100,000,” Riggin said.
The company cited tariff costs and the impending end of the EV tax credit.","Collin Riggin thinks Elon Musk should stay in his lane — building electric vehicles — without swerving into politics.

Riggin is a veteran car dealer and owner-partner of Evolve Auto, the state’s only exclusive used EV dealer. He added several brands beyond Tesla to his lineup after Musk embraced Donald Trump as a big donor and eventually, if briefly, joined the president’s administration.

“I’m an Elon fan, but I don’t like him in politics at all,” Riggin told Arkansas Business just after showing a photographer around his dealership on Broadway in North Little Rock. “We started opening up to some other brands of cars, because some clientele were not happy with it at the time.”

So while Evolve is still mainly selling previously owned Teslas, and bucking a nationwide trend by doubling and tripling its numbers, Riggin has also been dealing Chevy Bolts, Nissan LEAFs, Hyundai Ioniqs and a couple of Rivian all-electric SUVs.

“We had a [Chevrolet] Silverado EV for sale, which is my new second-favorite EV,” Riggin said.

And as Tesla deliveries of new vehicles continue a decline worldwide and in the United States, Evolve has been racking up impressive numbers. It’s on track to sell 300 EVs this year, mostly Teslas, Riggin said.

“I can tell you, we doubled sales in ’23, doubled sales in ’24, and we’re at approximately 180% year-over-year right now.”

He said the dealership now has about 40 EVs on the lot, “with more on the way.”

By the Numbers

At a time when tax credits for EVs are within six weeks of expiring and the gas-free autos face a hostile administration, Arkansans are bucking the trend. State registration figures show the surge.

In 2020, Arkansans registered just 1,300 fully electric vehicles and 18,242 hybrids. By 2024, those numbers were nearly 7,000 EVs and 41,652 hybrids. The trend accelerated again in the first half of this year, with more than 60,000 EVs and hybrids registered to drive the state’s roadways. EVs are most popular in northwest Arkansas and the Little Rock area. Benton, Washington and Pulaski counties tallied 47% of all EV registrations.

Scott Hardin, a spokesman for the Arkansas Department of Finance & Administration, said that the year-over-year increase for EVs and hybrids was 24.3%, and that the number of fully electric vehicles, 9,214, was up more than 35% from June 30, 2024.

And Riggin and Joel Spencer, president of the Tesla Owners Club of Arkansas, believe that the end of the federal Clean Vehicle Credit may bring EV prices down and thus eventually boost sales.

The EV tax credit, worth up to $7,500 for qualifying buyers of new vehicles and $4,000 for those buying used, will expire on Sept. 30. The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 ushered in the credits, and Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act of 2025 is ushering them out.

“Frankly, I’m not sad about that,” Riggin said.

“I want people to drive demand with their own buying power, so I don’t really believe in tax credits. But I also don’t believe we should be charged an annual fee to drive an EV.”

That was in reference to the bigger registration fee Arkansas and many other states impose on EV owners. The state charges fully electric vehicle owners $200 on top of the standard registration fee, as well as $100 for plug-in hybrids and $50 for standard hybrids.

The added fees were imposed, officials said, to offset lost revenue from fuel taxes that pay for road and highway improvements.

A Pricing Adjustment?

“New EV sales might struggle without the tax credit, at least until they adjust their pricing,” Riggin said. “A lot of newer EVs are still at the inflated prices you saw during COVID. They never came back down because of the tax credits.”

Prices of new Teslas run from about $42,000 on average to more than $125,000, based on model and options. “A lot of new EV trucks are still $80,000 to $100,000,” Riggin said. “It doesn’t entice many people to switch over.”

Spencer, the Tesla club leader and host of “The EV Geek” podcast, agreed.

“We may see sales decrease, but I think over the long run the price of vehicles could come down, and then we may see sales pick back up,” Spencer said. His family has a 2020 Tesla Model Y and a 2022 Kia EV6. “A lot of people who buy EVs may not even qualify for the credit.”

Spencer was instrumental in getting a dedicated Tesla Service Center in the works for North Little Rock. The service center is set to open on 3-acres at 5045 Warden Road. WRAMR Properties LLC, led by Alan Reuber, sold the site in May to 5045 Warden Rd. LLC for $5.1 million. Tesla owners now have to go to Memphis for dedicated service.

Spencer said freedom from the gas pump sold him on EVs, though he noted that many buyers appreciate their ecological friendliness and the simple allure of new, cutting-edge technology.

“Before, I was driving a truck to take my kids to and from school,” said Spencer, an educator. “It would cost me, I’d say, $300 a month. Compare that to charging at home, which costs me $70 a month. So for me it was the cost of fuel versus the cost of electricity.”

Riggin said his customers run the gamut, with some seeking low payments, some a tax credit, and others simply looking for a newer, modern vehicle without paying new car premiums.

“But I can easily say that most people come here looking for something that’s new and cool to drive, or they’re looking for the fuel savings.”

Global Headwinds

Sales in Arkansas have climbed even despite headwinds against Tesla worldwide.

In late July, the company reported a 16% decrease in automotive revenue and declining sales for a second straight quarter. Its auto revenue of $16.7 billion was off from $19.9 billion in the same quarter last year.

The company cited tariff costs and the impending end of the EV tax credit.

Musk said the company “probably could have a few” rough quarters. “I am not saying that we will, but we could,” he said.

Last month, Tesla said quarterly vehicle deliveries had slipped 14% year over year to 384,000 autos. Analysts noted consumer backlash after Musk donated heavily to the Trump campaign last year and then made controversial budget decisions as chief of the president’s Department of Government Efficiency.

But Riggin expects the brand to bounce back. The cars are exciting, fast out of the block and can drive themselves, “which is a blast,” he said.

Evolve sees many repeat customers, Riggin noted. “Some come back and upgrade to a little bigger EV. Some come back to get a vehicle for their spouse. But very few say they did not like the EV experience and want to go back to a gas car. And when I say very few, I mean less than 1 out of 10.”",https://arkansasbusiness.wppcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/EvolveAuto4.jpg,N,,2025-08-11 11:04:36.659158

Of course, the EPA workers who remain are still fighting the good fight every day for the health of our communities.
The Great Lakes will be dirtier and less able to support the recreation we enjoy all summer.","My desk is on the 15th floor of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Region 5 office in downtown Chicago, the same floor as the Ground Water & Drinking Water Branch. Today, I am president of the American Federation of Government Employees Local 704, the union representing 1,000 EPA workers across the Midwest, but I’ve worked as an attorney at the EPA for over 30 years. It’s hard not to notice the many empty desks — a visual representation of the glaring staff vacancies since Elon Musk took a machete to the federal workforce earlier this year.

Now, the experts in charge of oversight for drinking water programs in Illinois, Michigan and Minnesota are no longer on duty at Region 5, putting more than half of the population we serve at risk and leaving communities without the help they need to keep their drinking water safe.

Under the Trump administration, the EPA has lost more than 25% of its workforce through a combination of layoffs and voluntary separation incentives, including deferred resignation and early retirement offers. EPA Region 5, which covers the Great Lakes and six states, is now at its lowest staffing point since the Reagan administration, despite a massive increase in gross domestic product and a U.S. population growth of over 100 million people since that time. The effects aren’t just visible on the 15th floor of our building. This impacts the air, land and drinking water for millions across the Great Lakes region.

Since Jan. 20, 2025, the air enforcement group in Region 5 has lost at least 12 enforcers, about one-third of the staff whose job it is to enforce the Clean Air Act. Fewer enforcement actions are being taken by Region 5 this year than in any of the previous 10 years of the division’s existence. Cuts to air enforcement means more air pollution in the Great Lakes, causing reduced lung function, exacerbation of asthma, heart failure and premature death.

The purported DOGE priority of “efficiency” has ground to a halt at th EPA in recent months. Region 5 has lost over 30 attorneys since Donald Trump was elected, more than one-third of its legal office. EPA leadership has hired no one to replace them. Despite the heroic efforts of the very best environmental lawyers around, Region 5’s capacity to implement protections for human health has been wiped out.

The short staffing is only further exacerbated by the EPA’s sidelining of 40 Region 5 employees because they signed a letter of dissent calling out EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin’s refusal to protect the American people from toxic air and water. Those signing the letter have been placed on leave for over a month now, and the EPA has announced that they will not be put back to work until at least Aug. 18.

This hamstringing of our agency is severely damaging and puts millions of Americans in real danger. Less staff to do the work means delays. Delays mean lapses in protecting breathable air and drinkable water for the American people. As work piles up over time, without the staff to handle it, each program is forced to triage their vital responsibilities. And triaging leaves no time for addressing those emerging environmental threats, like microplastics, endocrine disrupters, and forever chemicals like per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS).

Of course, the EPA workers who remain are still fighting the good fight every day for the health of our communities. But fewer scientists and engineers working to curb toxic discharges by industries means more profits for polluters and more health problems for us. The Great Lakes will be dirtier and less able to support the recreation we enjoy all summer.

All those who care about the Great Lakes should demand that the EPA is fully funded and staffed — or else your future will be in the hands of polluting industries all too willing to trade your health for higher quarterly earnings.",https://s3-rd-prod.chicagobusiness.com/styles/1200x630/s3/skyline_brad_knight_unsplash.jpg,N,,2025-08-11 10:02:59.861189

“I hate to use the word unprecedented again, but this really is an unprecedented attack on all of climate action and on climate science,"" she said.","In late July, the Trump administration said it wanted to repeal the ""endangerment finding,"" a federal rule that let the government regulate climate change pollution.

Repealing the rule, experts say, would threaten public health and worsen the conditions leading to changes in the climate.

Arizona has its own limits on regulating greenhouse gasses, so experts say the state would feel ill effects from the repeal of the federal rule.

The chance to limit how quickly and dramatically the forces of climate change intensify heat waves, drought and wildfires hinges on the ability to contain the greenhouse gas emissions that are driving those shifts.

A new proposal from the Trump administration to repeal the 2009 ""endangerment finding"" that recognized these heat-trapping emissions as harmful pollution — establishing the framework for the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to set maximums on their release from various sectors burning fossil fuels — now seeks to undermine that at its core.

In America's hottest big city and one of its driest and least regulated states, erasing this federal control could have deadly and costly consequences.

Extreme heat in Arizona has already been tied to around 1,000 deaths and millions in lost worker productivity in recent years. And though it's always been hot here, temperatures are clearly on the rise. On Aug. 7, Phoenix hit 118 degrees, the hottest high logged during August in 120 years. Scientists attribute the spikes, in part, to more heat energy in the atmosphere destabilizing monsoon activity, which often offers some late summer relief.

Raging wildfires, like the one that consumed the Grand Canyon's North Rim in July and is one of the largest in state history, have also increased in frequency and intensity as a result of atmospheric climate change. And as the state with the most tenuous claims to the Colorado River, worsening climate-related drought amid rapid population growth has been a persistent concern for Arizona's residents, farmers and leaders.

The science on all of that has long been settled among a vast majority of scientists internationally, with hundreds or thousands collaborating every few years to assemble the United States' National Climate Assessments and the United Nations' Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change reports.

The peer-review process these reports follow of reaching a majority consensus on how to interpret data and results, which is the foundation of the scientific method that produced much of the technology and medical advances humans rely on today, has been especially robust when it comes to how a climate warmed by greenhouse gases is altering possibilities for life on Earth.

“The people who think that climate change is not a big deal, they get to speak. They’re part of these assessments. Their papers are included, because that’s the way science works,"" said Diane Pataki, who leads the science team at the National Wildlife Federation on leave from her post as a climate science professor at Arizona State University. ""People understand that science is a social process and it shouldn’t be based on the opinions of one person.""

Because of all this, Pataki and a legion of other climate researchers balked when five scientists with extreme viewpoints became the Trump administration's spokespeople in an attempt launched July 29 to overturn the endangerment finding.

Climatologist Zeke Hausfather, for example, broke from a family vacation to write a blog post ""to address how my work was used and misused"" in the proposed rule repeal as well as in a new report from the Department of Energy questioning the influence of greenhouse gases on climate impacts.

The Trump team's new proposal, Hausfather wrote, incorrectly used a more recent date as the baseline for temperature comparison than is referenced in his research, making the warming seem less dramatic. They also misquoted text from a 2019 paper of his and misinterpreted a supplementary graph in the DOE report, casting exaggerated doubt on past climate models.

Social media flooded last week with similar critiques of the Trump administration's anti-science approach.

These attacks on science matter, Pataki told The Arizona Republic, because the endangerment finding is what gives the federal government authority to regulate greenhouse gases as pollutants under the Clean Air Act, by strongly concluding that these climate-warming emissions ""threaten the public health and welfare of current and future generations.""

The EPA was established in 1970 by Republican President Richard Nixon to protect human health by addressing exactly these types of harms from unregulated industry. Upending this mission also casts U.S. business and research communities structured around it into chaos.

“The precedent that this sets, where decisions like this can be completely overturned from one administration to another, is terrible,"" Pataki said. ""How can we have any stability? Our economy is based on stability and science.""

Arizonans will feel the heat from this regulatory change

As the state at the forefront of some of the most extreme climate impacts, as well as the solutions being generated by the clean energy industry, experts say Arizona and Arizonans stand to suffer more than most.

In July 2022, when a Supreme Court decision reduced the EPA's authority to regulate greenhouse gas emissions from power plants, environmentalists worried it could demotivate a predicted shift to solar development in the state. The very next month, the passage of former President Joe Biden's Inflation Reduction Act, which included billions in incentives for clean energy development, breathed new life into the industry.

Arizona has since welcomed billions of investments capitalizing on its abundant, free sunshine, which also brought in thousands of new, local jobs. Then Trump took office again and implemented deep cuts to these programs.

In early July, The Arizona Republic reported that an estimated 100,000 jobs were on the line if clean energy tax cuts in Trump's massive policy bill passed as proposed. But out of 35 companies invested in clean energy technology in the state, The Republic found that only one was willing to speak out about how they intended to handle the changes and limited ability to plan.

If the next step is to undo the finding that greenhouse gas emissions like carbon dioxide are a climate problem warranting regulation, that could shake the business foundations of companies like CarbonCapture Inc., which secured a lease for a manufacturing facility in Mesa in June 2024 that had been projected to support 400 new jobs by 2029 and aimed to scale up direct air capture as a climate solution.

CarbonCapture Inc. declined a request from The Republic to comment for this story.

At a minimum, said University of Arizona law professor and climate policy expert Stephanie Stern, this proposal and the uncertainty may ""cause a general souring"" or doubt about investing in solar or other clean energy technologies.

“Industries gain a certain amount of momentum economically or socially,"" she said. ""I think this is very strategic, to undermine investments in the environment and also change norms in a different direction. Businesses hate rapid change because they need to plan and develop products and run their operations. It’s difficult to turn on a dime.""

More carbon emissions from tailpipes and smokestacks in Arizona's air will also likely have expensive and life-altering health impacts, particularly in a state already dealing with dangerous air quality.

“We know that air pollution and air quality can impact our lungs and definitely our health,"" said JoAnna Strother, the Southwest region's senior director of advocacy for the American Lung Association. ""So with what the EPA and this administration is considering in terms of the endangerment finding, we’re definitely concerned.”

The American Lung Association gave Maricopa County a failing grade on its ozone and particle pollution levels in its 2025 State of the Air report. Both are related to greenhouse gas emissions from vehicles and electricity generation and have been tied to rates of asthma, lung cancer and cardiovascular disease that drive up health care costs and drive down local quality of life.

“One reason we struggle in Maricopa County is that we haven’t acted on our air pollution burden,"" Strother said. ""In the past decade, we have not put in or strengthened laws or regulations that would protect our health. So it’s built up on us now. And climate change is going to make it harder, with the smoke from more catastrophic wildfires and our extreme heat playing a role with ozone formation. And that is because we didn’t act sooner.""

Arizona's failure to pass laws protecting air quality and environmental health may become more damaging if the Trump proposal forces the EPA to step back. A review last year by The Republic found that, out of 25 bills introduced in the Arizona Legislature with the support of environmentalists in 2023 and 2024, only one became law.

Other bills that have passed move the state further away from climate action. A 2010 law restricting the Arizona Department of Environmental Quality and other agencies from measuring or setting limits on greenhouse gas emissions has presented challenges for Phoenix officials attempting to reach local emissions reduction goals and for broader efforts to improve air quality, reduce fossil fuel reliance and address climate change across the state.

But since 2009, EPA regulations have provided a backstop to rampant climate-related pollution in some of these cases, thanks to the endangerment finding the Trump administration is now seeking to repeal.

“Our state regulations are not directly affected, but the federal regulations have typically been more robust in this area,"" Stern said.

“For us in Arizona, this is a big deal because we rely on federal laws to provide the floor for action,"" agreed Sandy Bahr, director of the Grand Canyon chapter of the Sierra Club. ""If this holds up, it’s a really bad indication, both that we won’t be able to do as much but also with what is happening to us in Arizona with the heat and fires becoming more unpredictable. At what point does it become unlivable for people, especially because of the cost?""

The legal battle ahead, between ideology and science

None of this is likely to happen quickly or without legal challenges, said Stern, the law professor.

“I certainly think it could go through, but it won’t happen overnight. The endangerment was passed 15 years ago through a rulemaking, which has a lot of procedures that are required,"" she said. ""So to just reverse the finding will require a fair amount of legal process. Then, of course, there will inevitably be court challenges to it.""

That process alone is likely to be costly for taxpayers. And though the Trump administration has 90 days to reach a decision from its Aug. 1 notice of intent, there are some important deadlines coming up.

On Aug. 19 and 20, the EPA will hold a virtual meeting to hear testimony from the public. Those interested in attending must register by sending an email to EPA-MobileSource-Hearings@epa.gov. Anyone wanting to testify or request special accommodations should do so by Aug. 12.

""I want to stress this is just a proposal, and the public still has an opportunity to weigh in,"" Strother said. ""We encourage everyone to take part in the public comment process and tell the EPA not to finalize these harmful rollbacks.”

Pataki, the ASU climate scientist working with the National Wildlife Federation, also encourages Arizonans to contact their elected representatives directly, and soon.

""It’s critical for Congress to exert the oversight function of the legislative branch,"" she wrote to The Republic. ""Let your representatives know how deregulating GHGs affects Arizonans and the rising threat of deadly heat.""

It's not only Arizona's air pollution or the related health consequences, or its heat or wildfires or drought, or the future of a local clean energy industry that is at stake, all experts agreed. This issue is also about living in a society that is built on a basic trust and investment in science.

With its proposal to repeal the EPA endangerment finding — which Pataki said reads nothing like a normal scientific report but is instead riddled with ideological interpretations — the Trump administration is rewriting how scientific information is presented, how a consensus in science is formed and blurring the lines between fact and opinion.

“There’s the truth in terms of things we can measure like temperature. So some things are factual or they can be empirically tested,"" she said. ""Then there are things that are value judgments, like that climate change is happening, but it’s not that important. Once you blend those things together, you don’t know what the truth is.""

Taxpayer-funded climate data and reports have been disappearing from federal websites since January. Trump also paused future versions of the National Climate Assessment, which Arizona scientists have volunteered their time to help produce. And on Aug. 7, his energy secretary, Chris Wright, told CNN they would be ""updating"" previously published government climate reports, saying “they weren’t fair in broad-based assessments of climate change.”

Bahr of the Sierra Club has read those reports, which were fair in their assessments according to the hundreds of scientists who wrote them. Removing them from the public domain doesn't change the tangible impacts Americans, and especially Arizonans, are seeing and feeling related to climate change, she said. But it is concerning.

“I hate to use the word unprecedented again, but this really is an unprecedented attack on all of climate action and on climate science,"" she said. ""It’s not like they’re just saying it's going to cost too much. They’re saying that it’s not real. That it’s not that big of a deal. They’re just throwing the science out the window and putting out slack and using that as the underpinning for rescinding this foundation for all of the EPA action on climate.""

In the end, the people and wild places hurt most by this will likely be the elderly struggling to pay rising utility bills on fixed incomes, the communities on the frontlines of climate impacts, the wildlife fleeing out-of-control megafires and the youth whose futures depend on elected adults using the tools of science to protect a livable planet.

“Overturning the endangerment finding would go against decades of scientific consensus and put polluters ahead of the health of children, seniors and communities,” Strother said.

The Environmental Protection Agency award is one of dozens of federal grants to Maine research institutions that have been cancelled or paused as the Trump administration cracks down on what it sees as wasteful spending. This includes cuts targeting environmental justice initiatives and climate change research.

The UMaine project, which was in its second year of a Science to Achieve Results award, had pulled together more than 100 people from the Wabanaki Nations and rural communities throughout Maine to discuss local renewable energy goals and pathways to reach them.

Over $900,000 of the award was unused at the time of the cancellation, according to project lead and University of Maine professor Sharon Klein.

“We’ve been really smart with our money,” Klein said. “It was definitely a big blow to get the termination because we felt like we were… kind of just hitting our stride.”

The grant was briefly reinstated on June 5 — only to be revoked again four days later.

“There was no explanation for anything,” Klein said. “You just get these emails. So they’re like, ‘It’s terminated,’ ‘Nope, it’s back,’ ‘Nope, it’s terminated again.’”

The EPA did not respond to a request for comment by publication.

Without that funding, Klein fears that some renewable energy projects in rural and Indigenous communities may never get off the ground. Local opposition to solar and wind projects is common, and the development process is burdensome. She’s still meeting with community members and advising them on grant applications, but she’s spread thin.

“We risk communities being unprepared for the disasters that are coming for them with climate change, because they haven’t had the capacity to… prepare,” Klein said.

While much of the initiative’s efforts have been curtailed by the grant cancellation, one of the positions it funded has been salvaged by a grant from the Maine state government: the coordinator for climate and energy resilience projects with the Wabanaki Nations.

The coordinator, Kelsey Flores, continues to support the first update to the Penobscot Nation’s strategic energy plan in 20 years, training of new technicians to install energy-efficient appliances, and recently secured $15,000 for emergency preparedness kits for households.

Though the swift rescission of the STAR grant caused the cancellation of emerging energy projects, Flores says there’s still hope to bring electric heat pumps, solar and other projects to Wabanaki communities.

The grant cancellation “is affecting almost every initiative that we have,” Flores said, “and we really are trying to restructure things so that we can still move forward.”

The University of Maine isn’t the only research institution that has seen cuts to federally funded climate change initiatives.

Down the coast in Portland, the nonprofit Gulf of Maine Research Institute has had $4 million in federal awards paused or terminated since February, according to the organization’s chief scientific officer Janet Duffy-Anderson.

Federal funding supports between 40 and 50 percent of the institute’s budget, and abrupt changes this spring meant interruptions to long-term climate research projects that require consistent data collection.

One of the early casualties involved the institute’s “energy solutions” program, said Dave Reidmiller, the nonprofit’s chief impact officer. That included an initiative to understand concerns lobster and groundfish fishermen might have with the development of offshore wind projects.

The program received two federal awards — one from the EPA, another from the Department of Energy. Both awards were frozen after Trump took office, halting GMRI’s engagement work with the fishing industry. The DOE grant was restored months later, but the EPA grant was terminated.

“They were really intended to elevate the interests and concerns of the fishing industry in the offshore wind development process,” said Reidmiller. “A core piece of that was making sure that the best available science and technical information was in their hands to weigh in in an informed manner with the federal decision makers.”

In addition to the stop-and-go pauses and termination of existing awards, research institutions across the country have been grappling with a longer review process that federal agencies are now instituting before releasing funds.

This includes funding from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, where awards over $100,000 have to be reviewed and approved by the head of the U.S. Commerce Department, Axios reported in April.

Any funding pauses could interrupt the institute’s ongoing monitoring of ocean conditions and the effects of climate change, according to Duffy-Anderson. Such interruptions cause mariners to lose access to buoy data that informs how they navigate the ocean, and could diminish the accuracy of GMRI’s long-term forecasts and projections.

“Not only are your weather forecasts going to be probably less skillful and less accurate, but the model forecast for the longer term (models) are going to be inhibited as well,” said Reidmiller. “So it’s a real disservice to anybody who cares about the weather.”

Researchers are concerned about what these changes and the Trump administration’s proposed budget cuts suggest for federal funding opportunities going forward, including at other nonprofit research outfits like the Downeast Institute.

“NOAA in general funds so many important programs across the nation and we hope that funding will continue to flow,” said Kyle Pepperman, associate director of the Downeast Institute. “We are worried but we are also very diversified so we should be able to weather this storm.”

Duffy-Anderson with GMRI was blunt about the impacts reduced funding opportunities would have on her institution and beyond. GMRI is part of a broader research ecosystem that is studying the impacts of climate change along Maine’s coast.

Epoch AI is committed to grounding public discourse on AI in robust empirical evidence, by making its findings widely accessible through reports, models, and visualizations.","PALO ALTO, Calif. and BERKELEY, Calif., Aug. 11, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence—particularly the training of large-scale models that are used to power many of today's widely used applications—is driving renewed growth in electricity demand. A new report released today from EPRI and Epoch AI forecasts that training a leading model could require more than 4 gigawatts (GW) of power by 2030—enough to power millions of U.S. homes.

The training of large-scale AI models has historically required large, localized power supply. Despite rapid efficiency gains, the power demands of training a leading model have more than doubled every year for the past decade, according to the report. AI companies have found that increasing model size and complexity can provide better performance, which in turn drives the need for additional compute and electrical power. The report finds that the AI industry will likely continue to scale up its models in the coming years, despite recent computational efficiency breakthroughs.

Overall power demand for AI extends well beyond large-scale training. Significant power capacity will be allocated towards the deployment of AI to serve users, as well as training smaller models and conducting AI research. Total AI power capacity in the U.S. is estimated at around 5 GW today and could reach more than 50 GW by 2030—matching the total global demand from data centers today and comprising a rapidly growing share of overall data center power demands.

""The energy demands of training cutting-edge AI models are doubling annually, soon rivaling the output of the largest nuclear power plants,"" said Jaime Sevilla, director of Epoch AI. ""This report offers a rigorous, data-driven look at these trends and where they're headed. Epoch AI will continue investigating the energy demand of AI and related topics.""

""AI applications are becoming prevalent in our daily lives and will likely play a key role in the energy system of the future,"" said EPRI President and CEO Arshad Mansoor. ""To meet these rising energy demands, data center developers and power providers are embracing innovative solutions in a build-to-balance approach. Building new infrastructure along with balancing through flexibility in data center design will be critical to accelerate grid connections, while minimizing costs and enhancing system reliability,"" he added.

EPRI launched the DCFlex collaborative last year to demonstrate the technologies, policies, and tools to make data center flexibility a reality. Data center flexibility, including geographically distributed training data centers, could transform data centers from passive customers to grid assets to improve reliability, lower costs, and speed connection. The effort, which brings together over 45 companies, including founding members Google, Meta, NVIDIA, and various utilities, recently launched its first real-world field demonstrations in Lenoir, N.C., Phoenix, Ariz., and Paris, France.

The advanced manufacturing facility will comprise just a portion of the property.
“Today, those attributes provide a differentiated foundation for advanced manufacturing and critical-technology operations,” Pivotal Partners said.
This has a lower melting temperature than traditional methods, which enables the process to require less energy, Highland said.
Pivotal Manufacturing Partners is a real estate investment platform built to support the rapidly growing reshoring trend in U.S. advanced manufacturing and critical technologies.","Pivotal Manufacturing acquired 140 acres of land where a scandal-ridden nuclear plant was abandoned 40% into construction and more than $2.6 billion in debt, and instead, executed a long-term ground lease with Highland Materials for a polysilicon advanced manufacturing facility and a campus of other energy endeavors.

According to the Department of Energy (DOE), Highland’s manufacturing facility will have an initial annual capacity of 16,000 metric tons of solar-grade polysilicon at “less than standard cost.” At full capacity, DOE said the facility will produce 20,000 metric tons after four years, which is the equivalent of 11 GW of solar cells.

Much of the critical infrastructure, such as a high-voltage interconnect, flexible zoning and a development-friendly permitting environment are heirlooms of an incomplete nuclear power facility that amassed more than $2.6 billion and was just 40% complete when it was canceled.

U.S.-based Highland Materials, a purified polysilicon, and aluminum and silicon alloy manufacturer, said it is developing a next-generation production platform designed to meet rising domestic and international demand for such critical technologies.

In April 2024, Highland announced it secured $255.6 million in Qualifying Advanced Energy Project Credit (48C) tax credits to build a polysilicon plant in the United States.

The IRA expanded the 48C credits to provide an additional credit allocation of $10 billion, with $4 billion set aside for projects in designated energy communities. The 48C credit is an tax credit of up to 30% of qualified investments for qualifying projects, provided they meet prevailing wage and apprenticeship requirements.

When it awarded the tax credits, DOE said Highland was working closely with Northeast State Community College to develop and implement workforce development including Department of Labor-certified apprenticeship programs, along with other community support programs.

Highland said it chose Phipps Bend for its exceptional power infrastructure, strategic location within the TVA region, and development-ready environment capable of supporting large-scale, high-precision manufacturing.

Pivotal and Highland said they are working closely with local, regional, and federal stakeholders — including Hawkins County, the Tennessee Valley Authority, Holston Electric Cooperative, and the State of Tennessee — to deliver infrastructure, incentives, and economic development to support both near-term and long-term phases of the campus. The project will provide over 400 high-paying full-time manufacturing jobs, according to Highland.

The advanced manufacturing facility will comprise just a portion of the property. The 140-acre site, “The Phipps Bend Advanced Manufacturing & Technology Campus” is planned to be a heavy-infrastructure location for operators who require high-power infrastructure and scale, Pivotal Partners said.

The campus has direct on-site access to a regional transmission interconnect owned by the Tennessee Valley Authority, a federally owned electric utility corporation.

Much of the critical infrastructure, such as a high-voltage interconnect, flexible zoning and a development-friendly permitting environment are heirlooms of an incomplete nuclear power facility that amassed more than $2.6 billion to reach just 40% of its construction when it was canceled.

While no reactors were ever brought online, Pivotal Partners said the site retains a “powerful legacy”: significant utility infrastructure, a strategic location within the TVA transmission network and a regional development mindset rooted in energy-intensive industry. “Today, those attributes provide a differentiated foundation for advanced manufacturing and critical-technology operations,” Pivotal Partners said.

Highland said its energy-efficient process “has a much smaller footprint than that of other silicon manufacturing methods and a much lower power consumption per kg produced.” Its process can produce one kilogram of silicon with 20 to 40 kWh per kilogram, according to Highland.

The plant will use a scaled-up version of an aluminum-silicon alloy system that smelts the impure raw silicon with pure aluminum. This has a lower melting temperature than traditional methods, which enables the process to require less energy, Highland said.

The land first began to be put to use for renewable energy in 2017 when United Renewable Energy installed a 1 MW solar project beside the towers of nuclear project’s 35-year-old concrete ruins.

Pivotal Manufacturing Partners is a real estate investment platform built to support the rapidly growing reshoring trend in U.S. advanced manufacturing and critical technologies.

“Lower unit losses in Europe, fewer US sales, peak Gen2 (skunkwork) investment and more competitive models all point to lower unit losses,” he wrote.
Ford is scheduled to reveal in Kentucky a new EV strategy later this Monday (August 11) with a focus on upcoming more affordable electric models.
Its current EV lineup includes the Mustang Mach-E, the F-150 Lightning and the E-Transit EV.

According to a note to clients obtained by PriceTarget, Houchois said Ford’s full-year net tariff guidance of $2 billion is “not very different” from Stellantis at $1.7 billion and General Motors at $2–3 billion excluding Korea, after adjusting for size.

The analyst noted that higher exposure to aluminum — subject to a 50% tariff — “offsets higher US final assembly, but also contributes to F’s ~25% lower average emissions in addition to high hybrid exposure.”

As a strong Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) performer, Ford is less leveraged to any loosening of greenhouse gas regulations, Houchois said.

He added that the automaker should be able to materially reduce losses at its Model e electric vehicle unit from 2026, pointing to Q2 results that showed all incremental revenue over Q1 coming from Europe, while divisional losses held steady.

“Lower unit losses in Europe, fewer US sales, peak Gen2 (skunkwork) investment and more competitive models all point to lower unit losses,” he wrote.

Jefferies raised its 2025 adjusted EBIT estimate for Ford by 2% to $6.9 billion, with its Credit division offsetting weaker Pro segment results, and lifted its free cash flow forecast by 12% to $2.7 billion on a higher internal Credit dividend — though still below company guidance.

For 2026, the firm increased its adjusted EBIT estimate by 25% to reflect a still-modest 5% margin, with an improved product mix in its Blue division and a 20% reduction in Model e losses to about $3 billion.

However, Houchois cautioned that a valuation of 7 times 2026 earnings and warranty liabilities remain overhangs.

Ford is scheduled to reveal in Kentucky a new EV strategy later this Monday (August 11) with a focus on upcoming more affordable electric models.

Its current EV lineup includes the Mustang Mach-E, the F-150 Lightning and the E-Transit EV.

Ford saw its US sales rise 9.3% year on year in July to 189,313 units, with hybrid vehicles posting the biggest increase.

They're still waiting.,News From The States,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/startup-promised-45000-ev-jobs-struggling-towns-theyre-still-waiting,"The company planned to build six EV plants, create 45,000 jobs — and help these impoverished communities secure a place in America’s green future.
Fort Valley gave its backing in early 2024 to Imola’s ambitious plan to build an EV plant that would employ 7,500 workers.
This time, instead of building an EV plant, they pitched a high-tech lighting system for the town.
But despite announcements of partnerships and promises of good-paying jobs, his EV company has yet to show any tangible progress.
Council members were told that Georgia Power couldn’t provide sufficient power for the EV company, according to minutes of their March 2025 meeting.","They came with promises of transformation: thousands of jobs, surging salaries and a foothold in the booming electric vehicle market.

Imola Automotive USA, a Boca Raton, Florida-based startup, pitched officials in small, struggling towns in Georgia, Oklahoma and Arkansas on a bold vision. The company planned to build six EV plants, create 45,000 jobs — and help these impoverished communities secure a place in America’s green future.

But more than 18 months later, the company hasn’t broken ground on a single site. And its top executive — whose background is in television and athletic shoes, not automotive manufacturing — has gone silent.

A Floodlight investigation did not uncover lost taxpayer money in Fort Valley, Georgia; Langston, Oklahoma; or Pine Bluff, Arkansas, where Imola has sought free land, municipal financing and other incentives for its shifting proposals.

But an economic development watchdog said the episode illustrates how the frenzy to land electric vehicle jobs can leave economically distressed towns vulnerable to empty promises.

Imola CEO Rodney Henry declined requests for an interview. He responded to Floodlight’s inquiries with a short statement, insisting the company had not given up on its plans, which have included a partnership with an Italian manufacturer of two-seat electric vehicles.

“Our timetable has been modified due to matters outside of our control,” Henry said in a statement. “We are highly focused on bringing our goals into alignment. Due to proprietary consideration as well as NDA (nondisclosure) agreements, we are not at liberty to discuss specifics at this juncture.”

That’s a stark shift from the company’s earlier promises. In a press release issued in January 2024, Henry claimed the company had already secured land in multiple states to build half a dozen plants and create tens of thousands of jobs.

Could someone with no experience in car manufacturing really deliver that?

“It’s ludicrous,” said Greg LeRoy, CEO of Good Jobs First, a nonprofit that tracks and analyzes economic development projects.

Building large auto plants, he said, requires “a great deal of capital, a great deal of management skill, a great deal of engineering and marketing chops. And obviously, Tesla developed those, but they didn’t do it overnight, right?”

Langston, Fort Valley and Pine Bluff weren’t the only towns swept up in the competition to attract electric vehicle plants. Spurred by federal policies like the Inflation Reduction Act, which unlocked billions in private investment and expanded government incentives, local officials across the country scrambled to land high-paying manufacturing jobs and a slice of the booming clean energy economy.

Since the IRA passed in 2022, more than 150 EV plants have been announced in the United States, according to E2, a nonpartisan group of business leaders who advocate for economic development good for the environment.

But that rush may be grinding to a halt. The recently passed “One Big Beautiful Bill” rolls back many federal tax credits and incentives for electric vehicles. The law is already throwing the EV sector into turmoil — threatening to stall or shrink the kinds of ambitious projects towns like Langston, Fort Valley and Pine Bluff were counting on. E2 reports that plans for 14 EV-related plants have been canceled this year.

Bold promises, then silence

In three towns where Imola pledged massive investment, there’s no sign of construction and little more than confusion.

Langston — a town of 1,600 where more than 35% of residents live in poverty — never saw Imola’s plans take shape.

A 2023 letter to the city council from former Imola chief operating officer Eric Pettus stated that the company had run into “multiple obstacles,” including trouble acquiring enough land.

“In order for us to continue moving forward on the project we are requesting that the City of Langston convey to us any and all vacant properties owned by the city,” Pettus wrote.

Langston City Council member Magnus Scott said the company also asked the town to issue municipal bonds to help them build their plant. Since then, he said, a company representative told him the deal had been canceled.

“I guess maybe they ran into financial problems,” Scott said.

Reached by phone, Pettus, of south Florida, said he’s no longer employed by Imola but instead works as a consultant for the company. Citing a nondisclosure agreement, he declined to discuss Imola’s plans.

Fort Valley gave its backing in early 2024 to Imola’s ambitious plan to build an EV plant that would employ 7,500 workers.

A year later, with no sign of progress on the plant, the company came back to the Georgia town with an entirely different proposal. This time, instead of building an EV plant, they pitched a high-tech lighting system for the town.

One city council member balked.

“You want us to sign an agreement for 99 years before you bring us the car company,” said council member Laronda Eason, according to minutes of the March 2025 meeting. “It feels like a bait and switch.”

Eason did not respond to emails and text messages seeking comment on the Imola proposal.

In Pine Bluff, where per capita income last year was just over $21,000, city officials were initially all in. Writing to Henry in August 2024, then-Mayor Shirley Washington said the city of 39,000 stood ready to buy land, build infrastructure and issue industrial revenue bonds to support Imola’s vision.

“With an anticipated employment base of more than 8,000 jobs,” Washington wrote, “we firmly believe this investment will marshal a pivotal turning point in our community.”

But a year later, the project hasn’t moved.

“We never did get off the ground with that,” Washington said in a brief phone interview.

LeRoy said Imola’s pitch fits a troubling pattern.

“It grabs me as an example of how the craze among governors and mayors to get the next big thing has caused some sloppy vetting,” he said of the struggling communities courted by Imola.

Such towns, he said, are “easy prey. …They’re desperate.”

Grand vision, missing details

Henry, who lives in Florida, touts a background as a longtime TV executive producer and the founder of Protégé, an athletic footwear brand. He claims on his IMDB profile that Protégé donated a million pairs of shoes to African nations.

But despite announcements of partnerships and promises of good-paying jobs, his EV company has yet to show any tangible progress.

Floodlight found the website for Imola — named after the Italian city where Tazzari EVs are made — is no longer accessible without a password. A search of the Tazzari website found no mention of plants in the United States. But a 2024 version of the Imola site mentions the tiny vehicles “coming soon to America.”

In early 2024, Imola Automotive USA and the Tazzari Group — an Italian firm best known for its electric two-seater micro cars — jointly announced plans for a partnership.

The EVs that Tazzari makes in Italy aren’t designed for highway driving. Top speed on the company’s Opensky Sport model is about 56 miles per hour, while maximum speed on the Opensky Limited is about 37 mph, according to the company’s webpage.

Tazzari didn’t respond to email messages from a Floodlight reporter.

Henry said at the time that the company chose Langston and Fort Valley because of their universities.

“Both of these locations are ideal,” he said in the January 2024 news release, “as their proximity to communities with institutions of higher learning, will allow residents and students career opportunities in the fast growing EV Technology and Innovation Industry.”

Many local officials in Fort Valley, Langston and Pine Bluff did not respond to interview requests. Few documents were provided in response to Floodlight’s public records requests.

But it’s clear from available records that Imola’s promises stirred hope.

Langston Mayor Michael Boyles called the proposal “transformative” in a January 2024 news release.

But some local leaders soon began to question the details.

Erica Johnson, a real estate agent and former member of Langston’s economic development commission, said parts of the plan didn’t add up. How, for instance, would the company house more than 1,000 workers in such a small town? And how were they going to build such a large plant on land without utilities or water?

Her doubts deepened when she learned that Imola wanted to lock down land agreements without putting up any earnest money.

“My early feeling was that, ‘Something is not quite okay with this,’ ” she said. “But I think the hope for our community kind of outweighed the ability to just take things slow and look at them for where they are and what they are — versus where you hope them to be.”

Eventually, the promise fizzled.

“It was disappointing,” Johnson said. “…We could have had our energy and time focused on something that seemed more valid and more substantial.”

Still waiting for the shovels

Some residents in Fort Valley are still holding out hope.

Mayor Jeffery Lundy said early last year that it was a “priority for my administration to land a company like Imola Automotive USA.” Local officials, he said, were looking forward to the economic boost the plant would bring.

At the time, Imola claimed it would break ground on a 195-acre site by the third quarter of 2024 and open the plant within 20 months, according to a report in the Macon Telegraph.

During a February 2024 town hall meeting, Imola officials told residents that the plant would pay employees an average of $45 an hour, according to a Facebook post. Commenters buzzed with excitement, with one writing: “Application me !!!!”

Pettus told a local TV station that most jobs would require only a high school diploma.

In early 2024, Fort Valley rezoned land to accommodate the plant, and the city council signed off on the deal. But more than 15 months later, there’s still no sign of construction.

Council members were told that Georgia Power couldn’t provide sufficient power for the EV company, according to minutes of their March 2025 meeting. A spokesman for Georgia Power said that while the utility doesn’t discuss economic development projects, “We’re prepared and ready to meet the energy needs of any new customer.”

Makita Driver, one of the Facebook commenters who’d voiced excitement about the proposed EV plant, said there’s no doubt she would have applied for one of the jobs there — had the facility ever been built.

“The pay rate was really what got my attention,” she said.

As a medical assistant, Driver said she earns far less than what Imola had promised. But she eventually concluded the promises were too good to be true.

“Who really makes that kind of money starting out?” she asked.

In a brief interview with Floodlight on July 11, Mayor Lundy said he’s still in contact with Henry.

“We are patiently waiting for that groundbreaking,” Lundy said.",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/s3/files/styles/social_large/s3/articles/feeds-state-47649/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/photo-from-imola_s-website-in-2024-1024x5721754910777.png?h=335cd77d&itok=hG2GIIQy,N,,2025-08-11 10:04:09.906886

Its Paramount refinery near downtown Los Angeles had been a rare success story, supplying millions of gallons of SAF a year to airlines such as United Airlines and fellow U.S. carrier JetBlue Airways. The plant, which began operations in 2016, was central to the carriers’ pledges to help the airline industry switch to a blend of 10% SAF by the end of this decade.

But the refinery quietly ceased operations in April. And World Energy’s plans for a second plant in Houston have stalled amid a lack of commitment from the industry, according to Chief Executive Gene Gebolys.

“Some airlines were engaged in a pretty disingenuous effort to put out press releases” overstating their commitment to SAF projects, Gebolys said, without naming any companies. “People sometimes said too much in the past and did too little.”

Still, Gebolys acknowledged that some airlines have made a genuine effort to support SAF producers, while governments also needed to step up with stronger incentives to drive progress.

The termination of United’s fuel purchase contract with World Energy - and the closure of the Paramount refinery - have not previously been reported.

United Airlines said it ended its relationship with World Energy “a few years ago”, without providing a reason. A JetBlue spokesperson said World Energy has been a “valued partner” since 2020 and it will continue working with the company.

World Energy’s struggles mirror the plight of dozens of clean fuel startups, according to a Reuters review of the sector. Nearly 20 years after the first commercial flight powered partly by biofuels made the short hop from London to Amsterdam, Reuters found that the airline industry’s plans to go green before regulators start penalising them are little more than a pipe dream.

No clear pathway

The International Air Transport Association (IATA), a global body that represents 340 airlines, forecasts SAF will account for 0.7% of total jet fuel this year, up from 0.3% in 2024. Air passenger traffic, meanwhile, is expected to rise 6% this year, IATA says.

IATA has set a goal of net zero emissions by 2050, a target that would require airlines to ramp up SAF use to 118 billion gallons annually, a more than 300-fold increase from current production.

Airline industry leaders point to a wave of new SAF initiatives they say will spark a boom similar to the rapid rise of electric vehicles and solar energy.

However, the aviation sector has yet to publish a comprehensive roadmap or a transparent database of upcoming SAF projects that would allow regulators and the public to assess the credibility of these projections.

To scrutinise the industry’s claims, Reuters built its own database of airline SAF initiatives - offering the most comprehensive view yet of the sector’s faltering green progress and revealing that the industry has no clear pathway to hitting net zero targets.

While airlines have announced 165 SAF projects over the past 12 years, only 36 have materialized, Reuters found. Among those, Reuters uncovered problems at three of the largest - including World Energy - that exemplify the systemic challenges plaguing the SAF sector.

If all the pending projects announced by airlines reached their maximum potential, it would only add 12 billion gallons of SAF production, the Reuters analysis found. That’s about 10% of what’s needed to hit the net zero target.

Airlines pin the problems on the oil industry, saying it isn’t producing enough fuel.

“These guys are the cause of the problem, and they’ve got to start playing their part,” said Willie Walsh, director of IATA, the global airline lobby, and a former chief executive of British Airways and its parent International Airlines Group.

At the moment, SAF costs three to five times more than jet fuel and some oil company executives argue that there is limited demand from airlines at current prices.

“I’d like there to be a shortage. I actually see an overcapacity,” Bernard Pinatel, the head of downstream and marketing and services at TotalEnergies, told a press briefing in June.

Paramount ‘reset’

The Paramount refinery, which used cooking oil and animal fat from a local abattoir to make fuel, repeatedly stumbled in its efforts to expand and all 35 employees were laid off in April, two sources with direct knowledge of the matter said.

The future of the plant is uncertain, the two people said, after World Energy’s partner, Air Products, withdrew from the project in February, citing challenging commercial conditions tied to the expansion and operations. Air Products, a U.S. industrial gases and chemicals company, had been slated to lead a $2 billion expansion of the site.

World Energy CEO Gebolys said Paramount’s closure was a “reset” because the refurbishment was over budget and behind schedule. He said it would come back online, without giving a time frame. He declined to comment about the layoffs.

According to more than a dozen people directly involved in the sector, airlines play minimal roles in the execution of projects and, in most cases, their only commitment is to buy SAF when their partners produce it.

What’s more, airlines are making bold projections about SAF use and emissions reductions based on unproven technologies or early-stage projects run by startups with no experience of commercial production, Reuters found.

Of the 36 projects that have produced any SAF, all but one rely on the Hydroprocessed Esters and Fatty Acids (HEFA) process to convert waste oils, fats and grease into jet fuel. HEFA was the technology used at Paramount.

However, HEFA plants are severely constrained by the limited availability of suitable raw materials and cannot meet the industry’s long-term fuel demands, three industry specialists said.

IATA chief economist and sustainability executive Marie Owens Thomsen disputed the idea airlines only play a minimal role, saying they were striking SAF purchase agreements and investing in new technologies, supporting early-stage innovation and collaborating with research institutions.

She also said alternative ways of making SAF needed to be developed alongside HEFA, as this process alone would not be sufficient to produce enough fuel to hit net zero by 2050.

‘Exercise in futility’

Aviation accounts for 2.5% of global emissions of planet-warming gases such as carbon dioxide. This figure is expected to rise as air traffic more than doubles from 2019 levels by 2050 and fuel use rises 59%, according to environmental advocacy group Transport & Environment (T&E).

By painting a picture of imminent breakthroughs and success in producing SAF at scale, airlines can bolster their green credentials while deflecting pressure for more disruptive interventions, such as stricter emissions caps or higher carbon taxes, the group said.

“This is first and foremost about justifying never-ending growth and pretending that you can do that without heating the planet more and more - which you cannot do,” said Almuth Ernsting, a campaigner with advocacy group Biofuelwatch.

Failing to find a solution could prove costly. Under new EU rules, airlines face escalating mandates to use SAF on flights departing from EU airports. The mandate starts with at least 2% of their fuel in 2025, climbing to 6% by 2030, and eventually hitting 70% by 2050.

European SAF mandates are expected to cost airlines $2.9 billion in additional fuel purchases and compliance expenses this year, according to IATA estimates.

The return to power of U.S. President Donald Trump could further hamper the industry’s green transition. Trump has pledged to roll back many incentives his predecessor, Joe Biden, offered to SAF and other green energy projects.

As projects flounder in the United States, the U.S. airline industry has pinned hopes on a new SAF bonanza in Panama. It’s already hitting the skids, Reuters found.

SGP BioEnergy, headquartered in New York, pledged in 2022 to build the world’s largest SAF facility, in collaboration with the government of Panama. The plant is to make green fuel from industrial hemp oil and used cooking oil.

Due to start this year, production has been pushed back to 2027. SGP BioEnergy Chief Executive Randy Letang said the delay was largely due to airlines showing less interest in backing SAF projects than in the past.

Panama’s energy secretary did not respond to a request for comment.

After the plant opens, the company may switch to making renewable diesel for trucks and ships, because those industries showed more enthusiasm than aviation, Letang said.

“We’re only going to take it so far with SAF until we determine whether or not the airlines are actually serious about making the commitments for this fuel,” he said.

Letang said airlines were competing to announce their own marquee projects, when producers actually needed consortiums made up of many carriers to invest in large-scale projects.

“That’s how you build this industry. Without that, it’s an exercise in futility, quite frankly,” he said. “The airlines could do a lot more.”

A few years ago, Letang was striking big SAF deals with major airlines through his previous biofuels venture, SG Preston. In 2016, JetBlue announced a 10-year commitment to buy commercial volumes of green fuel from SG Preston, calling it one of the largest such deals in history. JetBlue said in 2021 it would double down on the deal as it pursued a target to use SAF for 8% of its fuel needs by 2023.

Australia’s Qantas Airways signed a similar 10-year deal with SG Preston in 2017 for 8 million gallons of SAF annually starting in 2020 to help power flights between Los Angeles and Australia.

The deals were based on SG Preston’s plan to build five plants across North America - two in Ohio and one each in Indiana, Michigan, and Ontario. None has been built.

SG Preston filed for bankruptcy in 2022, according to company filings. A spokesperson for Letang’s current firm, SGP BioEnergy, said the two companies had no affiliation.

New technology

While most SAF projects rely on HEFA, British startup Velocys uses Fischer-Tropsch technology, which converts waste such as garbage, wood chips, or flared gas into clean fuel.

IAG - the parent of British Airways, Iberia, Vueling and Aer Lingus - has been an enthusiastic backer, announcing four major SAF initiatives with Velocys over the past 15 years. But despite producing SAF in pilot projects, none of the Velocys projects has reached commercial production.

The challenges for Velocys began in 2010 with a project to turn methane from a London landfill into jet fuel. That venture collapsed when its main backer went bankrupt.

Since then Velocys has attempted to build its own plants - including in Oklahoma - but it has proven too costly and technically challenging.

After shutting the Oklahoma plant, Velocys shifted focus to two new projects: one at Immingham in northeast England and another in Mississippi.

British oil major Shell and IAG initially backed Velocys’s English venture, and the British government awarded a 27 million pound ($37 million) grant in 2022, then another 3 million pounds in July. However, Shell backed out in 2021 to pursue its own SAF ventures. Shell declined further comment.

While IAG has no purchase deal with Velocys, it maintains a partnership and expects production to begin in 2029.

Velocys Chief Executive Matthew Viergutz remains optimistic, saying the company has learned from past setbacks. However, the Mississippi project is on hold pending clarity on U.S. SAF regulations.

The Immingham project was meant to start supplying British Airways last year. The plant site is a dusty field, empty but for a blue portable toilet lying on its side.

Velocys has yet to sell a drop of green jet fuel to IAG or any other airline.",https://www.reuters.com/graphics/AVIATION-SUSTAINABILITY/movadylljpa/cdn/images/SAF-sharecard.jpg,N,,2025-08-11 09:00:51.052280
,American Energy,2025-08-11 11:45:42+00:00,Energy-Storage.News,"Tesla, Sunrun hail 'win-win for the household and the grid' with California virtual power plant test",Andy Colthorpe,,,,,https://www.energy-storage.news/tesla-sunrun-hail-win-win-for-the-household-and-the-grid-with-california-virtual-power-plant-test/,"According to a source close to the VPP test, it was a “good representation of likely performance during a grid emergency,” noting similarities to how the aggregated systems performed per-site last year during a grid emergency and market-driven events.
The source said that available capacity is growing rapidly due to the accelerating adoption of residential energy storage, combined with several years of good outcomes for California VPP programmes.
The grid operator began issuing ‘Flex Alerts’ in August 2022, allowing batteries in homes to dispatch to the grid as part of the state’s Emergency Load Relief Program.
The provider accounted for some 360MW of systems in the recent test, but the grid still leaves that growing resource largely untouched.
“Realising the full potential of VPPs beyond an emergency capacity use case is California’s next great challenge,” Tesla’s Kevin Joyce told Energy-Storage.news.","VPP participants were in all three territories of California’s investor-owned utilities (IOUs), Pacific Gas & Electric (PG&E), Southern California Edison (SCE) and San Diego Gas & Electric (SDG&E).

Most battery systems taking part were already enrolled with the state’s Demand-Side Grid Support (DSGS) load relief programme, which runs from May to October each year.

According to a source close to the VPP test, it was a “good representation of likely performance during a grid emergency,” noting similarities to how the aggregated systems performed per-site last year during a grid emergency and market-driven events.

The source said that available capacity is growing rapidly due to the accelerating adoption of residential energy storage, combined with several years of good outcomes for California VPP programmes.

Meanwhile, the intelligence behind dispatch technologies has significantly improved, resulting in yearly improvements in event preparation, dispatch performance and better forecasting of customer bill savings, the source said.

In short, customers get paid for letting the aggregator use their home battery system in the programme and the aggregator gets paid by the grid operator. Sunrun said it pays US$150 per battery per dispatching season, while Tesla is thought to have paid around US$9.9 million to VPP customers enrolled in its own aggregation programmes around the world in 2024.

“This customer-led solution is a win-win for households and the grid. Distributed home batteries are a powerful and flexible resource that reliably delivers power to the grid at a moment’s notice, benefiting all households by preventing blackouts, alleviating peak demand, and reducing extreme price spikes,” Sunrun CEO Mary Powell said.

‘Residential batteries provide dependable, planning-grade performance at scale’

Brattle Group said the event occurred during the CAISO system’s net peak, when solar and wind generation are low, but evening demand adds load.

The firm said that the VPP’s discharging created “a visible reduction in net load” and posited that the technology could help reduce the effect of California’s famous ‘Duck Curve’.

“Performance was consistent across the event, without major fluctuations or any attrition. Events like these demonstrate to system operators that residential batteries provide dependable, planning-grade performance at scale,” Brattle Group principal Ryan Hledik said.

The role VPPs could play in mitigating CAISO’s net peak could reduce the need to invest in additional generation capacity and relieve strain on the system associated with the evening load ramp-up.

“PowerWall owners have responded to the call to create a large distributed capacity resource for California,” Tesla lead for VPPs and electricity retail, Kevin Joyce, told Energy-Storage.news.

However, at this point, the CAISO grid only calls on distributed storage systems in emergencies. The grid operator began issuing ‘Flex Alerts’ in August 2022, allowing batteries in homes to dispatch to the grid as part of the state’s Emergency Load Relief Program.

The resources quickly showed their value alongside utility-scale battery energy storage systems (BESS), helping California to avoid rolling blackouts of the kind that had occurred just two years before.

At the time, Sunrun was dispatching around 80MW of batteries to the California grid daily and Sunrun senior director of market development and policy, Chris Rauscher, said in a 2022 interview that it was unfortunate that aggregated residential batteries were only being tapped in emergency events and not to mitigate daily peaks.

The provider accounted for some 360MW of systems in the recent test, but the grid still leaves that growing resource largely untouched.

“Realising the full potential of VPPs beyond an emergency capacity use case is California’s next great challenge,” Tesla’s Kevin Joyce told Energy-Storage.news.

Joyce said Tesla looked forward to working with stakeholders including CAISO, the regulatory California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) and the California Energy Commission (CEC), “to address roadblocks and bring this timely resource to California’s capacity, energy, and ancillary services markets.”",https://www.energy-storage.news/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Brattle-Group-California-VPP-test-event.png,N,,2025-08-11 09:00:33.494319

From there, analysts use publicly available information about the power plant to estimate the emissions of greenhouse gases and other pollutants.","The Trump administration has done many favors for the fossil fuel industry. In addition to allowing more pollution from coal and gas power plants and derailing clean energy, the administration is taking steps to keep the public from even knowing how much climate-warming greenhouse gases – like carbon dioxide and methane – are being emitted.

Currently, the federal government requires companies to measure their output of heat-trapping pollution and report it to the EPA. But in a March 2025 press release, the EPA said that reporting greenhouse gases is burdensome, and EPA Administrator Lee Zelden said the requirements to document climate-warming pollution hurt “the ability to achieve the American dream.” So the EPA may eventually allow facilities like power plants or oil refineries to stop reporting how much climate pollution they’re emitting.

But polluters still won’t be able to escape scrutiny.

At this very moment, instruments on board satellites, airplanes, and the International Space Station are steadfastly measuring plumes of methane and carbon dioxide drifting from power plants, refineries, and pipelines. These programs have been operating for years but aren’t widely known. This article is the first in a series that will showcase the instruments, highlight their top-level findings, and illustrate how anyone can use these tools to become a climate sleuth.

Seeing CO2 and methane from air and space

As sunlight bounces off Earth’s surface and heads back out to space, some of its energy gets trapped in the atmosphere by climate-warming greenhouse gases. Methane, carbon dioxide, and other gases each absorb different wavelengths of light. Instruments on aircraft or in space can measure the exact wavelengths of light coming upward through the atmosphere. The specific fingerprint of reflected light can tell observers which gases are present and in what quantities.

Measuring greenhouse gases from above brings a multitude of benefits. These independent measurements don’t rely on reporting from the corporations that are causing the pollution in the first place. Satellites can see the whole world and can reveal pollution sources even in far-flung locales that may not report their emissions. Aircraft can fly localized spot-checks to find leaks and equipment malfunctions that can be fixed. Companies can use this data to take stock of their emissions and the efficiency of their operations.

Much of the data is free and available to the public, and in some cases, it’s viewable through user-friendly mapping tools. Journalists and community members can use this data to easily learn about sources of pollution. Anyone with access to the internet can monitor emissions sources all around the world.

Some of these instruments are run by government agencies like NASA. Others are privately owned and operated. Private measurements of greenhouse gases have become especially important in the Trump era because they can’t be canceled by an executive order or budget cut.

Amid seemingly endless bad news, these scientific missions offer a ray of hope that accountability can’t be erased. Information is empowering, and even more so when it’s key to an urgent problem.

Carbon Mapper puts data from multiple instruments in one place

Carbon Mapper is a nonprofit organization that aims to make emissions data easily accessible so it can help drive action to reduce climate pollution. The group brings together funding from philanthropists with engineering from NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Planet Labs, and others. (Full disclosure: The author of this article is a contractor with NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory.) Carbon Mapper operates its own satellite with a second one in development.

Carbon Mapper’s data portal combines data from five different sources into a user-friendly mapping tool that displays plumes of CO2 and methane in intricate detail. The map is intuitive to use and offers a satisfying level of detail for those who want to drill down into the specifics.

Two of the data sources used in the Carbon Mapper data portal are from NASA. To date, those missions are not slated to be cut, but the uncertainty around federally funded science underscores the importance of programs that are outside the government.

Climate TRACE uses satellite imagery plus AI to estimate emissions

Climate TRACE takes an entirely different approach to tracking greenhouse gases. The team uses satellite imagery plus AI models to estimate emissions based on visual cues. For example, the amount of water vapor coming from a coal power plant is an indicator of how much electricity the plant is generating. From there, analysts use publicly available information about the power plant to estimate the emissions of greenhouse gases and other pollutants. In addition to power plants, this tool covers sectors like mining, agriculture, transportation, buildings, and land use change.

Climate TRACE features a user-friendly emissions map with options to look up specific locations and sectors.

The data for the tool comes from both government-owned and privately owned satellites.

NASA’s EMIT finds methane super emitters and leaky oil and gas operations

EMIT is a NASA instrument on the International Space Station that was originally designed to measure how wind-borne dust might warm or cool the climate. But it also turns out to be really good at finding methane. Within its first few months of operation, the instrument had found some of the largest releases of methane ever measured. The mission initially pinpointed over 50 super-emitters, many coming from oil and gas operations or landfills. The list of methane plumes has only expanded since then.

Investigative journalists at Bloomberg Green used EMIT imagery to find large methane leaks coming from oil and gas operations in Texas and New Mexico. In one case, Exxon had violated state law by failing to promptly report a leak. Bloomberg contacted Exxon and showed them the image from EMIT, and then Exxon filed a (late) report and fixed the leak. This example shows the power of publicly available data to help shine a light on highly polluting oil and gas operations and ultimately, to stop leaks.

NASA recently extended EMIT’s mission and shifted the mission’s focus from mineral dust to methane. The results are free and open to the public in NASA’s EMIT Open Data Portal. The European Space Agency has a similar program with its Sentinel-5P satellite. Their Methane Hotspot Explorer adds new data every week, which is more frequent than EMIT.

No U3O8 has been, nor is forecasted to be, purchased in 2025.

Operational Updates:

Improvements in operational efficiency at Alta Mesa In-Situ Recovery (""ISR"") Uranium CPP and Wellfield (""Alta Mesa"") continued through the second quarter with monthly increases in U3O8 extraction during the second quarter. Daily production averaged 2,678 pounds per day in June 2025, 2,103 pounds per day in May 2025 and 1,942 pounds per day in April 2025;

Wellfield development at the Alta Mesa Project's Wellfield 7 continued to expand throughout the second quarter with the addition of 75 wells: 35 extraction wells and 40 injection wells. This is part of the ongoing ramp up strategy to advance wellfield expansion every 4 to 5 weeks. Wellfield development has been ongoing at an accelerated rate with a total of 24 drill rigs in operation across the South Texas operations at the end of the quarter. The Company anticipates increasing the number of drill rigs operating to 30 in the third quarter of 2025;

Important permitting progress during the second quarter was highlighted by the inclusion of the Upper Spring Creek ISR Uranium Project in the existing Radioactive Materials License (""RML"") from the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (""TCEQ""). This license allows the Company to handle radioactive materials, which includes the final product, U3O8. The current RML includes the Rosita ISR Uranium Project, which has now been extended to cover the Upper Spring Creek Project's Brown Area. The RML allows the construction of wellfields and a Satellite Ion Exchange (""IX"") Plant which will provide feed for the Rosita ISR Uranium Central Processing Plant. Construction activities commenced during the quarter.

About the Alta Mesa ISR Uranium CPP and Wellfield (""Alta Mesa Uranium Project"")

The Alta Mesa Uranium Project hosts a fully licensed and constructed ISR Central Processing Plant and operational wellfield located on 200,000+ acres of private land and mineral rights in and regulated by the state of Texas. Total operating capacity at the Alta Mesa CPP is 1.5 million pounds uranium per year with additional drying capacity of 0.5 million pounds. The Alta Mesa Uranium Project operates under a 70/30 joint venture with Boss Energy Limited which is managed by the Company.

The Alta Mesa CPP historically produced nearly 5 million pounds of uranium between 2005 and 2013 when production was curtailed as a result of low prices. The Alta Mesa Uranium Project utilizes well known ISR technology to extract uranium in a non-invasive process using natural groundwater and oxygen. Currently, oxygenated water is being circulated in the wellfield through injection or extraction wells plumbed directly into the primary pipelines feeding the Alta Mesa CPP. Expansion of the wellfield will continue, with extraction to steadily increase from the wellfield as expansion continues through 2025 and beyond.

About the Upper Spring Creek ISR Uranium Project

The 100% Company-owned Project is a planned Satellite ion exchange (""IX"") Plant operation for the Rosita CPP. The Project consists of several future potential production units within the historic Clay West uranium district. The Project was previously held by Signal Equities LLC, who previously licensed and permitted the property as an ISR uranium project, maintaining the aquifer exemption and ceased work following continued low uranium spot prices. In December 2020, the Company acquired the Upper Spring Creek Project. The uranium mineralized sands that are associated with the project area lie within the Oakville Formation. These historic uranium producing sands stretch across an area of approximately 120 miles long by approximately 20 miles wide in South Texas. The uranium mineralized ore body at the Upper Spring Creek Project occurs at depths typically between 300 and 450 feet from the surface.

Rosita ISR Uranium Central Processing Plant

The Rosita CPP can receive uranium-loaded resin from remote project areas across the South Texas region through a network of Satellite IX Plants. These Satellite IX Plants, located near wellfields, are a key component of the ISR uranium extraction process. A lixiviant, consisting of groundwater mixed with oxygen and sodium bicarbonate, is injected into the wellfield using ISR technology, where it dissolves uranium from the underground sandstone. The uranium-bearing solution is then pumped to the surface and directed through the IX columns at the nearby Satellite IX Plant, where uranium is absorbed onto resin beads. The uranium-loaded resin is then transported to the Rosita CPP, where the uranium is removed from the resin and processed into yellowcake. Once processed, the resin is recycled and trucked back to the Satellite IX Plants for reuse. These modular, efficient, and relocatable IX Plants allow for cost-effective operation across multiple sites without the need to construct full processing facilities at each location, and they can be relocated once a wellfield is depleted.

Utilities face real concerns about managing the price and volume risk tied to obtaining enough gas.
“Across the industry, we’re seeing a resurgence in the need for new natural gas generation,” said Brian Despard, senior project manager at 1898 & Co., the consulting arm of Burns & McDonnell.
“That delivery network has to be planned for, and it’s increasingly important to recognize regional pinch points and infrastructure limits.” Why utilities need a strategic, future-focused procurement strategy Reactive natural gas procurement strategies cannot prevent price spikes or ensure reliability.
In constrained regions like New England, for example, limited land for new renewable generation and natural gas pipeline limitations have forced planners to model energy systems holistically, balancing seasonal gas storage, renewable intermittency, and electrification all at once.","Electric utilities are grappling with the reality that the past is not prologue when it comes to electricity demand. Just a few years ago, many utilities assumed that flat load growth and decarbonization policies aimed at increasing electrification meant they didn’t have to worry much about securing sufficient volumes of affordable natural gas.

Those days are over, at least for now. Utilities face real concerns about managing the price and volume risk tied to obtaining enough gas. A major risk driver is the electricity demand of data centers. Data center load growth tripled from 2014 to 2024 and may double or triple again by 2028, according to an analysis by the U.S. Department of Energy’s Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory.

“Across the industry, we’re seeing a resurgence in the need for new natural gas generation,” said Brian Despard, senior project manager at 1898 & Co., the consulting arm of Burns & McDonnell. “Load forecasts are increasing, especially with the demands from 24/7 operations like data centers and large industrial loads. That naturally leads utilities back to gas, and it’s increasing the pressure to manage procurement risk more strategically.”

Growing need and complexity

Planning for natural gas is difficult because gas-fired units are often dispatched based on market prices or short-term needs, making daily volume requirements unpredictable. Waiting until the last minute is risky—prices fluctuate with weather, power demand, LNG demand, and pipeline congestion.

“The complexity is growing,” said Matthew Lind, director of resource planning and market assessments at 1898 & Co. “We’re seeing cost pressure, delivery constraints, and increased reliance on a system that hasn’t added major pipeline infrastructure in years. That creates planning challenges that utilities need to factor into every major investment.”

This risk is especially acute in Northeastern states, where fracking bans and pipeline permitting limitations restrict access to reliable gas delivery. Limited gas supply during high demand periods has forced utilities to burn more expensive fuels or even curtail load—threatening both reliability and affordability.

“You can’t assume fuel will show up just because you built a gas plant,” Lind said. “That delivery network has to be planned for, and it’s increasingly important to recognize regional pinch points and infrastructure limits.”

Why utilities need a strategic, future-focused procurement strategy

Reactive natural gas procurement strategies cannot prevent price spikes or ensure reliability. Instead of relying on spot market purchases dictated by daily events, utilities must embrace a structured and long-term procurement strategy that accounts for uncertainty.

This will vary by utility, depending on risk tolerance and available planning tools and expertise. “We recommend defining clear procurement and hedging objectives and using probabilistic modeling to quantify price and volume risks,” Despard said. “From there, you can build a structured program that tests different hedge strategies and adapts to market conditions.”

Hedging strategies can significantly lower risk while still allowing utilities to take advantage of short-term market opportunities. For example, programmatic hedging locks in gas prices over fixed intervals, regardless of market conditions. Other strategies adjust volumes when prices drop or trigger hedges if prices spike. These approaches allow utilities to match gas positions with expected power needs and adjust as needed.

A phased hedging strategy over a three-to-five-year timeframe can also be effective, Despard said. “Early on, you want to lock in the most certain volumes further out. As you get closer to the month you need the gas, the hedging becomes more dynamic, reacting to updated load forecasts and price signals.”

Co-optimized planning is mandatory

As the energy system becomes more integrated and complex, utilities can’t plan gas and power in silos. In constrained regions like New England, for example, limited land for new renewable generation and natural gas pipeline limitations have forced planners to model energy systems holistically, balancing seasonal gas storage, renewable intermittency, and electrification all at once.

This need is expanding nationwide. “You have to look at the whole system,” Lind said. “If you’re planning power and gas separately, you can miss how deeply they depend on each other. That interdependence becomes even more critical when you’re retiring coal and expecting renewables and gas to fill the gap.”

Co-optimization helps answer critical questions: Do current pipelines support new generation? Can you afford the price and volume risk of interruptible gas? Are long-term procurement plans aligned with decarbonization timelines?

While integrated resource planning is already complex, adding co-optimization and probabilistic gas modeling is too vital to delay.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/IdjLmteoGqMDIPf6qM3GxBDS_m_3lwDWKG1tsxhuiaM/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9HZXR0eUltYWdlcy00OTY5NTQ4NzZfeUo2ZHNaaC5qcGc=.webp,N,,2025-08-11 08:04:25.774464

American manufacturing gets serious For hybrid systems to scale, we need a reliable domestic supply chain.
Hybrid systems offer a better equation.
Moving beyond demonstrations Commercial hybrid projects are operating and domestic manufacturing is scaling.
Hybrid systems solve challenges that single-technology approaches can’t.","There’s a quiet revolution happening in American energy infrastructure, and it’s unfolding in places you might not expect.

This fall, students at a K–12 school in Sandy, Utah, will watch the grid of the future operate in real time. Outside the Murray Science Center at Waterford School, a hybrid flywheel-battery storage system powers operations, smooths geothermal loads, and gives students hands-on exposure to the technologies they’ll inherit.

That same architecture—high-speed flywheels paired with lithium iron phosphate batteries—now supports commercial deployments built to participate in utility demand response programs while withstanding extreme weather and grid stress. This educational demonstration is a scalable model for distributed infrastructure that delivers speed, resilience, and real value to utilities and commercial operators.

The takeaway is clear: smarter storage is already here.

The battery degradation reality

Ask any utility engineer about frequency regulation duty cycles, and you’ll hear the same story: batteries degrade quickly under constant cycling. The field is littered with early replacements, derailed economics, and procurement teams hesitant to greenlight large-scale deployments.

Several proposed large-scale battery projects in the U.S. have been shelved due to cost, complexity, and supply chain volatility. Meanwhile, coal plants stay online to serve data center load, simply because current storage options don’t hold up economically over the long haul.

This isn’t a failure of technology. It’s a mismatch of application. Batteries excel at energy storage. They’re poorly suited for high-frequency power management.

Flywheels are the opposite: not ideal for long-duration storage, but unmatched for fast response and power quality.

Pair them wisely, and both technologies thrive.

How hybrid systems work

The concept is simple: flywheels absorb the stress that kills batteries, like voltage spikes, frequency swings, and rapid cycling. Batteries handle the longer-duration storage and smooth discharge they’re designed for.

At Waterford, the science center draws from 45 on-site geothermal wells. While geothermal may sound steady, the electrical load varies constantly as HVAC systems cycle. A conventional battery system would wear out quickly. The flywheel smooths those fluctuations while the battery array provides backup power and multi-hour storage.

Students watch frequency regulation and voltage control in real time. The building teaches grid operations better than any textbook.

American manufacturing gets serious

For hybrid systems to scale, we need a reliable domestic supply chain. Domestic battery manufacturing is finally becoming competitive. New American-made LFP cells now deliver 3–6C performance, rivaling the world’s best. These cells are engineered for demanding grid applications, built domestically, and designed for recyclability.

Pair them with flywheel technology, and you get hybrid systems that can manage temperature extremes, meet uptime requirements, and support grid services like demand response, peak shaving, and ancillary reserves without compromising asset life.

No supply chain anxiety. No geopolitical risk. No performance tradeoff.

Data centers and EV charging: New pressure points

Load growth from AI data centers and EV fast-charging is already overwhelming planning models.

Hybrid systems offer a better equation. Flywheels provide clean ride-through power during grid disturbances, which is critical for AI workloads that can’t tolerate even millisecond-level interruptions. Batteries step in for longer outages and shifting loads.

At charging stations and commercial and industrial sites, flywheels absorb sharp demand spikes while batteries sustain the power output needed to serve multiple EVs or high-draw machinery.

The result: infrastructure that avoids costly grid upgrades and remains responsive under pressure.

The real economics

In many situations, flywheels cost more upfront. But over 20 years, they deliver lower total cost of ownership with no degradation, no replacements, and minimal maintenance.

More importantly, they extend the life of battery systems. Instead of replacing degraded cells every 8–10 years, utilities can operate systems reliably for 15–20.

That math matters when the U.S. grid faces $1.1 trillion in capital needs over the next decade.

Moving beyond demonstrations

Commercial hybrid projects are operating and domestic manufacturing is scaling.

What’s catching up is recognition. Hybrid systems solve challenges that single-technology approaches can’t. Batteries alone degrade under high-cycling stress. Flywheels alone don’t provide enough stored energy.

Together, they create something new: a storage platform that gets stronger under stress, not weaker.

The path forward

The grid America needs won’t run on any single technology. It will depend on systems that combine mechanical durability, chemical efficiency, and intelligent control from the edge of the grid to the core.

Waterford shows that this model works. Commercial deployments prove it scales. American manufacturing makes it viable.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/ZV6h2-ehPu1sH24BXG2dHTf0n7l0EB5bNcVYiHrmWDk/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS8wTjdBNzEwMC0yXzEuanBn.webp,N,,2025-08-11 08:04:29.759872

People purchasing the cars, made by Nissan, Renault and Vauxhall, will be able to save £1,500 through the grant.

Four models from Citroën are already eligible for a discount under the £650 million scheme which aims to make it cheaper and easier to own and electric vehicle (EV).

The discounts are applied automatically at the point of sale with no paperwork required from customers.

The government said the scheme is capped at cars costing up to £37,000 to target support at the most affordable options, adding that more models are expected to be approved in the coming weeks as manufacturers’ applications are assessed against the scheme’s sustainability standards.

In total, the government said it is investing £4.5 billion to facilitate the switch to EVs and aims to make the UK a “world-leader” in EV adoption.

The government says that Britain was Europe’s largest EV market in 2024, adding that sales are up almost a third so far this year.

The discounts are designed to bring down the price of models so they more closely match their petrol and diesel counterparts.

“With discounts on 17 car models announced this week alone, we’re delivering on our promise to make it easier and cheaper for families to go electric,” said transport secretary Heidi Alexander. “This is about backing drivers, putting money back into people’s pockets and creating the jobs and growth that will drive Britain forward, delivering on our Plan for Change.”

There are over 82,000 public charge points now available, with over 100,000 more set to be added in the coming years.

Last month, the Society of Motor Manufactures and Traders (SMMT) said that more could be done to increase the sales of battery-operated electric vehicles (EVs) in the UK.

Sales of EVs in the UK rose by a third to 224,841 in the first half of the year, resulting in a market share of 21.6 per cent.

However, this is below the mandated 28 per cent for this year.

According to the survey of chief executives working in the industry carried out by SMMT, the insufficient EVs sales were down to a lack of charging incentives as well as fiscal disincentives such as the newly applied Expensive Car Supplement (ECS), which is estimated to impose an effective fine of more than £360 million on EVs bought from April in this year alone.",https://nationaltechnology.co.uk/images/BT EV charger (1).png,N,,2025-08-11 10:05:02.892763

Such dual-use practices are a ‘middle ground’ between critics who argue too much prime farmland is being used for utility-scale solar projects and proponents, who point out significantly more real estate is dedicated to ethanol production.

In many situations, it’s an attractive proposition for land owners to lease a chunk of their property to a developer for 20-30 years, at which point, the plot is restored to its original state and can resume crop production. Each agrivoltaics project is a custom fit, requiring community engagement from the first planning stages. Accordingly, developers of dual-use projects must become fast friends with farmers, creating a symbiotic relationship that ensures each endeavor ends up a win-win.

However, rapidly degrading solar federal policy is making everything a lot tougher, creating project overruns, tax credit uncertainty, and rushed development that ultimately hurts everyone involved.

“To do agrivoltaics well, you need the time and the design space to be able to make sure that you treat the land well during construction, that you do good designs, and that you have thoughtful accommodations,” explains Jesse Robertson-Dubois, Director of Sustainable Solar Development at BlueWave Energy. “They don’t necessarily need to be more expensive, but they need to be thoughtful and well-designed. And the best, fastest way to not do good design and not do good construction practices is to accelerate the whole process.”

“The projects that are going to be hurt the most by these cutbacks are the ones that are trying to do the best work by putting more time into design, by putting more time into their construction timelines, by being willing to spend a little more money, burying the cabling rather than using an above-ground cabling system. These are all the things that don’t necessarily cost more, but do take time and effort that is going to be cut out of the system if we have these rollbacks, and that’s the thing that gives me the most fear. We’re just starting to make some real progress with agrivoltaics, and this is going to make agrivoltaics much, much harder to do.”

On this episode of the Factor This podcast, host Paul Gerke is joined by three foremost agrivoltaics experts to share stories, discuss best practices, and pontificate on perfecting policy. Topics include establishing dual-use markets, detailing new pilots and innovations, recalling memorable interactions with landowners, and more.

The expansion - expected to cost around $5.3 billion - will expand the system by 516 miles and add 1.5 Bcf per day of capacity to the system.

The expansion was driven by increased demand for natural gas to power large power plants, according to Tom Long, co-CEO of Energy Transfer. “We continue to see a significant level of activity from demand-pull customers to supply, store, and transport natural gas for gas-fired power plants, data centers, and industrial and onshore manufacturing,” Long said.

APS will act as the project's anchor customer and use the gas to power plants that will serve data centers within the utilities' service territory, according to Ted Geisler, chairman, president, and CEO of Pinnacle West Capital Corp., APS’ parent company.

APS has said it expects to spend up to $7.3bn over 25 years on buying gas from the expansion project. It intends to bring the power plants online at the same time as the pipeline expansion is completed, which is slated for sometime in 2029.

At present, APS has almost 4.5GW of committed, high-load customer demand in its interconnection queue, mostly from the data center sector. In addition, it has more than 20GW of uncommitted large load customers.

This standard could run afoul of state and federal laws limiting ESG investment strategies — practices where investment firms account for “environmental, social and governance factors” when making investments, according to Bird’s letter.
According to the law firm Morgan Lewis, there were 20 states with “anti-ESG” rules in effect as of September 2023.
SC Daily Gazette Editor Seanna Adcox contributed to this report.","Iowa Attorney General Brenna Bird led a multistate letter Friday questioning whether a new net-zero carbon emissions standard for businesses is illegal under state and federal law.

The letter was sent to David Kennedy, CEO of the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi), a group that recently released its Financial Institutions Net-Zero standard.

This standard is meant to aid financial institutions “in addressing their most significant climate impact through alignment and sector-specific targets,” according to the document, through actions like stopping or limiting investments in new projects related to fossil fuel expansion and addressing deforestation risks in existing investments.

This standard could run afoul of state and federal laws limiting ESG investment strategies — practices where investment firms account for “environmental, social and governance factors” when making investments, according to Bird’s letter.

According to the law firm Morgan Lewis, there were 20 states with “anti-ESG” rules in effect as of September 2023.

South Carolina joined the list in February 2024, when Gov. Henry McMaster signed the ESG Pension Protection Act.

Bird also wrote SBTi and the businesses that commit to following the standard may be in violation of state consumer protection laws and federal and state antitrust laws, constituting an illegal boycott by deliberately cutting off investment and insurance for certain industries through their standard on oil, gas, and coal expansion.

“Some economic arrangements are illegal because they are unfair or unreasonably harmful to competition; the ‘good intentions’ behind them are irrelevant,” Bird wrote.

The letter was co-signed by attorneys general from 22 other states — Alabama, Alaska, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Indiana, Kansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, North Dakota, Oklahoma, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia, West Virginia, and Wyoming.

It included a list of requested information and documents from SBTi on its communication with members about how it plans to meet net-zero carbon emission commitments, how the standard was developed, and how it is working with insurance companies to reduce emissions.

In a news release Friday, Bird called the standard from SBTi, which partners with the United Nations, the World Wide Fund for Nature and other organizations in providing advisory information, “the next attempt by radical environmentalists to coordinate companies to squeeze important American industries into eliminating carbon dioxide production by some future date.”

“SBTi is trying to redo President Biden’s radical green scheme,” Bird said in a statement. “If successful, they’ll hurt farmers, energy producers, and Iowans. Its program limits output of goods or services, and these unrealistic net-zero programs harm both American agriculture and industry. Making net-zero a goal actively harms Americans, creates risk for energy independence, and increases the cost of safe, healthy, nutritious food.”

Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier also took steps to investigate SBTi last week, announcing he would issue subpoenas to the advisory group and the CDP, an international nonprofit focused on environmental impact reporting.

The investigation will look into whether these organizations violated state consumer protection and antitrust laws “by coercing companies into disclosing proprietary data and paying for access under the guise of environmental transparency,” according to a news release.

“Radical climate activists have hijacked corporate governance and weaponized it against the free market,” Uthmeier said in a statement. “Florida will not sit back while international pressure groups shake down American companies to fund their ESG grift. We’re using every tool of the law to stop the Climate Cartel from exploiting businesses and misleading consumers.”

South Carolina’s anti-ESG law requires the Retirement System Investment Commission to make investment decisions based only on “pecuniary factors” — in other words, what’s expected to net the most money — without giving weight to policies such as climate change and social impacts. During a public hearing, the commission’s CEO told legislators nothing would change, since the agency already operated that way.

But that future is under threat if we don’t act decisively to curb the pollution fueling the climate crisis.
For decades, it has been a bulwark against the pollution driving climate change.
Climate change is not a distant threat—it is here, it is real, and it is devastating lives right now.
Steve Gibson is an Altadena resident and a Pasadena Area Community College District Trustee since 2022.","On January 8th, my wife and I awoke at 3:15 a.m. to the shrill tone of a phone alert. We had been without power for twelve hours, but nothing could prepare us for what came next. When we opened the front door, the darkness outside was suffocating, lit only by the red glow of swirling embers. The alert screamed “immediate evacuation.”

We checked on our neighbors, grabbed our insurance papers and a change of clothes, scooped up our little dog, Cantinflas, and drove away in a haze of ash and headlights. That was the last time I saw our home of 24 years in Altadena.

For me, this is not an abstract debate about climate policy. This is personal. The fire that destroyed my home is one chapter in a growing national crisis—one fueled by climate change and made worse by political choices in Washington.

Yesterday, I shared my story publicly at the People’s Hearing on Extreme Weather at the Maxwell House in Pasadena, an event organized by the Climate Action Campaign and partner organizations. Survivors, experts, and community leaders gathered to testify before the public and the media about how climate change is already devastating lives—and to call on the Environmental Protection Agency to halt dangerous rollbacks to climate protections. My testimony was one of many personal accounts underscoring that the climate crisis is real, urgent, and hitting home now.

As a trustee of Pasadena City College, I have also seen how disasters like these ripple through a community. Fires, extreme heat, and toxic air don’t just damage homes—they disrupt education, threaten health, and upend the lives of students, faculty, and staff. At PCC, we work to connect our students’ dreams to a brighter, more secure future. But that future is under threat if we don’t act decisively to curb the pollution fueling the climate crisis.

The Environmental Protection Agency was created in 1970 with overwhelming bipartisan support to protect our health and our environment. For decades, it has been a bulwark against the pollution driving climate change. The EPA’s Endangerment Finding, established in 2009, is grounded in rigorous science and requires the agency to protect the public from greenhouse gases that threaten our lives.

Now, that protection is under direct attack. The administration’s plan to roll back the Endangerment Finding and weaken climate pollution standards would be a catastrophic step backward. It would make climate denial official U.S. policy—leaving more families vulnerable to disasters like the one that uprooted mine.

If these rollbacks succeed, more people will suffer. More homes will be reduced to ash. More communities will face the trauma of evacuation, the loss of stability, and the grief of starting over. We can’t afford to let that happen.

We must stand together to defend the EPA’s mission. Climate change is not a distant threat—it is here, it is real, and it is devastating lives right now. I’ve lived through it. And I’m determined to ensure that what happened to me never happens to you.

The EPA must reverse course, uphold the Endangerment Finding, and protect the climate standards that safeguard our health, our safety, and our future—including the future of our community college students, who deserve to inherit a world where their education can prepare them for opportunity, not survival. Anything less would be a betrayal of the American people.

The number of funds net long stocks in the First Trust Global Wind Energy ETF reached a 30-month high in February this year.
After losing about half its value between the end of 2021 and 2023, the Solactive Select China Green Energy Index — which includes solar giant Longi Green Energy Technology Co. — has advanced around 19% from an April low.
For green investors, it’s been “less bad than expected,” said Nishant Gupta, founder and chief investment officer of Kanou Capital LLP, an energy transition-focused hedge fund.
“There’s been more protection around US domestic production than expected.” And this year’s tariff wars have coincided with a broad rebound in green stocks.","Hedge funds are betting against oil stocks and winding back shorts on solar in a reversal of positions that dominated their energy strategies over the past four years.

Since the beginning of October and through the second quarter, equity-focused hedge funds have — on average — been mostly short oil stocks, according to a analysis of positions on companies in global indexes for sectors spanning oil, wind, solar and electric vehicles. That’s a reversal of bets that had dominated since 2021, according to the data, which are based on fund disclosures to Hazeltree, an alternative-investment data specialist.

Over the same period, funds have unwound short bets against solar stocks. The analysis, which is based on a universe of some 700 hedge funds representing about $700 billion in assets — or roughly 15% of the industry’s total under management — also shows that portfolio managers have stayed net long wind in the period.

There has been “a bottoming out with some of these clean energy plays,” said Todd Warren, portfolio manager at Tribeca Investment Partners Pty. That trend has “really occurred at the same time as we’ve seen — in the oil patch — some concerns with regards to supply and demand balance,” he said.

The analysis shows that more hedge funds were, on average, net short stocks in the S&P Global Oil Index than net long for seven of the nine months starting October 2024. By contrast, net longs exceeded net shorts in all but eight of the 45 months from January 2021 through September 2024.

The development coincides with a rise in oil supply as some OPEC+ member nations act to preserve their market share. Joe Mares, a portfolio manager at Trium Capital, a hedge fund managing about $3.5 billion, notes that ratcheting up output has “not historically been great” for the oil industry. Evidence of an economic slowdown in the US and China, combined with an expectation that global oil inventories will continue to rise through the rest of 2025, means there’s growing skepticism toward the sector.

Once investors take in “the general slowdown in everything,” the question then becomes, “who’s buying the oil?” said Kerry Goh, Singapore-based chief investment officer at Kamet Capital Partners Pte.

Greenwich, Connecticut-based Tall Trees Capital Management LP is short oil stocks because “we see much lower oil prices, especially in 2026,” said Lisa Audet, the fund’s founder and chief investment officer.

And in the US, President Donald Trump’s quest to add supply in an effort to bring down the price of oil has unsettled local producers.

The Dallas Fed’s latest quarterly energy survey, published on July 2, shows negative sentiment among oil companies toward the Trump administration’s policy on the fossil fuel. One respondent in the anonymized study said the administration’s implied price target of $50 a barrel is simply unsustainable for the industry. Another spoke of the “chaos” caused by current US trade policies, adding the volatility will drive companies to “lay down rigs.”

​​The analysis of Hazeltree’s data shows that the average share of funds that were net short stocks in the Invesco Solar ETF dropped to 3% in June. That’s the lowest percentage since April 2021, when green equities were trading near record highs. The number of funds net long stocks in the First Trust Global Wind Energy ETF reached a 30-month high in February this year. Those positions fell back in June, but net longs still dominated shorts overall.

Other hedge fund managers said AI has the potential to trigger a generational swell in energy demand that is likely to give new support to renewables.

“The market is telling you that AI is the biggest thing we’ve seen in our entire careers,” said Karim Moussalem, chief investment officer of equities at London-based Selwood Asset Management LLP, which manages about $1.6 billion. To meet energy demand from AI, renewables will need to play a big part, not least “because they’re the fastest to market,” he said. Renewables are likely to meet more than half of the required additional generation capacity by 2035, BloombergNEF said in a report last month.

In China, green stocks are now enjoying a rebound after its solar industry started addressing overcapacity concerns. After losing about half its value between the end of 2021 and 2023, the Solactive Select China Green Energy Index — which includes solar giant Longi Green Energy Technology Co. — has advanced around 19% from an April low.

according to an analysis from the E2 advocacy group.

number of fund managers, the decision to slash green subsidies helps end some of the policy uncertainty that had prevented investors from moving into wind and solar.

“At least now we know what the rules are going to be and so people can go back to evaluating these as businesses,” Mares said.

The final version of Trump’s $3.4 trillion budget bill — dubbed the One Big Beautiful Bill — was actually more favorable toward some corners of the renewables market than Tall Trees Capital’s Audet expected. Utility-scale solar, for example, has emerged as a relative winner, she said.

For green investors, it’s been “less bad than expected,” said Nishant Gupta, founder and chief investment officer of Kanou Capital LLP, an energy transition-focused hedge fund. “There’s been more protection around US domestic production than expected.”

And this year’s tariff wars have coincided with a broad rebound in green stocks. Since Trump first unveiled his proposed tariffs on April 2 — dubbed Liberation Day by the White House — the main S&P index tracking clean energy stocks has added about 18%. Over the same period, the main S&P index for oil companies is down around 4%.

Much of the clean-energy rebound has been driven by solar. The Invesco Solar ETF, a widely tracked exchange-traded fund packed with solar stocks, is up more than 18% since April 2.

More hedge funds continue to be short stocks in the Kraneshares Electric Vehicles and Future Mobility Index ETF than long — a constant since 2021 as China has steadily displaced Western manufacturers. But the share of net shorts dropped to 2.87% in June, which is the second-lowest level in almost half a decade.

At the same time, there’s an expectation among fund managers that the continued rise in sales of EVs globally will reduce the need for petroleum. That matches BloombergNEF estimates, which anticipate a 25% annual increase in EV sales this year. BNEF also expects that about 40% of vehicles on the road could be electric by 2040, displacing 19 million barrels of oil a day by that year.

The strategy shift among funds reflects the fact that economic growth without low-carbon energy is now inconceivable, according to Trium’s Mares.

“If we are going to continue to grow both in developed and emerging economies, we’re going to need a lot of energy,” he said. “A big chunk of the marginal growth in energy over the last 10 years has come from renewables and it’s hard to see why that isn’t going to continue.”

Fortunately, Minnesota has tools at its disposal to continue advancing solar despite the void in federal leadership.
State lawmakers and the Walz Administration can step in by passing a state-level solar tax credit to help bridge the gap.
Additionally, they can enact instant permitting legislation to simplify and accelerate rooftop solar installations on homes and businesses.
It’s a massive undertaking that cannot — and will not — be achieved affordably without significantly expanding distributed solar.","Last month’s congressional passage of the One Big Beautiful Bill slammed the brakes on America’s rooftop solar momentum — a move that will raise energy bills, eliminate jobs and slow our response to the climate crisis at a time when we can only afford to accelerate. Now, the path to an affordable and livable energy future depends on state and local leadership here in Minnesota.

The bill terminates the 30% federal solar tax credit for homeowners — a popular and effective incentive that has been instrumental in expanding clean energy and access across the United States. Its removal will cancel thousands of solar projects currently in the queue and put clean energy out of financial reach for millions of Americans seeking smart, cost-effective energy solutions.

This will make achieving Minnesota’s 100% carbon-free electricity goal by 2040 even more difficult, especially as the state braces for massive demand increases driven by AI data centers coming online in the next decade. And why, you might ask, would anyone choose to eliminate such a proven policy? To provide an unprecedented tax giveaway for billionaires and high-wealth individuals.

Alongside the decline in solar development will come job losses. Early analysis from the Energy Innovation Lab predicts the bill could slash up to 840,000 clean energy jobs by 2030 and an additional 790,000 by 2035. These are not just statistics — they represent a vital and growing segment of Minnesota’s workforce. In 2023, Minnesota had over 62,000 clean energy jobs—71% of which were small businesses. These are often well-paying, family-supporting positions that offer a pathway to the middle class.

Undermining the growth of America’s most affordable energy sources — wind and solar —will also raise utility costs, dealing a blow to households trying to reduce expenses. Phasing out these tax credits alone could drive a 13% increase in electricity bills for Minnesotans by 2029, with some states facing hikes as high as 30%. These rising costs will fall hardest on low-income Minnesotans who are already struggling under the weight of frequent rate hikes and ongoing inflation.

Fortunately, Minnesota has tools at its disposal to continue advancing solar despite the void in federal leadership. Our state has a strong base of solar policy and a lineup of new bills ready to move.

State lawmakers and the Walz Administration can step in by passing a state-level solar tax credit to help bridge the gap. Minnesota launched one of the nation’s first community solar programs and should continue to grow and safeguard it from threats. Lawmakers can also uphold our net metering policy, which fairly compensates solar owners for the energy they share back with the grid. Additionally, they can enact instant permitting legislation to simplify and accelerate rooftop solar installations on homes and businesses.

Virtual Power Plants (VPPs) offer another promising path forward. By connecting distributed resources like rooftop solar, batteries and smart appliances, VPPs help manage demand, boost reliability, and reduce energy costs for participants — all while supporting the broader grid. With major electricity demand growth looming — driven by AI data centers, manufacturing expansion and widespread electrification — Minnesota must adopt forward-thinking policies to meet that need while also hitting our 2040 climate targets. It’s a massive undertaking that cannot — and will not — be achieved affordably without significantly expanding distributed solar.

Xcel Energy, Minnesota’s largest investor-owned utility, recognizes this reality. That’s why the company is pivoting toward distributed resources and signaling a new approach that treats wind, solar and battery storage as essential elements of the energy mix. Xcel’s Distributed Capacity Procurement (DCP) — the first initiative of its kind — could meaningfully scale local solar and clean energy resources to meet peak demand while delivering tangible benefits to communities.

The program will be most successful if it includes a diverse mix of distributed solutions —like community and rooftop solar, battery storage, and smart appliances — not just one technology type. We hope Xcel’s proposal reflects that full potential.

While federal leadership retreats from its responsibility to the public and the planet, states like Minnesota can and must lead the way. Our carbon-free electricity mandate, landmark community solar program and strong net metering protections provide a solid launchpad for future policy.

By continuing to pass ambitious policies, holding utilities accountable for climate action, and investing in equitable, community-driven energy solutions, Minnesota can chart a path toward a cleaner, more just and more affordable energy future for all.

Data centers also offer major untapped potential for sustainable water solutions.
Traditionally, data centers are criticized for providing few long-term jobs.
By integrating greenhouse agriculture and carbon capture, data centers can significantly expand employment opportunities.","In late July, the Trump administration released its long-awaited AI Action Plan, which includes steps to cut environmental requirements and streamline permitting policies to make it easier to build data centers and power infrastructure.

But even with massive deregulation, the fact remains: we have no idea where we’ll find all the energy, water, and grid capacity to meet the enormous speed and scale of the emerging AI revolution.

Recently, experts from the International Energy Agency estimated that electricity use from data centers could more than double in the next five years. By 2030, these facilities could use nearly 9% of all electricity in the United States. Without major investments, this growth will strain our power grid and lead to higher energy bills for everyone.

And it’s not just energy. Globally, by 2027, water consumption from AI alone is estimated to reach the equivalent of more than half the annual water usage of the U.K. Researchers at the University of California, Riverside, estimate that a ChatGPT user session that involves a series of between 5 and 50 prompts or questions can consume up to 500 milliliters of water (about the amount in a 16-ounce bottle). Google used a fifth more water in 2022 compared to 2021 as it ramped up its artificial intelligence work. Microsoft’s water usage increased by 34% over the same period. On top of all this, many communities are protesting or rejecting data center construction due to factors like noise disturbances and limited job-creation benefits.

It’s easy to feel overwhelmed by the scale of the task before us as a nation, especially considering that winning the AI race with China requires overcoming all these constraints, quickly. But the answer isn’t despair, or even just deregulation. We need to innovate. Let’s imagine and build data centers that stack as many functions as possible for sustainability, efficiency, and even social good.

While the most obvious sustainability move for data centers is clean energy, permitting wait times and baseload requirements mean many new constructions are developing “behind-the-meter” power plants with natural gas. Even these systems can transform their environmental impact. Imagine if data centers could capture waste heat and CO₂ and put it to the best possible use—for example, fueling nearby industrial-scale greenhouses that grow fresh, high-quality food. The CO₂ emissions, when introduced into greenhouses, could accelerate photosynthesis, significantly boosting crop yields. Heat captured from servers can also keep greenhouses warm year-round. In other words, you could grow local tomatoes, lettuce, and herbs in the middle of a Northeast or Midwest winter by harnessing data center emissions. Because data centers often choose less populated areas for affordable land and available space, these projects could provide fresh produce to rural food deserts, addressing nutritional gaps and stimulating local economies.

In summer months, when greenhouses require less CO₂, innovative data centers could convert excess emissions into clean hydrogen fuel. Emerging carbon-capture and electrolysis technologies can transform emissions into hydrogen, which could power backup systems, fuel cells, or even local transit. Likewise, organic waste from the greenhouses could be composted or converted into biochar onsite, enriching soils, sequestering carbon, and further contributing to local agriculture. Multiple sustainability functions can be creatively “stacked,” maximizing environmental benefits and turning traditional liabilities into assets.

Data centers also offer major untapped potential for sustainable water solutions. Their expansive, flat roofs—often exceeding 100,000 square feet—are ideal for rainwater harvesting. Just one inch of rain on a 50,000-square-foot roof can yield over 31,000 gallons of water, significantly offsetting cooling demands and reducing dependence on local municipal sources. This harvested rainwater can directly irrigate adjacent greenhouses, creating further efficiencies. Tech giants like Google and Microsoft are already starting to demonstrate the value of this straightforward yet promising approach.

Traditionally, data centers are criticized for providing few long-term jobs. Construction might employ up to 1,500 people temporarily, but ongoing operations usually support only about 50 permanent workers. By integrating greenhouse agriculture and carbon capture, data centers can significantly expand employment opportunities. These integrated campuses could provide apprenticeships, educational programs, and hands-on training in data operations, energy management, sustainable agriculture, and related fields. This approach would promote diverse, long-term job creation and deeper community integration, ensuring more meaningful local benefits.

Right now, we’re embarking on the biggest infrastructure development project in multiple generations. We need to think seriously about the choices we’re making regarding emissions, water, and local economies. We’ve done this kind of big thinking before. When America needed cheap power in the 1930s, we built the Tennessee Valley Authority and strung wires to virtually every farmhouse through the Rural Electrification Act. When commerce demanded speed, we carved the Erie Canal and later laced the continent with the Interstate Highway System. When the Cold War called for a moonshot, we answered with Apollo—turning slide-rule sketches into a lunar landing in less than a decade and achieving scores of technological innovations along the way. Each project looked audacious at the outset. Each rewrote what was possible.

AI infrastructure now demands a leap of similar scale. If we pair data center capacity with on-site microgrids, rain-harvesting roofs, carbon-fed greenhouses, hydrogen production, workforce academies, and other innovations, we can meet the demands of AI without undermining communities or nature.

President Trump’s new AI Action Plan includes some sensible and important steps, including expediting permitting for some data centers and semiconductor fabs as well as new initiatives to boost needed occupations like electricians and HVAC technicians. Yet any comprehensive plan to address the AI challenge needs much more serious attention to questions like energy and water sustainability as well as community resilience. The AI infrastructure race can be a positive opportunity for society, but we need to get creative","https://images.fastcompany.com/image/upload/f_webp,q_auto,c_fit,w_1024,h_1024/wp-cms-2/2025/08/p-1-91382446-Tech-POV-Lets-Imagine-the-Data-Center-of-Our-Dreams.jpg",N,,2025-08-11 08:04:46.243149

This broad coverage ensures that drivers can get mobile charging 24/7 — whether they’re stranded on the side of a highway, in a busy downtown, or running a large fleet that can’t afford downtime.

Partnerships with Top Automakers

Bee Charged EV is currently in discussions with major car brands — including Lucid, Mercedes-Benz, Lexus, and Hyundai — to integrate free mobile charging into their ownership programs.

The idea is simple but groundbreaking: include emergency mobile charging as a standard perk for new EV owners, much like roadside towing has been for decades. If finalized, these partnerships could help eliminate range anxiety for thousands of drivers nationwide.

More Than Just Emergencies

While Bee Charged EV is best known for roadside rescues, its services now extend far beyond that:

Level 3 Fast Charging Machines — Rapid on-site power for events, dealerships, and high-demand situations.

Fleet Charging Solutions — Tailored programs for corporate, delivery, and government fleets.

Entrepreneur Provider Program — A unique opportunity for local operators to join the network, creating new jobs and expanding coverage in their own communities.

This “one-stop shop” approach has made Bee Charged EV a go-to solution not just for individual drivers, but also for large businesses managing dozens or even hundreds of EVs.

First Stop Abroad: Mexico City

Bee Charged EV’s expansion isn’t stopping at the U.S. border. The company has officially launched in Mexico City, one of Latin America’s fastest-growing EV markets.

The Mexico City hub will serve both consumer drivers and commercial fleets, providing the same fast, mobile charging solutions that have made the company a leader in the U.S. It’s the first step in a long-term plan to connect North America and eventually expand into global markets.

Recognized by Industry Leaders

Industry experts and corporate clients alike have praised Bee Charged EV’s ability to deliver fast, reliable, and scalable service. Some have even dubbed it “the next AAA for EV drivers.”

That recognition comes not only from the company’s footprint but also from its responsiveness. In most areas, mobile units can be dispatched within minutes, and customers can track their arrival in real time.

Meeting the EV Challenge Head-On

As EV adoption accelerates, one challenge continues to loom: charging infrastructure. Traditional charging stations are costly, slow to install, and often concentrated in major cities — leaving many areas underserved.

Bee Charged EV solves this by flipping the model: instead of bringing drivers to the charger, the charger comes to them. That means no waiting in line, no detours, and no being stranded in the middle of nowhere.

This flexibility also boosts operational efficiency for fleets, helping them avoid downtime and keep vehicles on the road where they belong.

After President Donald Trump named him chair on Jan. 20, Christie entered the fray as a like-minded critic of Democratic policies: Coal plant closures were ill-conceived, wind and solar power weren’t reliable, and climate policy was the wrong thing for regulators to focus on, Christie said.

Before and after he became chair, Christie maintained a stubborn, almost evangelical belief in the states, arguing they’re better suited than federal regulators to chart the path for a nation that now requires more electricity and for consumers who may pay higher costs.

The veteran regulator from Virginia issued a famously scathing rebuke of former Chair Willie Phillips’ major policy effort, which sought to bring more federal order to the nation’s interstate grid planning process. Christie framed it as an effort to force a left-leaning clean energy agenda on politically conservative states.

But even as Christie hit the same notes as Trump, he could be out of step with the White House on questions of executive power over the agency. In an interview with POLITICO’s E&E News, Christie embraced a characterization from Albert Pollard, a former state lawmaker in Virginia, who said of Christie, “He’s no shrinking violet.”

When the Trump administration demanded that workers justify their jobs, Christie stepped in, writing a weekly letter on behalf of the entire agency instead of staff sending individual emails. Christie thinks the letters attest to the incredible work ethic of the agency, which publishes roughly three orders a day.

A White House official told POLITICO on Friday that Trump intends to elevate FERC Commissioner David Rosner to the role of chair. Rosner is a Biden-era Democratic appointee to the commission. Christie’s departure leaves FERC with a 2-1 Democratic majority. Trump has nominated White House adviser David LaCerte and energy attorney Laura Swett to the commission, awaiting Senate approval.

‘No longer on the horizon’

If there is one policy issue that defined Christie’s time at FERC — which began as a Republican commissioner in 2021 — it is grid reliability.

Christie became chair as the electricity and natural gas industries watched projected demand growth skyrocket. Tech giants planning massive artificial intelligence data centers from Ohio to Arizona changed the landscape for a utility business that had seen almost flat growth for decades.

In the mid-Atlantic and Midwest, and for dominant utilities in the South and West, the projected gap between supply and demand tightened considerably. AI training and cloud computing demands are expected to push electricity loads into uncharted territory.

“The horizon is no longer on the horizon,” Christie said. “It’s across the street. It’s here now.”

He traces the problem to a basic imbalance: retiring too much dispatchable generation — coal and gas plants — while failing to build enough new resources to replace them, especially in the PJM Interconnection, the sprawling grid serving the mid-Atlantic and Great Lakes regions.

“Dominion alone has 40 gigawatts of data center load sitting in its interconnection queue,” Christie noted, referring to the Virginia utility. “That’s a quarter of PJM’s entire peak.”

Christie said the sudden demand spike is breaking the assumptions behind traditional resource adequacy planning. With market incentives for new generation flagging, Christie sees a new model emerging — one driven by the tech sector’s need for near-perfect reliability.

“I call it BYOG — bring your own generation,” he said.

Rather than relying on markets to secure future electricity capacity, Amazon, Microsoft and others are striking power purchase agreements and investing directly in electric generation.

This trend, Christie warned, will intensify as data centers running AI programs require “10 to 15 times” the power of traditional cloud computing hubs. But it raises a crucial question: Who pays?

“The two most important questions in utility regulation are who pays and who profits,” Christie said. “States are going to have to grapple with how to allocate the costs.”

He pointed to Dominion’s pending request in Virginia to create a new customer class for data centers as a possible national bellwether. Such classes get power at different rates as a way to allocate a utility’s total costs and often include residential, commercial, or industrial users.

If Christie had a major disappointment, it wasn’t the brevity of his tenure but the commission’s inaction on transmission costs. “Transmission costs are now reaching the point of being the primary driver of people’s monthly bills,” he said. “FERC has failed to address them.”

Despite his efforts, Christie said he was unable to secure the necessary three votes to reform policies such as return-on-equity adders or formula rate presumptions.

He blamed “tremendous lobbying by the transmission owner industry,” which he said has little incentive to give up the generous financial terms they enjoy under current rules.

FERC independence

Christie recounted learning of his elevation to chair in a call from a Trump transition official while watching football at a cigar bar outside Richmond, Virginia. There were no demands, no preconditions — just a simple ask: Would he accept the appointment?

He did. And from his first press conference, Christie signaled he would be a more communicative chair, eager to consult with both federal and state energy policymakers.

He emphasized his relationship with Peter Lake, a former Texas utility regulator now working at the White House National Energy Dominance Council.

“They’ve been very appreciative to hear what we’re doing,” Christie said, stressing that no person from the administration attempted to interfere in pending cases. “It’s been what I wanted it to be.”

Previous FERC chairs have emphasized the rarity of FERC-White House communications. Jon Wellinghoff, who served under President Barack Obama, said he never got one phone call from the White House other than an initial introduction. Former Chair Richard Glick had regular meetings with a White House climate adviser under the Biden administration.

As Trump pushed out executive orders seeking to bring FERC and other agencies overseeing big business under White House control, Christie voiced support in principle for the administration’s goals while reiterating the necessity to adhere to the law. In response to an order to automatically repeal certain regulations unless they were renewed by the commission, Christie said the administration was right to seek a regulatory house cleaning. Yet he said the specifics of the order needed further scrutiny.

“Everything we do — whether it’s a rescission, whether it’s putting a sunset provision on it — has to be done in accordance with law. Otherwise, you’re just spinning your wheels,” Christie said in an April press briefing, warning that skipping proper procedures would almost certainly lead to reversals in federal court.

Christie declined to speculate on whether FERC will become more politicized, but he acknowledged growing concerns about executive overreach across independent agencies. “If a chief executive can fire members of a commission, it’s not independent,” he said. “The ability to be fired is the dividing line.”

Ultimately, Christie said, FERC’s fate may rest with the Supreme Court, which is considering a case testing the president’s ability to remove commissioners without cause. The White House asked Phillips, the chair under Biden, to resign earlier this year, and Phillips agreed to. At other agencies, like the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Trump has ordered commissioners dismissed.

Christie’s “gold standard for an independent agency” is his former employer, the Virginia State Corporation Commission.

“It’s done a wonderful job for 100-some years because it’s independent, because the governor doesn’t appoint, the governor can’t fire — and, frankly, no one can. The Legislature [could choose not to reelect] you every six years, but that’s it,” Christie said.

Yet Christie said the administration’s move to eliminate agency independence could have benefits. He said the current system is “an insider’s game” dominated by special interests that can afford lobbyists. Making FERC more beholden to an elected president, he said, might push the agency to prioritize the general public.",https://static.politico.com/dims4/default/55a1666/2147483647/resize/1200/quality/100/?url=https://static.politico.com/d3/73/9c696c27447eb94c22171b217716/federal-energy-regulatory-commission-68746.jpg,N,,2025-08-11 08:03:49.379868

This development potentially positions the facility as America’s first commercial nuclear reactor to resume operations after decommissioning.

The 800MW nuclear plant’s revival is contingent on approvals by the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC).

The financial assistance was given by former President Joe Biden’s Loan Programs Office initiative, which aims to bolster emissions-free nuclear power amid increasing electricity demands driven by data centres and AI advancements.

Constellation Energy revealed its plans to reopen Three Mile Island, the site of a historic partial nuclear meltdown in 1979. They anticipate this Pennsylvania-based plant could be operational by 2027, roughly one year ahead of initial projections.

In 2022, Entergy permanently shut down the Palisades nuclear plant after more than 50 years of operation.

The closure occurred two weeks earlier than planned due to a malfunction with a control rod, despite a $6bn federal initiative aimed at supporting reactors facing financial challenges.

This coincided with President Donald Trump signing executive orders expediting new nuclear licenses and reforming NRC procedures.

In July 2025, Holtec obtained NRC approval for fuel loading into the Palisades’ reactor.

However, multiple licensing actions and prerequisites remain under NRC review before Palisades can recommence operations under its original licence, valid until 2031.

Holtec is currently repairing the steam generators at Palisades due to a failure to adhere to standard maintenance procedures during the plant’s shutdown.

Holtec emphasised its goal to restart the plant in the fourth quarter of 2025.

US DOE Secretary Chris Wright stated: “Thanks to President Trump, the Department of Energy is working in tandem with our regulatory partners to accelerate the reopening of the Palisades nuclear plant and unleash a true American nuclear renaissance.

“These efforts will help reinvigorate our nuclear industrial base, deliver lower energy costs for millions of Americans and strengthen our nation’s energy security.”

Since announcing financial closure in September 2024, this fifth disbursement brings total DoE-guaranteed loan funds released to Holtec for Palisades’ reopening efforts to $335m.

These funds are instrumental as Holtec progresses towards meeting regulatory requirements and transitioning from decommissioning back into operation.",https://live-b2b-gdm-figaro1.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/sites/21/2025/08/DOE-Shutterstock_2056673918.jpg,N,,2025-08-11 08:04:56.738516

Solar grazing is a win/win for sheep farmers, the environment, and Fayette County residents.","Solar energy projects and farming operations have something in common — they each require large, relatively flat tracts of land. At one point, this shared need seemed to put the two in opposition to each other. Any land that would be good for farming would also be good for non-polluting renewable energy infrastructure, but only one of these uses was possible.

In my 20 years raising sheep, I have seen this dynamic change for the better, especially within recent years. It turns out that using the same land for clean energy production and farming is not only possible, but mutually beneficial.

I attend the American Sheep Industry Association Annual Convention every year. It’s always been a great opportunity to discuss everything from best practices for raising sheep to promising new markets for lamb and wool. However, people at the most recent ASI Convention were talking about a new topic: the promise of solar development for sheep farmers and ranchers like me.

Farmers and ranchers discussing energy infrastructure in the past were often worried about how the development of a project like a solar farm would negatively impact farmland. At the last ASI Annual Convention, however, conversations were about how solar was revitalizing farmland, and farming opportunities along with it.

These agrivoltaics projects, which combine agricultural and solar energy-producing operations, are opening up options for Kentucky’s farmers and ranchers. Over the multi-decade lifespan of a project, shepherds with solar grazing contracts can see their flocks flourish and grow. Rotational grazing practices improve the land through regular cycles of foraging and fertilization, followed by rest. After a few years, the soil is in better shape than it would be if the land had remained untouched. One sheep solar grazer reported a 300% increase in soil organic matter after multiple years of sheep rotational grazing at that site.

These solar installations have about a 40-year life. After that, they can be removed and the farm land restored—whereas a housing development is never going back to being farm land.

Today’s sheep ranchers view solar grazing sites as a pathway for us to access more grazing land and get paid to graze it. Solar grazing contracts provide shepherds with a long-term, new, steady source of income and also with the opportunity to increase their lamb production and income with sales to restaurants and grocery stores, like we do at Four Hills Farm. Our farm and the farms we work with have sold lamb to local and regional grocery stores for 16 years (see our lamb at Whole Foods Markets in Kentucky and Ohio).

As Lexington and Fayette County’s Council considers the current Zoning Ordinance Text Amendment, I urge them to take into account the opportunity that a ZOTA allowing for agrivoltaics projects can support local farmers while also providing much needed clean energy to help power our daily lives.

As a former president of the Kentucky Sheep and Wool Producers’ Association, I know there are sheep farmers in Kentucky that would jump on the opportunity to expand their grazing land and be paid a steady income to manage the vegetation on a large solar site.

That is why developers, financiers, insurers, and downstream players must enforce batch-level reliability testing.
So we need experienced technical leadership, focused R&D, and long-term investments in skill-building, especially as India begins scaling its cell manufacturing base.","In an interview on the sidelines of the Mercom India Renewables Summit 2025 held in New Delhi on July 24 and 25, 2025, Sishir Garemella, Head of International Business Development at Kiwa PVEL, shared his insights into the evolving landscape of solar module reliability and manufacturing quality.

He stressed that success in global markets depends not only on high-quality products but also on consistent, well-executed manufacturing processes, automation, and workforce training. As India rapidly scales up both module and cell production, Garemella advised manufacturers to prioritize reliability testing and technical talent development.

Please provide an overview of the services Kiva PVEL provides.

Kiva PVEL is a globally recognized reliability testing lab headquartered in California. We operate two labs, one in California and another in China. The Chinese lab primarily tests modules from Chinese manufacturers, while our Napa facility in California handles modules sourced from the rest of the world.

One of our core offerings is the Product Qualification Program, which we revise every few years to reflect the latest trends and challenges in module reliability. This program replicates real-world environmental stresses such as heat, humidity, and UV exposure. It spans a six-month period and includes a range of rigorous test legs to evaluate whether modules can genuinely deliver on their 25 to 30-year warranty promises.

We have seen TOPCon modules achieve higher efficiencies than Mono PERC, but they also show higher degradation in Indian conditions. Why is that?

Yes, TOPCon is a relatively newer technology, whereas Mono PERC has been around for a while and is more established. In our testing, TOPCon modules have exhibited an issue called UV-induced degradation (UVID).

The industry has not yet pinpointed the exact cause of this degradation. It could stem from the cell itself, the encapsulant, or a combination of factors. In some cases, the degradation appears to reverse when the module is kept in the dark and re-flashed. It is still an open area of investigation. That said, all modules, regardless of technology, undergo the same environmental reliability testing.

How do Indian modules compare with those from Western manufacturers under lab testing?

Indian modules are generally on par with global counterparts in terms of long-term reliability. However, as with any market where manufacturing is relatively new, including India, Laos, Indonesia, or even the U.S., we notice slightly more quality assurance (QA) and quality control issues.

These are not structural failures but are indicative of the early-stage learning curve. As the industry matures and production stabilizes, these issues tend to decline. Overall, Indian manufacturers are holding up well under our reliability standards.

What do Indian module manufacturers need to focus on to compete on the global stage?

Two critical factors define long-term performance. One is the bill of materials (BOM). Choosing the right materials is foundational. The second is the manufacturing process. Even with the same BOM, different manufacturers can get drastically different results based on their operational practices.

One of my colleagues puts it nicely: If you and I bake a cake using the same recipe, we could still end up with completely different cakes. It is not just about the ingredients. It is about how skilled your workforce is, how automated your line is, and how tightly you control process variables. Indian companies that invest in both quality materials and robust manufacturing practices are already doing quite well.

India is scaling up module and cell manufacturing rapidly. How can quality be ensured during this expansion?

I have two key suggestions, one conventional and one slightly unconventional. First is the need for more testing and accountability. As the industry scales, there is more at stake. India is no longer a small-volume market. We are talking about 95-plus GW of module capacity. If something goes wrong with even a single 200 MW project, the financial exposure is significant. That is why developers, financiers, insurers, and downstream players must enforce batch-level reliability testing. Whether the testing happens in India or at our labs in the U.S. or China, the point is to embed this into the procurement and financing process.

Second is a focus on talent development. This is less discussed but critically important. Module manufacturing is process-heavy. It is like running a well-organized assembly line where attention to detail and a trained workforce matter. Cell manufacturing, on the other hand, is quite different. It is more like cooking, where minor changes in the recipe can lead to very different outcomes. A pinch of something added today might not behave the same tomorrow. So we need experienced technical leadership, focused R&D, and long-term investments in skill-building, especially as India begins scaling its cell manufacturing base. In summary, process control, skilled workforce, and technical expertise are just as important as speed and scale.",https://d382rz2cea0pah.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/sishir-1.jpg,N,,2025-08-11 08:04:03.206002

Terra Firma Energy (TFE) has launched a strategic review to evaluate how it can continue to support the UK energy system. Currently, the private company has a portfolio of operational and under construction gas peaking plants, supported by long term Capacity Market contracts.

Zach Dodds-Brown, development director at Terra Firma Energy, explained that the strategic review will “define how we continue to lead in reliability, while exploring new frontiers such as battery storage, low-carbon fuels, and digital optimisation”.

According to TFE, the review will examine ‘organic and inorganic’ opportunities, including utility-scale BESS, acquisition of operating assets, integration of green hydrogen and carbon capture technologies, and establishing an in-house asset management platform to “drive efficiency”.

Peaking plants, typically powered by gas turbines, switch on at times of high electricity demand to support the grid. As increasing amounts of intermittent renewable generation comes online, fast-response assets will be required to meet peak demand at times when generation may be low.

“The UK energy market is changing rapidly, and so are the needs of the system,” said Dodds-Brown, adding that TFE’s “flexible generation assets already play a vital role in balancing intermittent renewables”.

He added: “Flexible, fast-responding energy will remain critical as we shift to a renewable-powered grid,” added Zach. “TFE’s mission is to be the partner of choice for that transition — not just keeping the lights on, but doing it in a smarter, cleaner way.”

In the National Energy System Operator’s (NESO’s) Future Energy Scenarios (FES) 2025, all of the pathways that achieve net zero by 2050 need significant supply side flexibility (as provided by peaker plants), across various technology types.

For supply side flexibility through energy storage, battery energy storage growth is increased in FES 2025’s medium and long term capacity projections: from 29GW-36GW to 31GW-40GW in 2050.

Hydrogen storage also features in the pathways set out by NESO.

Statewide, rates increased by nearly 3% from May 2024 to May 2025.

On Thursday, Evers sent a letter to EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin calling on the Trump administration to abandon efforts to terminate Solar for All grants.
“I don’t think any previous administration has done, so across the board, what the Trump administration has done to take back promises from the federal government,” she said.
“Each solar panel that we have that’s powering the grid of Wisconsin makes us less vulnerable to those (demand) peaks.”","Gov. Tony Evers is urging the Trump administration not to end a program that awarded Wisconsin more than $60 million to help low- and moderate-income families access solar energy.

The New York Times reports the Trump administration was preparing to terminate $7 billion in federal grants awarded through the Solar for All program.

According to the Times report, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency planned to send termination letters to 60 organizations that received grants from the program, funded by a Biden-era climate law.

One of those organizations is the Wisconsin Economic Development Corp. WEDC was awarded $62.4 million in 2024 as part of the Solar for All program. As of Friday afternoon, the agency had not received a formal notification from the EPA that the funding had been terminated, according to WEDC Secretary Missy Hughes.

The agency has been developing guidelines for how to administer the program, dubbing it “PowerUp Wisconsin.” The program would support solar projects on single- and multi-family homes, as well as community solar projects.

On Thursday, Evers sent a letter to EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin calling on the Trump administration to abandon efforts to terminate Solar for All grants. Evers wrote there’s “no legitimate purpose or justification” for terminating the grants.

Doing so, the governor said, would “negatively impact Wisconsinites,” by increasing energy bills and hampering the state’s efforts to “improve air quality, boost resilience and create good-paying jobs.”

He said the program could serve up to 7,400 Wisconsin households, saving each of those households up to $500 per year.

“At a time when energy demand continues to increase, it is unfathomable for the Trump Administration to unnecessarily — and potentially illegally — terminate funding for a program designed to deploy affordable, renewable energy systems,” Evers wrote.

Earlier in the year, the program had been in limbo due to a federal funding freeze. This summer, Hughes said WEDC solicited proposals to find someone to provide “subject matter expertise and technical assistance.” Those proposals are due by the end of the month.

She said the agency planned to first focus on funding solar for single-family homes and hoped to get the program fully “up and running” by the start of the next construction season in the spring.

She also said a “very little” portion of the $62 million has already been spent on administrative costs, and the federal government had allowed that money to be spent.

“There was somebody who was still responding to us, and we were still working and developing the program with the EPA,” Hughes said. “We thought, based on what we had heard from the federal government and from the EPA, that this program was going to be one of the ones that was moving forward.”

The Wisconsin chapter of conservative advocacy group Americans for Prosperity criticized Evers’ letter to the Trump administration and the Solar for All program.

AFP-Wisconsin State Director Megan Novak said in a statement that grants for “intermittent energy sources like solar” do not lower costs and “drive up costs for everyone else.”

“President Trump is right to question the wisdom of taxpayer-subsidized energy programs that rig the market,” Novak stated. “Dismantling these costly drivers ensures a level playing field for all energy sources so families can benefit from lower prices, not politically favored technologies.”

Hughes said she disagreed with the notion that the Solar for All program was politically motivated and argued the Trump administration’s actions to dismantle the program were political.

Over the last six months, Hughes said the current administration has felt it’s “appropriate to renege on obligations” the federal government made to states.

“I don’t think any previous administration has done, so across the board, what the Trump administration has done to take back promises from the federal government,” she said.

Heather Allen, senior policy director for Chicago-based clean energy nonprofit Elevate, said the program would make a difference for the low- and moderate-income families that it was expected to support by using solar installations to reduce their electric bills.

Terminating the program’s funding would mean those households will have less money to spend on groceries, medicine and for supporting their children, she said.

“Now is the time to invest in our communities and to lower energy costs for hard-working families,” Allen said. “It is not the time to take one of the most simple, accessible, rapidly deployable tools, like solar, out of the hands of the people who need it most.”

In addition to helping families, Allen said the program would’ve helped take some pressure off of the grid at a time when utilities are expecting to see major increases in electricity demand from data center development.

“Every time we can reduce the demand for energy in the state of Wisconsin, we have less burden on our utilities to build more fossil fuel-fired power plants,” she said. “Each solar panel that we have that’s powering the grid of Wisconsin makes us less vulnerable to those (demand) peaks.”",https://www.wpr.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/AP25181610588399.jpg,N,,2025-08-11 08:04:07.912019

No longer.. North Carolina, like the rest of the world, is experiencing firsthand the dangerous effects of climate change.","This famous saying used to be true: “Everybody talks about the weather, but nobody does anything about it.”

Now the Trump administration is doing something about it – but not what you hoped for.

The administration has removed the National Climate Assessment from government websites and is planning to update – read “rewrite” – it. Presumably, the revisions will weaken the evidence of climate change and give credence to those who deny its dangers, most notably President Trump.

But in North Carolina, the weather – unlike congressional Republicans – is not complying with Trump.

This summer in North Carolina is producing vivid evidence of a changing climate. Records are being set for heat and rainfall is also nearing records.

Based on the overnight low temperatures, last month was the state’s warmest July on record, according to the State Climate Office. On July 18, the low was just 80°F, which is tied for the warmest night ever recorded at RDU International Airport dating back to 1944.

This summer had 48 days where the temperature reached at least 90°F, which is tied for the fourth-most such days through this point in the season. The top five warmest Julys ever recorded in the state have come since 2011.

Rainfall is up, too. An early tropical storm – Chantal – deluged central North Carolina in early July. Orange and Chatham counties saw more than 10 inches of rainfall – more than the total rain from Hurricane Fran in 1996. The Haw and Eno rivers exceeded their record crests, which were set during Fran.

Since June 1, rain gauges at RDU have recorded seven days with at least 1 inch of rain. The record for June through August is nine days. That record could fall by Aug. 31.

July’s high heat and heavy rain follows a June that included a searing heat wave. Raleigh set a record high of 100°F on June 24 and it tied the daily record on June 23, when it also hit 100°F.

“You look at these extreme conditions and you realize they are pretty uncommon, but they are becoming more common,” said Corey Davis, assistant state climatologist.

Davis said conditions are ripe for an active hurricane season in North Carolina.

The increasingly extreme weather calls for stronger preparation, but the Trump administration is doing the opposite.

It ended the Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities program, a change that could cost North Carolina $225 million in grants aimed at reducing the state’s vulnerability to storm damage. Twenty states, including North Carolina, have sued to force the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to restore the program.

“In North Carolina, we know what it takes to rebuild from a disaster,” state Attorney General Jeff Jackson said in a News & Observer report. “This money helps us better prepare for future storms. FEMA was wrong to break the law and cancel this money, which will save lives.”

The Trump administration thinks that warnings about the dangers arising from climate change are fake news.

In a Wall Street Journal podcast, U.S. Secretary of Energy Chris Wright discussed what the newspaper summarized as ”the upsides of warming, the minimal economic effects of climate change, the limits of U.S. policy actions and the lack of evidence that climate (change) is related to the frequency or intensity of extreme weather.”

The climate is changing slightly, Wright concedes, but there’s nothing to fear.

“If you look at the deaths from extreme weather, they’ve just declined like a stone throughout the last 100 years, including in the last 20 or 30 years,” Wright said in his conversation with the Journal’s Kim Strassel. “So your risk of dying from extreme weather is the lowest we’ve ever had data on, but yet 20% of kids report nightmares about fears of climate change. How do those go together?”

Maybe someone in western North Carolina can explain how they go together. When Hurricane Helene swept through the mountainous area in September 2024, flooding, landslides and the general chaos resulted in more than 100 deaths and the highest storm damage cost in the state’s history.

The area had been considered a haven from the worst effects of climate change. No longer..

Trump has pledged to roll back many incentives his predecessor, Joe Biden, offered to SAF and other green energy projects.
Velocys has yet to sell a drop of green jet fuel to IAG or any other airline.","PARAMOUNT, California - In 2019, Scott Kirby, the chief executive of United Airlines, hailed its new contract with green jet fuel producer World Energy as an example for the aviation industry to follow in its drive to cut emissions.

Six years later, that collaboration is dead.

Boston-based World Energy was one of the first companies in the world to produce commercial quantities of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), a type of renewable fuel made from sources such as used cooking oil, agricultural residues and other waste.

Its Paramount refinery near downtown Los Angeles had been a rare success story, supplying millions of gallons of SAF a year to airlines such as United Airlines and fellow U.S. carrier JetBlue Airways. The plant, which began operations in 2016, was central to the carriers’ pledges to help the airline industry switch to a blend of 10% SAF by the end of this decade.

But the refinery quietly ceased operations in April. And World Energy’s plans for a second plant in Houston have stalled amid a lack of commitment from the industry, according to Chief Executive Gene Gebolys.

“Some airlines were engaged in a pretty disingenuous effort to put out press releases” overstating their commitment to SAF projects, Gebolys said, without naming any companies. “People sometimes said too much in the past and did too little.”

Still, Gebolys acknowledged that some airlines have made a genuine effort to support SAF producers, while governments also needed to step up with stronger incentives to drive progress.

The termination of United’s fuel purchase contract with World Energy - and the closure of the Paramount refinery - have not previously been reported.

United Airlines said it ended its relationship with World Energy “a few years ago”, without providing a reason. A JetBlue spokesperson said World Energy has been a “valued partner” since 2020 and it will continue working with the company.

World Energy’s struggles mirror the plight of dozens of clean fuel startups, according to a Reuters review of the sector. Nearly 20 years after the first commercial flight powered partly by biofuels made the short hop from London to Amsterdam, Reuters found that the airline industry’s plans to go green before regulators start penalising them are little more than a pipe dream.

No clear pathway

The International Air Transport Association (IATA), a global body that represents 340 airlines, forecasts SAF will account for 0.7% of total jet fuel this year, up from 0.3% in 2024. Air passenger traffic, meanwhile, is expected to rise 6% this year, IATA says.

IATA has set a goal of net zero emissions by 2050, a target that would require airlines to ramp up SAF use to 118 billion gallons annually, a more than 300-fold increase from current production.

Airline industry leaders point to a wave of new SAF initiatives they say will spark a boom similar to the rapid rise of electric vehicles and solar energy.

However, the aviation sector has yet to publish a comprehensive roadmap or a transparent database of upcoming SAF projects that would allow regulators and the public to assess the credibility of these projections.

To scrutinise the industry’s claims, Reuters built its own database of airline SAF initiatives - offering the most comprehensive view yet of the sector’s faltering green progress and revealing that the industry has no clear pathway to hitting net zero targets.

While airlines have announced 165 SAF projects over the past 12 years, only 36 have materialized, Reuters found. Among those, Reuters uncovered problems at three of the largest - including World Energy - that exemplify the systemic challenges plaguing the SAF sector.

If all the pending projects announced by airlines reached their maximum potential, it would only add 12 billion gallons of SAF production, the Reuters analysis found. That’s about 10% of what’s needed to hit the net zero target.

Airlines pin the problems on the oil industry, saying it isn’t producing enough fuel.

“These guys are the cause of the problem, and they’ve got to start playing their part,” said Willie Walsh, director of IATA, the global airline lobby, and a former chief executive of British Airways and its parent International Airlines Group.

At the moment, SAF costs three to five times more than jet fuel and some oil company executives argue that there is limited demand from airlines at current prices.

“I’d like there to be a shortage. I actually see an overcapacity,” Bernard Pinatel, the head of downstream and marketing and services at TotalEnergies, told a press briefing in June.

Paramount ‘reset’

The Paramount refinery, which used cooking oil and animal fat from a local abattoir to make fuel, repeatedly stumbled in its efforts to expand and all 35 employees were laid off in April, two sources with direct knowledge of the matter said.

The future of the plant is uncertain, the two people said, after World Energy’s partner, Air Products, withdrew from the project in February, citing challenging commercial conditions tied to the expansion and operations. Air Products, a U.S. industrial gases and chemicals company, had been slated to lead a $2 billion expansion of the site.

World Energy CEO Gebolys said Paramount’s closure was a “reset” because the refurbishment was over budget and behind schedule. He said it would come back online, without giving a time frame. He declined to comment about the layoffs.

According to more than a dozen people directly involved in the sector, airlines play minimal roles in the execution of projects and, in most cases, their only commitment is to buy SAF when their partners produce it.

What’s more, airlines are making bold projections about SAF use and emissions reductions based on unproven technologies or early-stage projects run by startups with no experience of commercial production, Reuters found.

Of the 36 projects that have produced any SAF, all but one rely on the Hydroprocessed Esters and Fatty Acids (HEFA) process to convert waste oils, fats and grease into jet fuel. HEFA was the technology used at Paramount.

However, HEFA plants are severely constrained by the limited availability of suitable raw materials and cannot meet the industry’s long-term fuel demands, three industry specialists said.

IATA chief economist and sustainability executive Marie Owens Thomsen disputed the idea airlines only play a minimal role, saying they were striking SAF purchase agreements and investing in new technologies, supporting early-stage innovation and collaborating with research institutions.

She also said alternative ways of making SAF needed to be developed alongside HEFA, as this process alone would not be sufficient to produce enough fuel to hit net zero by 2050.

‘Exercise in futility’

Aviation accounts for 2.5% of global emissions of planet-warming gases such as carbon dioxide. This figure is expected to rise as air traffic more than doubles from 2019 levels by 2050 and fuel use rises 59%, according to environmental advocacy group Transport & Environment (T&E).

By painting a picture of imminent breakthroughs and success in producing SAF at scale, airlines can bolster their green credentials while deflecting pressure for more disruptive interventions, such as stricter emissions caps or higher carbon taxes, the group said.

“This is first and foremost about justifying never-ending growth and pretending that you can do that without heating the planet more and more - which you cannot do,” said Almuth Ernsting, a campaigner with advocacy group Biofuelwatch.

Failing to find a solution could prove costly. Under new EU rules, airlines face escalating mandates to use SAF on flights departing from EU airports. The mandate starts with at least 2% of their fuel in 2025, climbing to 6% by 2030, and eventually hitting 70% by 2050.

European SAF mandates are expected to cost airlines $2.9 billion in additional fuel purchases and compliance expenses this year, according to IATA estimates.

The return to power of U.S. President Donald Trump could further hamper the industry’s green transition. Trump has pledged to roll back many incentives his predecessor, Joe Biden, offered to SAF and other green energy projects.

As projects flounder in the United States, the U.S. airline industry has pinned hopes on a new SAF bonanza in Panama. It’s already hitting the skids, Reuters found.

SGP BioEnergy, headquartered in New York, pledged in 2022 to build the world’s largest SAF facility, in collaboration with the government of Panama. The plant is to make green fuel from industrial hemp oil and used cooking oil.

Due to start this year, production has been pushed back to 2027. SGP BioEnergy Chief Executive Randy Letang said the delay was largely due to airlines showing less interest in backing SAF projects than in the past.

Panama’s energy secretary did not respond to a request for comment.

After the plant opens, the company may switch to making renewable diesel for trucks and ships, because those industries showed more enthusiasm than aviation, Letang said.

“We’re only going to take it so far with SAF until we determine whether or not the airlines are actually serious about making the commitments for this fuel,” he said.

Letang said airlines were competing to announce their own marquee projects, when producers actually needed consortiums made up of many carriers to invest in large-scale projects.

“That’s how you build this industry. Without that, it’s an exercise in futility, quite frankly,” he said. “The airlines could do a lot more.”

A few years ago, Letang was striking big SAF deals with major airlines through his previous biofuels venture, SG Preston. In 2016, JetBlue announced a 10-year commitment to buy commercial volumes of green fuel from SG Preston, calling it one of the largest such deals in history. JetBlue said in 2021 it would double down on the deal as it pursued a target to use SAF for 8% of its fuel needs by 2023.

Australia’s Qantas Airways signed a similar 10-year deal with SG Preston in 2017 for 8 million gallons of SAF annually starting in 2020 to help power flights between Los Angeles and Australia.

The deals were based on SG Preston’s plan to build five plants across North America - two in Ohio and one each in Indiana, Michigan, and Ontario. None has been built.

SG Preston filed for bankruptcy in 2022, according to company filings. A spokesperson for Letang’s current firm, SGP BioEnergy, said the two companies had no affiliation.

New technology

While most SAF projects rely on HEFA, British startup Velocys uses Fischer-Tropsch technology, which converts waste such as garbage, wood chips, or flared gas into clean fuel.

IAG - the parent of British Airways, Iberia, Vueling and Aer Lingus - has been an enthusiastic backer, announcing four major SAF initiatives with Velocys over the past 15 years. But despite producing SAF in pilot projects, none of the Velocys projects has reached commercial production.

The challenges for Velocys began in 2010 with a project to turn methane from a London landfill into jet fuel. That venture collapsed when its main backer went bankrupt.

Since then Velocys has attempted to build its own plants - including in Oklahoma - but it has proven too costly and technically challenging.

After shutting the Oklahoma plant, Velocys shifted focus to two new projects: one at Immingham in northeast England and another in Mississippi.

British oil major Shell and IAG initially backed Velocys’s English venture, and the British government awarded a 27 million pound ($37 million) grant in 2022, then another 3 million pounds in July. However, Shell backed out in 2021 to pursue its own SAF ventures. Shell declined further comment.

While IAG has no purchase deal with Velocys, it maintains a partnership and expects production to begin in 2029.

Velocys Chief Executive Matthew Viergutz remains optimistic, saying the company has learned from past setbacks. However, the Mississippi project is on hold pending clarity on U.S. SAF regulations.

The Immingham project was meant to start supplying British Airways last year. The plant site is a dusty field, empty but for a blue portable toilet lying on its side.

Dow owns or contracts services from dozens of gas turbines and other combined heat and power systems across its petrochemical manufacturing footprint. Several years ago, it began evaluating the potential of small modular reactors to help reach its goal of reducing emissions by 5 million metric tons annually by 2030, according to an executive who anaylzes Dow’s capital investments in energy systems.

“Don’t discount the possibility of nuclear,” said Kreshka Young, North America business director for energy and climate at Dow. “There are a huge amount of benefits. It provides clean, firm power, and the cost can be very competitive. I would recommend that people not be afraid to look at it.”

High hopes for small nuclear

X-energy’s technology classifies as a small modular reactor — that is, one with a capacity of less than 300 megawatts. The current pipeline of such reactors is more than 47 gigawatts, which will require an investment of at least $360 billion, according to research firm Wood Mackenzie.

Dow’s installation will initially include four X-energy base modules, which have a capacity of about 80 megawatts. The ability to stack the units was important for reliability, Young said. Dow also found the compact size of X-energy’s system — about the dimensions of a gas turbine — appealing. The project is subject to ongoing review and ongoing government funding. “We take a very measured approach to this,” Young said, referring to Dow’s energy investments. “We are not in a situation to write blank checks.”

Small modular reactors are attractive because the timeline for building them is more predictable and cost-effective than legacy nuclear project development, said Alison Hahn, technical adviser for new nuclear technologies at the Nuclear Energy Institute. That’s because components can be constructed on an assembly line, enabling developers to standardize design and manage several processes in parallel, Hahn said.

The three largest artificial intelligence and cloud computing companies — Amazon, Google and Microsoft — are all considering advanced nuclear to power their data centers. Amazon was part of a $500 million funding round for X-energy in October 2024, which was increased to $700 million in February.

“X-energy provides an impactful solution to a critical challenge — and the support Amazon, Dow and other major corporations have provided underscores its potential and merit,” said Ken Griffin, founder and CEO of lead investor Citadel, when the initial funding was announced.

Amazon is looking to deploy up to 5 gigawatts of X-energy’s technology by 2039, starting with a four-unit, 320-megawatt project in central Washington that is being developed by Energy Northwest. The plan calls for the installation to be tripled over time.

The Dow project, however, is likely to be online first — as early as 2028, if project timelines stay on schedule. Its construction permit could be approved within 18 months, thanks to a new executive order by the Trump administration. After construction is complete, Dow and X-energy will need to apply for an operating license.

The Amazon and Dow commitments atop X-energy’s DOE funding will give backers the confidence to finance X-energy’s manufacturing and supply chain ramp-up as well as the workforce training that will be needed to support operations, said Hahn.

“Building out that order book allows you to confidently invest,” she said.

X-energy’s innovation: the ‘pebble bed’

What makes X-energy’s offering unique is the tristructural-isotropic (a.k.a TRISO) fuel used by its reactors — poppy seed-size particles of uranium clumped into billiard-size balls and spread out in a pebble bed. Helium is pumped through the pebbles, and heat is extracted for steam generation. TerraPower, which raised $650 million in June from investors including Bill Gates and NVDIA’s venture arm, uses a similar design.

X-energy’s reactors operate at temperatures higher than lava’s, making them appropriate for energy-intensive processes such as hydrogen production or petroleum refining. The design is explicitly meant to prevent meltdowns.

X-energy will manufacture its TRISO fuel at a facility it’s building in Oak Ridge, Tennessee. The company, which employs about 600 people, is based in Rockville, Maryland.

The spent pebbles in X-energy’s reactors can be replaced by new ones on a daily basis, so shut down is not necessary, said Harlan Bowers, senior vice president and director for the Dow project.

“We see that as an advantage,” Bowers said, “but it does pose some additional challenges for the regulator, because most fuels are not moving, so there are some statistical aspects to calculating reactivity within that core. That means there are new techniques that the NRC will have to use to evaluate our safety case and ultimately approve our design.”",https://trellis.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/trellis_editorial_dow_nuclear_technology_1470x894.png,N,,2025-08-11 08:04:12.832469

In Pennsylvania, the Solar for All program never got off the ground.

Last year, the EPA awarded the Pennsylvania Energy Development Authority (PEDA) $156 million as part of the program to build rooftop solar on the homes of 12,500 low and moderate-income families across the state. It was intended to lower their energy bills and reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

But there was a caveat: the Pennsylvania legislature required its own approval to accept the money. So far, it hasn’t done that.

Now that the EPA has announced it’s canceling those grants across the country, solar advocates in Pennsylvania are worried that lawmakers will never act.

“I am afraid of that being an excuse for not moving forward with the Solar for All authorization,” said Monica Carey, Pennsylvania program director of the non-profit Solar United Neighbors (SUN).

Carey still wants the legislature to approve the acceptance of this money. The EPA administrator has made his move, she said, “but that is not the legal finality of Solar for All…the money is contractually obligated, so it is legally PEDA’s to spend on Solar for All.”

She and other solar advocates are not surprised by the EPA announcement, but are still disappointed, “especially as electricity prices are set to rise dramatically,” said Leo Kowalski of the nonprofit Pennsylvania Solar Center.

“We’re having more and more electrification and data centers go in,” he said. “So it feels like a great time to be leading on that front, to be helping incentivize normal people to pay cheaper electricity rates when they’re the ones that are going to be footing the bill for these large entities.”

Republican lawmakers are skeptical of solar

At a hearing of the House Energy Committee in February to consider a bill to accept the Solar For All funds, Republicans brought up concerns about the disposal of solar panels, about free markets, and about the price tag of rooftop solar, even though the federal government had already allocated the money to Pennsylvania.

“Why in heaven’s name would we continue to invest taxpayer dollars, whether it’s state or federal? “ asked Rep. Jamie Barton, a Republican who represents Berks and Schuylkill counties, at the hearing. “Why would we invest in unreliable energy sources?”

That bill was derailed by an unrelated amendment. Now, advocates are concerned that there is no political will to approve the funding.

“To give up now is basically saying these low-income residents of Pennsylvania never mattered to us,” said Carey. [Lawmakers are saying] “‘we don’t care if they have to spend more on energy bills proportionally than anyone else in the state. We’re not going to do anything to help them.’ That’s what it feels like to just give up on Solar for All.”

Solar advocates see the best route now is through the state budget, but the legislature is at an impasse.

“The Solar for All program remains an important lifeline for the many working people and families in the commonwealth who need energy affordability,” said Rep. Elizabeth Fiedler, Democrat of Philadelphia, who chairs the House energy committee, despite the EPA canceling the program. “We’re still working hard in the legislature to authorize the program and move this funding out quickly, so as many Pennsylvanians as possible can benefit.”",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8cb63c7/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1800x945+0+98/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F45%2Fb3%2Fad155cae40b5a787679f025730af%2Fsolarmain.jpg,N,,2025-08-11 10:03:17.414785

The table below summarizes the cuts, with a heavy focus on programs that have resulted in the development and economic success of new energy technologies, especially clean energy technology.","Demand for power is climbing to unprecedented levels. U.S. Energy Information Administration data reveals that July set a new record for electricity peak demand, driven by nationwide heat waves and increasing reliance on power-intensive artificial intelligence tools. And, given the state of the electrical grid in several jurisdictions, the U.S. The Department of Energy declared an emergency order on July 28 to secure the mid-Atlantic power grid. The situation could worsen as summer continues, although it has already been a long time in coming.

On day one of his second administration, President Donald Trump declared a national energy emergency. The declaration formalized the idea that economic prosperity, national security, and foreign policy are under threat due to an insufficient energy supply. While this claim may be intended to encourage leniency towards the fossil fuel industry, there are many issues with our energy infrastructure that do need urgent attention. The American Society of Civil Engineers gave the nation’s aging electrical infrastructure a D+, a failing grade, in the organization’s latest annual Infrastructure Report Card. The aging grid is in dire need of infrastructure upgrades so that it is able to serve the increasing power demand as we see more frequent extreme temperatures and weather events due to climate change, alongside the expansion of data center power use and the electrification of buildings and transportation. Currently, energy generation takes years to connect to the grid due to slow permitting processes and a patchwork of utility regulations and forecasters predict electricity use will increase 50% by 2050 in the US.

However, instead of creating a pathway to speed up the connection of new energy sources to the grid, Trump followed this emergency declaration with a budget request for fiscal year 2026 that kneecaps energy innovation. Followed closely after that was the passage of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which, in combination with severe budget and personnel cuts in government-funded science and technology research and development, will likely result not in energy stability or even dominance, but a true national emergency: a long-lasting rise in energy prices. It may also lead to a decline in the U.S.’s leadership in technology innovation and talent.

Investing In Innovation Could Help Address The Energy Crisis

Today’s ubiquitous GPS, computer chips, solar photovoltaic cells, and lithium-ion batteries didn’t arrive from the ether fully-formed and ready for consumers to use. Many of these innovations are thanks to the equivalent of $7.4 billion (in today’s dollars) taxpayers invested shortly after WWII ended to create the Office of Scientific Research and Development. Funds from OSRD eventually led to discoveries in the 1940s and 50s that resulted in the establishment of the National Science Foundation National Aeronautics and Space Administration, Atomic Energy Commission (later becoming the Department of Energy), and other science agencies. Federal funding for research and investment in these agencies has resulted in trillions of dollars of economic benefit, resulting in the U.S. being a leading developer of technologies that have transformed our world.

Funding cuts to the DOE pose a threat to our energy system and leadership in energy systems like next-generation grid technology, AI, and clean energy development and manufacturing.

DOE is the largest funder of basic physical science research in the government. The DOE’s Office of Science’s annual budget is $8.2 billion for projects related to critical minerals, quantum computing, enhanced geothermal energy, and artificial intelligence. All are topics that the Trump administration has identified as crucial to U.S. economic competitiveness and “dominance.” Applied technology offices within the DOE – the ones that transform scientific research into commercial applications, like the Manufacturing and Energy Supply Chain Office, Office of Clean Energy Demonstrations, and the Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy office- have funded projects across industries and sectors. These include the private sector, national labs, and universities, all of whose work has resulted in historically low costs for battery storage, solar photovoltaics, grid components, and critical infrastructure. These investments have fed into a resurgence of our domestic manufacturing industry across the Rust Belt (Midwest) and the Sunbelt (southern states like Georgia, South Carolina, and Texas).

The DOE historically has a positive return on taxpayer investment across its research and development offices. From its start in 1976 through 2015, DOE invested $12 billion in research, development, and deployment in EERE and found that its return yielded $388 billion in economic benefits, or an ROI of over 27% by conservative estimates. The Building Technologies Office within DOE, which is known for developing energy-saving technologies that save consumers money on their utility bills, has estimated that for every $1 invested in its R&D, it has yielded between $20 and $261 in economic benefits. The benefits of these investments are in the form of job creation, consumer cost savings, and new technologies like horizontal drilling – yes, the technology used for fracking developed through the DOE’s R&D program on natural fracturing.

Given that context, it may be counterintuitive that the same officials touting U.S. leadership in innovation and discovery are proposing the largest financial cuts to DOE in history. The president’s budget request is proposing a 26% cut to non-defense DOE programs. The table below summarizes the cuts, with a heavy focus on programs that have resulted in the development and economic success of new energy technologies, especially clean energy technology.

But the loss of the tax credits could mean that residents pay more on their utility bills.
But the giant domestic policy measure Trump signed on July 4 abruptly ended those tax credits.
Godfrey, the industry advocate, said that wind and solar projects may be canceled once the tax credits expire.","The abrupt termination of tax credits for clean energy projects is perhaps the most drastic blow that President Donald Trump has struck in his campaign against wind and solar electricity.

As states brace for the uncertainty ahead, they are scrambling to get pending projects off the ground before the tax credits expire.

“The real opportunities are making sure that the projects in the queue make their deadline,” said Washington Democratic state Sen. Sharon Shewmake, who chairs the Senate Environment, Energy & Technology Committee. “Can we speed that up? Can we make that easier for them?”

Shewmake, and leaders in other states, say they’re focused on fast-tracking permitting decisions and working with regulators to ensure projects can connect to the grid.

“Ironically, one of the impacts of the phaseout is that there’s a rush to speed up the development of some projects in the short run,” said Warren Leon, executive director of the Clean Energy States Alliance, a nonprofit coalition of state energy agencies.

The tax credits were the linchpin for countless wind and solar projects in states aiming to get a large portion of their power from renewable energy. Leaders and advocates in those states say that renewable sources remain the best way to meet their electricity needs. But the loss of the tax credits could mean that residents pay more on their utility bills.

“This will likely kill some projects,” said Matt Abele, executive director of the North Carolina Sustainable Energy Association, an industry-supported nonprofit that backs clean energy policy. “The financial scenario for these projects is built around tax credits that were intended to be in place until the 2030s.”

But once the dust settles, many officials expect state laws and market forces to continue driving the buildout of wind and solar.

“We still need to add electricity in this state, and wind and solar are still the cheapest way to do it,” said Pete Wyckoff, deputy commissioner of energy resources with the Minnesota Department of Commerce. “It’s a blow, but it doesn’t change our energy policy, it doesn’t change what is economically the right thing to do. But it’s a big hit to our ratepayers.”

Tax credits axed

Under the Inflation Reduction Act, which President Joe Biden signed in 2022, developers received a 30% tax credit for investments in zero-emission energy projects, along with a production credit of up to 2.75 cents for every kilowatt-hour of clean electricity generated by the projects. Those tax credits were slated to extend into the 2030s.

State officials and renewable energy industry leaders say the credits have been a major driver in the nation’s rapid buildout of wind and solar, along with corresponding growth in manufacturing jobs.

But the giant domestic policy measure Trump signed on July 4 abruptly ended those tax credits. Under the new law, projects must be up and running by the end of 2027 to qualify for the credits, or start construction by July 4, 2026. Projects that begin construction after that date must be operational by the end of 2027.

Trump has falsely claimed that wind and solar are “expensive and unreliable,” and has at the same time worked to boost fossil fuel production. He has also taken aim at the fact that some renewable energy components are manufactured overseas, calling it a national security threat.

“Projects in early to mid-stage development are deeply in danger if not completely cut off,” said Harry Godfrey, managing director with Advanced Energy United, an industry group focused on energy and transportation. “This administration is finding a variety of ways to pull the rug on wind and solar.”

While there may be a short-term burst of projects before the credits expire, the landscape becomes much more uncertain after that.

“Certainly there will be some projects that are canceled, but the bigger issue is going to be new projects that don’t get started because of the unfavorable environment for them,” said Leon, of the Clean Energy States Alliance.

A slower, costlier transition

Industry leaders say it’s too early to tell just how drastically the loss of the tax credits will slow their deployment of wind and solar. But they say states remain committed to laws that mandate a transition to clean energy. And building fossil fuel power, such as natural gas plants, is still slower and more costly.

“You don’t build a natural gas plant overnight, and there are real supply chain constraints — you can’t even get the parts,” said Amisha Rai, senior vice president of advocacy with Advanced Energy United.

Rai and others noted that the country is seeing a surge in demand for new electricity, driven by the electrification of vehicles and buildings, as well as growth in data centers to support technologies like artificial intelligence.

“Market forces are going to continue to drive development of clean energy, the primary market force being significant demand for new electricity,” said Abele, with the North Carolina group. “It’s not going to come from natural gas, given that turbines are on back order through 2029. Solar, wind and battery storage are the quickest ways to add electrons to the grid.”

Clean energy backers said Trump’s efforts to block solar and wind undermine his “energy dominance” agenda at a time when more power is needed. Ultimately, they believe the loss of the tax credits will cause higher electricity bills.

“Just by the law of supply and demand, if you have growing demand and you don’t have growing supply to keep up with it, that’s going to lead to higher prices,” Leon said.

According to a report from Energy Innovation Policy & Technology, a nonpartisan think tank, the loss of the tax credits could increase electricity rates 9-18% by 2035, raising household energy costs by $170 annually.

Godfrey, the industry advocate, said that wind and solar projects may be canceled once the tax credits expire. But many of those same projects may be revived as rising electricity prices make their costs more viable.

Analysts have noted that the clean energy boom brought on by the Inflation Reduction Act has largely benefited Republican-led states. But some lawmakers fear that developers will now focus their investments on Democratic states, where laws mandating a transition to renewable sources provide more market certainty.

“We’ll probably see more of the investment go towards blue states that have those sorts of mandates,” said Utah state Sen. Nate Blouin, a Democrat. “That’s a loss for states like Utah, where we were seeing good new tax revenue, and agriculture folks making supplemental income [from wind and solar projects].”

Lawmakers in states that do have mandates say they’re still committed to meeting their goals.

“When I heard that the Inflation Reduction Act was going to be repealed, I was devastated,” said Shewmake, the Washington senator. “But then I started to look at the economics of the situation, and you realize this transition is going to happen. The federal government can slow it down, but this fight isn’t lost.”",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/solar-panels.jpg,N,,2025-08-11 07:02:47.822967

In its first report published today (Monday 11 August), the taskforce says a “radical reset” is needed to speed up vital nuclear projects and encourage more companies to build in Britain, delivering a new golden age of nuclear with thousands of good jobs and investment - supporting government’s mission to make Britain a clean energy superpower.

The taskforce, announced by the Prime Minister in February and led by John Fingleton, former CEO of the Office of Fair Trading, will today publish its interim report. The findings reveal an “unnecessarily slow, inefficient and costly” system which is hampering the delivery of clean energy infrastructure needed to power Britain’s future, as well as increasing costs of the UK’s vital nuclear deterrent.

Radical, once-in-a-generation reform could transform nuclear delivery in several critical areas, while maintaining the highest safety standards. These include overly complex and inconsistent regulatory processes, risk-averse cultures that prioritise bureaucracy over proportionate safety measures, and outdated planning frameworks that fail to support new technologies like small modular reactors.

It comes after the Chancellor announced action to reduce the administrative cost of regulation by 25%.

Minister for Energy Consumers Miatta Fahnbulleh said:

For too long, big British infrastructure projects have been held back by needless bureaucracy.

It’s time for a new approach to getting nuclear projects off the ground more quickly, and at a lower cost.

We look forward to working with the expert taskforce to modernise outdated regulations so we can unlock growth, jobs and energy security for the British people.

Nuclear Taskforce lead John Fingleton said:

Nuclear energy is safe and reliable and can contribute to net zero goals. It is also vital to the UK’s strategic deterrent.

However, over recent decades, nuclear regulation has become more complex and costly without always delivering commensurate safety and environmental benefits.

Our interim report identifies our main concerns with the current system which we think is not fit for purpose.

With a view to recommending a once-in-a-generation reset, we now invite views from interested parties on what solutions will better enable the UK to achieve the huge benefits nuclear power offers.

The final report and recommendations will be published in the autumn. As a first step, the government will work with the taskforce to develop a new strategic direction for nuclear operators and regulators to prioritise quick, effective and safe delivery of nuclear programmes.

The government’s nuclear programme is now the most ambitious for a generation and reforms will be essential to unlock the potential of the industry. Once small modular reactors and Sizewell C come online in the 2030s, combined with Hinkley Point C, this will deliver more new nuclear to the grid than over the previous half century combined.

It follows government action earlier this year to shake up the planning rules to make it easier to build nuclear across the country – delivering cheaper clean power, energy security and jobs.

The final report’s recommendations will focus on:",https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/6899b67d586f9c9360656a68/s960_GFX2508-107_GOVUK.jpg,N,,2025-08-11 06:00:30.956317

Opinion of the Federal Court of Justice The Federal Court of Justice overturned the decision of the Higher Regional Court of Düsseldorf and deemed the granting of a BKZ in grid connection proceedings under the EnWG to be permissible.
Does the Federal Court of Justice ruling also apply to storage facilities above 100 MW?","On 15 July 2025, the Federal Court of Justice (BGH) ruled (case no. EnVR 1/24) that network operators in network connection procedures under the Energy Industry Act (EnWG) may demand a construction cost subsidy (BKZ) for battery storage systems (BESS) based on the performance price model (BGH press release; full text of the decision). In doing so, the BGH clarified the admissibility of this practice and removed any doubts as to the legality of a BKZ for battery storage systems. On 22 July 2025, the BGH also published the reasons for its decision.

Background to the decision

The question of whether to grant a construction cost subsidy is a key (cost) factor in the implementation of BESS projects. Depending on the connection capacity, the costs often run into the tens of millions, which is why the BGH’s decision was eagerly awaited in the industry.

In the first instance, the Higher Regional Court of Düsseldorf ruled that the granting of a BKZ was excluded on the grounds of discrimination against other connection customers by means of the performance price model. In this case, the Higher Regional Court were of the view that the special features of battery storage systems – in particular their different grid utilisation compared to a “normal” end consumer – had to be considered in the BKZ calculation. Accordingly, a blanket application of the Federal Network Agency’s (BNetzA) performance-based pricing model was not permissible.

Opinion of the Federal Court of Justice

The Federal Court of Justice overturned the decision of the Higher Regional Court of Düsseldorf and deemed the granting of a BKZ in grid connection proceedings under the EnWG to be permissible. It found that the granting of a BKZ calculated according to the performance price model for battery storage systems did not violate the prohibition of discrimination under Section 17(1) EnWG.

The Federal Court of Justice acknowledges that, from a technical point of view, battery storage systems have a different effect on the grid than end consumers: they merely store the electricity they consume and release it later and can even support the grid in the event of impending grid bottlenecks. However, this positive impact on the grid is not necessarily attributable to the respective connection network operator. Ultimately, it is up to the network operators to assess the specific effects on the grid and possible ways of avoiding expansion costs. However, no general discrimination against “normal” end consumers could be established.

However, it should be noted that the question of whether and to what extent the individual service price of the respective network operator was determined in a permissible manner remains open. In this regard, particular consideration will have to be given in future to the position paper of the Federal Network Agency, which provides for average pricing based on the last three years, as well as reduction options for flexible grid connection contracts.

What impact does the ruling have in practice?

The ruling removes the previous legal uncertainty as to whether the BKZ can be granted for battery storage systems, at least for the grid connection procedure under the EnWG. This means that previous payment and reimbursement reservations are now generally irrelevant and the provisions made by grid operators can be reversed. In addition, the storage industry can now prepare for the payment of a BKZ and take this into account in its profitability calculations and project financing.

Does the Federal Court of Justice ruling also apply to storage facilities above 100 MW?

However, the BGH ruling cannot be regarded as legally conclusive. Among other things, the granting of a BKZ on storage facilities with a capacity of 100 MW or more is likely to remain inadmissible. This is because, in deviation from the EnWG, these storage facilities are subject to the so-called KraftNAV, which expressly prohibits the levying of a BKZ in Section 8 (3).

It is also unclear to what extent the collection of a (significant) advance payment of the BKZ is permissible in the ongoing grid connection procedure under the EnWG, as this may in principle only be granted as consideration.

Outlook

Although the Federal Court of Justice’s decision provides some clarification, it must be viewed as a setback for the storage industry overall, alongside the announced network charge reform. It remains to be seen whether the legislature will amend the legal situation for storage facilities in a positive manner to continue to promote the necessary flexibility. In addition, legal uncertainties remain regarding the collection of the BKZ, particularly for storage facilities with a capacity of 100 MW or more. In view of the range of questions currently arising in the grid connection and approval process for battery storage systems, it is to be hoped that the legislator and the Federal Network Agency will take stronger and faster action to end the “legal vacuum” and ensure the necessary planning and investment security for the players involved.",https://www.taylorwessing.com/-/media/taylor-wessing/images/social-media/energiespeicher_tw25_open_graph_image_2500x1306px3.jpg?as=0&dmc=0&iar=0&thn=0&udi=0?&hash=800D62C8470573B6460D44CE46374082,N,,2025-08-11 07:02:22.186913

“New, small PV systems are already profitable on the market today and do not require subsidies,” Reiche told newspaper Augsburger Allgemeine in an interview.
She replied to a question about private PV installations, such as on homeowners' rooftops, and did not further define their size.
This would mean, for example, equipping even small PV systems with storage units, and requiring them to market their electricity.
“Onshore wind and solar power plants will have to contribute more to the costs of grid expansion in the future,” Reiche told Augsburger Allgemeine.","Germany’s economy minister, Katherina Reiche, is considering to phase out the subsidy system currently in place for small-scale photovoltaic (PV) installations which feed electricity into the grid. “New, small PV systems are already profitable on the market today and do not require subsidies,” Reiche told newspaper Augsburger Allgemeine in an interview. She replied to a question about private PV installations, such as on homeowners' rooftops, and did not further define their size.

So far, homeowners with a solar rooftop system have been guaranteed a fixed remuneration per kilowatt-hour of electricity fed into the grid for a period of 20 years, depending on the size of their systems and when they were commissioned. This feed-in guarantee has gradually gone down in recent years. It is credited with powering the Germany’s renewables growth. Without such a mechanism, renewables would have had a hard time competing with other sources, such as coal. Existing solar installations would continue to receive the agreed remuneration, Reiche said.

The government parties had said in their coalition agreement that they wanted to ensure that renewable electricity installations could fully finance themselves on the market in the long term. The further expansion and the installation of adequate storage capacity likewise should be achieved through “a greater use of market instruments.”

Minister Reiche wants to change the regulatory framework so that renewables feed their electricity into the grid in a controlled way. This would mean, for example, equipping even small PV systems with storage units, and requiring them to market their electricity. Many small rooftop systems currently feed their electricity into the grid in an uncontrolled manner, putting the network under pressure.

“Onshore wind and solar power plants will have to contribute more to the costs of grid expansion in the future,” Reiche told Augsburger Allgemeine. Moreover, the expansion of renewables should be aligned with grid expansion, as not accounting for this “makes our electricity system unnecessarily expensive,” the minister said.",https://www.cleanenergywire.org/sites/all/themes/cleanenergywire/logo_og.png,N,,2025-08-11 06:00:38.556796

For wealth managers, chief investment officers and family offices, the asset class is evolving from a peripheral risk to a pivotal play in portfolios shaped by the demands of energy security, climate action and digital infrastructure.

DBS’s latest CIO thematic, The Nuclear Renaissance, makes the case plainly: nuclear power is not just a clean energy solution, it is fast becoming indispensable.

“The world has entered a new regime where reliable, sovereign and scalable power sources are non-negotiable,” says Daryl Ho, senior investment strategist at DBS, the Singapore-headquartered Asian regional bank. “Nuclear fits all three.”

The fragility of fossil fuel supply chains has been laid bare, illustrated by the war in Ukraine and Middle Eastern conflict which occasionally threatens access to the Strait of Hormuz, argues DBS.

Add to that surging power needs driven by artificial intelligence and net-zero mandates accelerating worldwide, the rationale for nuclear power adoption becomes clearer. “This is not a sector that is simply being re-rated,” says Mr Ho. “It’s being reimagined.”

Tipping point

Perhaps most striking in DBS’s thesis is the linkage between nuclear energy and AI. Far from reducing energy needs, the growing efficiency of AI and quantum computing is expected to amplify demand rather than curb it. “AI systems like large language models require always-on, high-density power,” says Mr Ho. “Only nuclear, with its unmatched capacity factor, can deliver that cleanly, consistently and at scale.”

Investments in the energy theme are increasingly being integrated into strategic asset allocations, as Schroders Capital echoes in its infrastructure outlook.

“Energy transition assets remain especially compelling,” says Nils Rode, Zurich-based chief investment officers at Schroders Capital. “They offer inflation protection, secure income, and diversification, especially in regions like Asia and Europe where decarbonisation policies are accelerating.”

Next-generation nuclear innovations including Small Modular Reactors (SMRs) have emerged as the sector’s tipping point. Smaller, safer and quicker to deploy than conventional plants, SMRs could redefine how institutional and private capital engages with the sector.

“SMRs moved from theory to implementation in 2021, when China connected its first unit to the grid,” says Mr Ho at DBS. He expects “demo units” to be available in the West by 2027–28, with “full commercial rollouts” by 2035.

Rolls-Royce, NuScale, and GE Hitachi are among the players racing to bring viable SMR designs to market, while more than 80 other projects are under development globally.

“Family offices are watching this sector closely,” says François Savary, founder of Geneva-based GENVIL Wealth Management. “Energy security is increasingly seen as a portfolio theme, particularly as AI-linked demand continues to surprise to the upside.”

Uranium premiums

Investors looking for exposure to nuclear energy often start with uranium. “It’s the cleanest near-term play,” says Mr Ho. “Prices are up 162 per cent since end-2019, but remain far from their 2007 peak.”

Yet despite bullish fundamentals, uranium is still “under-financialised”, according to DBS, with most global trade occurring over-the-counter. That makes physical uranium accessible via exchange traded funds or listed holders like Yellow Cake Plc, a uniquely low-volatility commodity position.

“Miners are also attractive,” Mr Ho adds, “especially those with in-situ recovery projects or near-term production. Cameco, NexGen, Denison, they’re all seeing strong equity flows.”

For wealth managers, the question is no longer if nuclear belongs in the portfolio, but how to position it. Schroders sees nuclear fitting squarely within its core/core+ infrastructure strategies. “With higher rates and reduced dry powder, expected equity returns in the space have recalibrated upwards by over 200 basis points since early 2023,” says Mr Rode. “It’s a buyer’s market.”

GENVIL’s Mr Savary takes a slightly broader tack. “It’s difficult to find pure plays on public markets,” he notes. “So we integrate nuclear within a wider global energy allocation that includes transition assets and alternative infrastructure.”

Even within the nuclear energy sector, the capital stack is diversifying. Alongside uranium and listed miners, opportunities are emerging in utilities with nuclear capacity, such as Constellation and Vistra in the US, as well as reactor manufacturers including GE and Rolls-Royce, which DBS notes have outperformed even the “Magnificent Seven” tech stocks since 2023.

Cold war hangover

Sentiment remains a wildcard. Incidents like Chernobyl and Fukushima have etched deep scars into public perception. But the data tells a different story: nuclear has the lowest fatality rate per terawatt hour of any energy source, far safer than coal, gas or even hydropower.

“We need to re-anchor the narrative in facts,” says Mr Ho. “The emotional hangover from cold war-era fears has held nuclear back far too long.”

Public policy is starting to reflect this shift. The US Inflation Reduction Act includes $6bn in tax credits and R&D support for nuclear power. Thirty-one nations pledged to triple nuclear capacity by 2050 at COP29. And the EU has added nuclear to its sustainable taxonomy.

Yet risks remain, not least the concentration of enrichment capacity. Russia controls 46 per cent of global enrichment, a dominance that’s prompted a flurry of Western investment in self-sufficiency. The US, for example, has allocated $700m to expand domestic enrichment.

Still, raw uranium supply is more diversified than crude oil. Australia, Canada and Kazakhstan lead global production, while Namibia and Niger remain key exporters. The concept of “strategic uranium reserves”, mirroring oil stockpiles, is gaining traction.

Emerging technologies such as fusion and thorium are also being developed as potential long-term disruptors to nuclear fission.

“Fusion is exciting but decades away from commercialisation,” says Mr Ho. “Its energy return on investment is still very low.” Thorium reactors and space-based solar may play a role in the longer term, but fission remains the only scalable, high-density, zero-emission solution available today.

Mr Savary agrees: “Nuclear is not perfect but compared to the intermittency and material intensity of other renewables, it offers unmatched consistency and energy density.”

We’re still in the early stages, believes Mr Ho. “But the conditions are in place, capital flows, policy support, technological readiness. And the needs of the digital, decarbonised world aren’t slowing down.”

For investors willing to look beyond old fears, nuclear may well be the most underestimated story in clean energy’s next chapter.",https://d2iztrg3kgqpue.cloudfront.net/production/cc37feae-9b6b-4a38-ba37-3128ed04e705.jpg,N,,2025-08-11 07:02:30.969922

State officials emphasize commitment to diverse energy sources and aim for a flexible procurement schedule to benefit ratepayers.

The Trump administration's shift towards fossil fuels further complicates offshore wind development in Massachusetts.

With the current batch of offshore wind talks facing prolonged headwinds, Massachusetts officials will keep the subsequent development round paused until at least 2026.

The state Department of Energy Resources said in a memo published Thursday that parties do not expect to submit a draft request for proposals for the fifth offshore wind procurement, which would contain ""a proposed timetable and method of solicitation for Department review,"" until next year at the earliest.

Officials cited delays in existing contract talks as well as ""uncertainty from the federal government pertaining to offshore wind permitting and generally.""

""Massachusetts remains committed to an all-of-the-above approach to energy, including offshore wind. But due to uncertainty surrounding federal permitting and tax credits in this moment, the state will not conduct an offshore wind procurement in 2025,"" said DOER spokesperson Lauren Diggin. ""As we work to lower energy bills and meet growing energy demand, we are bringing more energy into Massachusetts with the completion of Vineyard Wind and the [New England Clean Energy Connect] hydropower line, advancing new strong solar programs, speeding up permitting, and pushing for more transmission to connect us to affordable energy. We will also develop a more flexible offshore wind procurement schedule so ratepayers can secure the best deals.""

The move appears likely to further delay the eventual buildout of offshore wind power, an industry that state leaders have long targeted as vital to Massachusetts. Wind infrastructure has struggled to achieve liftoff here amid changing market conditions and more recently a shift in federal policy under President Donald Trump.

Contract talks are ongoing for the fourth round of procurement under a state law sometimes known as Section 83C. Project developers selected by the state were supposed to complete those negotiations with utilities by Aug. 14, 2024, but the deadline has been pushed back several times, most recently to Dec. 31, 2025.

""Section 83C Round IV contract negotiations need to conclude for such improvements to be fully understood and completely incorporated into the Round V procurement process,"" DOER attorneys Ben Dobbs and Colin Carroll wrote in the memo published Thursday.","https://www.capecodtimes.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2024/04/30/NCCT/73511023007-vineyardwind-15.JPG?crop=2749,1547,x0,y150&width=2749&height=1547&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-08-11 06:00:43.458816

Next-gen Ford F-150 Lightning delayed until 2028

Blue Oval says it will focus resources on fast-tracking smaller and more affordable models

Ford Motor has announced its battery-powered Ford F-150 Lightning and Ford E-Transit replacements have both been postponed.

This move buys the US car-making giant time in the effort to release a family of smaller, more affordable EVs to market that will include a small or mid-size zero-emission ute that could be positioned beneath the current Ford Ranger

According to Reuters, Ford has already contacted suppliers involved with the development of the unnamed full-size ute and confirmed that production would be pushed back from 2027 to 2028.

The next-generation Ford E-Transit, meanwhile, was supposed to enter production next year but will now be delayed until 2028.

Commenting on reports that the big battery-powered ute’s arrival has been pushed back, Ford released a statement that said:

“F-150 Lightning, America’s best-selling electric truck, and E-Transit continue to meet today’s customer needs”, with Ford adding that it “will be nimble in adjusting our product launch timing to meet market needs and customer demand while targeting improved profitability.”

Ford reportedly will now use the time to refocus its efforts to develop a range of low-cost EVs, to help it finally compete with cheap EVs from China.

To help deliver its affordable electric cars, work has already begun on creating what’s described as a ‘streamlined platform’ that should bring cost-savings when it comes to production.

The switch in strategies had been previewed in a call to investors last week by Ford CEO Jim Farley who said: “The pure EV market in the US seems to us very clear, small vehicles used for commuting and around town.”

During the call Farley went on to blame quality issues for triggering mass recalls and said that he expected the Blue Oval’s electric car division to post losses of up to $US5.5 billion ($A8.5b).

Just last year Ford scrapped plans for a full-size three-row SUV flagship over a perceived lack of demand. Ford says it will now lay out its future plans for its upcoming EVs on August 11 but among the cars it will unveil will be a compact ute.

Ahead of the unveil Ford has trademarked the ‘Ranchero’ nameplate on August 5. The new EV pick-up shuns a crude ladder-frame chassis for a car-like monocoque, sacrificing payload for a more sophisticated ride and drive.

The new Ford Ranchero EV could be repositioned as a replacement for the popular Ford Focus-based Maverick ute sold in the US, but all should be revealed shortly.

To meet this level of growth, the manufacturing and production of batteries is critical.

One of the biggest players in this key sector is Panasonic, which powers more than three million EVs with its batteries as of December 2023.

The company aims to use its century-long expertise to decarbonise transport and transform the way batteries are produced to support the industry's growth.

Lithium-ion leadership and climate goals

Panasonic is among the leading producers of lithium-ion batteries in North America, supplying millions of units for EV applications. According to the IEA, transport accounts for about 25% of global CO₂ emissions, making the shift to EVs an essential part of international decarbonisation strategies.

Panasonic Energy of North America CEO Allan Swan says: “In addition to reducing emissions from Panasonic’s own operations, this ‘reduction contribution’ also advances Panasonic’s commitment to fight climate change. The automotive battery business is the flagship of the Panasonic Group’s efforts to confront climate change issues.”

The company sees its battery business as a central element in the transition to cleaner transport.

Scaling up US operations

Allan oversees Panasonic’s work at the Tesla Gigafactory in Nevada and is now directing the development of a new battery plant in De Soto, Kansas. The facility, set to become the world’s largest battery plant, broke ground in November 2022 and is scheduled to begin production in 2025.

“The shift to EVs requires training the next generation to invent, design and build the battery technology that will power our future,” he says.

“We hope to inspire the young people who will create a more vibrant and sustainable future and we are committed to helping them achieve their goals.”

The Kansas facility will produce 2170 cylindrical lithium-ion batteries, valued by original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) for their high energy density, safety and performance. “What we do here today, will impact your tomorrow,” Allan says.

The expansion is targeted at meeting growing demand in the US, where strict environmental regulations and consumer interest in high-performing EVs are accelerating adoption. Allan notes that the US market’s preference for long-distance travel makes it ideal for Panasonic’s high-capacity battery technology.

Local sourcing of raw materials is another priority. “North America offers local sourcing of raw materials mined and processed in a responsible manner, often using renewable energy and other sustainability best practices,” Allan explains, adding that localisation reduces transport emissions, shortens supply chains and strengthens EV infrastructure in the region.

Net zero battery manufacturing and supply chain partnerships

Panasonic acknowledges that producing EV batteries involves a high carbon footprint, with almost 90% of emissions generated during material extraction, processing and logistics. The Kansas plant is being built as a designated net zero facility.

“We will minimise the amount of electricity needed for production and all aspects, from wiring to machinery and equipment, will support CO₂ emissions reduction,” says Allan.

Panasonic plans to source 100% local renewable energy for the site within the next decade. The company is also optimising its value chain, from sourcing and manufacturing to recycling, to lower its Carbon Footprint of Products (CFP).

Strategic partnerships are part of this approach. Since 2019, Panasonic has worked with US battery recycling firm Redwood Materials to recycle waste materials from its Nevada facility. It has purchase agreements in place for recycled cathode materials and copper foil.

Other sourcing partnerships include:

Sila Nanotechnologies (US) for silicon anode materials

Novonix (US) for artificial graphite with reduced CO₂ emissions

Nouveau Monde Graphite (Canada) for renewable-powered graphite for anodes

“By procuring Canadian materials for our US plants, we can shorten the supply chain, significantly reducing distribution-related CO₂ emissions,” Allan says. “They are like-minded companies that are sincerely facing the challenge of reducing CO₂ emissions.”

All initiatives are part of Panasonic GREEN IMPACT, a global effort to cut 93 million tonnes of CO₂ emissions by early 2031, with battery production and EV adoption at its core.

“What I find very exciting about working at Panasonic is the sense that we are taking on the challenge of combating global environmental issues like climate change,” says Allan. “This is true not only for me but for all Group employees: we’re all committed to making products that help in that fight.”",https://assets.bizclikmedia.net/1200/d2ccadc3380b0b3f43db406d8613b779:fe94d4a5f62e2fddd759ebb721d9c17f/kansas.jpg.jpg,N,,2025-08-11 06:01:01.401253

The award recognizes Park Court Apartments as an exemplary model of how environmental responsibility and historic preservation can create safe, affordable housing that benefits both residents and the surrounding community.

Historic Property Transformed with Green Technology

Originally built in 1962, Park Court Apartments has undergone a comprehensive renovation that transformed the property into 48 energy-efficient residential units. The project successfully integrated multiple sustainable strategies while maintaining the site’s historic character.

Key sustainability features of the renovation include:

Low-flow water fixtures and drought-tolerant landscaping

Reuse of existing construction materials

Significant diversion of construction waste from landfills

Non-toxic pest control management systems

High-efficiency plumbing fixtures designed to reduce water consumption

Impressive Environmental Impact

The environmental benefits of Park Court’s sustainability initiatives are substantial. According to project data, the complex’s energy savings are equivalent to diverting 168 tons of waste from landfills annually and planting 12,010 trees each year.

The development also prioritized the use of previously developed sites, ensuring that no new ground or vegetation was disturbed during construction – a practice that helps preserve local ecosystems while maximizing urban land use efficiency.

LEED Gold Certification Achievement

Park Court Apartments has earned LEED v4.1 Gold certification, a prestigious recognition in green building standards that validates the project’s comprehensive approach to sustainability.

“Park Court Apartments sets a strong example for sustainability in affordable housing,” said Scott Farmer, executive director of the North Carolina Housing Finance Agency, who presented the award plaque to the Housing Authority of the City of Goldsboro. “Its LEED v4.1 Gold certification is an incredible accomplishment and should serve as a model for future projects.”

As the Trump administration keeps pushing to change the focus of scientific research and roll back environmental regulations — moves that critics say favor industry over public health — members of North Carolina’s scientific and environmental communities are speaking out. They’re raising alarms about the effect of the EPA’s stated goal of dismantling its environmental research arm, including the possible closure of its Office of Research and Development in Research Triangle Park.

“Gutting EPA’s research capabilities directly harms states’ ability to ensure we have clean air and clean water, because we rely on the EPA for scientific expertise and capacity that is rarely available at the state level,” Elizabeth Biser, former secretary of the N.C. Department of Environmental Quality, told NC Health News in a text.

“Eliminating the scientific backbone of the EPA would severely compromise the agency’s ability to make evidence-based decisions, putting communities across North Carolina — and the nation — at risk,” Biser wrote. “When you add funding cuts to scientific research at academic institutions, the nation as a whole is losing critical resources to protect the public from toxic chemicals.”

Critics warn that closing ORD’s Research Triangle facility could jeopardize public health, hinder critical climate research, undermine environmental safeguards and harm the economy of the Research Triangle and North Carolina as a whole.

ORD’s contributions to NC

The Office of Research and Development opened its Research Triangle Park facility in 2001. For more than two decades, it has played a pivotal role in advancing science that protects public health and the environment.

The office’s contributions include developing tools to monitor air pollution, helping detect and manage PFAS contamination in North Carolina’s drinking water, informing public health guidance during the COVID-19 pandemic and engaging more than 385,000 students and community members through education and outreach programs. These contributions have shaped federal and state environmental policies while directly benefiting local communities, according to the agency.

“ORD has also done a lot of the fundamental research to understand the health effects of exposure to air pollution,” said Chris Frey, a North Carolina State University engineering professor and former assistant administrator at ORD. “That includes work at a laboratory facility located on the campus of the University of North Carolina, where clinical studies of human exposure were conducted.”

“Not long ago, the agency announced it was not going to continue funding that facility, and it’s vacating the site,” Frey added. “That is a significant loss of research capability that is very unique in the United States — actually, very unique globally.”

In addition to RTP, the Office of Research and Development maintains facilities across the country, including in Washington, D.C., New Jersey, Rhode Island and Oregon. In recent years, its total staff has hovered around 1,500, with approximately 700 employees based at the RTP location, according to Frey, who returned to his NCSU post in 2024. Of those 700, about 400 have departed recently through resignations, early retirements or firings, he said.

Economic and educational impact

According to the most recent data published by the EPA, the agency’s RTP campus contributed “an annual output of $245.4 million within the region and $262.2 million statewide.”

“The loss of so much expertise hurts everyone,” said Linda Birnbaum, who was director of the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, also in Research Triangle Park, from 2009 to 2019. “In addition, the loss of hundreds of federal jobs is only the tip of the iceberg — because all of those positions are accompanied by the loss of contractors, trainees and visiting scientists. Huge economic as well as personal losses.”

In addition to the scientific research that has shed light on public health issues such as COVID and PFAS, ORD has provided research opportunities for thousands of students from local universities, Frey said.

“The local universities in the triangle — N.C. State, UNC, Duke, N.C. Central and also others like North Carolina A&T — have had strong partnerships and collaborations with ORD and Research Triangle Park,” Frey noted. “There’s a kind of research ecosystem that revolves around what goes on at that EPA lab, and that’s all apparently coming to an end.”

Earlier this year, N.C. State University economist emeritus Mike Walden told NC Health News that a rule of thumb is to double the amount of a federal grant to get a handle on the ripple economic effect of that money on a region.

Project dollars generate jobs for research assistants, needs for equipment and other capital investments. The people who fill those posts or supply that apparatus then spend money from the grant generating local economic activity, in grocery stores, restaurants and retail.

Impacts beyond NC

The Environmental Protection Network, a nonpartisan group that includes many former EPA employees, works to strengthen and protect environmental safeguards. Organization members warn that the Trump administration’s efforts to reduce scientific research and roll back environmental regulations will harm the U.S. population.

EPN projects that these rollbacks could lead to “nearly 200,000 premature U.S. deaths through 2050 and trigger more than 10,000 asthma attacks each day nationwide, resulting in missed school and work days and increased emergency care.” The group also estimates that public health costs will outweigh corporate savings by six to one, with $254 billion in annual benefits lost compared to $39 billion in reduced costs for polluters — undermining protections under the Clean Air Act, Safe Drinking Water Act, and other laws,” according to data published by the group.

Although environmentalists are concerned about the potential loss of the Office of Research and Development and the rollback of key regulations, Frey believes the need for continued scientific research will not go away.

“In a sense, this is an exercise. By taking away this capability, it’s going to cause people to realize what they’re missing and how badly it’s needed,” he said. “So I would think it’s going to motivate a really strong conversation about how we fulfill this need for new science to deal with increasingly complex challenges.”",https://i0.wp.com/www.northcarolinahealthnews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Screen-Shot-2025-08-10-at-4.27.33-PM.png?fit=838%2C673&ssl=1,N,,2025-08-11 06:01:21.349110

When President Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill, or OBBB, became law last month, incentives for clean energy projects like wind and solar tax credits and clean energy grants were cut — a blow to the renewable energy sector and a major setback to tribal nations.
The Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe, for instance, has planned solar projects reliant on federal tax cuts.
The now-defunct program promised $3 billion to 350 recipients to fund projects addressing pollution and high energy costs.
Currently, the self-funded Alliance is covering tribal projects that have experienced a sudden loss in tax credits, rescission of federal funds, and uncertainty of direct pay.","Cody Two Bear, who is Standing Rock Sioux, served on his tribal council during the Dakota Access Pipeline protests in 2017. Growing up in a community powered by coal, the experience was transformative. “I’ve seen the energy extraction that has placed a toll significantly on tribal nations when it comes to land, animals, water, and sacred sites,” said Two Bear. “Understanding more about that energy, I started to look into my own tribe as a whole.”

In 2018, Two Bear founded Indigenize Energy, a nonprofit organization that works with tribes to pursue energy sovereignty and economic development by kickstarting clean energy projects. Last year, with nearly $136 million in federal funding through Solar for All, a program administered by the Environmental Protection Agency, the nonprofit launched the Tribal Renewable Energy Coalition, which aims to build solar projects with 14 tribal nations in the Northern Plains.

But when President Donald Trump took office in January, those projects hit a wall: The Trump administration froze Solar for All’s funding. That temporarily left the coalition and its members earlier this year without access to their entitled grant (it was later released in March). However, the EPA is considering ending the program entirely.

The coalition is back on track with its solar plans, but now tribes and organizations, like the ones Two Bear works with, are bracing for new changes.

When President Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill, or OBBB, became law last month, incentives for clean energy projects like wind and solar tax credits and clean energy grants were cut — a blow to the renewable energy sector and a major setback to tribal nations. Moves from federal agencies to end programs have shifted the project landscape as well. The current number of impacted projects run by tribes is unknown. According to the Alliance for Tribal Clean Energy, at least 100 tribes they have worked with have received funds from federal agencies and the Inflation Reduction Act; however, those figures could be higher. “Without that support, most of, if not all of those projects are now at risk for being killed by the new unclear federal approval process,” said John Lewis, the Native American Energy managing director for Avant Energy, a consulting company.

The Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe, for instance, has planned solar projects reliant on federal tax cuts. The projects were designed to power a community health clinic, schools, and a radio station that broadcasts emergency notices during winter storms. However, with the passage of the OBBB, the tribe must now begin construction by July of next year or lose credits, a feat that doesn’t account for the time it takes to secure capital in various stages, seek a complete environmental review, and navigate long permitting timelines through the Bureau of Indian Affairs.

“Some of these projects, at a minimum, have stalled, or they’re having to be reworked in some way to fit within the current parameters that have been laid down by the administration,” said Verrin Kewenvoyouma, who is Hopi and Navajo, and a managing partner at Kewenvoyouma Law that assists tribes with environmental permitting, cultural resources, and energy development. “We have clients that are looking at creative solutions, trying to keep them alive.”

In June, the Inter-Tribal Council of Michigan, a joint organization representing 12 federally recognized tribes in the state, joined a class-action lawsuit against the Environmental Protection Agency, alongside a tribe in Alaska, arguing that the agency illegally froze access to promised project funds from the Environmental and Climate Justice block grant program. The now-defunct program promised $3 billion to 350 recipients to fund projects addressing pollution and high energy costs. Plaintiffs hope the program will be reinstated so that pending projects can be restarted.

Tribes are now seeking philanthropy, short-term funding, and conventional financing to cover delays and gaps in project costs. After the Guidiville Band of Pomo Indians in California lost access to a $3.55 million BIA award to the tribe for solar microgrid development in March, the BQuest Foundation, which specializes in covering expenses needed to continue housing or climate-related projects, gave the tribe $1 million to resume the project’s timeline.

Currently, the self-funded Alliance is covering tribal projects that have experienced a sudden loss in tax credits, rescission of federal funds, and uncertainty of direct pay. “We’re helping try to navigate this challenging period and continue on their self-determined paths, whatever it looks like for them — to energy sovereignty,” said Shéri Smith, CEO of the organization. At the moment, the Alliance is offering a mix of grants from $50 to $500,000, and loans up to $1 million, which will be converted to grants should a tribe default.

“Tribes need to build up internal capacity to carry that out and to have control of their energy situation, for their at-risk members, and members in general,” said John Lewis. “ At such a critical stage, access to affordable, reliable electricity is paramount. The country is getting hotter. The world is getting hotter. It’s warming.”",https://grist.org/wp-content/themes/grist/static/img/favicon/android-icon-192x192.png,N,,2025-08-11 06:01:28.180990

“I’m not against solar, not against wind, but don’t gaslight the people of Virginia by saying they’re clean,” Earle-Sears said.
On biomass: ‘A very good source of fuel’ Some of the policy debates over energy in Richmond have been over what counts as renewable energy beyond solar and wind.
One particular debate has been over “biomass” energy, which means burning something biological to turn it into energy.
Abigail also understands that Virginia must meet its energy needs with affordable, reliable energy in the short- and medium-term.","Virginia’s next governor will face an energy crisis. How she handles it may well define her term.

The basic problem is that the demand for energy is rising — driven largely by the growth of data centers.

The operator of the regional power grid, known as PJM, has already warned that under some scenarios we might not have enough power this summer — and we’ve come close.

The generally agreed-upon solution is to produce more power. There’s also a more controversial notion that maybe we should try to slow down the growth of these power-hungry data centers, although those on the environmental side of the ledger who are most inclined to want to constrain data centers also back the Virginia Clean Economy Act’s goals to convert Virginia’s biggest utilities to a carbon-free electric grid, which means building new energy sources to replace fossil fuels. There seems no scenario where we don’t need to produce more power.

That’s not a task for government — that’s a task for utilities — but the rules that government sets shape what those utilities can and cannot do, and what our energy choices are. That’s why as soon as Republican Winsome Earle-Sears and Democrat Abigail Spanberger were confirmed as their parties’ nominees for governor in early April, I contacted each to ask for an interview on energy policy. Spanberger’s campaign responded right away, and my interview with Spanberger published in late April. Earle-Sears has taken longer to respond, but we recently connected and instead of the promised 15 minutes, she gave me 40 minutes of her time.

Even without an interview, we know some things about how the two candidates differ on energy policy. Spanberger supports the Clean Economy Act and wants to see more solar power developed on rooftops, parking lots and schools as a way to relieve some of the pressure on rural Virginia. Earle-Sears opposes the Clean Economy Act and backs an “all-of-the-above” energy approach, specifically citing “clean coal” as an energy option. In our interview, she said she doesn’t object to renewables, but is not nearly as enthusiastic as pushing solar, in particular, as Spanberger is.

However, on other energy sources, the rhetorical differences between the two candidates might be bigger than the actual policy differences. Both candidates say they support the development of small nuclear reactors (Earle-Sears is more effusive, though). Both say they support burning biomass (again, Earle-Sears seems more effusive). And while Earle-Sears is more supportive of natural gas, Spanberger allows that there is a place for natural gas “in the near- and medium-term.”

With that background, here are some of the highlights of my interview with Earle-Sears:

It’s easy to say we need to produce more energy; it’s much harder to actually do it, when every form of energy has its detractors and nobody wants an energy site near them. So how do we pursue any energy strategy — be it “all of the above” or “some of the above” — when neighbors often want “none of the above” near them?

That’s a question I put to both candidates.

Spanberger’s answer was that she’d convene utilities and others “to have a clear understanding” of the scope of the challenge and figure out how Virginia’s response fits into what other states on the grid do. “I haven’t necessarily given you the solution, but it’s an acknowledgement that it takes real leadership and a focus from the state,” she said.

Earle-Sears’ answer was much the same: “My way of living is to bring people to the table and find a compromise. Find a way that we can have this ‘all of the above’ energy approach.”

Neither of those answers are terribly specific. I also don’t know what answer a candidate could realistically give. Both candidates reject one possible solution — for the state to override local zoning decisions and mandate that localities must accept certain energy projects.

Spanberger opposes a state mandate; so does Earle-Sears. “I do believe the best form of government is the government closest to you,” Earle-Sears said. “After all, you see the mayor, the board of supervisors in the supermarket.”

That also creates a situation where some local governments are making decisions — to approve data centers or to block energy development — that creates consequences the state must deal with; in this case, energy demands are rising faster than energy supply. The solution? “It’s not unusual for us to come together and find a way,” Earle-Sears said. “Someone once said politics is the art of the compromise.”

She did talk about how she would conduct such a meeting: “There are some things as governor you can promise all you want but you have to come to the table and shut everybody in a room and say look, we all want the same thing, how do we get there. You’ve got to get to the white board. What are your five things? What are your five things? What are your five things? How about you? OK, we can’t do your five, but can you agree that maybe these other five we can start looking at? OK, now, let’s go down the line, why won’t this work? OK — why won’t this work? Well, how about this one, and then you bring everybody together. I mean, this is not war. This is not war. You bring everybody together and you figure it out, and sometimes you’ve got to take a hit. You’ve got to take a hit and then hope in the long run, the voters understand that this was the best solution you could come up with.”

As part of her belief in an “all of the above” energy strategy, Earle-Sears said she was not inclined to rule out any energy options: “Why would we tie our hands?”

On nuclear power: ‘We know that SMRs are safe‘

Nuclear power is enjoying a renaissance, with an emphasis on a new type of reactor known as small modular reactors, or SMRs. As the name suggests, they are smaller than conventional reactors (maybe one-third the size) and the idea is that they can be mass-produced in a factory and moved to the eventual site (that’s the modular part). Conventional nuclear plants have taken a long time to build and are expensive. The hope is that SMRs can be built quicker, and more cheaply — and then produce lots of power from a small site (whereas solar requires a lot of space).

The technical term that comes into play here is “baseload power,” meaning a type of power that can run around-the-clock to produce a consistent amount of power — something solar and wind can’t do. While nuclear power has always been popular on the right, some (though not all) on the left are also starting to embrace it because they see using a certain level of nuclear power as the easiest way to phase out fossil fuels without losing reliability.

The only small reactors currently in operation are in China and Russia, but a recent report by the Nuclear Energy Association listed 126 SMRs that have been proposed around the world — with 19 of those described as “near-term” projects, mostly in North America, Europe and Asia. Those lists don’t include the three that are still in the idea stage in Virginia — two from Dominion Energy, at its North Anna nuclear station in Louisa County and the Yorktown Naval Weapons Center, one from Appalachian Power at its Joshua Falls substation in Campbell County. (Disclosure: Dominion is one of our donors, but donors have no say in new decisions; see our policy).

Spanberger has said that “I think Virginia is doing it perfectly” by having Dominion pioneer an SMR at an existing nuclear site.

Earle-Sears emphasized that the technology behind SMRs has already been proven because, even though small reactors have not been used commercially, they have been used by the military for decades. “We know that SMRs are safe because right now they’re right now on the ships and submarines in Norfolk, the largest naval base in the world, and I do not think they’ve had an accident, not the Fukushima type, which is what people want to say when they want to scare folks.”

On renewables: They’re not as green as people think

While Spanberger wants to see more deployment of solar — with particular emphasis on urban areas — Earle-Sears is more critical of both solar and wind.

“I’m not against solar, not against wind, but don’t gaslight the people of Virginia by saying they’re clean,” Earle-Sears said. “These turbines, for example, are manufactured in China, which, as you know, is pursuing coal, so they’re manufactured by fossil fuels, and then lubricated by fossil fuels. And solar has its attendant problems with lithium and storage and all that.”

Globally, 60% of the wind turbines deployed around the world are built in China, according to the Global Wind Energy Council. However, a U.S. Department of Energy report — produced during President Donald Trump’s first term — found that most of the parts used in wind turbines built in the United States were manufactured domestically, from 50% to 70% of the blades to 85% of the nacelles, to 75% to 90% of the towers.

Virginia doesn’t have any on-shore wind farms — not yet anyway, although one is under construction in Botetourt County — but Dominion does have an off-shore wind farm underway off the coast of Virginia Beach. A Dominion spokesman says “the vast majority” of the parts for that facility come from Europe, with some from Mexico — and none from China.

Solar, by contrast, is much more dependent on Chinese production. While it’s difficult to find out what percentage of the panels used in the United States come from China, that nation does account for about 85% of global production of solar panels, according to Statista. The Biden-era Inflation Reduction Act was intended to spur domestic production of solar panels, and it did — but the energy news site E+E Leader reports that many of those companies setting up operations have Chinese ties. The recently enacted One Big Beautiful Bill also ends many solar tax credits, so it’s unclear how many domestic solar panel factories will survive.

Earle-Sears is correct on Chinese manufacturing: While China is ramping up its use of renewables, more than 87% of Chinese power is still based on fossil fuels, with 60.9% coming from coal, according to the International Energy Association. If something says “made in China,” it’s almost a given that it was made with fossil fuels.

On biomass: ‘A very good source of fuel’

Some of the policy debates over energy in Richmond have been over what counts as renewable energy beyond solar and wind. One particular debate has been over “biomass” energy, which means burning something biological to turn it into energy. That can mean lots of things — burning municipal solid waste, for instance — but generally means burning wood.

Not everyone is happy about counting biomass as renewable energy. Yes, trees can grow back, but critics see biomass as expensive — and just another form of carbon emissions.

Biomass currently accounts for 4% of Virginia’s energy generation, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. While that’s a small percentage, Virginia produces more megawatt hours of energy from biomass than all but three other states — California, Georgia and Florida, in that order, according to the group Save On Energy.

Earle-Sears is enthusiastic about biomass. “Biomass, of course, could be used as a baseload, but my opponent doesn’t want to talk about that, but we can’t afford to lose our farming, our forestry, our loggers in Virginia — that’s jobs. And this is a very good source of fuel.” More use of biomass would also be an economic boon to rural areas, particularly those in Southside, whose counties are the top producers of forest products in the state. “We have the land. And trees,” Earle-Sears said. There are those who say “they don’t want any trees cut down. You know there are jobs attached to that. It’s created opportunity. We are going to lose that industry — it adds quite a bit to our economy. That could be part of the renewables but, of course, there are people who don’t want that. They only want solar and they only want wind.”

Earle-Sears’ emphasis on biomass prompted me to go back to ask Spanberger about her views on biomass, since that was something we didn’t cover in our first interview. Here’s the statement Spanberger’s campaign sent: “Abigail is committed to transitioning Virginia to cleaner electricity generation, and she is committed to the long-term goals of the Virginia Clean Economy Act. Abigail also understands that Virginia must meet its energy needs with affordable, reliable energy in the short- and medium-term. Abigail is supportive of expanding a variety of electricity generation sources and continuing to develop advanced energy technologies, such as small modular nuclear reactors, fusion, geothermal, and hydrogen. Abigail also knows that natural gas will continue to be an important part of our energy mix in the near- and medium-term. She also believes that as Virginia works to meet increasing electricity demand, biomass — particularly biomass managed in such a way as to reduce local pollution and encourage sustainable forest management — should remain on the table as an option for consideration.”

You can also see how the candidates answered two energy-related questions on our Voter Guide questionnaire. I intend to seek other interviews with both candidates to ask about other topics.

What do you see as the administration’s responsibility in analyzing its actions on energy policy in terms of affordability?
Can you tell us more about where members of Congress have power to challenge how the administration is managing energy policy?
You asked the DOE for a list of all the closed loans and conditional commitments that the department is reviewing.","The Trump administration recently terminated a $4.9 billion loan for the Grain Belt Express, the country’s biggest transmission grid project. Sen. Martin Heinrich, Democrat from New Mexico, says the decision is illegal.

In an exclusive new interview with Canary Media, Heinrich discusses why he’s demanding that the Department of Energy account for the decision — and what response he’s received.

Last month, Heinrich, the top Democrat on the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, sent a letter to the DOE challenging its vague excuse for cutting off the legally binding contract between the federal government and Invenergy, the Chicago-based energy project developer planning to build the power-line project from Kansas to Illinois.

“Not only am I concerned that this move is illegal,” Heinrich wrote — a belief shared by Jigar Shah, the former head of the DOE Loan Programs Office, which issued the conditional loan guarantee in the waning days of the Biden administration. ​“I am concerned that the federal government is eroding what little trust the private sector has in our ability to be reliable partners.”

That trust is eroding rapidly, Heinrich said. The project has been in the works for more than a decade and is one of only a handful of major transmission developments underway in the United States.

The Grain Belt Express would support gigawatts’ worth of new wind and solar projects — energy sources that are under attack by the Trump administration.

The new GOP megalaw is expected to cut new solar, wind, and battery deployments by more than half just as power demand is rising. Last year, clean energy made up 96% of the new energy capacity being added to the U.S. grid.

Meanwhile, the Trump administration has unleashed a flurry of anti-wind and anti-solar actions in the past month that threaten to subject wind and solar projects to burdensome and potentially insurmountable Interior Department reviews, block development on federal lands under ​“capacity density” restrictions, and potentially put a halt to already permitted wind farms on land and at sea.

The move to block the Grain Belt Express is part of this broader attempt to slow renewable energy — just when the country can least afford it, Heinrich said.

This interview has been edited for clarity and brevity.

Why did you decide to write the letter to Energy Secretary Chris Wright?

Secretary Wright, before he was secretary, said numerous times to our committee [the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources] that he was going to follow the law, and a conditional loan guarantee is a legally binding commitment.

It’s as if you go to your bank and you get preapproved for a mortgage, then when you show up for the closing, you expect the bank to make good on that. And that’s what we had here.

The reality is, we need this administration to follow the law and make good on commitments that have been made so that there is predictability in the market. We also need every cheap electron we can get right now, and so if you put these big infrastructure projects in jeopardy, what you’re really doing is passing along more costs to consumers.

Have you received any response from DOE?

Not yet.

Do you expect you’ll eventually get a response?

I certainly expect to. And if the secretary wants to be taken seriously by the Senate, then he needs to provide that information.

One of the things that really bothers me about a lot of the actions that the Department of Energy and the Department of Interior are taking right now is the sum total is creating a lot of uncertainty in the finance markets, and that flows through to create additional costs for consumers.

When you have a big transmission project like this one, there are $52 billion in energy savings over the course of the next decade, and that should be accruing to consumers. And if you put all of this in jeopardy, the real impact is that costs are going up, and then when you put all of these permits that are usually very predictable and are now uncertain, all of this is going to raise costs for consumers — for retail consumers and for commercial consumers. We’re already seeing electric rates start to rise, and I am deeply concerned that that is going to get a lot worse in the coming years because of their actions and their inactions.

You asked the department if it had analyzed the impact of canceling the loan guarantee. What do you see as the administration’s responsibility in analyzing its actions on energy policy in terms of affordability? And are they fulfilling those responsibilities?

They are not. And it doesn’t take a detailed analysis to understand that, in an environment of surging demand, if you artificially constrain supply, you’re going to be raising costs for people. And I want the American people to know that this is not an accident. They are choosing to take actions which are raising people’s electric bills.

Sen. Chuck Grassley, a Republican representing Iowa, has said he won’t be moving Treasury Department nominations forward until there’s some response from the administration regarding its actions on wind and solar tax credits. Can you tell us more about where members of Congress have power to challenge how the administration is managing energy policy?

Well, I think the confirmation process is one obvious place. This is an administration that has been very public about saying that they need more people in place to be able to execute their agenda. But unless they’re responsive to the Congress, that process is not going to speed up.

You asked the DOE for a list of all the closed loans and conditional commitments that the department is reviewing. Have you received any response?

I’ll be honest, they have not been particularly transparent or responsive on many of these issues, and that is a trend that I think does not bode well for the next several years.

Having been through a 17-year process to get one transmission line built [the SunZia line in New Mexico and Arizona], I’m also acutely aware of the jobs that hang in the balance. We’re talking about thousands and thousands of good, high-quality American jobs that are simply not going to come to fruition because this administration has a political agenda.

What's happening?

New offshore oil and gas exploration permits were banned in New Zealand in 2018 with government plans to transition to a carbon-neutral future, per the Guardian. However, the right-wing coalition voted to reverse the ban after a final reading of the Crown Minerals Amendment Bill.

Government leaders said reversing the ban will help with high energy costs as well as energy shortages. Meanwhile, environmental groups said the move will hurt the country's biodiversity and natural resources. Steve Abel, a member of the Green Party of Aotearoa New Zealand, called it ""shamefully regressive.""

The ban reversal followed New Zealand's departure from the Beyond Oil and Gas Alliance in June. The international coalition, which includes countries like Denmark and France, aims to phase out fossil fuel use.

Why is the ban reversal important?

Fossil fuels like coal, oil, and natural gas are dirty energy sources that contribute to the overheating of the planet. Nearly 30% of all oil and gas production comes from offshore areas, according to Oceana.

Fossil fuel exploration for offshore drilling sites can have devastating impacts on the environment, including disrupting ecosystems. Oftentimes, fossil fuel companies use seismic testing to find reserves. The noise can echo for miles and harm marine animals that rely on sound for communication and navigation, per the Natural Resources Defense Council.

There's also the risk of oil spills and gas leaks. In 2024, the city of Huntington Beach, California, received a $5.25 million settlement after thousands of gallons of crude oil spilled into the ocean years earlier. Several beaches and harbors were closed, resulting in financial loss for local businesses.

What's being done about offshore oil and gas exploration?

Over the period, SGN and Utonomy project a 16% methane emissions reduction using intelligent pressure control, with the gas distribution governor pressure safely reduced by up to 31%.

The trial, conducted between October 2024 and March 2025 across five SGN regions in southern England, used dynamic pressure management powered by Utonomy’s AI-driven platform, UtonomyOne.

The system optimises the network pressure by automatically adjusting it in response to real-time demand and weather conditions.

It also anticipates changes, such as sudden cold snaps, avoiding the surge of alarms typically triggered by older pressure management systems during rapid demand shifts.

As a result, the average governor pressures could be reduced by up to 31% – a critical factor in curbing methane losses, which rise with pressure.

Richard Buckley, SGN Head of Network Management (Distribution), said that tackling methane leakage is a key focus for the company.

“By harnessing advanced pressure management and machine learning, we can achieve meaningful reductions today while modernising network operations. This trial demonstrates how intelligent, self-optimising systems can drive a more efficient, lower emission gas network built for the future.”

The trial is part of SGN’s £6 million ($8 million) Intelligent Gas Grid initiative, funded by Ofgem’s Strategic Innovation Fund to explore how digitalisation, AI and green innovation can reshape the gas networks for a decarbonised energy future.

In the next phase of the project, AI and an expanded dataset will be leveraged over a longer period to help gas networks predict anomalies before they occur and accelerate the integration of renewable green gases like biomethane.

Adam Kingdon, founder and CEO of Utonomy, adds delight in working with SGN as well as Cadent, Wales & West Utilities, Northern Gas Networks, National Gas and DNV on this project.

""I have the GE geospring heat pump water heater,"" one commenter wrote.","A homeowner who upgraded to a heat pump water heater was thrilled with how quickly they started saving money and how soon the switch would pay off.

They described ""the awesome experience"" on Reddit, detailing the replacement of two electric 40-gallon water heaters with a hybrid 80-gallon heat pump water heater.

Despite concerns about noise, vibrations, and other commonly referenced negatives, ""Ours had no issues whatsoever,"" the poster said.

In its first week of operation, the water heater saved 30 kilowatt-hours every day. Based on the homeowner's electricity rate of 12.6 cents per kilowatt-hour, they expected to save $113 each month.

The poster said they installed the appliance themselves and rehomed the old water heaters to rental units. They would break even in less than two years.

Their situation marked a perfect example of how you can benefit from upgrading to a heat pump water heater. The homeowner lived in humid South Texas, which is ""about as hot as it gets in the U.S.,"" they noted.

And since their heat pump water heater was located in the garage — and the appliances generally pull heat from the air to heat water — it could help to keep the space from becoming ""unbearable.""

These are just some of the positives you can count on if you make the change.

Additionally, a tax credit through the Inflation Reduction Act gives homeowners 30% off a heat pump water heater installation. This tops out at $2,000, but your state and local governments and retailers may offer other incentives.

After President Donald Trump signed the One Big Beautiful Bill into law, though, the rebates and incentives for heat pump water heaters will be ending Dec. 31, so acting sooner rather than later could save you thousands of dollars.

One option is Cala, which markets a smart heat pump water heater that learns when you need hot water and how much. The customizable system helps you save money and lower your household's production of planet-warming pollution, as 3% of Americans' heat-trapping gas pollution is created by water heaters.

In the Northeast, this setup and others can save you over $6,000 over the lifespan of the heat pump water heater, according to Cala. That's because the technology is much more efficient — up to 500% efficient, in fact — than gas or electric configurations, and heating water accounts for almost 20% of household energy costs.

Their goal is to help institutions across the nation optimize efficiency and reduce operational costs while cutting carbon emissions.

In a recently published study, Sanjeev Khanna and Saad Alsamraee, researchers in the University of Missouri’s College of Engineering, analyzed six years of data collected from the university’ Combined Cooling Heat and Power Plant between 2017 and 2022.

The data included campuswide energy usage and environmental variables such as air temperature, humidity, wind speed/direction and solar radiation — all tracked hourly.

Using machine learning, the research team successfully forecasted the campus’s energy demands for 2023 with an accuracy of 94%.

“By knowing when there are going to be peaks and valleys and how much energy will be needed, even on an hour-by-hour basis, we can ultimately help power plants better plan ahead so they can be as efficient as possible with energy use,” Khanna said. “This research can help universities and industries reduce carbon emissions and save money.”

The U.S. energy transition agenda, for instance, remains politically fragile.
Investment Implications For investors, the key takeaway is that Ørsted's rights issue is a calculated bet on long-term resilience.","The energy transition is no longer a distant promise but a present-day imperative. Yet, as the world races to decarbonize, companies like Ørsted A/S are grappling with the harsh realities of a high-cost environment: inflationary pressures, regulatory uncertainty, and the financial toll of scaling renewable infrastructure. In this context, Ørsted's $9.4 billion rights issue—announced in 2025—marks a pivotal moment. It is not merely a capital raise but a strategic recalibration aimed at balancing growth with financial discipline, and resilience with profitability. For investors, the question is whether this move will fortify Ørsted's position as a leader in offshore wind or expose vulnerabilities in an increasingly volatile sector.

A Strategic Pivot: From Aggressive Expansion to Capital Efficiency

Ørsted's decision to scale back its 2030 capacity target from 50 GW to 35–38 GW signals a shift from volume to quality. The company is prioritizing high-internal-rate-of-return (IRR) projects in its core markets—fixed-bottom offshore wind in Europe and the U.S.—while exiting underperforming regions like Norway, Spain, and Japan. These exits, expected to unlock $15.3 billion in capital, will fund a broader efficiency program, including 600–800 global job cuts by 2026. The move reflects a sector-wide trend: as interest rates remain elevated, companies are rethinking capital allocation to preserve liquidity and credit ratings.

The rights issue's proceeds will also support Ørsted's U.S. offshore wind ambitions, a market fraught with policy risks. Projects like Revolution Wind and Sunrise Wind require long-term financing, which hinges on maintaining an investment-grade credit rating. By securing this capital, Ørsted aims to mitigate the impact of potential U.S. tariffs on wind components or regulatory rollbacks under a future administration. The company's renegotiation of the Ocean Wind project in New Jersey—avoiding $7.3 billion in cancellation fees—demonstrates its agility in navigating political and economic headwinds.

Financial Prudence in a High-Cost World

The rights issue addresses a critical vulnerability: Ørsted's debt servicing costs in a high-interest-rate environment. With the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) offering tax credit transferability, the company has also turned to private capital partnerships, such as a $680 million deal with J.P. Morgan, to reduce project risk. These partnerships mirror broader industry strategies, such as Australia's Powering Australian Renewables Fund, and underscore the importance of diversifying funding sources in an era of capital scarcity.

However, the move is not without trade-offs. The Danish government, as the majority shareholder, has signaled its support for the offering, but dilution remains a concern for existing shareholders. The reinstatement of dividends in 2026—a key milestone for investor confidence—will hinge on the success of cost-cutting measures and the execution of the revised investment plan. For now, the focus is on achieving EBITDA targets of DKK29–33 billion by 2026 and a return on capital employed (ROCE) of ~13% through 2030.

Risks and Opportunities in the Energy Transition

While the strategic reset is well-intentioned, execution risks persist. The U.S. energy transition agenda, for instance, remains politically fragile. A potential Trump administration could impose tariffs or delay permitting, directly impacting Ørsted's U.S. projects. Similarly, supply chain bottlenecks and rising material costs could erode margins. Investors must also weigh the durability of the global energy transition itself. If demand for renewables slows, even the most disciplined strategies may falter.

That said, the move positions Ørsted to capitalize on its core strengths. Offshore wind remains a high-growth sector, with Europe and the U.S. offering long-term demand. By focusing on these markets, the company is aligning itself with regions where regulatory support is strongest. The half-year 2025 earnings report, due on August 13, will be a critical test of the strategy's effectiveness, particularly in terms of cost reductions and project pipeline execution.

Investment Implications

For investors, the key takeaway is that Ørsted's rights issue is a calculated bet on long-term resilience. The move prioritizes financial stability over short-term growth, a necessary adjustment in a high-cost environment. However, success depends on the company's ability to navigate regulatory and macroeconomic risks.

These sensors are portable devices that can measure local air quality in real time. They are generally less accurate than more expensive instruments. However, their lower cost enables users to deploy them in large numbers to supplement information provided by the national air quality monitoring system and meet other information needs. Among their many uses are identifying pollution hot spots, monitoring industrial sites and nearby neighborhoods, and conducting scientific research. Sensors are more accurate for some pollutants than others. They are not yet available for ambient levels of certain specific air toxics such as benzene and metals.

Solar and wind, while critical to decarbonization, are intermittent and require costly storage solutions. Nuclear energy, by contrast, offers baseload power with zero carbon emissions, making it the ideal partner for AI's energy demands. Constellation's nuclear plants—such as the Clinton Clean Energy Center in Illinois and the Crane Clean Energy Center in Pennsylvania—are now central to powering the next generation of AI infrastructure.

The company's 20-year agreement with Meta to supply nuclear energy to AI data centers in Illinois is a case study in this alignment. By increasing the Clinton plant's output by 30 megawatts, Constellation ensures a stable, carbon-free power supply for Meta's operations while securing a fixed-price revenue stream for decades. This model—long-term, high-margin contracts with energy-intensive tech firms—is replicable and scalable. Microsoft's 2024 partnership to restart the Three Mile Island plant further underscores the growing demand for nuclear energy in the AI sector.

Strategic Expansion and Regulatory Tailwinds

Constellation's recent acquisition of Calpine, a leader in natural gas and renewable energy, has created a coast-to-coast energy platform. This diversification strengthens its ability to meet regional AI demand while maintaining a foothold in traditional energy markets during the transition. The company's nuclear fleet, with over 19,000 megawatts of capacity, is now a critical asset in a world where energy security and sustainability are non-negotiable.

Regulatory support has also accelerated Constellation's momentum. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's streamlined licensing processes and President Trump's executive orders to fast-track nuclear projects have reduced barriers to entry. Additionally, the Inflation Reduction Act's Production Tax Credit (PTC) provides financial incentives for long-term nuclear contracts, enhancing the economics of these partnerships.

Earnings Resilience and Long-Term Value

For investors, Constellation's strategy offers a compelling mix of stability and growth. The company's fixed-price, multi-decade contracts with tech firms insulate it from energy price volatility, a stark contrast to the cyclical risks of fossil fuels. These agreements also lock in cash flows for decades, creating a predictable earnings trajectory.

Consider the Crane Clean Energy Center: its early 2027 restart will generate $16 billion in GDP for Pennsylvania and create 3,400 jobs, while delivering steady returns to shareholders. Similarly, the Clinton plant's 20-year Meta contract preserves 1,100 local jobs and generates $13.5 million annually in tax revenue. These projects are not just environmental or economic wins—they are earnings-firming assets that compound value over time.

Investment Implications

Constellation's positioning as a bridge between nuclear energy and AI-driven growth makes it a standout in the energy transition. The company's ability to secure long-term, high-margin contracts with tech giants—while benefiting from regulatory and policy tailwinds—positions it to outperform peers in both traditional and renewable energy sectors.

For investors seeking exposure to the AI economy's infrastructure layer, Constellation offers a unique opportunity. Its nuclear fleet is not just a power source; it is a foundational asset for the next era of technological innovation. As AI adoption accelerates, the demand for reliable, carbon-free energy will only grow, and Constellation is poised to meet it.

In a market increasingly defined by short-term volatility, Constellation Energy's long-term, earnings-firming strategy provides a rare combination of resilience and growth. For those with a 10- to 20-year horizon, this is a stock worth watching—and owning.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-08-11 03:00:40.676569

The primary environmental concern was the potential harm to neighboring plants from Dicamba drift and volatilization.
The issue has not centered on human health, but on the effects of Dicamba drift on the environment.
With 500,000 soybean farmers in the US, we rank first in global soybean production.
The result is a chaotic patchwork of shifting interpretations, frustrating farmers, emboldening environmentalists, and leaving the EPA in the crosshairs of both.","Dicamba is a widely used herbicide for weed control, on which many soybean and cotton farmers depend. Under the law, an herbicide is approved if it

“will not generally cause unreasonable adverse effects on the environment.”

Dicamba is involved in an ongoing policy tug-of-war over whether it satisfies the criteria for “unreasonable adverse effects” and represents an overall redefinition of acceptable risk, which changes with each new Administration.

Dicamba

What makes Dicamba particularly interesting is that it has been widely used since 1967 on commercial and residential turf, as well as in forestry, golf courses, lawns, and in agriculture, including corn, cotton, soybeans, sugarcane, and wheat crops. The controversy over Dicamba is over anarrow application of its use.

As discussed previously, in 1996, manufacturers introduced seeds that were genetically engineered to be resistant to specific herbicides, including Dicamba. Dicamba does not damage crops grown from these GMO seeds but kills weeds growing near the crops. This is enormously beneficial to farmers, increasing their crop yields and efficiency. These seeds were rapidly adopted across the US, primarily for soybeans, cotton, and corn. Today, over 90% of these crops in the US are the product of genetically engineered seeds.

Dicamba Drift

One of the major controversies surrounding the use of Dicamba is its ability to “drift” from where it is sprayed, damaging crops, as well as desirable plants, bushes, and trees in neighboring fields that are not grown from genetically engineered seeds. This is particularly a problem in hot weather and with temperature inversions [1], which can cause Dicamba to vaporize and become suspended near the ground surface, subsequently moving into neighboring fields. Drift has pitted neighbors against neighbors and is central to several lawsuits.

Another issue is over-reliance on Dicamba, as weeds become increasingly resistant, a phenomenon that has also occurred with other herbicides, such as glyphosate, and antibiotics in microbes. There are also concerns that the EPA understated its effects on bees and other pollinators, which critics believe could lead to significant losses in honey production.

The Regulatory Picture

Under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA), all pesticides and herbicides seeking EPA approval for use in the US must demonstrate that the product

“will not generally cause unreasonable adverse effects on the environment.”

The law goes on to say that “economic, social, and environmental costs and benefits of the use of the pesticide” may be considered. This sets up a regulatory tug-of-war and is why each Administration can switch its interpretation of the law.

Before 2016, Dicamba use was restricted to mixing it in the soil before planting a crop; however, in 2016 and 2017, the EPA approved spraying three dicamba products “over-the-top (OTT)” for growing genetically engineered soybeans and cotton. This change was approved because spraying Dicamba on the growing plants is the most effective method for killing weeds on these crops. In 2018, the EPA extended that approval for an additional two years.

Before the 2016 approval, the EPA prepared a draft risk assessment on Dicamba’s OTT use, which was updated in 2022. The EPA found no dietary, residential, or post-application risks of concern and identified only an occupational hazard for workers who might inhale the product. Nor did the EPA find evidence that Dicamba was associated with an overall risk of cancer or any specific type of cancer, based on animal studies and the Agricultural Health Study, a study of 41,969 private and commercial pesticide applicators in Iowa and North Carolina. The primary environmental concern was the potential harm to neighboring plants from Dicamba drift and volatilization.

For the last five years, the approval of Dicamba for genetically engineered crops has ping-ponged back and forth due to lawsuits and EPA action. The issue has not centered on human health, but on the effects of Dicamba drift on the environment. After its initial approval, its use was canceled in June 2020 due to a lawsuit. The EPA reapproved it in October 2020, but another lawsuit resulted in its cancellation in 2024. On July 23, 2025, the EPA announced a proposal essentially reversing its 2024 decision to disallow Dicamba’s use.

The EPA included provisions in its proposed approval to protect workers’ health, requiring applicators to wear personal protective equipment, including NIOSH-approved respirators. To protect against drift, it set maximum application rates, prohibited aerial applications, established buffer zones, and implemented temperature-dependent restrictions on application.

Weeds

Weeds “quickly establish in, protect, and restore soil that has been left exposed by natural and human-caused disturbances.” On the other hand, weeds are the most costly type of pest to farmers, causing greater yield loss and adding significantly to farmers’ costs than insect pests, crop pathogens, or pests such as rodents, birds, and deer. Weeds compete directly with crops for light, nutrients, moisture, and space, releasing natural substances that inhibit crop growth, hosting pests or pathogens, and contaminating crop harvest. Weeds result in higher costs for farmers, since they may need to use more labor-intensive (manual) weed control, which results in more soil disturbance and erosion.

With 500,000 soybean farmers in the US, we rank first in global soybean production. Soybeans are grown on approximately 87 million acres, with 80 percent of farms concentrated in the Midwest. Weed control is crucial for soybean farmers, with one study finding that if not controlled, weeds could destroy up to 50 percent of our soybean yield.

Cotton is another major US crop, with approximately 16,000 farms producing nearly 20 million bales of cotton. We are the largest global exporter of cotton. Cotton, in its earliest stages of growth, is slow-growing, making it even more susceptible to weeds than soybeans

The EPA moved quickly because, without herbicides, yields would fall, leading to higher prices and, in some instances, farm failures.

The Dicamba debate is less about a single herbicide and more about how we define risk, responsibility, and regulatory consistency in American agriculture. As administrations pivot, so too do the standards that determine what is considered environmentally safe. The result is a chaotic patchwork of shifting interpretations, frustrating farmers, emboldening environmentalists, and leaving the EPA in the crosshairs of both. Until we establish a more stable regulatory framework that can withstand political turnover, the cycle of litigation, cancellation, and reapproval will persist, rendering our pesticide policies a perennial game of administrative whack-a-mole.

The Company is delivering practical solutions to climate challenges through solar, hydropower, and green hydrogen projects tailored to local drought and energy needs.

In May, POWERCHINA entered into a general contracting agreement with Spain’s Viroque Energy for the Arreaz Photovoltaic Power Station in San Roque, Cádiz. The project, with an installed capacity of 44 megawatts, includes design, procurement, construction, commissioning, and operation and maintenance. Once completed, it is expected to supply about 95,000 megawatt-hours of clean electricity annually, supporting local low-carbon energy development. POWERCHINA is actively advancing the global energy transition.

Another POWERCHINA-constructed solution to global climate pressures, the Ulog Hydropower Plant in Bosnia and Herzegovina, was officially completed and handed over for operation recently, marking the project’s entry into full commercial operation. With an installed capacity of 35.14 megawatts, this hydropower station is designed to meet both power generation and ecological water supply needs, the project is equipped with a concrete double-curvature arch dam, an ecological flow power station, a right-bank water diversion tunnel, and a water diversion and power generation system. Upon full completion, the project will significantly enhance local power supply reliability, support Bosnia and Herzegovina’s energy structure optimization, concurrently improve regional ecological conditions, and further amplify POWERCHINA’s global influence.

Further east, Central Asia’s first industrial-scale green hydrogen project in the region – also marking POWERCHINA’s maiden international green hydrogen venture – has commenced trial operations in Tashkent, Uzbekistan, with successful production of high-purity hydrogen. This landmark project represents a crucial component of Uzbekistan’s Green Energy Strategy. The core hydrogen production facility is located at the MAXAM Chemical Plant in Tashkent, the capital of Uzbekistan. It adopts ALK electrolysis technology, equipped with 4×1,000 Nm³/h electrolyzer systems, total capacity is 20 MW. The facility can produce 3,150 tons of green hydrogen annually, reducing approximately 30,000 tons of carbon dioxide emissions per year compared to the previous gray hydrogen production mode. The project represents a key milestone in advancing green, low-carbon energy transformation across Central Asia and beyond.

Speaking about the green hydrogen initiative, Mohammad Abunayyan, Chairman of ACWA Power, commented that the successful launch of the project marks a significant milestone for the industry. He praised the project’s progress, highlighting its demonstration of international cooperation and the shared commitment to advancing clean energy. By overcoming numerous challenges, the project also provides valuable experience for the global development of green hydrogen.

Last month, at least 14 car-carrier ships traveled from Chinese ports to Europe through the Red Sea and Suez Canal, according to a new analysis by Lloyd’s List Intelligence, a British maritime information service. About the same number made the voyage in June.

The trips have continued even after the Houthis used drones, grenades and gunfire to sink two other cargo ships early last month. The militia group says the attacks are in solidarity with Palestinians living through Israel’s war against Hamas in Gaza.

Most shipping analysts assume that the Chinese government has reached an understanding with Iran or the Houthis not to harm car-carrier ships from China. It seems that “China has found a way to deal with the Iran-backed Houthi rebels, and they have been told that their ships will not be targeted,” said Daniel Nash, associate director of valuation and analytics at Veson Nautical, another maritime data firm.

Traveling through the Red Sea and Suez Canal saves 14 to 18 days on each round trip between Asia and Europe, compared with going around Africa. This reduces costs for fuel, crews and the ships themselves by a couple hundred dollars per car.

“So, no alarm bells about any projects getting pulled back or held up amid cuts at the federal level?” NJBIZ asked.

“In fact, there’s actually been some signs to the opposite for this region and for our area,” Lalevee told NJBIZ. He said that the infrastructure needs are undeniable. “From an administration point of view, I think they’re [the Trump administration] continuing to move things.”

The IUOE Local 825 leader also noted that next year is when the Federal Highway Trust Fund is set to be authorized. Lalevee said that will be an interesting study given the current political climate.

On the Hudson Tunnel Project, which NJBIZ has reported extensively on, he said he is pleased with the continued progress and momentum. “Complete confidence in the GDC,” said Lalevee of the Gateway Development Commission, which manages the $16 billion project.

Energy

The conversation then moved to energy – the hottest-button issue at the moment as local utility bills have spiked – and one he has spoken extensively to NJBIZ about previously.

Lalevee has been critical of the Murphy administration for its energy policies.

“First of all, it’s a mess,” he said. “Second, the governor can call all the summits that he wants, but on the day he took office New Jersey was a net exporter of electric. On Jan. 1, 2025, we’re a net importer.”

“If we’re going to capture the future economy, if that’s truly data centers and AI – which I don’t think there’s much of an argument against that premise, that this is the future economy – you need lots of electricity. You need redundancy in your system. Data centers and AI need latency of power. That means when the switch opens, the power has to run right through. That means it has to be right there next to it. Your data centers are generally placed right next to the generating plants,” Lalevee continued.

“So, if we don’t have generating plants, we’re not going to have data centers. And Pennsylvania and New York are going to kick the crap out of us,” he said, comparing these “upper-middle-class jobs” to the ones throughout New Jersey’s “Medicine Chest” heritage. “This data center/AI economy is kind of the next iteration. And we’re not built to accept it.”

Lalevee said that the reality is, with President Donald Trump in office, that offshore wind farms are not in the cards, which the state made big bets on. He added that we can’t just put our hands up and let the economy tank because offshore wind farms are not happening.

“And I’m not saying it’s all gas all the time – and that’s the only situation and the only solution,” said Lalevee. “But it accounts for over 45% of the electricity that we’re making right now. You can’t ignore it. It’s the elephant sitting in the room – so what are you going to do?”

He noted the different political philosophy of the Trump administration. “Now we hear talk of the NESE, that Northeast Supply Extension Pipeline Project, perhaps coming back. That goes through New Jersey and helps get natural gas out on Long Island.

“In lower New York State, there’s serious talk about the Constitution Pipeline, which had been shut down back in Gov. [Andrew] Cuomo’s day,” Lalevee continued. “Those are two projects that would give our members a whole ton of work. Of course, there’ll be some kind of the political tennis that goes on.

“Here we are sitting in a world of 20% energy increases on our electric bill, a PJM auction that’s going to raise them again, and last year, when we had our polar vortex – if you were to look at the PJM app, which is public and shows the energy mix – we watched the amount of electric produced by natural gas go down because we are using the natural gas to heat our homes.

“But what increased on the side was coal. So, for the people who say – oh, we have enough natural gas supply. Do we? Certainly, those are projects that would bring a lot of activity into the area and pipelines pay taxes. So there’s some good downstream to local governments, if you will.”

The big race

From there, the discussion shifted to the 2025 gubernatorial campaign.

IUOE Local 825 made major news with its decision to endorse Republican candidate Jack Ciattarelli over Democrat Mikie Sherrill. The union had backed Gov. Phil Murphy in his two elections.

Lalevee cited energy policy as a major reason, voicing his disagreement with Sherrill’s energy policy. The candidate laid out her plan in an NJBIZ op-ed that focused on clean energy sources, such as solar, and against “handing the keys to our energy future to Big Oil and coal CEOs.” It made no mention of natural gas.

“It was a pretty easy choice,” said Lalevee. “Energy policy is a big thing – and a big deal and a big job creator. We believe that the two policy directions on the table are black and white. And for our members to have good, robust work – they’re downstream to the economy.

“We’re the last ones out when it goes – kabang. And we’re the last ones back in when it starts to ramp up,” he said, explaining how economic downturns and upswings impact his members. “Which is why really robust public infrastructure programs have consistently saved the economy – because it’s restarted construction work faster. On the energy there’s that piece.”

He also mentioned Sherrill’s advocacy for suspending the federal gas tax a few years back when pump prices spiked. Lalevee noted that those dollars feed the Federal Highway Trust Fund.

“Are your members going to be actively out there for Ciattarelli – supporting his campaign and things of that nature?” NJBIZ asked.

“Absolutely,” said Lalevee. “Jack came to a union meeting and accepted the endorsement with 500 people who were in a ballroom in a hotel – who jumped to their feet when he walked through the door.”

“So, he’s got the rank-and-file behind him?” NJBIZ asked.

“He absolutely has the rank-and-file behind him,” said Lalevee. “And I would even go as far as to say some of my colleagues who’ve made a different endorsement are not in step with their rank-and-file.”

Workforce development

The conversation closed with Lalevee highlighting the union’s focus on training, workforce development as well as adopting and learning the ever emerging, and evolving, technologies.

“Having an educated workforce that we supply to the contracting community is the core of our mission,” said Lalevee. “We are essentially a big HR department for construction contractors. We’re supposed to train them, skill them, deploy them out into the workforce.”

Having an educated workforce that we supply to the contracting community is the core of our mission.

– Greg Lalevee, IUOE 825 business manager

He said that it’s important to stay on the razor’s edge and train – especially given the dangers of the work, referencing two recent deaths on job sites around New Jersey.

“Being productive, being safe – those are the two things we have to do here,” Lalevee stressed. “This in an inherently dangerous business – and the only way we stop on top of it and maintain the highest end of productivity is to train, train, train.”",https://originnjbiz.wpenginepowered.com/files/2024/10/Lalavee-interior.jpg,N,,2025-08-11 00:59:01.056787

TO ADD TO THAT SUPPLY. IN A ONE ON ONE INTERVIEW, WE ASKED HIM ABOUT THAT EFFORT AND HIS RECENT DECISION TO BEGIN THE PROCESS OF RESCINDING AN OBAMA ERA CLIMATE CHANGE REGULATION. ADMINISTRATOR ZELDIN, TAKE US THROUGH. HOW BIG OF A PRIORITY IS IT FOR PRESIDENT TRUMP TO GET THESE PIPELINES, LIKE THE CONSTITUTION, INTO NEW ENGLAND? I HEAR PRESIDENT TRUMP TALKING ABOUT UNLEASHING ENERGY DOMINANCE SO OFTEN. IT’S NOT JUST WHAT THE PUBLIC HEARS DURING PUBLIC SPEECHES, BUT DURING PRIVATE MEETINGS. THE NATIONAL ENERGY DOMINANCE COUNCIL WAS ESTABLISHED BY PRESIDENT TRUMP RIGHT AFTER HE WAS INAUGURATED, BRINGS TOGETHER DIFFERENT AGENCIES WITH EQUITIES IN THIS ENERGY CONVERSATION SO THAT WE’RE WORKING TOGETHER AND WE’RE COLLABORATING DURING THESE MEETINGS THAT WE HAVE. PRESIDENT TRUMP WANTS TO KNOW ABOUT PROGRESS WITH CONSTITUTION PIPELINE TO DELIVER NATURAL GAS IN NEW ENGLAND. NESSIE PIPELINE, WHICH IS TO BE BUILT ONTO LONG ISLAND AND THERE’S, YOU KNOW, YOU GO ACROSS THE ENTIRE MAP ALL THE WAY OUT TO ALASKA, SEVERAL HUNDRED MILE LNG PIPELINE THAT THEY’RE DISCUSSING THERE. AND YOU THINK OF THE BENEFIT TO THE U.S. ECONOMY, TO OUR NATIONAL SECURITY. AND I WOULD SAY TO OUR ENVIRONMENT, TOO. WE IN THE UNITED STATES PRODUCE ENERGY AND TRANSPORT ENERGY, SO MUCH MORE SAFER THAN SO MANY OTHER COUNTRIES ELSEWHERE AROUND THE WORLD. AND AS PRESIDENT TRUMP AND THIS ADMINISTRATION LOOKS TO NEW ENGLAND, WE SEE SO MUCH OPPORTUNITY FOR U.S. ENERGY TO HELP POWER HOMES, TO BRING DOWN COSTS, TO CREATE JOBS. IT’S AN EXCITING OPPORTUNITY FOR NEW ENGLAND AND PRESIDENT TRUMP. I’VE HEARD A LOUD AND CLEAR FROM HIM MANY TIMES. HE WANTS TO HELP. WHAT IS THE EPA’S ROLE, THOUGH IN PARTICULAR, WE’VE HEARD IN THE PAST, THE OBSTACLE IS YOUR HOME STATE, NEW YORK. WHAT CAN THE EPA DO TO SMOOTH THE ROAD, PERMITTING, PERMITTING, PERMITTING? YOU KNOW, IT’S THERE ARE SO MANY WAYS EPA IS CAPABLE OF SLOWING THINGS DOWN, BUT EPA ALSO HAS A LOT OF DIFFERENT WAYS TO HELP SPEED THINGS UP. WE WANT TO ADVANCE COOPERATIVE FEDERALISM. WE WANT TO WORK WITH THESE LOCAL STATES AND MUNICIPALITIES. WE WANT TO GET THESE PROJECTS OVER THE FINISH LINE. NOW, IN SOME CASES, WE’LL GET INVOLVED IN SITING WHERE PROJECTS POWER PLANTS MIGHT GET BUILT ON TOP OF A SUPERFUND SITE OR A BROWNFIELD SITE. SO THAT’S IMPORTANT. SO ALL THREE OF THOSE ASPECTS COME TO MIND. THOSE ARE JUST THREE OF THE EXAMPLES OF PERMITTING WITH SITING AND ADVANCING COOPERATIVE FEDERALISM. CAN YOU EXPLAIN THE DECISION TO REPEAL THIS ENDANGERMENT FINDING FROM THE OBAMA ERA REGARDING CLIMATE CHANGE AND THE IMPACT TO HUMAN HEALTH AND THE ENVIRONMENT? IT’S A PROPOSAL THAT’S NOW GOING OUT TO PUBLIC COMMENT FOR 45 DAYS, AND THEN A DECISION WILL GET MADE AFTER THE PUBLIC COMMENT PERIOD. THIS PROPOSAL THAT WENT OUT IS A PROPOSAL THAT’S GONE OUT NOW AFTER THE SUPREME COURT WEIGHED IN IN SOME VERY MAJOR CASES IN RECENT YEARS, THE LOPER CASE OVERTURNING THE CHEVRON DOCTRINE, WEST VIRGINIA VERSUS EPA, MICHIGAN VERSUS EPA AND OTHERS, MAKING IT CLEAR THAT WHEN INTERPRETING LANGUAGE THAT’S IN STATUTE, WE CAN’T GET CREATIVE. WE HAVE TO LOOK AT THE PLAIN READING OF THAT STATUTE. AND THERE’S ALSO SOMETHING CALLED THE MAJOR POLICY DOCTRINE. SO WHEN A DECISION IS MADE BY EPA, WHICH THEN GETS FOLLOWED WITH WHAT AMOUNTS TO TRILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF REGULATION, THAT’S A PRETTY BIG DECISION. AND CONGRESS, WHERE I SERVED FOR EIGHT YEARS, SHOULD BE NOT JUST INVOLVED IN THAT, BUT THEY SHOULD BE THE LEAD IN DETERMINING WHAT THE STATUTE SAYS. AND I, AS THE HEAD OF EPA, SHOULD BE MAKING SURE THAT WE ARE FOLLOWING THE LAW AND NOT GETTING CREATIVE. AND THE AMERICAN PUBLIC SPOKE LAST NOVEMBER. AND I THINK THAT IT’S VERY IMPORTANT THAT WHILE I’M THERE IN CHARGE OF EPA, THAT I, I’M NOT TRYING TO GET CREATIVE WITH LAW, THAT WE ARE ACTUALLY RETURNING TO THE RULE OF LAW AND RESPECTING THESE DECISIONS OF THE SUPREME COURT. AND WHILE FOCUSING ON OUR CORE MISSION, WHICH IS PROTECTING HUMAN HEALTH AND THE ENVIRONMENT WHILE LOOKING TO ADVANCE CLEAN AIR, LAND AND WATER FOR ALL AMERICANS, THAT WE’RE ALSO COGNIZANT OF WHAT THE AMERICAN PUBLIC SPOKE OUT LAST NOVEMBER WITH THEIR ECONOMIC CONCERNS, THEIR ECONOMIC DEMANDS, AND WHEREVER POSSIBLE, WE CAN BOTH PROTECT THE ENVIRONMENT AND GROW THE ECONOMY. IS THIS ABOUT DISAGREEING WITH THE SCIENCE FROM 2009, OR RECONFIGURING THE POLICY MATRIX IN HOW THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT OPERATES? WE CARE ABOUT FACTS AND TRUTH, AND THIS IS A GOOD THING. IN 2009, WE’RE ABLE TO DEAL WITH MORE FACTS THAN WHAT IN 2009 WERE ASSUMPTIONS THAT WERE GETTING MADE. SO IN 2009, WHEN TRYING TO REACH THE ENDANGERMENT FINDING, THERE WERE OPTIMISTIC VIEWS OF WHERE THINGS WERE GOING WITH THE CLIMATE. THERE WERE PESSIMISTIC VIEWS OF WHERE THINGS WERE GOING WITH THE CLIMATE.

Asia now has a once-in-a-generation opportunity to lead the low-carbon transition.”

— Cathay FHC President, Chang-Ken Lee

TAIPEI, TAIWAN, August 10, 2025 /EINPresswire.com/ -- Amid rising geopolitical volatility and shifting sustainability priorities, long-term sustainable transformation requires bold, forward-looking strategies that connect systems and stakeholders. On July 9, Cathay Financial Holdings (Cathay FHC) convened over 5,000 registered participants for the 9th Cathay Sustainable Finance and Climate Change Summit, reinforcing its role as a regional platform for accelerating climate action.

Held under the theme “Shaping a New Vision for Sustainability,” the 2025 summit focused on two urgent fronts: the evolving landscape of sustainable finance in a disrupted world, and nature-positive, socially inclusive business transformation. The summit’s growing influence was evidenced by participation from over 2,500 institutions, including more than 700 listed companies representing nearly 80% of Taiwan’s total market capitalization. Notably, over half of major high-emission industries were represented, with board-level participation surging nearly 90% year-on-year—signaling increased executive-level commitment to climate action.

""Asia’s Moment to Lead""

Cathay FHC President Chang-Ken Lee set the stage for the summit by commemorating the 10th anniversary of the Paris Agreement and noting the critical five-year window to achieve 2030 climate targets. “While political headwinds in the West have slowed momentum, Asia now has a once-in-a-generation opportunity to lead the low-carbon transition,” Lee said.

Citing data from the Asian Venture Philanthropy Network (AVPN), Lee noted that Asia is projected to account for up to 40% of global climate investment. Lee also highlighted the rising strategic relevance of water resources, biodiversity, and innovative financing mechanisms such as biodiversity bonds and nature-based insurance.

Cathay FHC continues to advance this agenda through industry-leading efforts, including co-developing biodiversity credit methodologies, mobilizing corporate engagement, and expanding low-carbon finance. As of the end of 2024, Cathay FHC and its subsidiaries had mobilized TWD 375.7 billion (USD 11.6 billion) in low-carbon investments, a 13.7% year-on-year increase. Taiwan’s industrial strengths in precision machinery, shipping, automation, and e-mobility also position it to play a leading role in the global green economy.

""Strengthening the Policy-Private Sector Interface""

In a keynote address marking his first year in office, Financial Supervisory Commission (FSC) Chairperson Chin-Lung Peng, reaffirmed Taiwan’s commitment to green finance. He introduced three priority initiatives: (1) The development of a national carbon emissions database; (2) The publication of guidelines for sustainable economic activities; and (3) Strategic incentives for financial institutions to support emerging green sectors.

During the morning session, titled “The Evolving Landscape of Sustainable Finance in Times of Disruption,” FSC Chairperson Peng, Taiwan Stock Exchange President Edith Lee, and other distinguished guests provided stakeholders with updates on emerging financial policy directions and evolving sustainability disclosure frameworks.

Rebecca Mikula-Wright, CEO of the Asia Investor Group on Climate Change (AIGCC), warned that 73% of Taiwan’s listed firms face significant environmental risks. She cited a research from the Government of Singapore Investment Corp (GIC) estimating that global investment in climate adaptation could reach USD 9 trillion by 2050, urging Taiwan to accelerate its efforts in green power, low-carbon technology, and just transition strategies.

Also joining the summit for the first time was Hiro Mizuno, former CIO of Japan’s Government Pension Investment Fund (GPIF), following his earlier appearance at Cathay FHC’s COP29 side event. In his keynote, he stated: “ESG is not an ideology—it is a framework for understanding risk. Financial institutions must become accelerators of the energy transition to turn ideas into impact.” He emphasized that despite increasing political resistance in the West, Asia and Taiwan are uniquely positioned to lead.

Other speakers included Wen-Chen Shih, Deputy Minister of Environment, who presented Taiwan’s updated net-zero transition roadmap, and Brenda Hu, Director General of FSC, who outlined the policy vision for positioning Taiwan as a regional sustainable finance hub.

The morning concluded with a high-level panel discussion, “Shaping a New Sustainable Paradigm,” featuring President Chang-Ken Lee and global experts envisioning a new sustainable finance architecture responsive to shifting global dynamics.

""From Climate Action to Nature Capital""

The afternoon session, “Innovative Solutions for Nature-Positive and Socially Inclusive Business Transformation,” pivoted to explore the intersection of ecosystems, biodiversity, and human well-being.

Shan-Chi Liu, President of Cathay Life Insurance opened the session, followed by Jens Nielsen, CEO of the World Climate Foundation (WCF), who spoke on the evolution of sustainability—from climate to nature—and the integration of nature capital into financial markets. He also highlighted the rapid emergence of biodiversity credit markets in Asia.

Sophia Cheng, CIO of Cathay FHC, presented actionable pathways for a just and resilient transition, stressing the importance of aligning environmental and social outcomes.

Patrick Yeung, Assistant Director of AVPN, discussed how sustainable finance can support equitable energy transitions across Asia.

Ming-Jer Tsai, Director of National Taiwan University Experimental Forest, shared a global overview of biodiversity credit developments and introduced the Asian Biodiversity Credit Alliance, a newly formed regional coalition of universities working credible methodologies.

Peter Pu, Managing Director of the British Standards Institution (BSI) Group NE Asia, addressed the increasing pressure on Taiwanese enterprises to align with nature-related risk frameworks and disclosure requirements.

The summit concluded with the panel, “Towards a Sustainable Future- The Challenging Nature Actions Across Diverse Industries,” featuring: Chih-Pang Lin, President of Cathay Power Inc.; Aravindan Srinivasan, Executive Director of AVPN; Shalom Chen, Chief Sustainability Officer of L’Oréal Taiwan; Viola Lin, Vice Chairperson of Ørsted Taiwan. Panelists shared how companies across sectors are tackling nature-related risks and embedding strategies into their business models.

Cathay FHC reaffirmed its commitment to Sustainable Finance in Action, with a long-term goal of achieving 100% renewable energy across global operations by 2050. A recognized leader in climate finance, Cathay FHC’s energy transition portfolio reached TWD 73.3 billion by the end of 2024—an 80% increase since 2021—signaling strong momentum toward a nature-aligned, inclusive, and resilient economy.

“Slapping a tax on electric vehicle drivers won’t make a massive difference to roads anyway.
They are making your streets healthier for you and the next generation,” Francis Vierboom said.
This could help minimise the need for new transmission lines and support more rooftop solar in our communities,” Francis Vierboom said.
Let’s use the tax system to get this upgrade to EVs done faster,” Francis Vierboom said.","Rewiring Australia has slammed the proposal to fast-track a road-user tax for electric vehicle users, with 90% of new cars sold every day still being petrol vehicles.

Plans for a road-user tax for electric vehicle drivers are reportedly being discussed at a meeting today ahead of the Treasurer’s Economic Reform Roundtable.

Rewiring Australia has warned that targeting such a small percentage of drivers who are motivated by a desire to reduce their fuel bills and emit less carbon emissions is not only bad for the uptake of cleaner and cheaper technology, but of no real benefit to the economy either.

“We should be creating more incentives for people to upgrade to electric vehicles, which are cheaper to run, quieter, and cleaner for our air,” Rewiring Australia CEO Francis Vierboom said.

“Of the 3,500 new cars sold every day in this country, 90% are still new petrol vehicles. Every time someone buys a new petrol car, they are locking in another two decades of expenses and emissions. We need to prioritise cleaner and cheaper alternatives for Australian families and businesses.

“Slapping a tax on electric vehicle drivers won’t make a massive difference to roads anyway. The current fuel excise tax, which brings in $16 billion in revenue, only makes up about 2% of total tax revenue. If the government is worried about tax revenues, we’d suggest they take another look at the fuel tax credits handed out to oil and gas companies before going after commuters trying to reduce their running costs.

“Of that $16 billion, only about a third is spent on roads so the argument that a small proportion of drivers will lead to a vast improvement in our roads is a bum steer.

“An EY report found each electric vehicle contributed about $740 a year in benefits because of reduced noise and air pollution and carbon emissions. I don’t think EV drivers are really getting a free ride. They are making your streets healthier for you and the next generation,” Francis Vierboom said.

Rewiring Australia said there was evidence electric transport could also bolster our economy.

“Australia has almost the most roads in the world per capita, and has been spending $160 million on importing oil every day. We could instead be harnessing our own solar energy to power transport which moves our groceries, building and agriculture supplies around the country. The economic benefits from cheaper transport will flow through the rest of the economy.

“If we want quieter streets, less air and carbon emissions, and reduced bills, we need to be doing everything we can to help people upgrade.

“Another added benefit - we know EVs can help ease the cost of our energy system, with the batteries in our cars set to become the biggest source of flexibility and storage in our energy system. This could help minimise the need for new transmission lines and support more rooftop solar in our communities,” Francis Vierboom said.

“It’s taxation basics: tax what you want less of, not what you want more of. Let’s use the tax system to get this upgrade to EVs done faster,” Francis Vierboom said.",,N,,2025-08-11 02:00:17.781952

Yes, the fall of renewable prices below that of fossil fuels means that renewables today provide not only a cleaner and better alternative to fossil fuels, but also a cheaper one.
Even the EU, held in thrall by Trump and the US, is shifting away from fossil fuels.","By Prabir Purkayastha

The tipping point between renewable energy and fossil fuels has been reached, says a new UN report.

UN Secretary General Antônio Guterres said we are entering a renewable era and leaving the era of fossil fuels. According to the report, “In 2024, renewables made up 92.5% of all new electricity capacity additions and 74% of electricity generation growth.”

While almost the entire world has increasingly switched to renewables, the US stands out as the sole ‘dissident’, with the Donald Trump administration denying climate change and still backing fossil fuels.

Not that it can stop the march of history, but given that we are already out of time, the US, the second largest emitter of greenhouse gases and one of the wealthiest countries in the world, can certainly worsen our transition to a hotter world.

According to the UN report, the cost of renewables has dropped, while their installed capacity has increased significantly. This is particularly the case for solar photovoltaic (PV) plants, which use solar panels.

Concentrated solar plants (CSPs), which use lenses or mirrors, concentrate solar rays to heat water into steam, and then use it in a steam turbine-driven conventional generator. By the end of this decade, the levelised cost of electricity from such solar plants is expected to approach that of fossil plants.

However, PV plants with storage have grown cheaper, making CSPs a much more cost-efficient option today, except perhaps in desert regions. The advantage of CSPs is that their turbines provide inertia, helping the grid remain stable – a crucial issue for grids with many renewable energy plants.

As we saw in the recent Spanish grid collapse, the grid’s failure was partly due to a lack of turbines to provide sufficient rotational inertia, thereby increasing the grid’s inability to handle frequency fluctuations.

For the first time, solar and wind energy are now cheaper than coal, natural gas or oil, and are the quickest options for installing new electricity generation. The difference in the last three to five years in this transition from fossil fuels to renewables can be seen below:

Between 2010 and 2022, solar and wind power became cost-competitive with fossil fuels – coal and gas.

By 2023, utility-scale solar photovoltaics (PV) and onshore wind energy had lower generation costs than fossil fuels.

The long-talked-about renewable transition is finally here!

The question is, do we have the political will to do what is not only necessary in climate terms but also economically a better option for all of us?

Or will the old fossil lobby, particularly in the US, sabotage humanity’s transition to a low-carbon future?

Solar and wind have now become the fastest-growing sources of energy and provide electricity at costs well below that of fossil fuels. Increasingly, it is economically cheaper than coal and oil. With the cost of batteries dropping, adding grid-level batteries and short-term hydro-storage schemes to stabilise the grid is again economically attractive.

In other words, renewables are now competitive today even without taking into account our climate goals. This is the real inflexion point that we have been talking about since the 1980s, when solar photovoltaics hit the scene.

The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change had two goals.

One goal was to bring to all countries the need for quick climate action to prevent a catastrophic rise in global temperature.

The other is to provide the means to fund the energy transition, phasing out fossil fuels, particularly for low-income countries. The understanding that drove such climate action was that the rich countries, who had already occupied the bulk of the existing carbon space due to their past carbon emissions, would help the poor countries fund this transition.

How have these dual goals been met? While the rich countries have been willing to talk about climate goals, right from the beginning, they have not been willing to walk the talk about providing funds to poorer countries for their energy transition.

While the EU and the UK, the biggest occupiers of global carbon space after the US, have been investing in their renewable energy transition, the US has not only twice walked out of the global climate agreements but has also provided incentives to its fossil fuel companies.

While then US President George Bush walked out of global climate change agreements, saying American lifestyles are not open to global negotiations. President Trump has gone even further. He is not only a climate change denier but is providing incentives to fossil fuel companies to burn even more carbon fuels and wants to drill for oil and natural gas even in Siberia.

Carbon credits are simply like blood money: rich countries paying poor countries to create or maintain carbon sinks, for the continued and profligate use by rich countries of carbon fuels – coal, oil and natural gas. These were mostly accounting frauds, in which certain companies issued fraudulent carbon credits, allowing continued carbon emissions in the rich countries.

Some of this carbon blood money also reached some partners in the Global South, but the bulk of the proceeds of the fraud stayed at home in countries issuing the so-called carbon credits.

A lot of hot air.

With the cost of renewables dropping below that of coal, where does this leave companies that touted carbon capture, not through natural carbon sinks such as compensatory forestry, but actual separation of CO2 from the exhaust gases after burning fossil fuels? This is the other carrot that is being dangled before us for rich countries continuing to burn oil, gas and coal.

Today, the only place that carbon capture still has economic relevance is in separating CO2 and using it “to enhance oil recovery projects, where it is injected into oil fields to extract additional oil that would otherwise be trapped underground” (Charles Harvey and Kurt House, New York Times, 16 August 2022). This is why the two authors also describe carbon capture as Big Oil’s Large Grand Scam!

The other use of fossil fuels is in the production of what is called grey hydrogen, where hydrogen is produced for its use in the manufacture of steel, ammonia, petroleum refining, methanol and plastic production.

It, however, releases greenhouse gases in the form of CO2 to the atmosphere, so it is called grey hydrogen. Grey hydrogen is used as a chemical and not as a fuel. The key players are oil companies: ExxonMobil, Chevron, BP and Shell.

Not surprisingly, an analysis – Li, M, Trencher, G, & Asuka, J, 16 February 2022, Plos One – of their business activities shows “a continuing business model dependence on fossil fuels…We thus conclude that the transition to clean energy business models is not occurring, since the magnitude of investments and actions does not match discourse”.

In other words, oil companies are continuing with their business as usual under the cloak of carbon capture, grey hydrogen, etc along with a lot of hot air. Incidentally, these four companies alone are responsible for 10% of all global warming in the world since 1965.

Yes, the fall of renewable prices below that of fossil fuels means that renewables today provide not only a cleaner and better alternative to fossil fuels, but also a cheaper one.

Whether it is electricity generation or transport, fossil fuel-based solutions are being rapidly replaced by solar and wind in power generation and by electric vehicles in transport.

Even the EU, held in thrall by Trump and the US, is shifting away from fossil fuels.

China and India are both investing heavily in renewables, with India having reached its goal of 50% of installed capacity in renewables well ahead of its goal.

For most developing countries, the renewable route is not only more carbon-friendly but also the cheaper option.

The only country acting as the spoiler is the US, which, though it is no longer competitive in manufacturing, believes that it can extract ‘rent’ from others. This is the new G1’s ‘Trump-based world order’, instead of the G7’s so-called ‘rules-based world order’. – Globetrotter.",https://aliran.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/pexels-photo-356036.jpeg,N,,2025-08-11 03:01:02.568927

The firm's journey to commercialize solid-state batteries—a technology long heralded as the next frontier in electric vehicle (EV) power—has reached a critical inflection point in 2025. With its QSE-5 platform now in testing and a $261 million funding boost from Volkswagen's PowerCo, QuantumScape appears poised to leap from the lab to the market. Yet, the path ahead remains fraught with technical, financial, and competitive hurdles that could either validate its bold vision or expose it as a cautionary tale of overhyped innovation.

The Allure of QuantumScape's Breakthrough

QuantumScape's QSE-5 solid-state battery represents a leap forward in energy density, charging speed, and safety. With a projected 844 Wh/L energy density—nearly double that of conventional lithium-ion batteries—the QSE-5 could enable EVs with 400–500 miles of range on a single charge. Its ability to charge from 10% to 80% in 12–15 minutes and retain 95% capacity after 1,000 cycles further positions it as a disruptive force. These metrics are not theoretical; the QSE-5 has already passed UN 38.3 safety tests, a regulatory milestone that opens the door to commercial deployment.

The key to scaling this technology lies in QuantumScape's proprietary ""Cobra"" separator process, which accelerates heat treatment by 25x compared to its predecessor. This advancement is critical for gigafactory-level production, reducing costs and enabling the company to meet automotive demand. The transition to Cobra is now underway, with baseline production expected to qualify by Q2 2025. If successful, this could catalyze a 2026 launch with a major OEM partner, a timeline that aligns with Volkswagen's aggressive EV strategy.

The Risks of a Pre-Commercial Gamble

Despite these strides, QuantumScape remains a pre-revenue entity with a $6.23 billion valuation and a cash burn rate of $250–$280 million in 2025. Its financial model hinges on milestone-based payments from partners like PowerCo and Murata Manufacturing, which together provide $261 million in funding. While this extends its liquidity runway to late 2028, it also exposes the company to execution risks. Delays in scaling the Cobra process, yield issues in mass production, or regulatory setbacks could trigger a liquidity crunch.

Competitive threats loom large. Toyota, Samsung SDI, and Solid Power are all advancing solid-state technologies with shorter timelines or more mature supply chains. Toyota, for instance, aims to launch its own solid-state batteries by 2027–2028, leveraging its decades-long R&D investment. Meanwhile, QuantumScape's non-exclusive licensing model—while capital-efficient—leaves it vulnerable to partners pivoting to alternative technologies or in-house solutions.

Geopolitical and regulatory uncertainties add another layer of risk. U.S.-China trade tensions could disrupt supply chains for critical materials like lithium and ceramics, while potential changes to EV tax credits might slow market adoption. These factors underscore the fragility of QuantumScape's business model in a sector where timing and execution are paramount.

Historical Context: High-Risk Tech Ventures

QuantumScape's story mirrors that of other high-tech pre-commercialization ventures, such as Tesla and SpaceX in their early days. Like these companies, QuantumScape is tackling a capital-intensive industry with long R&D cycles and high barriers to entry. However, while Tesla and SpaceX achieved early revenue and market traction, QuantumScape remains unproven in commercial production. Its valuation, which trades at a premium to its fundamentals, reflects the speculative nature of its bet.

Historical data shows that only 10–15% of high-tech startups generate outsized returns, while the majority fail to return capital. QuantumScape's risk-reward profile is thus binary: success could position it as a leader in the $200 billion EV battery market by 2030, while failure would likely result in a sharp revaluation. This dynamic is evident in its stock's volatility, with a beta of 4.37 and a 22% maximum drawdown in recent months.

Investment Implications

For investors, QuantumScape presents a high-stakes proposition. The upside is clear: if the QSE-5 achieves commercialization by 2026 and secures a meaningful share of the EV battery market, licensing and royalty revenue could drive exponential growth. The company's partnerships with PowerCo and Murata provide credibility, and its technological differentiation offers a moat against competitors.

However, the risks are equally pronounced. Execution delays, competitive displacement, or regulatory headwinds could derail its roadmap. Given its pre-revenue status and lack of a proven commercial model, QuantumScape is best suited for long-term investors with a high risk tolerance and a 5–10 year horizon. Short-term speculation is perilous, as the stock's volatility and lack of downside protection make it a binary outcome play.

Conclusion: A Gamble on the Future

QuantumScape's journey is a microcosm of the broader energy transition—a race to redefine mobility through cutting-edge technology. Its QSE-5 platform and strategic partnerships offer a compelling vision, but the path to commercialization is littered with obstacles. For investors, the key question is whether the potential to disrupt the EV battery market justifies the risks of a pre-commercial venture.

In the end, QuantumScape is not a stock to own for its balance sheet or earnings but for its potential to reshape an industry. If the company can navigate its technical and financial challenges, it may well deliver the kind of outsized returns that define the next decade of innovation. But for those unprepared for the volatility and uncertainty, the risks may outweigh the rewards. As with any high-stakes bet, the decision to invest in QuantumScape should be made with eyes wide open—and a clear understanding of the binary outcomes that lie ahead.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-08-11 02:00:25.816099

Now, PJM predicts Dominion’s territory will see more than 20,000 MW of growth over the same period from data centers alone.
A June report from the group found data centers accountable for 63% of the price surge in 2025 and 2026.
According to an IEEFA report, some utility customers are effectively subsidizing transmission infrastructure that exclusively benefits data centers in other states.
With no buyer for the electricity this new infrastructure was built to deliver, the cost of developing this now “stranded” grid capacity would fall to the utility’s other ratepayers, driving up retail electricity prices.","Unprecedented data center development is driving up the cost of electricity for U.S. consumers, particularly within the country’s largest power grid.

The price of power during times of peak demand is poised to jump over 1,000% from 2024 levels within the territory of PJM Interconnection, the U.S.’s largest grid operator. For homeowners and businesses served by many of the roughly 1,200 utilities that operate within PJM's grid, this means electric bills growing by as much as 60% over the next five years.

At the heart of this looming energy affordability crisis is an imbalance between the limited supply of new power being added to the grid amid a flood of demand for electricity from data centers. With a transmission system spanning 13 states in the mid-Atlantic and Midwest that encompasses data center hubs like Northern Virginia and Chicago, PJM’s service area is already home to the country's highest concentration of data centers, and many more are on their way.

While there are risks that the billions of dollars of grid improvements needed to meet this demand could push prices higher, both utilities and energy analysts warn that even greater sticker shock lies ahead unless urgent action is taken to build more generation and increase the supply of available power.

“Despite higher prices, we are not seeing the market respond fast enough,” Exelon CEO Calvin Butler said on the company's July 31 earnings call. One of the largest electric utility parent companies in the U.S., Exelon's six subsidiaries operate largely within PJM's grid.

“Time remains of the essence in adding supply to the grid,” he added.

Last month, PJM held its capacity auction for 2026 and 2027, which sets the price power plant owners will receive for the electricity they generate during peak demand, sold to utilities that then deliver it to customers.

Two years ago, the capacity auction for 2024 and 2025 saw power priced at $28 per megawatt per day. The final price at last month’s auction was $329.17 per megawatt per day, a more than tenfold increase that would have been higher had PJM not placed a price cap on the sale.

The auction’s results could increase residential retail rates between 30% and 60% by 2030, according to technology consulting firm ICF. And while the price impact will vary across different parts of PJM’s footprint, Pennsylvania utility PPL Electric indicated on the firm’s second-quarter earnings call that the capacity sale would ultimately increase its customers’ utility bills by an average of $20 per month.

""This outcome underscores PJM's critical need for capacity, driven largely by surging demand from data centers, which is expected to outpace new generation additions,"" analysts at ICF said, according to Reuters.

PJM’s supply and demand imbalance has become increasingly acute as artificial intelligence has accelerated the data center building boom.

In 2022, PJM anticipated that by 2037, there would be 5,700 MW of total load growth within Dominion Energy’s data center-sense service territory. Now, PJM predicts Dominion’s territory will see more than 20,000 MW of growth over the same period from data centers alone.

Other utilities operating within PJM report similarly dramatic spikes in their demand pipelines. American Electric Power, whose subsidiary utilities operate across 11 states, has 190 gigawatts in its interconnection queue — more than five times the capacity of its current 37-gigawatt system.

“Demand for power is growing at a pace I have not seen in my 45-year energy career,” AEP CEO Bill Fehrman said on its Q2 earnings call.

While data centers aren't the only source of load growth, they are the main driver of rising prices within PJM, according to Monitoring Analytics, a firm that serves as an independent monitor for the grid operator. A June report from the group found data centers accountable for 63% of the price surge in 2025 and 2026.

Expanding the PJM grid to meet this demand will require tens of billions of dollars of investment to build new power plants and upgrade transmission infrastructure. PPL Electric said on its earnings call that the new generation needed to meet demand within its service territory alone will require up to $19B. AEP raised its five-year capital plan last month by 30% to $70B, a capex hike that followed an earlier 30% increase less than a year prior.

Some industry analysts caution that this massive capital spending, while needed to alleviate power supply constraints, could itself put upward pressure on electricity prices.

According to an IEEFA report, some utility customers are effectively subsidizing transmission infrastructure that exclusively benefits data centers in other states. The study highlights utility customers in West Virginia, who may foot a $440M bill for a transmission line that does not actually provide them with power but instead supplies data centers in Virginia.

AEP Ohio's headquarters in Columbus.

Additionally, there is a risk that utilities could devote significant resources toward developing new transmission infrastructure to supply gigawatts of power for a data center campus, only to have that project canceled or dramatically scaled back. With no buyer for the electricity this new infrastructure was built to deliver, the cost of developing this now “stranded” grid capacity would fall to the utility’s other ratepayers, driving up retail electricity prices.

To protect against this scenario, AEP petitioned Ohio regulators to approve a specialized rate for data centers that requires them to pay for 85% of their full power commitment up front. That rate was approved last month, with similar targeted rates enacted or being considered in Indiana, West Virginia and Kentucky.

“This approved data center tariff provides assurances that there will be reliable electric grid infrastructure to deliver the power we all count on while keeping costs as low as possible for all customers,” AEP’s Fehrman said on the earnings call.

Still, Fehrman and other leaders of utilities that operate within PJM contend that controlling consumer cost increases amid the unprecedented rise in data center construction hinges primarily on increasing the power supply — developing new power generation and connecting it to the grid far faster than is being done today. But accomplishing this will be difficult.

As Bisnow reported last month, industry leaders say PJM’s generation interconnection process is fundamentally broken. The grid operator has a backlog of more than 2,000 power generation projects in its interconnection queue, with some waiting as long as seven years as an overwhelmed PJM struggles to conduct reliability studies. Many approved projects never materialize.

Additionally, the vast majority of projects in PJM’s queue are wind and solar, which face an uncertain future due to changes in tax incentives and permitting hurdles implemented by the Trump Administration.

While there are growing calls for major reforms to PJM’s interconnection process, PPL Electric CEO Vincent Sorgi says the structure of PJM’s capacity market exacerbates the generation shortage because existing power plant operators have little incentive to add more capacity. By building new generation, companies already operating power plants within PJM would be effectively competing against themselves, driving down the price of their product and cannibalizing demand, Sorgi said on PPL's earnings call.

“Once these last two capacity auctions are reflected in our customers' bills, it's going to increase them by about $20 a month with no new generation to show for it, and that’s simply a transfer of wealth from utility customers to IPPs and to their shareholders,” Sorgi said.

Leaders of multiple utilities said on earnings calls that there is a desperate need for generation options that will allow them to circumvent PJM’s interconnection process and the capacity market.

Firms like AEP and PPL pointed to behind-the-meter deals to provide power directly to hyperscalers, such as PPL’s recently announced partnership with Blackstone to power hyperscale campuses in Pennsylvania.

Utilities also highlighted the role state lawmakers play in facilitating new generation. Executives at PPL and Exelon point to pending legislation in Pennsylvania and New Jersey that would allow utilities to build and operate their own generation, something that is prohibited across much of PJM’s footprint.

With electricity demand from data centers continuing to grow, Exelon’s Butler says government and utilities need to pull out all the stops to address a power affordability crisis that isn’t going away soon.

“States have an opportunity to proactively bring control, certainty and cost benefits by pursuing options outside of the capacity market,” Butler said. “Such options can ensure solutions are there to meet state goals when the market can't or won't deliver.”",https://cdn.bisnow.net/fit?height=1200&type=jpeg&url=https%3A%2F%2Fs3.amazonaws.com%2Fcdn.bisnow.net%2Fcontent%2Fimages%2F2021%2F02%2F60331008129a7-pylon-1501237_1920.jpeg&width=1200&sign=EfNGz9bx2rHKRO-iBwuQFaMpZxaf9dxSDbthUeBHBWk,N,,2025-08-10 23:59:34.955032

The report rightly identifies three major gaps in Australia’s current emissions reduction policies: electricity sector policies post-2030; industrial facilities exempt from the Safeguard Mechanism; and heavy vehicles.

However, it overlooks some important levers that could achieve net zero at least cost:

Comprehensively improving energy efficiency and flexibility.

Reviewing inefficient electricity network revenue regulation and pricing.

Reducing fugitive methane emissions from coal and gas extraction.

Scrutinising the net economic cost-benefit of new coal and gas projects.

Comprehensively improving energy efficiency and flexibility

In its latest World Energy Outlook report, the International Energy Agency (IEA) said that “the goal of doubling the global rate of energy efficiency improvements could provide larger emissions reductions by 2030 than anything else, but looks far out of reach under today’s policy settings.” In 2023, the IEA found that, while Australia had had success in achieving energy savings, annual improvement rates slowed after 2015 to less than half what is required under a net zero-aligned trajectory.

IEEFA estimates that over 1.7 million inefficient new gas and electric appliances are installed each year across Australia. Failing to shift those to efficient electric appliances costs Australian households over $3 billion in unnecessary energy costs. Australian appliance standards have not kept up with technological progress, with widely available heat-pump based appliances using a fraction of the energy used by traditional gas and resistive electric appliances. Improving electric appliances’ efficiency nationally would save more electricity per year than the increase needed to accommodate the shift from gas to electric appliances.

Appliances offer an opportunity to support the electricity sector transition through being operated flexibly. Both hot water and air conditioning are key loads that could be flexibly operated, using more power during the daytime solar period, rather than in the evening peak period. This could reduce requirements for large-scale generation and network build.

Many small-scale programs have also revealed large untapped opportunities to improve industrial energy efficiency. For example, a program delivered by the Australian Alliance for Energy Productivity in New South Wales found that 80-90% of energy used by compressed air systems (which represent about 10% of industrial electricity use) is wasted. However, since the closure of the Energy Efficiency Opportunities program in 2014, there has been a gap in comprehensive government policy to support industrial energy efficiency. Unlocking this opportunity will require more than the Safeguard Mechanism, with a particular focus on capability building.

Reviewing inefficient electricity network revenue regulation and pricing

IEEFA estimates that supernormal profits across electricity distribution and transmission networks amounted to $15 billion (on top of “allowed” profits of $17.6 billion) over 2014-2023. This has led to higher electricity bills for consumers and undermined economic productivity. With distributed energy resources (DER) increasingly capable of providing network services, current regulation based on monopoly assumptions for electricity networks is outdated. A first-principles review of the economic regulation of electricity distribution networks is essential to redesign the regulatory regime for productivity, affordability and the energy transition.

The recent boom in household batteries also presents an enormous opportunity to reduce bills for households and reduce the investment required in large-scale electricity system assets. IEEFA has found that rooftop solar and batteries could slash summer and winter peak demand in all states, reducing it to zero or below zero in the vast majority of cases. However, tariffs and incentives are needed to drive an optimum outcome for the energy system.

Reducing fugitive methane emissions from coal and gas extraction

Coal and gas extraction are responsible for at least about 20% of Australia’s emissions, and possibly about 25% if suspected methane emissions underreporting is correct. Methane is a powerful greenhouse gas, but a short-lived one compared with carbon dioxide. Therefore, cutting methane emissions from the coal and gas sectors would have a rapid, significant effect on atmospheric warming potential.

Methane emissions are expected to remain stable till 2035, with the Safeguard Mechanism inadequate for driving methane emissions reductionsinadequate for driving methane emissions reductions. This is despite the low cost of abatement and the potential economic and financial benefits of utilising the captured methane. Methane is the main component of fossil gas, and IEEFA estimates that about 76 petajoules of methane could be recovered across the coal and gas sector each year. That is worth about $950 million and is more than twice the amount of gas anticipated to be needed for power generation in the National Electricity Market in 2025.

Scrutinising the net economic cost-benefit of new coal and gas projects

IEEFA’s research has shown there are high economic risks associated with many new coal and gas developments, in particular those targeting liquified natural gas (LNG) exports.

In the context of an enormous looming global LNG supply glut, new LNG projects could worsen the financial situation of existing projects by worsening oversupply, further depressing global LNG prices. Existing LNG projects in eastern Australia have had disappointing financial results and have led to significant economic costs by driving a tripling in domestic gas prices in the eastern states. This in turn has driven significant industrial facility closures and decreases in gas generation. In addition, LNG projects are associated with very large gas use and emissions, which cannot be adequately addressed by carbon capture and storage.

IEEFA hopes that the Productivity Commission will take a broader look at the opportunities available to both progress Australia’s emissions reduction agenda and reduce costs for Australians.",https://ieefa.org/sites/default/files/2025-08/andy-wang-XplGvY2UrfM-unsplash.jpg,N,,2025-08-10 23:59:39.661803

Tesla posted on X, stating, “$7,500 Federal Tax Credit ends Sept 30. You’ll need to take delivery – not just place an order – by that date to make use of the credit before it’s gone.”

“Important re timing of vehicle delivery,” Musk said, quoting Tesla’s post.

The deadline follows legislation signed by U.S. President Donald Trump in July that will end the credits that are available for new, used and leased EVs after Sept. 30, replacing a Biden-era policy that had been set to run through 2032.

For the Model Y, Tesla set an Aug. 11 order cutoff to qualify for a free upgrade on eligible inventory.

The Model Y Long Range AWD lease price increased to $449 a month from $399, up as much as 14%, with estimated delivery times extended to four to six weeks from one to three weeks for both Model Y variants, Tesla investor and influencer Sawyer Merritt posted on X.

For the Model 3, the free upgrade offer applies to inventory ordered by Aug. 18, with some variants, including custom orders, also seeing longer waits. Lease offers start at $299 a month for the Rear-Wheel Drive and $699 for the Performance trim, both with $3,000 down for 24 months.

Both models are eligible for a $7,500 federal tax credit on qualifying cash and financed purchases delivered by Sept. 30, as well as a $7,500 lease incentive.

Other promotions include $1,000 off for military personnel, first responders, teachers and students; a one-month Full Self-Driving (Supervised) trial; and the ability to transfer the feature from an existing vehicle.

Separately, Musk said Friday that Tesla’s next Full Self-Driving (Supervised) software update, expected next month, will “substantially” reduce the need for driver attention while not enabling full autonomy.

Drivers will still need to remain alert in complex intersections, poor weather, and “unusual events,” he said, describing the upgrade as a “major step-change improvement for rare conditions” that would make the car feel “eerily human.”

The EV maker also secured a rideshare license in Texas, listing Tesla Robotaxi LLC as an authorized transportation network company on the state’s Department of Licensing and Regulation website.

Analysts expect a sales surge before the federal credit expires. “We’re expecting Q3 may be [a] record for EV sales because of the tax incentives going away,” said Stephanie Valdez Streaty, senior analyst at Cox Automotive, according to a CNBC report.

U.S. consumers bought nearly 130,100 new EVs in July, the second-highest monthly total on record, up 26.4% from June and 20% from a year earlier, Cox data showed.

In 2023, according to the World Wind Energy Association, the global wind energy capacity increased to 1047 gigawatts, which is enough to supply energy to millions of homes and dramatically reduce carbon emissions. However, building the giant turbines that generate this clean energy is not simple. Wind equipment manufacturing is faced with considerable challenges: creating

100-meter long blades, coordinating a global supply chain, rising manufacturing costs, complex engineering designs, and a demand for decarbonized supply chain input and transportation associated with creating and deploying turbines. Most importantly, agentic AI introduces in wind turbine production a new way for manufacturers to build these machines that will lead the green revolution.

Agentic AI is not a standard AI. It is a system with agency—think of it as a factory manager that not only analyzes data but also makes decisions and takes actions in order to meet defined

objectives. In the context of wind turbine manufacturing, agentic AI will help with design, assembly, and construction processes in order to be a greener manufacture of wind turbines. This blog explains how agentic AI is revolutionizing wind equipment manufacturing, exploring its applications, benefits, challenges, and what lies ahead. Buckle up—we are about to see how “wind turbine production ai” and “agentic ai agency” are powering a cleaner, more efficient future.

What is agentic AI, and why is it important for wind turbines-

Picture a factory where equipment does not just follow a pre-programmed series of steps, but is able to independently adjust for any issues, such as delays, defects, or modifications to design. This is the basic idea behind agentic AI. It is a series of analytical systems working with data that will operate independently to attain a goal. Traditional AI systems may have the ability to predict a defect but will only state that there is a defect. Agentic AI would be able to not only identify the defective component, but also reroute the production line or redesign the blade in order to get the most optimized performance. This “agentic ai agency” is a true game-changer for industries such as wind turbine manufacturing, where quality and efficiency mean everything. Wind turbines are truly an engineering marvel, with blades, nacelles, and towers each requiring a careful design and production process. The manufacture of with many thousands of variables—material characteristics, aerodynamic properties, supply chain logistics, and endless coordination and deadlines to meet the global energy requirements—is incredibly complex. Agentic AI thrives in these complexities, it is capable of combining information from millions of system sensors and making split-second decisions to maintain productivity on the factory floor. The agent’s autonomy on the factory floor addressed the previous industry production pain points: cost, quality, and scalability, while demonstrating production sequencing, availability, and priority control of component assembly. For example, the ai agent may sense that the blade assembly was slightly slower than anticipated and reallocated available resources to minimize assembly bottlenecks—our agent may even disclose it using wind turbine production ai

How Agentic AI Changes the Game for Wind Turbine Manufacturing-

Agentic AI will influence every aspect of wind turbine manufacturing from concept to production. Here are five examples of how it is currently making a change.

Design Efficiency for Turbine Components

Designing a wind turbine blade, like creating a wing for a massive bird, requires an understanding of strength, weight, and wind shape. Agentic AI gives engineers the ability to test thousands of designs in a period of a few days instead of months. Take a UK-based start-up, EvoPhase, for example. They created over 2000 potential blade designs specifically for urban wind conditions using AI. Agentic AI enabled EvoPhase to do so by employing genetic algorithms and digital twins (a digital version of a physical object that creates behavioral simulations and interactions with the object’s environment). With this technology, agentic AI produced uniquely shaped blades that represent the best combination to generate the most efficient wind turbine output. This is the best illustration of wind turbine production ai.

Automation of the Manufacturing Process-

Imagine a manufacturing plant with robots on assembly lines working in concert, all under the stewardship of an artificial intelligence that acts as an experienced factory foreman. Agentic AI can observe production lines in real time, modifying workflows as required to avoid disruptions. If a machine slows down, for instance, the AI may be able to change the tasks assigned to that piece of equipment or speed up the flow of another production line, in order to keep the final product successfully completing the assembly operation of manufacturing. Moreover, production downtime can be one of the biggest (time) wasters and also has the potential to literally cost manufacturers millions dollars. When your robotic systems work collaboratively with agentic AI you get greater accuracy every time you are assembling complex mechanical components, such as nacelles, even in large quantities, while reducing the time and cost of accuracy.

Quality Control and Defect Detection

There is no room for error when manufacturing wind turbines, where even a small defect can result in a costly, catastrophic, and often preventable failure. In this regard, agentic AI is second to none when it comes to reviewing sensor feeds from the quality control and assurance systems. The AI can review timestamp events, as well as visual data to identify defects, such as cracks or inconsistencies in the materials that are used in production, with incredible accuracy. For example, Chinese manufacturers have rolled out AI vision systems that can find defects in blade assemblies with 95% accuracy, far exceeding human inspectors. If a defect has been identified, not only can the AI notify the human operators, but the AI can also modify the manufacturing parameters quickly, on the fly, to ensure that defects of the same nature do not disrupt production again. This immediate problem solving is called “agentic ai agency” and is by far the most distinguishing and significant feature our agentic AI system can provide.

Supply Chain and Resource Management

The wind turbine manufacturing industry is managed through a global supply chain that draws materials such as carbon fiber and steel from multiple continents. Agentic AI navigates through this complex puzzle by anticipating delays, finding alternate shipment sources (when needed) to ensure factories stay appropriately stocked. For example, General Electric’s tool began with AI-driven logistics that were team and overall objective-centric, with a goal of achieving 10% less costs, by predicting global savings of $2.6 billion by 2030. By forecasting demand, and reinforcing inventory control with raw materials stand by, agentic AI allows that inventory to be received “just in time” to limit excess, waste, and ultimately costs, consistent with traditional “wind turbine production AI

Sustainability Improvements

Sustainability is much more than a trendy slogan in wind energy; sustainability is a requirement. Agentic AI utilizes technology to help manufacturers, and every and any agent, be more intelligent with material utilization, and lower waste. It could for instance help predict how much resin will be needed to make a blade while reducing the excess, waste and emissions. Agentic AI is a much more direct route for production output linkage & alignment to environmentally sustainable practices. The win-win aspect provides renewable energy (solution) development, without degrading our planet. Anchoring sustainability is part of agentic ai, therefore presenting with legitimate and systematic means of addressing renewable energy challenges.

The Tangible Benefits of Agentic AI

The role of agentic AI in wind turbine manufacturing isn’t just theoretical; it is having a quantifiable impact on the industry.

First, Agentic AI improves operational efficiency. Agentic AI utilizes automated decision making to improve production times from decision-making bottlenecks flowing through a much lower rate of automated decision making. Essentially, agentic AI enables factories to produce the Wind Turbine component faster and reduce down time, enabling dealers to offer large scale Wind Farm projects on time with the limited amount of production time allowed.

Second, agentic AI saves costs. The logistics when using GE for example is only one case, costs and emissions reductions that aggregate benefits over time in the billion$. Agentic AI will also reduce throughput material waste, which leads to a cost saving in sourcing raw materials.

Third, agentic AI improves product quality. More accurate AI directed precision manufacturers allow for greater turbine durability and efficiency from an energy perspective, enabling it to produce more energy over its useful life. Fourth, agentic AI enhances sustainability. The actual use of AI in manufacturing will lead to decreased waste, energy use, and towards the goal for climate change at an international level to improve the carbon foot print. Lastly, agentic AI supports scale. Agentic AI will enable manufacturers to react to scaling over a wind project without compromising quality. The tangible agentic AI benefits can be categorized in many ways including 10% cost savings directly, 95% success rate for project planning and execution.

Meeting the Challenges of Agentic AI-

While agentic AI holds great promise, there are challenges to be addressed in the implementation stage. This, for instance, is true for implementing it in wind turbine manufacturing, considering the fact that agentic AI is not a plug-and-play solution, and different challenges will need to be overcome.

A major challenge is data integration. Factories produce a lot of data, and this is often messy, as sensors can vary in format or data can be incomplete, features are required to provide agentic AI clear data on which to act, and in turn clean data requires data pipelines to triage and relay. Another challenge is model interpretability. Engineers need to trust that the AI is making the right decisions, but if there aren’t explicable models — they often feel like black boxes.

Explainable AI (XAI) will be substantively important if we want people to know why the AI made the judgement call, in this case to tweak a production line.

Cybersecurity is another challenge.

As factories become more interconnected, IoT phenomena will always leave AI systems exposed to hacks. The only solution is strict encryption and then layering intrusion detection, etc. The second constraint relates to costs – practically all agentic AIs require much investment in hardware, software, and also training before they can be of value. Even if the long term ROI is an obvious question of if/when for small manufacturers, they may never see investment as more than an accelerator for business. The third concern is many factories operate legacy operating systems or older equipment, which they may struggle to connect AI with. It is also still true that for many factories, modernization will be an iterative integration not an installation of a whole AI system directly into the factory.

Real-World Success Stories-

Agentic AI has already shown its potential in wind turbine manufacturing. Let’s take a look at a few of the companies paving that path. General Electric (GE) Renewable Energy, has already helped streamline its supply chain with AI, achieving up to a 10% reduction in logistics costs. GE expects its extensive use of predictive analytics and digital twins to yield as much as $1.7 billion to $2.6 billion globally by 2030. This illustrated the use of “agentic ai agency” to optimize complexity in operation. Chinese manufacturers already are utilizing small AI vision systems to inspect turbine blades while the blades are being constructed and produced with 95% accuracy in crack and ice accumulation recognition so as not to stop production lines. Each example features the advanced specificity of “wind turbine production ai.” EvoPhase, a startup out of the UK, used agentic AI to generate thousands of designs for their urban wind conditions in Birmingham on the turbine blades. In less than a week, they were able to create alternative blade designs that translated to faster development and better performing turbines. In a different setting, Sandia National Laboratories used AI to optimize rotor performance by predicting data-driven wakes that will eventually yield improved efficiency in wind turbines. Together, these examples showcase why agentic AI is delivering results today, not tomorrow.

Future prospects for agentic-

in wind production are very good and positive advances in how wind turbines are designed and manufactured are bound to emerge. We are seeing the emergence of multi-agent systems whereby multiple AI agents work together to run an entire factory. We see a recognition that manufacturing, design, and logistics must be evaluated together as a single addition.

Physics-informed AI will utilize physics to include physics within the machine learning process whereby the turbine designs are assured to be data informed as well as scientifically valid.

Explainable AI will grow to a new level in that a level of confidence can now be established based in part on why an ai made a decision in regards to a process step, a new layer of assurance where an engineer or regulator can confidently expand outwards from being able to say why they accepted a machine learning decision.

Conclusion: Fueling a Cleaner Tomorrow

Agentic AI is changing the way that wind-based equipment will be manufactured, faster, cheaper, greener. From the design of high-performance blades to identifying defective equipment with uncanny precision, “agentic ai agency” represents a key component of “wind turbine production ai,” and is changing the future of turbine manufacture. The takeaways are evident: lower costs, better turbans, and a smaller environmental footprint. Will manufacturers face obstacles such as data sanitation, quality, and security? Absolutely, however they can be taken care of with a little strategic planning.

So what do manufacturers need to know-

John Kennedy on Thursday made a lively defense of the Big Beautiful Bill Act, pointing to what he said will be economic benefits and rejecting claims about the impact on Medicaid recipients.

""I'm so proud of it,"" the Louisiana Republican said at a joint event by Chambers of Commerce from St. Mary, Lafourche and Terrebonne parishes in Thibodaux. ""You will immediately see the impact. The American economy will immediately see the impact.""

Among the accomplishments in the act, passed July 4 and cited by Kennedy:

--Extension of the 2017 Trump tax cuts, an average tax savings of $2,135 for an individual taxpayer.

Failure to extend the tax cuts ""would have tanked our economy,"" Kennedy said, including $15 billion reduction in Louisiana's gross domestic product.

--Tax reductions on tips, Social Security payments and overtime.

--A deduction for auto loans for some taxpayers.

--An increase in the standard deduction on tax returns.

--Expanded school choice tax credits and college savings accounts.

--Immediate expensing of business investment rather than requiring depreciation over the course of years.

--An increase in the federal lifetime gift, estate and generation-skipping transfer tax exemptions to $15 million per person.

--An additional $150 million for payments from the Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act, which provides funds to Gulf Coast states for work such as preventing coastal erosion.

--Eliminating Biden-era green energy tax credits.

--Requiring the Department of the Interior to conduct 30 offshore energy lease sales over the next 10 years.

--Changes in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, formerly known as food stamps. The Big Beautiful Bill Act phases in an increased state share of the cost of program.

Kennedy also took aim at charges that the Medicaid changes in the legislation will eliminate 10.9 million people from the program's rolls.

He said 90 million Americans are on Medicaid, and spending on the program has risen by more than half since 2019. Meanwhile, Kennedy said, the Biden administration virtually eliminated eligibility requirements. One result: the Louisiana legislative auditor found 1,600 people enrolled in Medicaid even though their incomes are over $100,000 a year.

The new Medicaid work requirement is needed, he said. ""Everyone who loses their Medicaid under this bill was not entitled to it in the first place.""

Others in the public arena either dispute the claims made by supporters of the Big Beautiful Bill Act or point to additional challenges, and not just on the left.

Both the conservative Tax Foundation and the libertarian Cate Institute foresee growth in the nation's gross domestic product because of the tax cuts. But both also predict big increases in borrowing. Cato predicts a $4 trillion increase in the national debt over 10 years when increased interest is factored in. The Tax Foundation predicts increased debt of $3 trillion over 10 years.

Also, presenting the tax savings for individuals as one all-inclusive average tends to overstate the benefits for income groups below $100,000.

The Tax Policy Center, which describes itself as nonpartisan, calculates that the extension of the Trump Tax cuts means an average savings of $1,781 for household incomes of $66,801 to $119,200.

For households with incomes of $34,601 to $66,800, the savings amount to $750. Families with incomes at or below $34,600 will get a $150 tax cut on average.

KFF, formerly known as the health care think tank the Kaiser Family Foundation, also sounds a warning about the Medicaid work requirement, pointing to Georgia's experience with its own work requirement.

The Georgia Pathways to Coverage Program has essentially the same requirements as the new federal rules: work, school or 80 hours a month as a volunteer.

But the complexity of the verification system and the need for frequent re-verification has created red tape that ""can be costly for states to run, frustrating for enrollees to navigate, and disruptive to other public benefit systems,"" KFF's website says.

As such, governments worldwide are pushing for the rapid decarbonization of the transportation industry with the aim to eliminate fossil-fuel-powered truck sales by 2030 in much of the EU and 2035 in the UK, US, and parts of Asia.[2], [3], [4], [5] Yet, unlike the rapid deployment of new passenger electric vehicles (EVs), the commercial haulage and distribution sector has been slow to transition. This article explores the status of electrification in the commercial vehicle sector, looking at current roadblocks, potential solutions, and cutting-edge technologies, as well as considering alternative transportation modes for commercial deliveries.

Challenges for Commercial EV OEMs

Globally, passenger EV sales are rising. However, there is a big difference between this kind of success and adoption in the whole commercial vehicle industry. Goods vehicles with electric powertrains—which encompass battery, plug-in hybrid, and fuel cells—made up only 1.2 percent of worldwide truck sales in 2022.[6] Over the same period, the share of electric passenger car sales hit 14 percent.[7] Why does this disparity exist? There are several unique challenges facing commercial vehicle original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) in the EV industry.

Weight vs. Payload Considerations

Commercial vehicles, which can range from LGVs to HGVs, are designed to carry substantial loads. HGVs have a total weight of more than 3.5 tons, including the vehicle itself and its cargo. They come in various models, from articulated and flatbed trucks to tankers and emergency vehicles like fire engines. Transitioning to electric powertrains adds complexity due to the need to balance weight (including battery weight) with payload capacity. Part of this complexity includes optimizing the vehicle design to ensure sufficient range and payload capacity, especially if the cargo is refrigerated, which draws extra power.

Vehicle Cost

Commercial EVs often have higher initial costs compared to their internal combustion engine (ICE) counterparts, mainly due to the cost of the battery or hydrogen fuel cell. However, it is essential to consider the total cost of ownership (TCO), including factors such as running, maintenance costs, and government incentives. Commercial OEMs must educate fleet operators about the long-term benefits of EVs and work towards reducing upfront costs through economies of scale and technological advancements. Renault, for instance, predicts that their electric trucks will have an average energy cost per kilometer in Europe that is 40 percent lower than diesel trucks for city use.[8]

Infrastructure Constraints

Charging and hydrogen refueling infrastructure is critical for the widespread adoption of commercial EVs. Battery-electric vehicle (BEV) and plug-in hybrid electric vehicle (PHEV) trucks often have larger battery capacities but still require fast-charging capabilities to limit time off the road. Although there is massive investment in new installations, the current charging infrastructure may not be sufficient in terms of technical capabilities. According to the European Alternative Fuels Observatory (EAFO), there were over 550,000 public charging installations across Europe in 2023.[9] Even with ongoing investment, the European Automobile Manufacturers’ Association (ACEA) predicts that, by 2025, only 40,000 charging points will be suitable for medium- to heavy-duty trucks.[10] At a network scale, the availability of charging and hydrogen-refueling stations along major transportation routes is also limited. For instance, the ACEA estimates that by the 2030 electrification target, the number of charging points would have to grow to 270,000 to support the growing electric truck network.[11] Addressing these infrastructure shortcomings requires collaboration among commercial vehicle OEMs, governments, and infrastructure providers to upgrade charging stations and expand the networks.

Regulation Hurdles

Regulations play a crucial role in shaping the commercial EV market. While incentives such as subsidies and tax credits can encourage adoption, regulatory uncertainty or lack of sufficient incentives may hinder the transition to commercial EVs. Commercial OEMs need clear and consistent regulations that support EV adoption while addressing concerns such as emissions standards and vehicle safety.

Supply Chain Concerns

Transitioning to commercial EVs involves a significant overhaul of the manufacturing and servicing processes. OEMs need to secure a stable supply chain for critical components such as batteries (Figure 1), electric motors, and charging equipment. This may involve partnerships with suppliers, developing new manufacturing capabilities, and adequate training for service technicians to maintain and repair EVs. Supply chain disruptions, particularly in the context of global events or shortages of key materials, can pose additional challenges for commercial EV OEMs.

Solutions and recommendations

As the transportation industry continues to evolve, developing the “Truck of Tomorrow” is a pivotal challenge. Among the significant barriers to achieving this goal, perhaps none is more pressing than the issue of range limitation. However, through a strategic combination of technological innovation, infrastructure development, and supply chain reinforcement, the industry can effectively address this obstacle.

Technological Solutions to Extend Range

Several technological advancements can be leveraged to enhance the range of next-generation trucks. Maximizing the use of battery packs and improving the efficiency of the drivetrain can significantly optimize energy consumption, as can increasing the energy density of battery packs through the adoption of solid-state batteries. By building on the technological innovations gained from small-scale batteries, a meaningful larger-scale version will be possible.

Additionally, higher-voltage battery architectures like 800V systems will enable faster charging capabilities. At these higher voltages, advanced silicon carbide (SiC) devices are needed to replace conventional silicon devices, reducing switching losses while accommodating the higher breakdown voltages. Hydrogen fuel cells also offer a promising avenue for extending range. Furthermore, implementing battery-swapping technology can provide a swift and convenient alternative to traditional charging, minimizing interruptions and optimizing operational efficiency.

Infrastructure Development Strategies

Robust infrastructure development is essential for supporting the widespread adoption of next-generation trucks. This includes the establishment of faster charging stations along major trucking routes and the integration of stations that support battery swapping. Moreover, the deployment of hydrogen- and renewable-powered truck stops equipped with localized power generation capabilities is crucial for enabling charging in remote areas and off-grid locations. By investing in these infrastructure initiatives, stakeholders can effectively address range limitations and facilitate the seamless operation of commercial EVs.

Reinforcing the Supply Chain

A resilient supply chain is fundamental to the successful development and deployment of the next-generation trucks. This entails adapting supply chains to accommodate the procurement and distribution of advanced trucking technologies, such as advanced battery systems and hydrogen fuel cells. Additionally, fostering industry collaboration and partnerships can mitigate challenges within the supply and service sector, ultimately supporting the widespread adoption of innovative trucking technologies.

Further Evolution

The focus on electrifying commercial vehicles mirrors that of the passenger vehicle sector. However, advancements in intelligent automotive sensing and control systems open broader possibilities for revolutionizing global haulage and distribution.

Autonomous Trucks

Swedish company Einride specializes in electric-powered autonomous trucks (Figure 2). These trucks can be controlled completely autonomously over long distances. However, when the vehicle enters a more complicated area, such as a loading bay or busy urban environment, drivers can take control of the vehicle remotely.

Figure 2: Einride’s Gen 2 autonomous truck. (Source: Einride [einride.tech/press])

This autonomous but human-supervised technology lowers TCO, making up for the EV truck’s higher initial cost. When compared to a freight operation that relies on diesel, Einride’s technology, which has been in use since 2019, provides for an average reduction of 95 percent in GHG emissions.[12]

Last-Mile Deliveries

For people fortunate enough to work from home, rarely a day goes by that they don’t see or hear a van or LGV pass by the front door to deliver online purchases. With this shift in routine home and business deliveries, there are new alternative forms of transportation that can revolutionize these last-mile deliveries, especially in dense, urban environments.

Autonomous Delivery Robots

One alternative is the autonomous delivery robot (Figure 3), such as Starship’s platform,[13] which has now accomplished over five million deliveries. These compact robots use twelve onboard camera modules and GNSS tracking to move through urban surroundings at a pace of 6.5km/h.

Figure 3: Autonomous delivery robots operating on a public footpath. (Source: Julia/stock.adobe.com)

Unlike other delivery options, these types of autonomous delivery robots can travel along footpaths because of their low-speed electric drivetrain. This makes it possible for them to travel more straight lines, making up for their slower speed.

Drone Deliveries

In the US, Walmart uses delivery drones in a bid to increase efficiency, reduce costs, and cut emissions.[14] Using drones from on-demand delivery providers Wing and Zipline, Walmart gives customers a rapid delivery alternative. Because they operate in the air, these drones can take faster, more direct routes than conventional delivery vans can, and they do not get stuck in traffic jams.

Conclusion

The transition to electric haulage and delivery vehicles marks a turning point in sustainability and innovation in the ever-changing global commercial transportation scene. While the lessons learned from the development and deployment of passenger EVs can provide valuable insights, the unique features of commercial trucks frequently necessitate a new viewpoint in addition to the most recent advancements, supported by industry-wide collaboration, to ensure success.",https://www.manmonthly.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Adobe-Stock-347702104-jpg.jpg,N,,2025-08-10 23:00:21.400524

In just the past few weeks, the Trump administration instituted permitting reviews that threaten US wind and solar developments. It imposed standards that would essentially prevent new developments on federal land. It rescinded Biden-era decisions earmarking coastal waters for future wind turbines. And on Wednesday it yanked approval for a massive planned wind farm in Idaho.

The pace and range of strikes against renewables — alongside several other actions that serve to prop up fossil fuels and nuclear power — have whipsawed wind and solar developers that had grown accustomed to federal support. The policies have already helped contribute to the cancellation or delay of more than $22 billion worth of clean energy projects since January and the loss of thousands of jobs, a majority in Republican states, according to an analysis from the E2 advocacy group.

The actions have struck deeper than even some hardened industry players and observers anticipated — mirroring Trump’s more aggressive approach on an array of fronts during his second term. Timothy Fox, managing director of ClearView Energy Partners, once believed the incoming administration might merely refocus government efforts to prioritize power from coal and gas instead of taking aim at renewables.

But that “refocus” path is now in the rearview. Instead, Fox said, “we’re in the retaliate scenario.”

Trump has repeatedly called green energy a “scam” while also touting his focus on “energy dominance” by relying on domestic sources of oil, natural gas and coal. Beyond the words, the actual crackdown on wind and solar comes at a precarious time in the US. Electricity demand is rising quickly because of data centers and climbing use of artificial intelligence, contributing to bigger bills for Americans still stung by broader inflation. Meantime, there’s a backlog in natural-gas turbines and new nuclear power is many years away. Some studies predict the attacks on renewables will shrink potential power generation and lead to higher energy costs.

Trump administration officials say the moves are justified to ensure the US has an abundance of always-on power sources. Previous presidents gave too much preferential treatment to wind and solar ventures, Interior Secretary Doug Burgum said in announcing one policy shift. “Leveling the playing field in permitting supports energy development that’s reliable, affordable and built to last,” Burgum said.

The broadside against renewables began on Trump’s first day in office, when he froze offshore wind permitting. He’s moved to quickly reverse former President Joe Biden’s climate agenda and the Republican-majority Congress surprised even some GOP onlookers when it phased out tax incentives for wind and solar projects.

The White House did not respond to a request for comment.

The Transportation Department in July recommended a minimum set-back requirement for wind turbines that would require them to be, at a minimum, 1.2 miles (1.93 km) away from highways and railroads. The agency also said the Federal Aviation Administration would “thoroughly evaluate” proposed turbines to ensure they do not pose a danger to aviation. Concerns about turbines interfering with military flights have cropped up in previous administrations’ evaluations of offshore wind leasing.

The Environmental Protection Agency, meanwhile, has proposed rescinding the endangerment finding, a determination that greenhouse gases harm public health and welfare, indicating the lengths it will go to in order to prop up fossil fuels at the expense of solar and wind.

Billions of dollars’ worth of new factories and clean energy projects have been canceled, delayed or scaled back since the start of the year, with $11.7 billion of investments located in GOP districts as of June, according to E2. More than 16,500 jobs have been lost, with nearly 12,000 of them in Republican districts, the analysis finds.

The French energy company Engie says it’s on track to invest less than half its usual $2 billion to $3 billion in the US this year.

The industry had expected a slowdown, including a leasing pause on federal land and that newly proposed projects wouldn’t proceed, an energy company executive told Bloomberg earlier this year. But the scale of disruption, especially moves against fully permitted wind projects, took developers aback, said the executive who asked not to be named in order to speak more candidly.

For some businesses, the best strategy is to keep your head down and hope projects can wait out the next three and a half years, another energy industry executive told Bloomberg. Even so, the executive added, that keeps capital locked up and forfeits opportunities for other investment in the meantime.

“The proposed federal interference with private economic activity is unprecedented,” said the American Clean Power Association, a trade group for utility-scale wind and solar developers. The policies have created “a troubling challenge for critical infrastructure investment of any kind.”

Mired in Red Tape

Much of the administration’s assault on wind and solar power has run through the Interior Department, which has authority over hundreds of millions of acres of federal land and water, and is currently home to 4% of US renewable energy generation. That figure was projected to increase to as much as 12.5% by 2035, according to a January Energy Department report.

The Interior Department announced Thursday it was launching a full review of offshore wind energy regulations, including a rule finalized by the Biden administration that created a renewable energy leasing schedule and reduced restrictions on developers.

Burgum issued a directive that requires him to personally sign off on 69 separate approvals for wind and solar projects on federal land. The move effectively serves to mire projects in red tape, requiring his review of thousands of documents, according to the American Clean Power Association.

However, industry experts say the new federal policy is also likely to block projects built on private land too because often there is a nexus between those projects and the agency, especially in the West where the federal government owns nearly half the land.

“It will have a far reach,” said Eric B. Beightel, who formerly served as executive director of the Federal Permitting Council during the Biden administration. “I do think the impacts will stretch beyond just the federal land.”

The Interior Department now considers energy capacity density as a key factor in evaluating energy proposals on public lands and waters, the agency told Bloomberg. Each project is reviewed on a case-by-case basis it said.

“Just because some want to frame this as playing politics doesn’t make it true. Evaluating land use efficiency and environmental impact isn’t partisan, it’s responsible governance,” an Interior spokesperson said.

Despite all the new hurdles, big clean energy developers are trying to show investors they can survive the tumult. NextEra Energy Inc. and AES Corp. both said during recent earnings calls that they believe most of their projects have locked in tax incentives.

“I think it will be more difficult for the smaller, less capitalized developers in this environment,” AES Chief Executive Officer Andres Gluski said on an investor call.",https://energynow.com/wp-content/uploads/Trump-Solar-Wind-1200x810-August-9-2025.jpg,N,,2025-08-10 23:00:30.760970

The airport has issued a request for proposals (RFP) to study the feasibility of building a small modular reactor (SMR) on its campus. This initiative is part of DEN’s broader strategy to meet its future clean energy demands. With the aviation sector already considering hydrogen-fueled aircraft and electric drones, Denver Airport aims to set a precedent by integrating nuclear power into its operations, marking a significant step in sustainable airport management.

Denver International Airport’s Push for Nuclear Energy

Denver International Airport is preparing for a future where it expects to accommodate over 120 million passengers annually by 2045. In anticipation of this growth, the airport is turning to nuclear energy as a potential source for clean and efficient operations. Small modular reactors offer a safer, scalable, and potentially cost-effective method of generating nuclear power. Unlike solar and wind power, which depend on climatic conditions, nuclear reactors can provide a consistent energy supply, operating around the clock.

The RFP issued by the airport is aimed at assessing the feasibility of constructing an SMR on its premises. This move underscores DEN’s commitment to sustainable energy solutions, positioning it as a leader in green airport initiatives. The consideration of nuclear energy, particularly SMRs, highlights the airport’s proactive approach to addressing the energy demands of a rapidly growing city and a changing climate.

Feasibility Study for the SMR

In announcing the RFP, Denver Mayor Mike Johnston emphasized the importance of exploring innovative solutions to meet the airport’s future energy needs. He stated, “Studying the potential of small modular nuclear reactors is a forward-looking step in understanding how we can deliver reliable, clean energy at scale.” The study aims to address critical questions about the viability of SMRs for DEN, including cost estimates, funding options, and regulatory requirements.

DEN CEO Phil Washington acknowledged that while SMR technology is relatively new, it represents a significant opportunity to responsibly plan for the airport’s future. The study, which will cost up to $1.25 million and take between 6-12 months to complete, will provide insights into whether an SMR solution can meet the airport’s long-term electrical and energy needs. If successful, DEN could become the first airport in history to host an SMR, setting a benchmark for others to follow.

Understanding Small Modular Reactors

Small modular reactors (SMRs) are a type of nuclear reactor designed to generate electricity in the range of 20 to 300 megawatts. Their compact design makes them easier to install compared to traditional nuclear reactors, as they require less space. One of the key advantages of SMRs is their lower installation cost, which makes them an attractive option for entities looking to transition to clean energy resources.

SMRs also incorporate advanced technology that significantly reduces the risks associated with operating a nuclear power plant. This has led to growing interest in SMR technology worldwide, with several countries exploring its potential to support their clean energy transitions. For DEN, the pursuit of SMR technology represents an opportunity to lead the charge in sustainable airport operations.

Which brings us to Labor’s revamped ‘Safeguard Mechanism’.

First, let’s set one thing straight. This is basically all about the coal and gas industries. More than 54% of emissions covered by the Safeguard Mechanism come from gas or coal:

This chart shows how big the emissions from the gas and coal industries are compared to other industries covered by the Safeguard Mechanism. Often industries like cement production, agriculture or manufacturing are presented as being a big part of Australia’s climate debate. This chart shows that they’re not, at least in terms of the Safeguard Mechanism.

So, here’s how the Safeguard Mechanism manages to look effective while actually facilitating gas and coal projects.

Each mine or other Safeguard facility is issued a target level of emissions which collectively ratchets downwards over time, by almost 5% per year.

But each facility has a bevy of ways to secure a weak target, and even then, the polluter can meet this target by:

(a) purchasing carbon offsets,

(b) purchasing ‘overperformance’ from other emitters, or by

(c) actually reducing their emissions.

The logic behind this scheme is that the burden of options (a) and (b) becomes so great that companies eventually simply choose option (c) (such as choosing to electrify processes that run on fossil fuels).

Data covering the first year of operation of the Safeguard Mechanism was released a few months ago, and it shows something very important: the unlimited availability of carbon offsets.

For each of the mines and other facilities covered by the Safeguard Mechanism, they disclose the number of offsets they used to “meet” their designated target without actually reducing their emissions.

The largest users of offsets, by a pretty decent margin, are the coal and gas industries, with the coal mining industry being the most reliant on offsets to adjust its “net” emissions:

The ‘net’ emissions number (that is, including carbon offsets) is then used by the Clean Energy Regulator to present a graphic that implies the facilities are on track to achieving the overall goals of the scheme:

Perhaps the most worrying revelation in the data is how many fossil fuel extraction facilities were below their target – meaning they were given offsets to sell to others, rather than being forced to buy them to comply.

Here’s an eye-opening example. Chevron’s Gorgon facility, one of the highest emitting facilities in the scheme, ended up with an emissions limit (“baseline”) far, far higher than emissions in 2023-24 (the weakest target the project has ever received):

Because Gorgon was under its baseline, it was issued 388,803 ‘safeguard mechanism credits’, which another polluter can buy from Chevron to meet its emissions. This is despite Gorgon’s emissions being the highest they’ve been since FY19.

Not only are high-emitting facilities being issued credits (that they can sell) for being under their baselines, fossil fuel companies in the dataset seemed to be issued a disproportionate amount: those companies are 54% of total emissions, but they earned 74% of all credits issued in FY24. In total, facilities in the fossil fuel extraction sectors earned 6.1 million safeguard mechanism credits.

There is a lot of data to dig into here. But what is extremely clear already is that Australia’s big coal and gas companies are happily already exploiting many of the loopholes in Safeguard – not just to “meet” their targets, but to even actively earn money from the scheme while emissions are going up.",https://australiainstitute.org.au/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/20160411001247040791-original.jpg,N,,2025-08-11 00:59:05.636590

This shift allows local opposition to flourish, particularly to wind energy, driven by misinformation from fossil fuel interests,"" she added.","Amid the swirl of intensifying climate disasters, surging renewable potential and the mounting economic risks of inaction, a question looms: will Mark Carney’s legacy be that of a clean energy champion, or the leader who missed our last best chance?

Our shared home, Earth, has entered a new era: the Anthropocene, shaped not by natural forces, but by human influence on the atmosphere, the oceans, the land and the climate.

Since the Industrial Revolution, human activity has steadily warmed the planet. Each of the last four decades has been hotter than the one before it, leading us to 2024: the hottest year ever recorded, and an immediate reminder of the life-altering path we’re on.

In 2024, global temperatures reached about 1.52 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, with human activity responsible for 1.36 degrees of this dramatic increase, driven largely by greenhouse gas emissions, the latest Indicators of Global Climate Change (IGCC) report ominously underscores.

Take up of alternative energy around the world, at the current rate, could easily replace carbon-based sources within the next few decades.

(Clean Energy Canada)

The rest was due to natural factors like El Niño and unusually warm Atlantic waters.

Scientists warn that, given current emission trends, temperatures exceeding 1.5 degrees Celsius may now occur every second year.

From here on, years like 2024 are not anomalies. They are the new normal.

“Efforts to address climate change have been a struggle between urgency and complacency,” prime minister Mark Carney wrote in his book Value(s): Building a Better World for All.

(McClelland & Stewart)

“Achieving net zero will require moving away from fossil fuels to renewables…the first priority to build a zero-carbon economy is to green the generation of electricity.”

Mark Carney has long championed environmental sustainability, recognizing it as not just an ethical imperative but an economic opportunity. In 2020, he called the green transition ""the greatest commercial opportunity of our time”. By March 2021, he was emphasizing that Canada stood on the cusp of a ""huge economic opportunity"" as it transitioned to a sustainable economy with drastically reduced carbon emissions.

(Anushka Yadav/The Pointer)

Since the release of his book in 2021, Carney has moved into the centre of the political spotlight, and Canadians from coast to coast have clamoured for a renewed environmental legacy.

In a January 2025 interview with Jon Stewart, ahead of the federal election, he placed responsibility for reducing Canada’s emissions squarely on the oil industry’s shoulders, arguing the path to climate progress lies in cleaning up fossil fuels, not asking Canadians to change their everyday lives.

The oil and gas sector remains Canada’s largest source of climate-warming carbon pollution, according to the federal government. Between 2005 and 2023, emissions from the industry rose by 7 percent, even as most other sectors began reducing their climate impact.

The latest federal emissions inventory, released in March, shows an even steeper rise in oil sands emissions, up more than 140 percent over the same period.

At the final Liberal leadership campaign event in downtown Montreal ahead of the spring election, Carney pledged to champion sustainable growth and position Canada as a global “clean energy superpower in nuclear, hydro power, wind, hydrogen, battery storage and carbon capture.”

On March 9, he won the Liberal leadership election with 85.9 percent of the vote, becoming Canada’s 24th Prime Minister and succeeding Justin Trudeau, who left a mixed climate legacy, marked by controversial pipeline approvals.

In his first weeks in office, ahead of the election, Carney offered only broad statements about environmental policy, avoiding detailed plans.

Shortly after being sworn in on March 14, and facing restless voters ground down by years of hyper-inflation, one of his first directives was to eliminate the federal consumer carbon tax effective April 1, with April's carbon rebates going ahead as planned.

""This will make a difference to hard-pressed Canadians, but it is part of a much bigger set of measures that this government is taking to ensure that we fight against climate change, that our companies are competitive and the country moves forward,"" Carney said.

The consumer carbon price was responsible for reducing annual greenhouse gas emissions by 8 to 14 megatonnes, according to a Canadian Climate Institute report. Scrapping it means forfeiting one of the most simple tools to reduce the carbon footprint of Canadians.

Many reluctantly welcomed the news, considering the relatively small impact compared to the consequences of a Conservative move to scrap the carbon price entirely, including the industrial tax which is responsible for the vast majority of emissions reductions, which Carbon Brief analysis shows would result in nearly 800 million additional tonnes of emissions over the next decade.

This extra pollution could cause approximately $233 billion in global climate damages based on estimates by the federal government.

The Canadian Climate Institute’s Climate Costs Tracker reveals the staggering financial toll of climate-fueled disasters across Canada, illustrating how wildfires, floods, droughts, and storms are becoming both more frequent and more expensive. In the past 12 months alone, damages in some provinces have reached into the billions with Alberta reporting over $4 billion, and other regions like Manitoba and Ontario (over $3 million Mississauga and $1 billion in Toronto alone due to floods) seeing hundreds of millions in losses. Clusters of high-cost events are evident in Western Canada, particularly around British Columbia and Alberta, reflecting the intense fire activity and extreme weather that have plagued these provinces.

(Canadian Climate Institute)

This is not an inevitable trajectory. A Canadian Climate Institute report shows every dollar invested in climate adaptation yields $13–$15 in benefits.

By pairing proactive resilience planning with robust emission reduction policies aligned with global targets, Canada can slash future disaster costs by up to 75 percent, steering the country toward a more secure and affordable future.

Instead, by late March, Carney floated the idea of stepping back from hard emissions caps on the oil and gas sector, which were already filled with loopholes, opting instead for collaboration with provinces and industry on “specific ways to get those reductions,” rather than imposing “preset caps or preset restrictions on preset timelines.”

He also emphasized boosting energy sector competitiveness, stating, “It’s about getting, yes, pipelines built across this country so that we can displace imports of foreign oil.”

In June, after a meeting with premiers in Saskatoon, including Ontario Premier Doug Ford, Carney publicly referenced “decarbonized oil” in the context of new bitumen pipelines, suggesting that lower-emissions oil could still have a place in Canada’s future energy mix.

Such notions are controversial, pushed by an industry that spends millions on public relations to spin the idea of “cleaner” oil; Alberta’s tar sands production remains among the dirtiest, most polluting in the world, despite attempts to rationalize the consequences.

At the closing news conference, Carney listed “national interest” projects likely to be prioritized by first ministers, including the troubled Pathways Alliance carbon capture and storage hub and a proposed oil pipeline to Canada’s northwest coast.

“Carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) is a small part of decarbonization, but building more fossil fuel infrastructure expecting CCS to offset emissions is a fairy tale,” Citizens' Climate Lobby Canada director Cathy Orlando told The Pointer.

As of 2023, Canada operated seven CCS projects primarily in the oil and gas sector, capturing only 0.5 percent of the country’s total emissions, mostly used for enhanced oil recovery, and this excludes Scope 3 emissions, which are indirect greenhouse gas emissions generated throughout a company’s value chain, from fossil fuel combustion, which CCS cannot mitigate.

A 2023 report by the International Institute for Sustainable Development (IISD) argues CCS is not a viable solution for achieving net-zero emissions in Canada’s oil and gas sector since it is “expensive, energy intensive, unproven at scale, and has no impact on the 80 percent of oil and gas emissions that result from downstream use.”

CCS doesn't align with the urgency or scale needed to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius, and often ends up supporting additional oil and gas production rather than curbing it.

Indigenous Clean Energy’s executive director, James Jenkins, told The Pointer he can’t speak directly to Carney’s intentions but believes the prime minister is “trying to balance many political voices across the country.”

Adam Scott, the executive director of Shift, a Toronto-based group that monitors pensions for climate risk, criticized Mark Carney's support for ""decarbonized oil"", arguing it's scientifically flawed. Oil is inherently carbon-intensive, and technologies like Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) can capture some emissions, they don't address the majority of oil’s carbon footprint, which comes from its end use as fuel. CCS is still nascent and energy-intensive, making it insufficient to curb oil's climate impact.

He cautions against overemphasizing fossil-based solutions at the expense of the clean energy transition.

“The concern is when petrocarbon efforts are highlighted and the programs that have put us on the right path begin to be rolled back. Clean technologies still need planning, infrastructure, and community capacity to succeed. If the focus shifts too far toward fossil-based mega-projects, it can really undermine progress,” he explained.

“It’s important to keep clean energy at the centre of the conversation and recognize the success of federal funds over the past decade, and how to expand that momentum.”

By his fifth month in office, Carney had held meetings with 25 oil and gas lobbyists, according to data tracked by Environmental Defence.

On July 11, the federal government announced a $16 million investment in energy projects across the Maritime provinces, promising affordable and reliable clean energy for Prince Edward Island, Nova Scotia, and New Brunswick.

Tucked in the details was more funding for carbon capture, a move critics say props up the oil and gas industry under the guise of climate action. They argue that carbon capture and storage (CCS) is an expensive, unreliable solution with a poor track record, and that funds would be better spent on proven, cost-effective alternatives like wind, solar, and hydro, especially when paired with battery storage.

Carney seemed to agree back in 2021, when, serving as the UN Special Envoy on Climate Action and Finance since 2019, he wrote in Value(s) that “greening energy sources is within reach,” with technologies like solar, wind, and hydro becoming “increasingly cost-effective.”

That’s even more true today.

Two recent UN reports, drawing on data from the International Renewable Energy Agency, confirm that the global shift to renewables has passed a “positive tipping point” with $2 trillion invested in clean energy last year, $800 billion more than in fossil fuels.

The world’s three most affordable sources of electricity in the past year were onshore wind, solar panels, and new hydropower.

Solar is now 41 percent cheaper and wind 53 percent cheaper than the lowest-cost fossil fuel.

UN Secretary-General António Guterres declared that the world has “passed the point of no return” in the shift to renewable energy, urging governments to submit bold new climate plans ahead of November’s COP30 summit in Brazil.

Between 2023 and 2024, global energy demand grew by 11.9 exajoules, with renewables supplying just 23 percent of that increase while fossil fuels led the rest, causing carbon emissions to rise by one percent to a record 40.8 gigatonnes of carbon dioxide. Despite falling clean-tech costs and rapid innovation offering hope, renewables are still struggling to keep pace with growing energy demand.

(Statistical review of world energy/Energy Institute)

Guterres stressed that a clean energy future “is no longer a promise, it is a fact,” adding that no government, industry, or special interest can halt its progress.

“Of course, the fossil fuel lobby will try, and we know the lengths to which they will go. But, I have never been more confident that they will fail because we have passed the point of no return,” he said.

In 2023, global energy consumption reached 580 exajoules (EJ), of which 29.97 EJ or 5.2 percent came from renewable sources. By 2024, clean energy gained a little more ground, climbing to 32.74 EJ or 5.5 percent, data from the Statistical Review of World Energy shows.

Hydropower remains the largest source of renewable electricity globally, delivering about 16 EJ in 2024, even though there are concerns that hydropower plants and their associated reservoirs can negatively impact river ecosystems, affecting fish migration, water quality, and sediment flow.

Hydropower works by using flowing or falling water to spin turbines connected to generators, converting the water’s kinetic energy into electricity.

In Canada, hydroelectricity continues to meet more than ten percent of overall energy demand, producing 343.2 terawatt hours (TWh) in 2024.

But fossil fuels continue to dominate the energy mix, accounting for the majority, with oil at thirty-six percent, natural gas at thirty-two percent, and coal contributing less than five percent.

In 2024, Canada generated 343.2 terawatt hours (TWh) of hydroelectricity. This marked a 5.1 percent drop from 2023’s output of 360.7 TWh and continued a gradual long-term decline, averaging -1.1 percent per year over the past decade (2014–2024). Despite this recent dip, Canada remains the largest producer of hydroelectricity in North America by a wide margin, contributing more than half of the continent’s total hydro output in 2024.

Canada’s wind, solar and energy-storage sectors have also grown by 46 percent in the last five years, with a new installed capacity of more than 24 gigawatt (GW) at the end of 2024, a recent report by Canadian Renewable Energy Association (CanREA) highlights.

Between 2019 and 2024, Canada’s total installed capacity for wind, solar, and energy storage grew tremendously, and includes nearly 5 gigawatt (GW) of new wind capacity, now totaling more than 18 GW, 2 GW of new utility-scale solar and 600 MW of new on-site solar, bringing total solar capacity to over 5 GW, and 200 MW of new energy storage, increasing storage capacity by 192 percent to 330 MW. Over the same period, solar energy capacity (both utility-scale and on-site) nearly doubled, growing by 92 percent, and wind capacity increased by 35 percent.

(CanREA)

“Canada’s wind, solar and energy storage industry grew impressively over the past five years—and we expect to see significantly more growth in the next five years,” CanREA’s President and CEO Vittoria Bellissimo said in a statement.

“But this is not nearly enough. Canada has massive, untapped wind and solar resources that can and should be harnessed to provide the affordable, clean, scalable electricity needed in all jurisdictions.”

Over the past decade, Indigenous communities have led or co-led more than 600 energy projects, now accounting for approximately 20 percent of Canada’s electricity generation infrastructure.

Jenkins, who is from Walpole Island First Nation in southwestern Ontario, played a key role in developing community-led wind projects while working in band administration from 2013 to 2016. During that time, Walpole Island partnered with Samsung and Pattern Energy on wind farms through Ontario’s renewable procurement program, which included incentives for Indigenous equity participation.

“We formed partnerships on two major wind farms; North Kent Wind in Chatham-Kent and Borer’s River Wind in Lakeshore. We also partnered on Grand Bend Wind with Northland Power, where Walpole Island and Aamjiwnaang First Nation each own 25 percent,” he recalled.

Completed in 2018, the 100 MW North Kent Wind facility in Chatham-Kent features 34 Siemens Gamesa turbines and generates enough clean energy to power about 35,000 Ontario homes annually. The project faced criticism from nearby well water users, who claim turbine vibrations disturbed black shale, affecting water quality, a claim the developers dispute. Despite the concerns, the wind farm brought economic benefits, including 175 local construction jobs, 10 permanent positions, and over $40 million in projected local economic impact over 20 years. Both Chatham-Kent and the Bkejwanong (Walpole Island) First Nation each hold a 15 percent equity stake in the project.

(Pattern Energy)

These large-scale projects required extensive engagement but now generate annual dividends for the community that support health, economic development, and social programs.

“It really opened up opportunities for the community to make economic decisions on its own terms. A big success, in my view,” Jenkins said.

He believes Canada is well-positioned geographically with strong wind energy in the Great Lakes and the Rocky Mountain front range, steady wind in the Maritimes, and solar power that's competitive across the country. Battery storage is improving quickly, with both lithium and flow battery technology becoming more accessible.

Canadian solar power generation in 2016 was nearly 30 times higher than in 2010. It’s expected to nearly triple again by 2040.

Cities in Saskatchewan have the highest solar photovoltaic (PV) potential in Canada, followed by Manitoba, Alberta, Ontario, and Quebec, according to Canada energy regulator. Over 98 percent of Canada’s solar power generation capacity is currently located in Ontario.

What makes Canada well-suited for wind and solar energy development? Its vast landmass, diverse climates, and high-quality renewable resources across multiple regions. Southern Alberta and Saskatchewan rank among the sunniest places in the country, with cities like Regina and Edmonton receiving more sunlight annually than global solar leaders such as Sydney and Rio de Janeiro. Even in areas with lower solar irradiance, high electricity prices, such as in the Northwest Territories, make solar a financially viable option. Cold weather, often seen as a barrier, actually improves solar panel efficiency by reducing electrical resistance.

“In the North, it’s more challenging but there are success stories,” Jenkins said. One example is the Kwanlin Dün First Nation, which now supplies wind energy to Whitehorse. Closer to home, the Six Nations of the Grand River are leading the Oneida Energy Storage project, a 1,000 megawatt battery facility designed to help stabilize Ontario’s power grid.

He explained that the federal government has played a key role in supporting Indigenous clean energy projects, particularly in their early, high-risk stages. Grant programs from NRCan, Indigenous Services Canada, Environment and Climate Change Canada, and others have been essential.

“Because energy is a provincial jurisdiction, the federal role often comes through these types of funding. It’s important they maintain and expand these programs,” he noted.

Renewable energy also makes strong economic sense, particularly in light of recent trade tensions, including U.S. President Donald Trump imposing 35 percent trade tariffs on Canada.

The UN reports highlight how continued reliance on fossil fuels contributes to rising living costs through volatile prices, inflationary pressure on commodities, costly subsidies, and the increasing financial burden of climate-related disasters.

UN Secretaryâ€‘General António Guterres warned of the geopolitical dangers tied to fossil fuel dependence, calling it “the greatest threat to energy security today” and pointing to the price shocks that followed Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.

“There are no price spikes for sunlight, no embargoes on wind. Renewables mean real energy security, real energy sovereignty and real freedom from fossil-fuel volatility,” Guterres said.

Even without considering today’s unusually high oil and gas prices, renewables offer significant cost savings in both the short and long term, for governments and consumers alike.

According to the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA), the global deployment of renewable energy since 2000 has saved approximately USD 409 billion in fossil fuel costs for the electricity sector by 2023, with the greatest savings seen in Asia, followed by Europe and South America. Unlike fossil fuel imports, which involve ongoing costs, importing renewable technologies is typically a one-time investment. At 2024 prices, importing 1 GW of solar panels can yield savings equal to 30 years of gas import costs over the panels’ average 30-year lifespan.

(UN/Energy transition report)

Asia and Europe, which have seen the greatest fossil fuel cost savings globally from renewables, have emerged as global leaders in clean energy deployment thanks to targeted policies, investment incentives, and strong climate commitments.

China and India, in particular, have rapidly scaled up solar and wind capacity. China’s manufacturing dominance has also helped lower the global cost of solar panels.

“China is paradoxical. No country on the planet has the scale of manufacturing like China, for wind turbines, solar panels, you name it. They produce at scale. A lot of it used to be exported, but now the focus is on reducing and capping emissions aggressively,” Lorne Cousins, program director of the China Sustainability Leaders Council at The Conference Board and a Canadian who has lived in China for over 25 years, told The Pointer.

In 2024, China broke its own renewable energy records, installing 80 GW of wind capacity and 277 GW of solar, according to China’s National Energy Administration. That’s an 18 percent increase in wind (totalling 520 GW) and a 45 percent jump in solar (now 890 GW). Combined, China has already met President Xi Jinping’s 2030 target of 1.2 terawatts (TW) of renewable energy, six years early.

One of the world’s largest solar installations, the 4 gigawatt (GW) Ruoqiang photovoltaic project in China’s Taklamakan Desert, was connected to the grid in late 2024. Operated by China Green Electricity Investment, the project supports China’s national strategy to peak carbon emissions by the end of the decade.

(chinadaily.com.cn)

The International Energy Agency (IEA) points to China’s pace as a key reason why the global goal of tripling renewable capacity by 2030 remains feasible. Despite building new coal plants, China's overall power generation rose by nearly 15 percent in 2024, reaching 3.35 terawatt-hour (TWh).

But Cousins warns: “The grid is a major challenge. It’s outdated and fragmented. Provinces don’t collaborate well. It’s not a monolith. There’s territoriality and competition, so the grid struggles to handle the load from renewables.”

“Some of the original wind and solar sites allocated 15–20 years ago aren’t optimal anymore. Climate and weather patterns have shifted. So, China is now building coal plants next to those renewable plants to support the load…but they’ve also introduced policies under the umbrella of eco-civilization and beautiful China. It’s not just about energy; it’s reforestation, water conservation, restoration. It’s very ambitious.”

Modernizing the grid has now become a strategic priority, and he believes China will get it done.

Jenkins noted that Canada faces similar structural issues.

“Most (grids) were designed for centralized fossil fuel generation. Renewables, especially solar and wind, are intermittent, so battery storage is key. But these grids were built decades ago and need rethinking,” he said.

In 2023, Alberta paused new renewable energy approvals due to concerns about grid reliability. The sudden decision, announced in the summer, had an immediate impact; 53 projects, potentially worth billions of dollars, were withdrawn almost overnight.

Clean Air Partnership executive director Gabriella Kalapos, this is partly because the need for storage undermines the business case for renewables. She likened it to the simplicity of fossil fuel systems, where energy can be ramped up or down as needed.

“There is a strong preference in the provincial government, at least in Ontario, for this simpler approach, ramping up fossil fuels when needed, and not using them when not. The hard work of planning an electricity system reliant on renewables and managing them across provinces, along with factoring in storage, is avoided,” Kalapos told The Pointer.

In Germany, the interconnected grid ensures that when wind or sun is unavailable in one region, other parts of the country can compensate. Kalapos acknowledges that storage is only one challenge.

Europe is making impressive strides in renewable energy, with Germany standing out as a prime example of success. In 2023, the country reached a historic milestone, with over 50 percent of its electricity generated from renewable sources, a Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy Systems ISE report notes. Particularly notable was the near 60 percent share of renewables in Germany's electricity generation, with wind power contributing 32 percent and solar installations continuing to expand rapidly. The country added 17 GW of renewable capacity in 2023, bringing its total to nearly 170 GW, largely driven by a surge in solar and wind energy, German Federal Network Agency, Bundesnetzagentur, notes. Solar energy saw substantial growth, with over 1 million new installations, and the country is on track to meet its 2030 target of 215 GW. As a continent, Europe is on track to reduce emissions by 54 percent by 2030 and 90 percent by 2040.

But the storage challenge is just one piece of the puzzle; Ontario's approach to renewable energy costs faces a key flaw.

On August 28, 2024, the Independent Electricity System Operator (IESO) launched its largest-ever competitive energy procurement to expand renewable capacity.

Kalapos points out a significant issue with IESO's cost calculations: by including storage costs in the analysis, they inflate the price of wind and solar power. She argues yes, these renewables are intermittent, but the need for backup power shouldn't be used to drive up their costs. Wind and solar remain far more cost-effective than fossil fuels, but the added complexity of storage distorts their true affordability, undermining their potential as cheaper energy sources.

Another major hurdle, despite wind’s cost-effectiveness and falling solar prices, fossil fuel industry lobbying continues to hinder progress.

""The provincial government has taken away land use and growth management decisions from municipalities and given them energy planning authority instead. This shift allows local opposition to flourish, particularly to wind energy, driven by misinformation from fossil fuel interests,"" she added.

“If we invested in our electricity system instead of continuing to subsidize the fossil fuel industry, we’d meet our climate targets without any problem. Yet, we’re still putting money into fossil fuel subsidies that we’ve said for years we’d phase out.”

Jenkins agrees, adding that without federal leadership in redesigning grids and promoting smart grid technology, utilities may keep opting for fossil-based solutions.

“Without leadership from the federal government on redesigning grids or encouraging smart grid tech, utilities may continue choosing fossil-based options simply because the system isn’t built to support clean tech,” he said.

“Renewables already make economic sense, but scaling them up means solving these structural issues.”

In July, over 100 groups, led by the David Suzuki Foundation, called on Carney and the federal government to prioritize the expansion of Canada’s east-west electricity grid with renewable energy, ensuring workers' and Indigenous rights are protected.

In the same month, just days after the federal government passed the controversial Bill C-5, known as the One Canadian Economy Act, which faced criticism from both environmental advocates and Indigenous communities, Carney, while flipping pancakes at the Calgary Stampede, remarked, “I would think, given the scale of the economic opportunity, the resources we have, the expertise we have, that it is highly, highly likely that we will have an oil pipeline that is a proposal for one of these projects of national interest.”

Kalapos argues that instead of pushing for a national pipeline, the focus should shift to investing in a national electricity grid.

Carney’s decisions in the coming months will be closely watched, especially in light of the International Court of Justice’s landmark ruling that climate inaction is not only reckless but illegal; for the first time, the world’s highest court has affirmed that states are legally obligated to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, including those from fossil fuel production, or risk breaching international law with potential consequences.

Cathy Orlando of Citizens' Climate Lobby Canada says she is looking forward to this fall's federal budget and hopes it will provide a clearer roadmap for Canada's renewable energy future, offering Canadians a better understanding of the legacy Carney will leave behind.

“Right now, Canadians have the chance to give input on what they want in the budget, and Citizens Climate Lobby Canada will be highlighting that solar and wind are much cheaper and will reduce energy costs. Our children will thank us because not only will energy costs go down, but climate damage costs will too,” Orlando said.

“Democracy is more than voting; we need to be curious about why we can’t solve the climate crisis. The real cause is a coordinated, sophisticated, well-funded fossil fuel machine backed by billionaires who want to keep the status quo. Once we wake up to that, this will end sooner, and we’ll have a cleaner, better world.”

The Pointer reached out to the Prime Minister’s office for comment but did not receive a response ahead of publication.

The BRICS Energy Cooperation Roadmap 2025-30 outlines a structured plan to enhance energy coordination across member countries through joint research, investment and technology collaboration.","The global energy landscape is going through a structural shift. With the adoption of a joint road map at the meeting of BRICS’ energy ministers in Brazil this year, the bloc is set to redefine the terms of multilateral cooperation in energy. As the importance of energy security and climate finance rises to national agendas, BRICS+ has positioned itself as a platform for advancing regional interests across member economies.

India’s priorities are closely aligned with this shift. With its growing leadership in energy deployment, India stands to benefit from a more coordinated BRICS energy strategy, particularly in securing financing and advancing clean energy partnerships. As part of this effort, India has invited member countries to the next BRICS Energy Gathering, which will be hosted under its chairship in 2026. This convergence on increasing regional en­ergy collaborations showcases how far the BRICS platform has evolved from its original conception as a grouping for cooperation among emerging economic powers.

In 2001, the head of economic research at Goldman Sachs, Jim O’Neill coined the term “BRICS” to describe Brazil, Russia, India and China as nations projected to surpass the G7 (Group of Seven) in gross domestic product (GDP) growth over the following decade. According to O’Neill, this meant that global economic govern­ance ought to include space for these prominent economies. Soon enough, in 2009, the BRICS forum was formalised, with South Africa joining soon after. Since its inception, BRICS has been viewed as a South-led initiative, with the potential to reshape international institutional frameworks and provide alternatives to existing structures.

Between 2023 and 2025, BRICS doubled its membership. The bloc added five new countries – the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Egypt, Ethiopia, Indonesia and Iran – and increased the total membership to 10. By mid-2025, the growing BRICS+ accounts for nearly half the world’s population and over 40 per cent of the global GDP, surpassing G7 by approximately $20 trillion. Furthermore, between 2002 and 2022, intra-BRICS trade, as a share of global goods trades, more than doubled to 40 per cent.

Trends in the energy landscape

At the 2025 BRICS energy ministers’ meeting, which was held in Brazil, the bloc collectively reaffirmed their commitment to advancing regional energy cooperation. The meeting also saw calls to link energy trade with the local currency usage and prioritise technologic­al neutrality for a just transition. The energy profile of the expanded BRICS+ bloc is characterised by dual trendsuse trends including continued fossil fuel capacity development and a simultaneous shift towards renewables. According to the Global Energy Monitor, BRICS+ nations now account for 38 per cent of the glo­bal petroleum imports, with an expected increase up to 55 per cent, in case of further expansions. On the supply side, the group controls approximately 43 per cent of the global crude oil output and 32 per cent of the natural gas production. However, as new non-fossil capacity add­itions already outnumber fossil-fuel­ led projects slated for commissioning, we are witnessing a critical point of inflection for the bloc. For instance, wind and utility-scale solar projects that are under development already outpace planned coal, oil and gas plants by a ratio of two to one across BRICS countries, according to the Global Energy Monitor. These additions are driven by strong policy support in China and expanding pipelines in Brazil, India and South Africa. According to Climate Analytics, China’s investment in electric vehicles, batteries and solar manufacturing is expected to reduce the global oil demand by as much as 5 million barrels per day by 2030.

Similarly, India has made significant progress in domestic solar module manufacturing and infrastructure development. It has doubled its electricity capacity to 475 GW over the past decade and now ranks as the third-largest producer of solar and wind energy. Ongoing efforts include smart grid and transmission expansion under the Green Energy Corridor, along with targets for green hydrogen, a national carbon credit market and 100 GW of nuclear capacity by 2047. Simi­larly, India has made significant strides in domestic solar module manufacturing with help from the production-linked incentive scheme. It has launched efforts such as the Revamped Distribution Sector Scheme to install smart grids, strengthen transmission under the green energy corridor and is set to establish an operational national carbon market. Brazil continues to expand its hydropower and bioenergy portfolios and South Africa is scaling up investments in coal transition and distribution strengthening. Overall, the bloc has enough clean energy projects under ­development to nearly triple its renewable capacity by 2030.

BRICS roadmap for energy cooperation (2025-30)

To build on these national efforts by deepening coordination across the bloc, BRICS+ members adopted a revised En­ergy Cooperation Roadmap 2025-30 at the energy ministers’ meeting in May 2025. The BRICS Energy Cooperation Roadmap 2025-30 outlines a structured plan to enhance energy coordination across member countries through joint research, investment and technology collaboration. The cooperation framework is structured into two branches – Sectoral Cooperation and Cross-cutting Areas. Under the sectoral cooperation framework, six thematic areas have been prioritised in the renewable energy space including solar (grid and off-grid), wind (onshore and offshore), hydropower, geothermal energy and distributed renewable energy generation. In addition, grid modernisation has been identified as a central area of action, with specific focus on improving the quality of transmission infrastructure and the deployment of smart grids across BRICS countries.

The cross-cutting areas section identifies key technologies that can support the above deployment. These include en­ergy storage systems and emerging energy technologies, which are expected to become increasingly important in supporting the integration of variable renewable energy to meet overall transition goals. By 2027, the road map sets two clear operational targets. First, member countries aim to coordinate the development of energy storage and other emerging technologies to facilitate large-scale renewable integration and reduce grid intermittency. Second, smart grid development is positioned as a strategic priority.

BRICS as energy alliance

In an increasingly fragmented global order due to unilateral dominance in international institutions, the case for a South–South energy alliance has become more pronounced. Within this context, the BRICS platform presents an opportunity for emerging economies to build collaborative frameworks.

A key feature of the bloc’s evolving energy engagement has been the emergence of bilateral and regional initiatives aimed at supply chain diversification. For example, China and the UAE have partnered to establish joint cleantech knowledge centres to facilitate the transfer of patents in solar photovoltaic (PV) modules and electric vehicle components. This arrangement is designed to enable the UAE to build indigenous manufacturing capabilities, while allowing Chinese exporters to circumvent tariff-related trade barriers. Similarly, India has entered into green hydrogen cooperation agreements with Oman and signed an MoU with Malaysia and Vietnam for joint solar manufacturing. The financing for these initiatives is supported in part by the New Development Bank (NDB). In South Africa, the bank is supporting Eskom’s transmission infrastructure modernisation programme as part of its broader Just Energy Transition agenda. In Brazil, the NDB is co-financing the expansion of São Paulo’s electric bus fleet. In India, the NDB has extended financial assistance to Sustainable Alternative Energy Limited’s 300 MW solar PV project in Andhra Pradesh, which includes a 220 kV grid connection under long-term power offtake with the Solar Energy Corporation of India.

Internal contradictions and challenges

While BRICS+ does represent a unified front on South-South energy cooperation, the bloc remains divided by geopolit­ical rivalries and individual development priorities. According to an analysis by the Global Policy Journal, the group faces internal fragmentation due to “conflicting geopolitical alignments and unequal access to financing and technologies”.

Additionally, the NDB is yet to scale its role as a major financier of energy transi­tion projects. According to the NDB’s 2024­ Annual Report, only a limited share of total lending has been directed towar­ds clean energy infrastructure, with project pipelines concentrated in a few middle-income economies. A study by the South African Institute of International Affairs notes that slow disbursement cycles and an overly centralised governance model have prevented a fast uptake to country-specific energy needs. At present, BRICS also lacks a central framework for carbon intensity benchmarks and energy certification, which leaves members vulnerable to emerging trade barriers. For example, the Euro­pean Union’s CBAM (carbon border adjust­ment mechanism), which is slated for full implementation by 2026, presents significant challenges for BRICS exporters.

The road ahead

With the goal of positioning itself as a central pillar in a multipolar world, BRICS+’ ability to deliver meaningful outcomes depends on translating frameworks into operational coordination. This requires energy security to remain the foundational principle. To help countries solve reliability and affordability challenges in their domestic systems, coordinated investments in cross-border transmission, smart grid infrastructure and battery storage will be needed to build flexibility across geographies. This also opens opportunities for regional power pooling and co-investment in system balancing technologies, which can provide a buffer against intermittent generation and future supply shocks. Second, BRICS must move towards a common framework for carbon intensity benchmarks and certification schemes. Mutual recognition of standards will not only protect export competitiveness but also create shared accountability within the bloc.

Third, supply chain integration must be pursued more strategically. The global­ shift towards modular, multi-country production systems presents an opportunity for BRICS nations to align their comparative advantages. For instance, solar modules, battery packs, ­electrolyser components and electric vehicle charging systems are being manufactured across multiple geographies, as countries specialise in specific segments of the value chain. For BRICS nations, this trend presents a strategic opportunity to align their respective comparative advantages. For instance, Brazil’s access to rare earths and critical minerals could complement China’s cell and module manufacturing base, while India’s emerging hydrogen ecosystem could serve as a downstream market. Furthermore, joint ventures and transparent technology licensing could be some of the tools that incentivise cooperation.

If BRICS meets these expectations, it could become the most significant energy alliance of the Global South in the decades to come.",https://powerline.net.in/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/favIcon.png,N,,2025-08-10 21:59:17.938839

Nibertex’s innovations represent the future of textile manufacturing, combining cutting-edge materials science with environmental responsibility to provide sustainable solutions for the global industry.","Nibertex, a deep-tech company specializing in PFAS-free waterproof and breathable textiles, has successfully closed a $7 million Series A funding round, a news release from the company said.

The round, led by Southeast Asian venture capital firm TNB Aura, also saw participation from existing investors like the Asian Development Bank (ADB), Faircrest Holding, and Foxmont Capital Partners.

PFAS (per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances) are chemicals commonly used in products like rain jackets, medical gowns, and non-stick cookware for their water- and stain-resistant properties. However, these substances are being phased out due to their environmental persistence and links to serious health risks.

With stricter regulations and bans being introduced in the United States, European Union, and Asia-Pacific, manufacturers need alternatives that maintain high performance without harming the planet.

Nibertex meets this need with its electrospinning (nanospinning) technology, creating high-performance, PFAS-free membranes that are both waterproof and breathable.

“PFAS-free performance materials are no longer a ‘nice to have’—they’re fast becoming a requirement,” said Richard Beck, PhD, Nibertex’s Chief Strategy Officer, who previously worked at W.L. Gore & Associates (GORE-TEX).

Nibertex aims to capitalize on its breakthrough technology to become a key player in the growing demand for sustainable textile solutions.

“We’re combining decades of expertise to deliver membranes that meet real-world demands,” Beck added. “We aim to help manufacturers navigate this critical shift toward sustainability.”

TNB Aura’s Co-Founder and Managing Partner, Vicknesh Pillay, expressed confidence in Nibertex’s potential: “Their early commercial success, cost-effective production in the Philippines, and product quality put them in a strong position to compete globally. This is our first major investment in the Philippines, and we’re excited to support Nibertex’s growth.”

Since its founding in 2019, Nibertex has developed a scalable manufacturing process to produce PFAS-free membranes. These membranes are soft, silent, stretchable, and blend seamlessly into textiles, making them ideal for use in performance wear, healthcare, and industrial applications.

With the Series A funding, Nibertex plans to:

Expand manufacturing capacity to meet rising demand

Accelerate research and development to explore new applications beyond apparel

Scale marketing efforts and secure strategic partnerships with global brands

“This funding marks a key moment for us as we expand to meet global demand for sustainable textile solutions,” said Jae H. Park, Nibertex’s Co-Founder and Chief Operating Officer. “Our nanospinning technology gives us a competitive edge in providing environmentally responsible products that the industry urgently needs.”

Nibertex’s success is part of a broader shift toward more sustainable manufacturing in the textile industry. With governments worldwide tightening PFAS regulations, companies like Nibertex—offering proven alternatives—are becoming vital to manufacturers looking to future-proof their operations.

Their electrospinning technology enables the creation of materials that are not only environmentally safe but also deliver the high performance required in demanding applications.

As Jack Lifton of CMI quips, the nineteenth-century steel age never ended—it has simply morphed into a high-stakes age of critical minerals.
The Critical Minerals Report (CMR) is a weekly compilation of the top stories selected by the Critical Minerals Institute (CMI) Board of Directors.
The Critical Minerals Institute Elevates Steel to Critical Status as CMI’s 2025 Watchlist Expands to 24 (August 7, 2025, Source) – The Critical Minerals Institute (CMI) has released its expanded “CMI Critical Minerals Watchlist 2025,” increasing the list from 23 to 24 materials by adding steel and molybdenum while removing bismuth.
The bailout requires Nyrstar to modernise facilities to extract critical minerals such as antimony, bismuth, germanium, and indium from smelting byproducts.","Global competition for critical minerals intensified this week. In a decisive move that broadens the definition of what counts as “essential,” the Critical Minerals Institute (CMI) added steel and molybdenum to its 2025 CMI Watchlist, dropped bismuth, and raised the roster to 24 materials. By elevating steel—the workhorse of modern industry thanks to its blend of strength, formability, and durability—CMI signals that supply risk now extends to the very backbone of every decarbonization project on the planet. Molybdenum’s inclusion reflects its outsized role in hardening those steels and in powering next-generation semiconductors. Copper, uranium, gallium, rare earth elements, and cobalt retain their place atop CMI’s hierarchy, underscoring that vulnerability is not confined to permanent magnets or micro processing chips.

China promptly illustrated why the list keeps growing. Customs data show July rare earth exports fell nine percent month-on-month to 5,994 tonnes—down twenty-three percent from June’s record—despite Beijing’s agreement with Washington and Brussels to ease the export-licensing regime imposed in April. The year-to-date total remains up thirteen percent, yet the volatility underscores how a single policy lever in the world’s dominant producer can jolt global supply chains overnight. A fuller product breakdown, due August 20, will show whether shipments of finished magnets—vital for EV drivetrains and wind turbines—are flowing or stalling.

Europe answered with action. Solvay’s La Rochelle plant—still the only site outside China capable of separating all seventeen rare-earth elements—has begun a €20 million expansion to pivot from autocatalyst feed to high-purity magnet metals such as neodymium and praseodymium. Management says the goal is to meet thirty percent of Europe’s rare-earth demand by 2030 through a mix of recycled magnets and new feedstock from allies including Brazil, Canada, and Australia—a direct nod to the EU’s Critical Raw Materials Act.

Across the Atlantic, General Motors(NYSE: GM) tightened its own magnet lifeline. The automaker signed a multi-year supply agreement with Texas-based Noveon Magnetics—currently the United States’ only producer of sintered NdFeB magnets—for components in GM’s full-size trucks and sport-utility vehicles. Deliveries began in July, giving GM a hedge against China’s ninety-percent share of global rare-earth processing and the export licences Beijing introduced this spring.

Washington is leveraging both government policy and corporate partnerships to secure critical mineral supply. A revealing detail emerged from Pretoria: in 2019, South African President Cyril Ramaphosa quietly offered the Rainbow Rare Earths (LSE: RBW) Phalaborwa project to then-U.S. President Donald Trump, hoping to gain American backing for a non-Chinese source of neodymium-praseodymium (NdPr). Since then, Phalaborwa has attracted a US$50 million investment from the U.S. International Development Finance Corporation through TechMet. The project is now positioned to benefit from a July agreement in which the U.S. Department of Defense guaranteed MP Materials (NYSE: MP) a ten-year minimum price of US$110 per kilogram for NdPr—nearly double the current spot price.

The pricing precedent is contagious. Canberra revealed it is “actively considering” a rare-earth price-floor mechanism, backed by an A$1.2 billion strategic-reserve plan. Even the hint of sovereign support lifted shares of Lynas Rare Earths (ASX: LYC) to a thirteen-year high, while Iluka Resources (ASX: ILU) and Arafura Rare Earths (ASX: ARU) jumped roughly ten percent.

Resource nationalism is not limited to magnets. Brazil’s President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva declared strategic minerals a matter of “national sovereignty,” vowing to end the export of raw ores without domestic value-addition and to map the nation’s vast geological inventory under a new minerals council. The plan arrives amid a 50 percent U.S. tariff on Brazilian imports and illustrates how governments are linking minerals policy directly to foreign-policy friction.

U.S. policy, meanwhile, is reshaping demand. With federal EV purchase credits set to expire September 30 and emissions penalties rolled back, first-half U.S. electric-vehicle sales eked out just a 1.5 percent gain, while global sales jumped twenty-eight percent. Automakers are scrambling: GM has allocated nearly US$900 million to a new V-8 engine plant even as it delays certain EV launches, betting that tariffs on imported batteries may make domestically produced EVs comparatively attractive after incentives vanish.

Supply-side shocks are not limited to policy. Glencore (LSE: GLEN) warned that much of its cobalt output could remain unsold through 2025 because the Democratic Republic of Congo has extended its cobalt-export suspension. The mining giant has already stockpiled every pound produced since February; even so, first-half output rose nineteen percent to 18,900 t. Glencore’s reassurance that zero sales would not dent profits illustrates the distorted economics that emerge when a single country controlling seventy percent of global supply turns off the spigot.

Amid these crosscurrents, nuclear energy is staging a quiet revival. A Reuters analysis estimates the United States could add seven gigawatts of nuclear capacity by 2030—about a seven-percent increase—primarily by restarting shuttered plants and uprating existing reactors. Holtec International is on track to revive the 800 MW Palisades plant this year, Constellation Energy (NASDAQ: CEG) is preparing to bring Three Mile Island Unit 1 back by 2027 under a long-term clean-power deal with Microsoft, and NextEra Energy (NYSE: NEE) may restart Iowa’s Duane Arnold station.

Rebuilding the fuel cycle is part of that push. General Matter signed a US$1.5 billion lease with the Department of Energy to build an enrichment plant at Paducah, Kentucky, re-using 7 600 cylinders of depleted UF₆ as feedstock and cutting reliance on Russian imports before waivers end in 2028.

The Pentagon is directing capital toward less familiar but equally strategic metals. Elk Creek Resources, a unit of NioCorp Developments Ltd. (NASDAQ: NB), secured up to US$10 million under the Defense Production Act to advance its Nebraska project rich in niobium, scandium, titanium, and rare earths. By scrapping a costly acid plant and installing an electric underground rail system, NioCorp has shaved about US$300 million from its capex. Binding off-take deals cover seventy-five percent of planned niobium and twelve tonnes of scandium per year and talks with Stellantis (NYSE: STLA) could channel all future rare-earth output into domestic EV supply chains.

From steel’s elevation to critical status to sovereign price-floor proposals, nuclear restarts, and direct government investment in once-obscure metals, the through-line is unmistakeable: nations and corporations are racing to lock down the raw materials that will define economic resilience and geopolitical leverage for decades. Market forces alone no longer set the pace; industrial policy and strategic alliances increasingly dictate who controls tomorrow’s supply. As Jack Lifton of CMI quips, the nineteenth-century steel age never ended—it has simply morphed into a high-stakes age of critical minerals.

The Critical Minerals Institute Elevates Steel to Critical Status as CMI’s 2025 Watchlist Expands to 24 (August 7, 2025, Source) – The Critical Minerals Institute (CMI) has released its expanded “CMI Critical Minerals Watchlist 2025,” increasing the list from 23 to 24 materials by adding steel and molybdenum while removing bismuth. Steel’s inclusion reflects surging global demand from decarbonization initiatives and infrastructure projects, alongside supply concentration among a few Asian producers. Molybdenum, vital for strengthening steel, power transmission, and advanced semiconductors, was also added. CMI reaffirmed its Top 5—copper, uranium, gallium, rare earth elements, and cobalt—due to persistent supply risks and rising demand. The Watchlist, built from 12 global critical mineral lists and trade-flow analysis, aims to guide governments and investors in securing resilient supply chains.

China rare earth exports slid in July after hitting peak in prior month (August 7, 2025, Source) – China’s rare earth exports fell 23% in July to 5,994.3 metric tons, following a record high in June, according to customs data. The decline comes after Beijing reached agreements with the U.S. and Europe to increase shipments and ease export licensing introduced in April in response to U.S. tariffs. Analysts caution against drawing firm conclusions from the preliminary figures, which are volatile and lack detail on specific products. A full breakdown, including rare earth magnets—whose exports to the U.S. and Germany surged in June—will be released on August 20. From January to July, exports rose 13% year-on-year to 38,563.6 tons.

US eyes 7% more nuclear power through restarts, upgrades (August 7, 2025, Source) – The U.S. could boost nuclear power capacity by 7 GW by 2030 through restarts, uprates, and license extensions, offering faster, lower-cost options than building new reactors. Rising power demand from AI and Big Tech’s pursuit of clean, dispatchable energy have spurred projects backed by long-term power purchase agreements. Holtec is restarting Michigan’s 800 MW Palisades plant in 2024, while Constellation is reopening the 837 MW Three Mile Island Unit 1 in 2027 to supply Microsoft. NextEra may revive Iowa’s 600 MW Duane Arnold plant. Trump has ordered faster Nuclear Regulatory Commission approvals and set a 5 GW uprate target. Utilities are also pursuing multiple license renewals to extend reactor lifespans.

Ramaphosa offered Rainbow Rare Earths project to US (August 7, 2025, Source) – South African President Cyril Ramaphosa reportedly offered rare earth supplies to U.S. President Donald Trump in 2019, referring to Rainbow Rare Earths’ Phalaborwa project in Limpopo. The UK-listed company, led by CEO George Bennett, plans to produce neodymium and praseodymium (NdPr), key materials for permanent magnets. The U.S. International Development Finance Corp has already committed $50 million for a stake via TechMet, an 11.7% Rainbow shareholder. China currently mines 70% and refines 91% of global rare earths, controlling prices. A recent U.S. Department of Defense deal with MP Materials guarantees NdPr at $110/kg for 10 years, potentially benefiting Phalaborwa, which could produce 1,900 t annually with high profit margins.

Trump will slow, but may not stop the rise of electric vehicles (August 6, 2025, Source) – Electric vehicle (EV) growth in the U.S. faces headwinds under President Donald Trump, whose administration ended federal tax credits of up to $7,500 for EV purchases, abolished clean air penalties, and shifted policy toward fossil fuels. These changes have boosted production of profitable gasoline-powered pickups and SUVs, such as GM’s $900 million V-8 investment, while slowing EV sales growth to 1.5% in the first half of 2025. Globally, however, EV sales rose 28% to 9.1 million units. Advocacy groups, state incentives, and expanding charging infrastructure support continued adoption, while tariffs may make U.S.-built EVs more competitive. Analysts expect slower but ongoing U.S. EV market expansion.

GM signs rare earth magnet deal with Noveon Magnetics (August 6, 2025, Source) – General Motors has signed a multi-year agreement with Noveon Magnetics for the supply of rare earth magnets used in components for its full-size SUVs and trucks, Noveon announced Wednesday. The deliveries, which began in July, involve sintered neodymium-iron-boron (NdFeB) magnets, the strongest and most advanced permanent magnets available. Noveon is currently the only operational U.S. manufacturer of these magnets. The deal comes amid China’s dominance in rare earth processing—over 90% of global capacity—and its introduction of new export licensing rules in April, which have tightened supply to Western manufacturers.

Lula plans new ‘national sovereignty’ policy for strategic minerals (August 6, 2025, Source) – Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva announced plans for a new national policy treating strategic minerals as a matter of “national sovereignty,” aimed at preventing the export of raw minerals without domestic value addition. Lula emphasized establishing a complete mapping of Brazil’s mineral wealth and creating a national council on mineral materials and standards to safeguard resources and position Brazil as a leader in the energy transition. His remarks follow a 50% tariff imposed on U.S. imports from Brazil amid political tensions linked to former president Jair Bolsonaro’s trial. Lula assured that businesses would not face difficulties under the new framework.

How Europe is vying for rare earth independence from China (August 6, 2025, Source) – Solvay is expanding its rare earth processing plant in La Rochelle, France, to help Europe reduce dependence on China, which accounts for about 70% of global rare earth mining and 90% of refining. The EU’s Critical Raw Materials Act, enacted in 2023, targets greater domestic extraction, processing, and recycling by 2030. La Rochelle, one of only two European facilities and the only one outside China capable of processing all 17 rare earths, is shifting focus from catalytic converters to high-demand magnets for EVs, electronics, and defense. Backed by €20 million in French tax credits, the plant aims to source materials through recycling and imports from countries such as Brazil, Canada, and Australia.

General Matter signs lease with US energy department to enrich uranium (August 6, 2025, Source) – General Matter, a U.S. startup aiming to enrich uranium for nuclear reactors, has signed a lease with the Department of Energy (DOE) to build a $1.5 billion enrichment facility at the former Paducah Gaseous Diffusion Plant in Kentucky. Construction is set to begin in 2026, with operations expected by the end of the decade, creating about 140 permanent jobs. The project supports U.S. efforts to reduce reliance on Russian uranium, with a ban on imports in place but waivers allowed until 2028. General Matter will receive at least 7,600 cylinders of uranium hexafluoride from DOE and must obtain a Nuclear Regulatory Commission license before operations.

Glencore says Congo export ban may see much of its cobalt output unsold by end-2025 (August 6, 2025, Source) – Glencore said a substantial share of its cobalt production may remain unsold by the end of 2025 due to the Democratic Republic of Congo’s (DRC) ongoing cobalt export suspension. The DRC, the world’s largest cobalt supplier, imposed a four-month ban in February after prices hit a nine-year low, extending it by three months in June. Glencore, the second-largest cobalt producer globally, has been stockpiling output in the DRC since the ban and earlier declared force majeure on some deliveries. First-half 2025 cobalt production rose 19% year-on-year to 18,900 metric tons, with full-year output forecast at 42,000–45,000 tons, up from 38,200 tons in 2024.

Australia weighs price floor for critical minerals, boosting rare earths miners (August 5, 2025, Source) – Australia is considering implementing a price floor to support critical minerals projects, including rare earths, amid efforts to position itself as an alternative supplier to China for sectors such as automotive and defence. Resources Minister Madeleine King said mechanisms for a price floor, focused on voluntary national offtake agreements, are under active consideration to provide pricing certainty and reduce exposure to volatile markets. This follows an $87 million lifeline to Nyrstar’s metals processing operations and a pledge of A$1.2 billion to build a strategic reserve. The announcement drove share gains for Lynas Rare Earths Ltd. (ASX: LYC), Iluka Resources (ASX: ILU), and Arafura Rare Earths Limited (ASX: ARU), echoing a recent U.S. pricing deal with MP Materials (NYSE: MP).

Australia bails out Trafigura smelters as it seeks to secure critical minerals (August 5, 2025, Source) – Australia’s federal and state governments will provide A$135 million ($87 million) to Trafigura-owned Nyrstar to prevent the closure of the nation’s only lead smelter in Port Pirie and largest zinc smelter in Hobart. The bailout requires Nyrstar to modernise facilities to extract critical minerals such as antimony, bismuth, germanium, and indium from smelting byproducts. These minerals are vital for defence and technology, with some facing Chinese export restrictions. The initiative aims to strengthen Australia’s role as a non-Chinese supplier for global industries. High energy costs, weak market prices, and competition from Chinese producers have placed significant pressure on the country’s metals smelters.

US awards NioCorp unit up to $10 million for scandium project in Nebraska (August 5, 2025, Source) – The U.S. Department of Defense has awarded up to $10 million to Elk Creek Resources, a NioCorp Developments Ltd. (NASDAQ: NB) unit, to boost domestic scandium production and reduce reliance on China. The funding will support design and process improvements at NioCorp’s Elk Creek project in Nebraska, including eliminating a sulfuric acid plant to save $100 million and adopting a fully electric twin-ramp rail system, reducing costs by $200 million from the $1.14 billion capital estimate. The project, which also targets niobium, titanium, and rare earths, has completed drilling, metallurgy, and permitting. NioCorp holds binding deals for 75% of planned niobium output and 12 tonnes of scandium annually, and is in talks with Stellantis for rare earth supply.

With hyperlocal weather data and high-resolution weather modeling, energy companies can harden the grid.
Accurate weather intelligence forecasts give energy traders the inside knowledge necessary to capitalize on market opportunities.
Weather intelligence solutions like ours can help ensure that power grids transmit energy as efficiently as possible, utilizing all available line capacity.
Meanwhile, Meteomatics’ weather data enables utilities to unlock more grid capacity than they previously thought their aging grids could support.","Meteomatics is a weather intelligence and technology company that offers companies across industries—including energy, insurance, aviation and agriculture—real-time insights into localized weather patterns that directly affect their business. More than 600 companies, including Northwestern Energy, NASA, and UK Power Networks, rely on Meteomatics for weather data that can significantly impact everything from energy savings and logistics to process automation, risk management, and product design.

The company’s US1k weather model covers the contiguous U.S. and Gulf of Mexico at a resolution of 1 km and updates every hour, integrating data from 110+ sources, including aircraft, ground stations, drones, radars and satellites. Included in these sources is the company’s proprietary Meteodrones—weather drones capable of flying up to 6 km, or 19,500 feet, above mean sea level.

Meteomatics recently released its 2025 Weather Data Trends in Energy Report. Conducted in tandem with market research firm Dynata, the report surveyed 272 senior level energy executives across grid operations, utilities and energy trading, in the U.S. The report explores renewable energy’s impact on them, how they are using the source in their day to day operations, and how the weather affects energy generation. The report also shines a light on other key areas where increasingly extreme weather events are affecting energy executives including those in oil, gas and nuclear, as well as what they are investing in as solutions.

We interviewed Martin Fengler, CEO of Meteomatics, in August 2025.

Q1. What is the main way Meteomatics is impacting the energy industry?

Even a 1% difference in weather forecast accuracy can result in millions of dollars in annual economic losses. With this, power companies need to be able to accurately estimate the weather in order to determine how much energy is being generated, how much is needed to meet demand, and how much can be transmitted at anytime, anywhere. Meteomatics’ weather data models deliver the highest accuracy weather intelligence to companies, from utilities to traders, making this possible. We pair hyperlocal weather data with live data from energy companies’ respective power plants to deliver intra-day and day-ahead energy forecasts for solar, wind, hydropower, and offshore oil and gas platforms.

Q2. Meteomatics' report shows that energy operators are worried about meeting the uptick in energy demand in the U.S. What is causing the uptick?

Both communities and businesses alike are playing a part in the current spike in U.S. energy demand. On the business end, the market’s growing fixation with AI is a leading cause. Major technology companies, including Meta and Google, are investing billions in AI data centers. And now the phenomenon is spreading beyond the technology industry. Blackstone, for example, announced at the Energy and Innovation Summit in Pittsburgh a $25B investment in Pennsylvania data centers, which the company stated in a press release is “uniquely suited to serve as a strategic hub to power the nation’s AI objectives”. Large AI projects require a substantial amount of power. As more companies jump on the AI bandwagon, the power grid is under skyrocketing pressure to provide the power needed for AI to run.

Additionally, consumers are increasingly using more electricity amid extreme temperatures. This summer, we have already seen heat waves increase in intensity and longevity, resulting in increased customer demand.

Q3. Heatwaves have a serious effect on the energy business. Why is this, and can the oil and gas industry support the heightened energy demand?

From a power standpoint, the higher the temperature, the higher the cooling demand for air conditioning. The oil and gas industry helps support this heightened energy demand with gas-generated power plants, which are thermal power stations that burn natural gas to generate electricity. However, with temperatures reaching such high levels this summer, utilities need every energy resource they can get to effectively manage building demand.

It’s also important to note that heat affects the power grid infrastructure itself. Certain temperatures can affect the amount of power that power lines can transmit. Utilities aim to prevent overheating their lines and avoid causing outages.

Q4. I’ve heard that temperatures exceeding 100 degrees detrimentally impacts oil refineries. Why is this and how can Meteomatics help?

Refineries are typically designed to operate between 32°F and 95°F. When temperatures exceed these limits, refineries can become inefficient, shut down, or create potentially dangerous working conditions.

Our weather data can help the industry plan for instances like this, ensuring the lights don’t go out and nobody is in harm's way. For example, utilities can use forecasts to determine their energy distribution/trading strategy. If the temperature exceeds 95°F, they can plan to supplement the grid with additional renewable sources in case refineries shut down.

Q5. The report says over half of U.S. energy executives are still looking to increase their reliance on renewable power sources, despite the challenge of daily fluctuations. How can Meteomatics assist here?

Meteomatics’ 1k model provides highly accurate forecasts of even the smallest meteorological events. We can identify local weather patterns within an area of 1 square kilometer, rivaling current leading weather solutions in the U.S., to provide utilities with hyper-accurate insight into the daily conditions affecting their operations.

With this, companies can confidently understand how much renewable energy they’ll produce that day, the next day, or in the weeks following from solar, wind, and hydropower. Companies can also better assess the energy potential of specific locations based on wind speeds or the site's solar radiation. This enhances the reliability of renewable energy sources in power grids, enabling them to be utilized cost-effectively.

Q6. How do battery energy storage systems (BESS) resolve the intermittent sources of wind and solar?

One main challenge our report discovered for utilities is that when there is an excess of energy produced, it cannot be efficiently stored or distributed. That’s where battery energy storage systems can play a crucial role. Fluctuating generation, whether in excess or deficit, will be less of a challenge with BESS. The excess can be saved for later and then utilized when there is not enough energy being generated to support demand. Fifty-two percent (52%) of utilities plan to increase their investment in BESS solutions over the next decade.

Q7. What can you tell us about weather intelligence solutions for resilience of electric power?

Weather conditions can stress and damage power plant infrastructure. For example, wildfires and hurricanes specifically impact transmission lines. With hyperlocal weather data and high-resolution weather modeling, energy companies can harden the grid. This can take the form of everything from dispatching utility crews for severe storms to vegetation management to mitigate wildfires.

Meteomatics is currently working with NorthWestern Energy to strengthen its wildfire risk monitoring and response capabilities. The utility is using our platform to access real-time wildfire indicators—such as wind speed, humidity, and dryness—on a subhourly basis. This enables earlier action to help reduce the risk of service interruptions and infrastructure damage.

Q8. What role does weather intelligence play in energy trading?

Accurate weather intelligence forecasts give energy traders the inside knowledge necessary to capitalize on market opportunities. By anticipating weather-related fluctuations in energy demand and supply, traders can optimize their trading strategies and maximize profits.

For example, with Meteomatics traders can utilize weather data for forecasting natural gas and power demand. Granular weather data is used by power traders for real-time and day-ahead trading decisions across all major regional transmission organizations and independent system operators (e.g. ERCOT, PJM). The speed of ingesting various weather models via the platform during the market day is key for traders to act quickly and efficiently in response to rapidly changing prices.

Q9. Are there other ways Meteomatics and weather intelligence solutions can help keep U.S. power grids stable?

Weather intelligence solutions like ours can help ensure that power grids transmit energy as efficiently as possible, utilizing all available line capacity.

Renewable energy distribution requires a significant amount of grid capacity, but many operators need to build more infrastructure, which takes time. Meanwhile, Meteomatics’ weather data enables utilities to unlock more grid capacity than they previously thought their aging grids could support.

By monitoring weather factors that affect line capacity, such as air temperature, wind speed, and wind direction, in real-time, instead of using historical data, utilities can have a much better gauge of capacity.

For example, higher wind gusts can cool power lines, allowing more energy to be transmitted safely. If a provider knows the wind duration will last, they can safely funnel more power out to meet energy demand.",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/6897d8d59a7b68966af45c82/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,N,,2025-08-10 19:59:22.977738

This method, known as agrivoltaics or ‘solar grazing,’ allows farmers to maintain their grazing landscapes while generating electricity. The concept, already popular in Europe and Japan, is now making waves in Australia, offering a promising dual-use of land. The Glenrowan West solar farm, led by Gayle and Tom Lee, exemplifies this trend by integrating a 149-megawatt solar power station with traditional farming practices, paving the way for sustainable agriculture and energy production.

The Agrivoltaic Process: Marrying Grazing with Solar Power

Agrivoltaics, or ‘solar electric sheep,’ is a process that integrates sheep grazing with solar electricity generation. This innovative approach ensures that vegetation under and around solar panels is well-maintained, improving soil health while enabling cost-effective energy production. Australian farmer Ben Wynn has been instrumental in pioneering this model with his company Wynergy, which explores cattle grazing alongside solar farms. However, Wynn emphasizes the challenges of establishing a design that accommodates both animals and solar infrastructure. Misaligned panels or inadequate tracking systems can render solar grazing unfeasible, highlighting the importance of strategic planning.

“You need to establish a design that provides the capacity to host animals. It’s really difficult and challenging too,” Wynn stated, underscoring the complexities involved.

Advantages for Farmers and Solar Companies

Agrivoltaics offers significant benefits for farmers who wish to retain their grazing landscapes without ceding control to large solar companies. Eric Nordberg, a researcher at the University of New England, points out that this setup benefits both farmers and solar companies. Farmers retain their land, while companies obtain free vegetation management, reducing maintenance costs. Despite the growing interest, local on-the-ground data about the benefits and drawbacks of agrivoltaics remains limited. However, initiatives like the one funded by NSW’s EnergyCo aim to bridge this gap by developing comprehensive guidelines for solar farm setups.

Boosting Wool Quality and Quantity Through Solar Grazing

Solar grazing has been linked to improved wool quality and quantity, an added advantage for farmers. In 2023, Iberdrola, a renewable energy company in Portugal, began utilizing sheep to maintain its photovoltaic farms, finding that the animals help manage land and reduce fire risks. A UK project plans to graze 4,000 sheep on a 1,600-hectare solar farm, potentially saving the project $6.71 million in mowing costs over 40 years. Reports from New South Wales also suggest that sheep grazing under solar panels have produced superior wool, highlighting another advantage of this dual-use land model.

Challenges and Future Prospects

While the agrivoltaic model presents numerous benefits, it is not without challenges. For instance, aligning solar panel infrastructure with grazing needs requires careful design and implementation. Additionally, local data on the practicalities and impacts of such setups is still sparse, necessitating further research and development. Despite these hurdles, the potential of agrivoltaics to revolutionize sustainable farming and energy production is immense. As more countries recognize the dual benefits of this model, the future of agriculture and renewable energy may increasingly intertwine, offering new opportunities for innovation and sustainability.

The integration of farming and solar energy presents a promising avenue for sustainable development, but it raises essential questions about land use and resource management. How can we best balance agricultural needs with renewable energy demands for a sustainable future?

August 10, 2025

Gov. Tony Evers wrote to the federal Environmental Protection Agency on Thursday, urging the Trump administration not to cancel Wisconsin’s $62.4 million grant to install solar energy systems for low- and moderate-income households.

Evers’ letter to EPA administrator Lee Zeldin followed a New York Times report earlier this week that the agency was preparing to cancel the $7 billion federal “Solar for All” grant program. “Solar for All” was part of the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act passed by congressional Democrats and signed by then-president Joe Biden.

“To be clear, attempting to terminate Solar for All grants has no legitimate purpose or justification,” Evers wrote. “Beyond that, doing so will also negatively impact Wisconsinites and our state, causing increased energy bills for Wisconsinites and hurting efforts to improve air quality, boost resilience, and create good-paying jobs.”

The Wisconsin Economic Development Corp. has put out a request for proposal seeking an implementer for the state’s program, called “PowerUp Wisconsin.” Bidders were to submit a notice of their intent to bid by this past Monday, Aug. 4, and final proposals are due on Friday, Aug. 29.

According to the WEDC’s work plan for the project, Wisconsin’s grant would add rooftop solar power systems to 1,038 households in single-family homes and 2,200 more households in 24 multifamily homes. The plan also calls for 10 community solar projects that could serve an additional 4,239 households.

Evers told Zeldin in the letter that since Wisconsin’s $62.4 million grant was awarded in April 2024, the WEDC has worked with local governments, solar installers, utilities and housing developers to draw up the state’s program guidelines. The program would reduce Wisconsin’s reliance on out-of-state energy and save households up to $500 a year on their energy bills, Evers wrote.

The governor wrote that lowering costs has been “a top priority” for his administration.

“While the Trump Administration claims to share this priority, terminating Wisconsin’s Solar for All grant would have the exact opposite effect, preventing Wisconsin families and households from seeing the direct savings offered through PowerUp Wisconsin,” Evers wrote.

The Evers administration and the Wisconsin Department of Justice have joined a number of lawsuits to block Trump administration executive orders and unilateral actions to cut funding approved by Congress.

Evers’ letter appeared to leave open the prospect for more litigation. “At a time when energy demand continues to increase, it is unfathomable for the Trump Administration to unnecessarily — and potentially illegally — terminate funding for a program designed to deploy affordable, renewable energy systems,” Evers wrote.

The old EV batteries will be put to very good use in Texas

One of the major environmental concerns when it comes to EV batteries is what happens to them when they’re no longer usable.

As many as 100,000 EVs, and therefore 100,000 electric car batteries, will be retired this year in the US alone – and traditionally old EV batteries haven’t been the easiest things to recycle.

Thankfully, times are changing, and several companies are working on ways to reuse these old EV batteries.

One such company is B2U Storage Solutions, which recently announced a new energy storage facility in Texas that is made up of hundreds of old batteries from electric vehicles.

The batteries will be housed in 21 cabinets roughly the size of shipping containers, and will charge up when there is an excess of renewable energy production on the grid and power is relatively cheap.

This is the first of its kind in Texas, but the company is planning on building three more similar facilities throughout 2026, which will have a combined capacity of 100 megawatt hours.

To give that some context, the Texas Tribune reports that an average Texan household uses 30 kilowatt hours per day, so the facilities could have enough energy to power more than 3,000 homes for a day.

“We’re really helping to pioneer and demonstrate to the automotive industry that repurposing makes a lot of sense for a pretty healthy number of batteries before they’re truly ready for end of life and recycling,” CEO and co-founder of B2U Storage Solutions, Freeman Hall told the publication.

It’s not the only use for old batteries from electric cars

B2U Storage Solutions isn’t the only company cutting down on EV battery waste.

Redwood Materials, a company founded by a former Tesla exec, specializes in reusing and recycling electric car batteries.

In a blog post, the company explained that it has received around 250,000 old EV batteries so far and has found that many of them have more than half of their usable capacity.

So, rather than leaving the batteries to rot, Redwood Materials has been repurposing them as both stationary energy storage and in lower-power applications.",https://supercarblondie.com/wp-content/uploads/battery.webp,N,,2025-08-10 18:00:12.854829

A small Australian-first vertical axis wind turbine has helped power a building site for crews working on the duplication of Main South Road between Aldinga and Sellicks beaches.
Minister for Climate, Environment and Water, Susan Close, said the vertical axis wind turbine was an ""exciting development"".
""This wind turbine is able to capture more energy from low wind, which means is more useful for longer,"" she said.
""As a general rule, horizontal axis turbines are significantly more efficient than vertical axis wind turbines … so primarily that's the challenge,"" he said.","On a major construction project south of Adelaide, testing has been underway on a new renewable wind energy source.

A small Australian-first vertical axis wind turbine has helped power a building site for crews working on the duplication of Main South Road between Aldinga and Sellicks beaches.

The developers of the turbine — which is just a fraction of the size of the wind turbines that dominate rural landscapes across Australia — could become part of the country's renewable energy mix, providing power to businesses and potentially homes.

Flinders University has been working on the project for several years with company VAWT-X Energy.

Mechanical and aerospace engineer Dr Amir Zanj said the recent three-month trial had been positive, but that a lot more work and financial investment would be required.

""Without this technology being fully completed, still in the prototype level, we've received several requests from wineries … small manufacturers, small businesses and farmers,"" Dr Zanj said.

The project has been funded with support from both federal and state governments, as well as a private investor.

""Without all these elements around the table, making something of this scale would be impossible,"" Dr Zanj said.

The 6-kilowatt wind turbine was used to power CPB Contractors's construction site, and project manager Andrew Coonan said that there were advantages to having an energy source that can potentially run all day.

""Obviously the sun doesn't shine 24 hours of the day … so we really see this as integrating into the mix of energy sources,"" Mr Coonan said.

""Our compounds typically are powered by fossil fuels and having to tap into the [electricity] network, so having the ability to use wind power, solar power, sometimes there's bio-fuel generators that can be used as well.

""Having a real mix in there, means we can get away from fossil fuels for our projects.""

VAWT-X Energy managing director Gary Andrews said it had taken several years to create the current prototype, but he hoped he would have a product ready for manufacture within 12 months.

""The aim is to learn from it to see what faults there are and find solutions to fix those and have a commercial version by early next year,"" Mr Andrews said.

""Solar only operates during the day, so if you want to go off-grid, ideally, you want to be able to have the potential to be able to generate electricity 24/7.

""So if you have solar and a wind turbine, then you're potentially getting electricity day and night.""

Mr Andrews said he hoped to be able to manufacture locally in South Australia and wants to keep the cost to around $36,000, plus installation.

""We hope that this will be adopted across Australia and elsewhere in the world as a form of distributed renewable energy,"" Mr Andrews said.

The project has been given support from federal and South Australian governments, including a $300,000 grant from the Department of State Development.

Minister for Climate, Environment and Water, Susan Close, said the vertical axis wind turbine was an ""exciting development"".

""This wind turbine is able to capture more energy from low wind, which means is more useful for longer,"" she said.

""You would expect that the state that is the most switched on in Australia for wind and solar would see the most innovation, and that's exactly what's happening.""

Small-scale turbines could fill the niche

David Burton, from Monash University's Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering, said large wind farms that use horizontal axis wind turbines have dominated the global wind energy market.

Mr Burton said they had been found to be more commercially viable than vertical axis options like the VAWT-X prototype.

""As a general rule, horizontal axis turbines are significantly more efficient than vertical axis wind turbines … so primarily that's the challenge,"" he said.

""There's quite a large number of manufacturers who have delved into that [vertical] technology, previously … it's not a new thing.

But Mr Burton said smaller scale turbines could potentially be the best way for the vertical technology to find its niche.

""If I was to look at a place for vertical axis wind then it's in the area that they're targeting, that sort of application seems to be the most logical,"" he said.

""That seems to be where the technology is most likely to succeed, at least at this stage.""",https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/3b5a53a889d7b7d25657882d3ce0d8da?impolicy=wcms_watermark_news&cropH=2813&cropW=5000&xPos=0&yPos=189&width=862&height=485&imformat=generic,N,,2025-08-10 17:59:55.581137

PERTH, Monday 11 August 2025 – A new analysis released today by an alliance of unions and leading environmental organisations has recommended a nation-first 'decommissioning hub' be built in Western Australia to manage the state's growing number of retired offshore oil and gas infrastructure.

The WA Can’t Wait report, a collaboration between Greenpeace Australia Pacific, Unions WA, Conservation Council WA, Maritime Union of Australia - WA Branch, The Wilderness Society, Australian Manufacturing Workers Union - WA Branch, Electrical Trades Union - WA Branch, found that a WA decommissioning hub would deliver thousands of secure, skilled jobs, protect marine ecosystems and coastal communities, and direct scrap steel and other valuable resources into local domestic circular supply chains.

The report's recommendations include that:

A decommissioning hub be built in Western Australia, near current fossil fuel infrastructure and where green recycling facilities can be established

Oil and gas operators are held financially responsible and a fully industry-funded clean-up be mandated

Existing laws are strengthened and enforced to ensure a full and timely decommissioning

The safety of workers and the environment is prioritised

Investment in ports, recycling facilities and local workforces is increased to support decommissioning and emerging offshore wind and other renewable energy industries.

Geoff Bice, Greenpeace Australia Pacific WA Campaign Lead, said:

“Our oceans are buckling under pressure from the fossil fuel industry, the drilling, extracting and burning of fossil fuels, and the mismanagement of oil and gas infrastructure. Spills and discarded toxic material have dire impacts on the ocean and all life that depends on it.

""89% of Australia’s 5.7 million tonnes of offshore oil and gas infrastructure is in West Australian waters. The fossil fuel industry treats our oceans like a dump. WA’s oceans can’t become a graveyard for the rotting skeletons of the oil and gas industry.

“A decommissioning hub is WA-positive, and the industry should foot the bill for their own mess. This isn’t just a clean-up plan, it’s a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to build a world-leading industry.”

Rikki Hendon, UnionsWA Secretary, said:

“The oil and gas infrastructure off Western Australia’s coastline must be decommissioned at the end of its life. That work needs to be done properly, safely, and locally.

“The opportunity to create thousands of secure jobs here in WA by putting in place a local decommissioning hub is right in front of us. We have the people, we have the industrial capacity, and we have the know-how.”

Matt Roberts, Conservation Council of Western Australia Executive Director, said:

“50% of Australia’s offshore oil and gas infrastructure is due to be decommissioned by 2030 and most of it is in WA. It is critical that companies are held to account to deliver on their environmental responsibilities.

There are also huge opportunities for new jobs in decommissioning and metals recycling. These are the jobs of the future that will help us transition to renewable energy.""

Will Tracey, Maritime Union of Australia WA Secretary, said:

“This report is a wake-up call. It shows that with the right coordination, WA can get the job done locally and safely — creating union jobs, protecting our pristine coast, and practicing responsible stewardship of hazardous waste. We welcome this practical, worker and community-focused contribution to solving a national decommissioning bottleneck. This is how we keep high value jobs in WA and secure economic strength for decades to come, building a bridge between the energy past and a just, sustainable future.

""While this report points the way forward, the federal government is doing the opposite — towing the Northern Endeavour and 40,000 tonnes of recyclable steel to Europe instead of backing local yards and local jobs. It’s time for the government to act on what workers and communities are calling for: full removal, local recycling, and a Future Made in Australia that starts in WA.”

Steve McCartney, Australian Manufacturing Workers’ Union WA Secretary, said:

""Western Australia has an opportunity to develop a circular economy in steel production, using the decommissioning of oil and gas infrastructure as a feedstock for green steel recycling onshore.

""Not only would this help stand up green steel projects in the South West, it would provide long-term and stable onshore demand so we never see another debacle like the Northern Endeavour work being stolen from Australian workers ever again.""

Fern Cadman, Wilderness Society Fossil Fuel Industry Campaigner, said:

“Australia and WA are already behind the eight ball on decommissioning. The longer we wait, the harder the work is and the more the environment is at risk. We hope this report is a kick into gear for governments and industry.

""The magnificent oceans of WA mustn't become an industrial wasteland for the oil and gas sector. Cleaning up the legacy of the offshore oil and gas industry is a responsibility and an opportunity.""

Adam Woodage, Electrical Trades Union WA Secretary, said:

""Decommissioning must be approached with the highest standards of safety and environmental responsibility. Cutting corners puts workers, communities and our fragile marine ecosystems at risk. The legacy we leave beneath the waves must reflect not just decades of extraction, but our commitment to doing the right thing when the work is done.""

The report release follows recent revelations that Australian taxpayers are facing a $500 million clean-up bill for Chevron’s aging oil and gas infrastructure in WA waters and that the safety regulator NOPSEMA has ordered Woodside to restart decommissioning work at several offshore oil and gas fields.

Driven by regulatory tailwinds, technological innovation, and shifting consumer preferences, the adoption of electric and heat pump water heaters is accelerating at an unprecedented pace. This shift is not merely a trend but a structural realignment of the energy landscape, creating compelling long-term opportunities for investors in manufacturers, suppliers, and the broader clean energy ecosystem.

Regulatory Tailwinds: Policy as a Catalyst for Growth

Federal and state-level incentives have become the cornerstone of this transition. The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) has supercharged adoption through tax credits and rebates, with the Energy Efficient Home Improvement Credit offering up to $2,000 for heat pump water heaters (HPWHs) and the Residential Clean Energy Credit providing 30% tax credits for solar and geothermal systems. These incentives are complemented by state programs like Michigan's MiHER initiative, which offers rebates of up to $840 per unit.

The impact is measurable: HPWH adoption rates have surged in states with robust programs, such as Maine and California, where streamlined eligibility and direct discounts have reduced barriers to entry. By 2025, these policies are projected to cut the effective cost of electrification by 40–60%, making HPWHs competitive with traditional gas systems.

Technological Innovation: Efficiency and Integration

At the heart of this shift is the rapid advancement of heat pump technology. Modern HPWHs now achieve energy efficiency ratios (EER) of 3.0–4.0, reducing energy consumption by up to 60% compared to conventional electric models. Innovations like AI-driven maintenance alerts, IoT-enabled smart controls, and hybrid systems that integrate with solar panels are further enhancing value propositions.

For example, A.O. Smith's smart water heaters and Rheem's ultra-high-efficiency models exemplify how manufacturers are leveraging digital tools to optimize performance and user experience. These technologies not only lower operational costs but also align with the growing demand for smart home integration, a market segment projected to grow at 12% annually through 2030.

Market Dynamics: Growth Projections and Competitive Landscape

The U.S. electric water heating market is forecasted to expand from $5.1 billion in 2024 to $7.8 billion by 2033, with a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 5.5%. Heat pump water heaters, in particular, are expected to grow at a 7% CAGR, outpacing traditional models. This growth is fueled by stringent energy efficiency standards, rising electricity costs, and the phase-out of less efficient units.

Leading manufacturers like A.O. Smith, Rheem, and Bradford White dominate the market, collectively holding 30% of the global commercial segment. These firms are investing heavily in R&D and strategic partnerships. A.O. Smith's collaboration with renewable energy providers and Rheem's focus on hybrid systems highlight their adaptability to the clean energy transition. Meanwhile, international players like Haier and Midea are expanding their U.S. presence through localized product development and partnerships.

Supply Chain Opportunities: Beyond the Big Names

While leading manufacturers capture headlines, the supply chain offers equally compelling opportunities. Component manufacturers producing advanced insulation materials, smart sensors, and heat pump compressors are poised for growth. For instance, companies supplying high-efficiency compressors for HPWHs could benefit from the sector's expansion.

Recent tariffs on imports from China and Vietnam have also spurred domestic production, creating a tailwind for U.S. suppliers. This shift is evident in the rise of regional manufacturing hubs, particularly in the Southwest and Northeast, where proximity to renewable energy infrastructure and skilled labor pools is a strategic advantage.

Investment Thesis: A Multi-Faceted Opportunity

The electrification of water heating is a multi-decade transition with clear beneficiaries:

1. Manufacturers: A.O. Smith, Rheem, and Bradford White are well-positioned to capitalize on demand for high-efficiency systems. Their R&D pipelines and strategic partnerships align with long-term regulatory and consumer trends.

2. Suppliers: Component makers in the heat pump and smart grid sectors offer diversification and resilience.

3. Utilities and Energy Providers: The integration of HPWHs with renewable energy systems creates synergies for companies like NextEra Energy and Duke Energy.

Risks and Mitigations

Challenges remain, including uneven adoption rates in rural areas and the need for workforce training. However, programs like Efficiency Maine's contractor certification initiatives and the IRA's focus on equity are addressing these gaps. Investors should also monitor policy continuity, as future administrations may adjust incentives.

Conclusion: A Structural Shift with Long-Term Payoffs

The electrification of water heating is a linchpin of the U.S. clean energy transition. With regulatory support, technological innovation, and robust market growth, this sector offers a compelling investment case. For those seeking exposure to the energy transition, a diversified portfolio of manufacturers, suppliers, and utilities is a strategic bet on a future where efficiency and sustainability are non-negotiable.

UCNTau collaboration validates past results, techniques for future experiments

Incorporated into every aspect of everyday life, the neutron is a fundamental particle of nature. Now, a research collaboration led by Los Alamos National Laboratory has improved the precision of free neutron lifetime measurements. The team’s results highlight the success of the UCNTau experiment’s design and previews the effectiveness of new techniques and approaches that the team is incorporating into the next generation of the experiment.

“The precise lifetime of free neutrons is at the center of still-contested physics questions,” said Steven Clayton, physicist at Los Alamos. “Understanding the neutron lifetime can be used to test the nature of the weak force, one of the fundamental forces of the universe, and can also help search for physics beyond the Standard Model. Our results here validate the UCNtau experimental approach and point the way toward design improvements that will further enhance our understanding of the physics involved.”

The team’s new analysis, described in Physical Review C, incorporates three more years of data collection from the experiment at the Ultracold Neutron Facility at the Los Alamos Neutron Science Center, with accuracy bolstered by improvements in the systematic design of the experiment. The results update the understanding of the neutron’s lifetime to 877.83 seconds, with uncertainty reduced to under 0.3 seconds.

Bathtub design delivers consistent results

The UCNtau experimental apparatus — UCN stands for “ultracold neutrons” and tau is the symbol for a particle lifetime — works as a magneto-gravitational trap, resembling a bathtub whose concave surface is covered in magnets and open at the top. A variation of a “bottle” trap, the UCNtau experiment stands in contrast to the “beam” approach employed by some neutron lifetime experiments. The approaches have resulted in different measurements of the neutron lifetime, with the “neutron lifetime puzzle” dividing the physics community around the possibility that a flaw in either of the experimental approaches may explain the discrepancy.

The UCNtau bathtub is filled with ultracold neutrons slowed down cryogenically so they can be counted when they interact with a detector lowered into the bathtub. To prevent neutron loss, magnets on the interior surfaces prevent neutrons from leaking through the surface, and gravity keeps the neutrons from spilling over the high tub walls. Neutrons are counted when a zinc-sulfide detector coated with boron-10 descends into the bathtub; the neutrons are absorbed by the boron-10 coating on the zinc-sulfide detector and the excess energy causes the boron-10 nucleus to break apart, with a fragment pinging on the zinc-sulfide and producing a detectable — and countable — display of light.

To fine tune accuracy, the UCNTau team updated the apparatus every year as it took data, including improving monitoring of how many neutrons are initially loaded into the trap and the accuracy of counting surviving neutrons in the trap after being held for some time. The consistency of the recent data with the team’s earlier results validates the experiment’s design. Averaging the results from the five years of total run, the team arrived at the new measurement of 877.83 seconds. That figure includes an error estimate of less than 0.3 seconds.

“The results represent the most precise measurement of the neutron lifetime to date,” Clayton said. “Our goals have been to better understand and quantify systematic uncertainties in the experiment and to improve the lifetime statistical precision. With this level of precision, we’ve taken the current design as far as it can go.”

UCNTau+ represents next generation of experiment

For its next run of data, the research team has turned its attention to significantly increasing the capacity of the experimental apparatus — an iteration of the experiment the team is calling “UCNTau+.” The team is modifying the method of filling the trap to increase the density of ultracold neutrons by a factor of between 5 and 10 while also improving the detector system to reduce the largest systematic uncertainty by a factor of 10 — to a goal overall uncertainty of 0.1 seconds.

The team is ensuring counting accuracy by developing a new UCN detector with a scintillator based on a perovskite material that can be made to provide similar light output but without the long fluorescence trail found with the current scintillator. At the center of the effort to deliver more neutron density is a newly installed “elevator” that loads neutrons into the bathtub, swinging forward and down into the trap. Fabricated from copper and Teflon, useful for reflecting neutrons to prevent leakage through the metal, the elevator can deliver a larger load of neutrons down into the trap. The elevator was designed and fabricated in collaboration with the University of Illinois Champaign-Urbana.

“The elevator itself was challenging to design and execute because it has to form a seal as it backs up, and we needed any gaps to be reasonable,” said Maninder Singh, Los Alamos postdoctoral researcher on the UCNTau team. “Elevator transport has been done before but not at this scale, and not with this geometry, where the elevator is to move other than straight up and down. Implementing this technique has been an exciting challenge.”

The team hopes to bring UCNTau+ online this summer to begin taking data.

According to recent posts on X from Tesla North America and echoed by CEO Elon Musk, the credit requires not just placing an order but actually taking delivery of the vehicle by the end date. This nuance has sparked widespread urgency, with Musk emphasizing the “important re timing of vehicle delivery” in a quote of the company’s alert, highlighting that mere ordering won’t suffice amid potential supply chain and regulatory hurdles.

Industry analysts note this deadline stems from the Inflation Reduction Act, set to phase out the full credit after September 30, as detailed on the Internal Revenue Service website. Tesla’s own support page warns that the company cannot guarantee delivery timelines, advising buyers to consult tax professionals, underscoring the personal financial risks involved.

The Rush to Delivery: Navigating Tesla’s Supply Chain Challenges

Recent news reports indicate a buying frenzy, with EV sales spiking as consumers race against the clock. A Gizmodo article published just hours ago describes it as “The Great American EV Tax Credit Rush,” noting Tesla’s outsized benefits from the scramble, with order volumes reportedly overwhelming some service centers. Similarly, Autocar Professional reported 17 hours ago on surging U.S. EV sales driven by the impending cutoff, attributing the boom to fears of losing the subsidy under potential policy shifts.

Tesla’s inventory tools, as promoted in X posts from Tesla North America, direct buyers to vehicles available for immediate delivery, a strategy reminiscent of past end-of-quarter pushes. Historical tweets from Musk, dating back to 2018 and 2019, show a pattern of urgent calls to action around tax credit phase-outs, often tying them to year-end deliveries or display model discounts.

Eligibility Hurdles and Model-Specific Insights

Not all Tesla models qualify uniformly; the credit applies to vehicles like the Model 3, Model Y, and certain variants of the Model X, provided they meet U.S. manufacturing and battery sourcing requirements outlined in the Inflation Reduction Act. Kiplinger’s recent guide on EV tax credits, updated July 11, 2025, breaks down income limits—$150,000 for single filers and $300,000 for joint—which could disqualify higher earners, adding another layer of complexity.

Financing plays a pivotal role, with tips from EV Life’s blog post on July 7, 2025, suggesting buyers explore point-of-sale rebates to apply the credit upfront, potentially easing cash flow. However, Tesla’s disclaimer on its incentives page stresses that eligibility hinges on individual tax situations, and changes could arise from federal updates.

Market Implications: Broader EV Industry Fallout

The deadline’s approach has broader repercussions, as CNBC reported two days ago on EV sales soaring amid speculation of policy reversals under a potential Trump administration influence. Tekedia’s analysis from a day ago attributes the surge to legislative backing, warning that post-September, affordability could plummet for middle-class buyers, pressuring Tesla’s pricing strategy.

Insiders point to Tesla’s production ramps in Fremont and Austin as critical, yet supply bottlenecks—exacerbated by global chip shortages and labor issues—could leave some orders unfulfilled. X sentiment reflects frustration, with users sharing stories of delayed deliveries, echoing Musk’s unrelated but timely post on Full Self-Driving advancements, which might indirectly boost appeal for hurried purchases.

Strategic Advice for Buyers and Tesla’s Long Game

For prospective owners, acting swiftly means monitoring Tesla’s app for real-time inventory and considering used models eligible for a $4,000 credit, also expiring soon, per IRS guidelines. Yahoo Finance’s piece from a month ago outlines qualification steps, urging documentation readiness to claim the credit on 2025 tax returns.

Looking ahead, Tesla may pivot to alternative incentives, like software upgrades or leasing deals, to maintain momentum.

Washington’s Clean Energy Transformation Act mandates the end of coal-fired electricity production, or even its import from other states, by the end of this year.
Ferguson should commit to a holistic state strategy across all agencies to prioritize renewable energy projects, particularly those in jeopardy because of Congress’ actions.","Higher energy bills are coming to Washington state, thanks to Congress passing President Donald Trump’s “One Big Beautiful Bill Act,” or HR 1, which he signed on July 4. But if Gov. Bob Ferguson and state agencies can streamline the regulatory process for building wind and solar power projects, the state can spare consumers some of those ballooning electricity costs.

The federal bill is killing subsidies for wind and solar power generation, with nearly $9 billion across 27 clean energy facilities around the state at risk according to the think tank Energy Innovation. That’s real money that will make those clean energy projects cost more, and, in some cases, stop them altogether, eliminating critical new megawatts from the grid as well as jeopardizing the workforce able to build them.

The subsidies were created by the Democrats’ Inflation Reduction Act during the Biden administration. At Trump’s urging, Republicans voted to sunset them. Projects not under construction by July 4, 2026, nor those completed by the end of 2027, won’t be able to claim a 30% tax credit.

Under Washington state’s clean energy transformation laws, utilities will still pay to build those power sources — but they will be more expensive because HR 1 craters those subsidies. Utilities around the state will have no choice but to pass on those costs to ratepayers. In condemning the legislation, Ferguson announced in July the U.S. Climate Alliance expects Washingtonians’ average household energy bills could increase by $115 a year by 2029.

That is, unless more solar and wind projects can meet the sunsetting deadlines. Commerce Director Joe Nguyễn, whose agency plays a key role ensuring the state can achieve its clean energy goals, told the editorial board it’s incumbent on state agencies to “move heaven and earth” and ensure Washington state government isn’t the barrier that keeps a project from getting over the finish line.

Washington’s Clean Energy Transformation Act mandates the end of coal-fired electricity production, or even its import from other states, by the end of this year. Less supply on the grid, coupled with rapid new demand for electricity, is already a recipe for upward pressure on utility bills.

Ferguson should commit to a holistic state strategy across all agencies to prioritize renewable energy projects, particularly those in jeopardy because of Congress’ actions. Nguyễn said the governor is considering such a strategy.

For inspiration, Washington could follow Colorado Gov. Jared Polis’ example. Earlier this month, he mobilized his state to “eliminate administrative barriers and bottlenecks” for such projects to get as many under construction as possible.

“Getting this right is of critical importance to Colorado ratepayers,” Polis said in an order to state agencies. “By maximizing the utilization of tax credits while they’re available and reducing future tariff uncertainty, the State can avoid billions of dollars in additional energy costs for decades to come.”

Clean energy projects, as well as upgrades to high-voltage transmission lines, proceed in Washington at a snail’s pace under environmental reviews, a cumbersome permitting-and-siting process and local opposition from neighbors.

Nguyễn believes Washington’s abundant sun and wind can amply gird Washington’s electric grid.

“The limitations that we have are not technical. They’re bureaucracy. It’s red tape, it’s regulation … those things we impose on ourselves,” Nguyễn told Austin Jenkins on Inside Olympia in April.

In the long run, the Legislature can help, too, in moving faster on needed grid-enhancing projects. An example can be found within a state bill, proposed this year by Sen. Sharon Shewmake, D-Bellingham, to exempt upgrading transmission lines, the highways of electricity across the state, from some environmental reviews. The bill did not survive this year’s legislative session but shows lawmakers can, and should, seek ways to ease regulatory burdens in building critical clean energy infrastructure while still maintaining environmental safeguards.

Meanwhile, the state continues to give tax subsidies to data centers that increasingly feast on the grid’s electrons. The editorial board believes that policy should get another look when the Legislature reconvenes in January.

One silver lining: The federal bill kept in place subsidies for other new electricity generation technologies. Trouble is those methods have yet to mature and aren’t helpful today. Building small modular nuclear reactors, digging deep to tap geothermal energy and other sources are still likely a decade from deployment on the grid.

Trump and Congress, through elimination of the tax credits, are signaling to the investors and producers of wind and solar a more difficult path lies ahead. It’s up to Ferguson and state leaders to counter that signal and remind them Washington state is, and will continue to be, a leader in building out a clean energy economy.",https://images.seattletimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/08082025_tzr_tzr_122405.jpg?d=1200x630,N,,2025-08-10 16:00:15.230413

Panasonic Holdings Corp.’s newest battery plant in the US is on track to reach full production by later this year, a senior executive said, easing concern about the Japanese electronics maker’s commitment to supplying Tesla Inc. and other electric vehicle makers.

“We’re going to be full production this year,” Megan Myungwon Lee, the company’s head of North American operations, said in a Bloomberg TV interview on Monday.

Her comments come after Japan’s Nikkei reported last week that Panasonic planned to delay bringing production at the Kansas facility up to full capacity.

“When we commit to something, we’re fully committed and we want to make sure we support all the customers,” she said. “We’re not feeling the slowdown yet and we’re very bullish.”

Tesla, Panasonic’s biggest battery cell customer in the US, reported a 13% drop in US sales for the second quarter compared with a year ago as demand for its EVs weakened.

The new factory will ship battery cells to Tesla as well as several other EV makers, including Lucid Group Inc. and Hexagon Purus ASA.

“We’re definitely working with Tesla but we want to work with other established OEMs as well as startups,” Lee said, adding that Panasonic’s partnership with Tesla is “very strong.”

Lee spoke at a ceremony commemorating the grand opening of Panasonic’s second battery factory in the US, located in De Soto, Kansas, near Kansas City. While the facility is online and battery cells are being made, construction is still ongoing. At completion, the plant will have about 32 gigawatt-hours of annual capacity — enough to supply cells for 500,000 EVs.

The company also operates a battery manufacturing factory in Nevada, which has supplied Tesla since 2017.

The factory in Thoothukudi will initially make 50,000 electric vehicles annually, with room to triple output to 150,000 cars. Given its proximity to a major port in one of India's most industrialized states, VinFast hopes it will be a hub for future exports to the region. It says the factory will create more than 3,000 local jobs.

The Vietnamese company says it scouted 15 locations across six Indian states before choosing Tamil Nadu. It's the center of India's auto industry, with strong manufacturing, skilled workers, good infrastructure, and a reliable supply chain, according to Tamil Nadu's Industries Minister T.R.B. Raaja.

""This investment will lead to an entirely new industrial cluster in south Tamil Nadu, and more clusters is what India needs to emerge as a global manufacturing hub,"" he said.

VinFast Asia CEO Pham Sanh Chau said the company has aspirations to export cars across the region and it hopes to turn the new factory into an export hub.

The new factory could also mark the start of an effort to bring other parts of the Vingroup empire to India. The sprawling conglomerate, founded by Vietnam's richest man Pham Nhat Vuong, began as an instant noodle company in Ukraine in the 1990s and now spans real estate, hospitals, schools and more.

Chau said Tamil Nadu Chief Minister M.K. Stalin had invited the company to ""invest in a big way"" across sectors like green energy, smart cities and tourism, and said that the chief minister had ""promised he will do all what is necessary for us to move the whole ecosystem here.""

VinFast's foray into India reflects a broader shift in strategy.

The company increasingly is focusing on Asian markets after struggling to gain traction in the U.S. and Europe. It broke ground last year on a $200 million EV assembly plant in Indonesia, where it plans to make 50,000 cars annually. It's also expanding in Thailand and the Philippines.

VinFast sold nearly 97,000 vehicles in 2024. That's triple what it sold the year before, but only about 10% of those sales were outside Vietnam. As it eyes markets in Asia, it hopes the factory in India will be a base for exports to South Asian countries like Nepal and Sri Lanka and also to countries in the Middle East and Africa.

India is the world's third-largest car market by number of vehicles sold. It presents an enticing mix: A fast growing economy, rising adoption of EVs, supportive government policies and a rare market where players have yet to completely dominate EV sales.

""It is a market that no automaker in the world can ignore,"" said Ishan Raghav, managing editor of the Indian car magazine autoX.

EV growth in India has been led by two- and three-wheelers that accounted for 86% of the over six million EVs sold last year.

Sales of four-wheel passenger EVs made up only 2.5% of all car sales in India last year, but they have been surging, jumping to more than 110,000 in 2024 from just 1,841 in 2019. The government aims to have EVs account for a third of all passenger vehicle sales by 2030.

""The electric car story has started (in India) only three or four years ago,"" said Charith Konda, an energy specialist who looks at India's transport and clean energy sectors for the think tank Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis or IEEFA. New cars that ""look great on the road,"" with better batteries, quick charging and longer driving ranges are driving the sector's rapid growth, he said.

The shift to EVs is mostly powered by Indian automakers, but VinFast plans to break into the market later this year with its VF6 and VF7 SUV models, which are designed for India.

The company chose the VF7 for its India launch -- unlike the models introduced in the U.S., Canada, the EU, or Southeast Asia -- to position itself as a premium global brand while keeping the price affordable, added Chau, the VinFast Asia CEO.

Chinese EV brands that dominate in countries like Thailand and Brazil have found India more challenging.

After border clashes with China in 2020, India blocked companies like BYD from building their own factories. Some then turned to partnerships. China's SAIC, owner of MG Motor, has joined with India's JSW Group. Their MG Windsor, a five-seater, sold 30,000 units in just nine months, nibbling Tata Motors' 70% EV market share down to about 50%.

Tata was the first local automaker to court mass-market consumers with EVs. Its 2020 launch of the electric Nexon, a small SUV, became India's first major EV car success.

VinFast lacks the geopolitical baggage of its larger Chinese rivals and will also benefit from incentives like lower land prices and tax breaks for building locally in India. That's part of India's policy of discouraging imports with high import duties to help encourage local manufacturing and create more jobs.

The push for onshore manufacturing is a concern also for Tesla, which launched its Model Y in India last month at a price of nearly $80,000, compared to about $44,990 in the U.S without a federal tax credit.

""India's stand is very clear. We do not want to import manufactured cars, even Teslas. Whether it's Tesla or Chinese cars, they are taxed heavily,"" added Konda.

The road ahead remains daunting. India's EV market is crowded with well-entrenched players like Tata Motors and Mahindra, which dominate the more affordable segment, while Hyundai, MG Motors and luxury brands like Mercedes-Benz and Audi compete at high price points.

Indians tend to purchase EVs as second cars used for driving within the city, since the infrastructure for charging elsewhere can be undependable. VinFast will need to win over India's cost-sensitive and conservative drivers with a reputation for quality batteries and services while keeping prices low, said Vivek Gulia, co-founder of JMK Research.

""Initially, people will be apprehensive,"" he said.

VinFast says it plans to set up showrooms and service centers across India, working with local companies for charging and repairs, and cutting costs by recycling batteries and making key parts like powertrains and battery packs in the country.

Chau added that after a customer clinic in September and input from top engineers in Vietnam, the company upgraded its feature list to better match Indian customer expectations.

Scale will be key. VinFast has signed agreements to establish 32 dealerships across 27 Indian cities. Hyundai has 1,300 places for Indians to buy their cars. Building a brand in India takes time -- Hyundai, for instance, pulled it off over decades, helped by an early endorsement from Bollywood superstar Shah Rukh Khan.

VinFast can succeed if it can get its pricing right and earn the trust of customers, Gulia said. ""Then they can actually do really good.""",https://wehco.media.clients.ellingtoncms.com/imports/adg/photos/210770375_210762871-21fad157020c4f0cb3ee2208205c779f_t1200.jpg?57a0c2296240c280e9492005c3cad63e7cbe80f4,N,,2025-08-10 22:00:01.172869

Researchers at Oak Ridge National Laboratory have pioneered a method that combines these technologies to produce critical parts in days rather than weeks, potentially accelerating the deployment of new nuclear facilities. This development, highlighted in a recent article from Tom’s Hardware, underscores a shift toward faster, more efficient manufacturing processes that could address longstanding delays in nuclear projects.

The Hermes Low-Power Demonstration Reactor serves as a prime example, where AI algorithms optimize designs for 3D printing, ensuring components withstand extreme conditions like high radiation and temperatures. By leveraging additive manufacturing, engineers can create complex geometries that traditional methods struggle with, reducing material waste and costs. According to reports from Oak Ridge National Laboratory, this approach not only speeds up production but also integrates real-time data analytics to refine builds on the fly.

Accelerating Innovation in Nuclear Builds

Beyond speed, the integration of AI brings predictive capabilities to the forefront. Machine learning models analyze vast datasets from simulations and historical builds to foresee potential flaws, allowing for preemptive adjustments. This is particularly vital for small modular reactors (SMRs), which promise modular assembly and scalability. A post on X from the Nuclear Business Platform emphasized how 3D printing could enable precision-engineered parts with minimal waste, especially for SMRs, signaling a massive impact on future energy infrastructure.

Industry pioneers are hailing this as a “new era of nuclear construction,” as noted in coverage by Yahoo Tech. The U.S. Department of Energy’s Manufacturing Demonstration Facility at Oak Ridge is actively scaling up these techniques, anticipating a boom in nuclear energy demand. Recent demonstrations show that 3D-printed components meet rigorous standards, with Oak Ridge Lab sharing on X that their researchers have validated these parts for real-world nuclear applications.

Navigating the Safety Tightrope

Yet, amid the enthusiasm, safety concerns loom large. The nuclear sector’s zero-tolerance for errors means that any innovation must undergo exhaustive scrutiny. Critics worry that rapid prototyping via 3D printing might introduce microscopic defects undetectable by conventional inspections, potentially compromising reactor integrity over time. A detailed analysis in TechRadar questions whether this “new era” prioritizes speed over safety, urging close regulatory oversight at every step.

AI’s role adds another layer of complexity. While it enhances design accuracy, reliance on algorithms raises questions about data quality and bias. If training data overlooks rare failure modes, the results could be catastrophic. Insights from Power Technology highlight how Oak Ridge’s Transformational Challenge Reactor Program uses AI for 21st-century nuclear advancements, but stresses the need for robust verification methods to confirm component reliability.

Regulatory and Industry Responses

Regulators are responding cautiously. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission is developing frameworks to certify 3D-printed parts, drawing on lessons from aerospace where similar technologies have been vetted. Experts like those at the UK Atomic Energy Authority, as reported in World Nuclear News, are exploring additive manufacturing for fusion components, emphasizing complementary methods to ensure structural integrity.

Industry insiders point to successful pilots as evidence of viability. For instance, a 3D-printed nuclear reactor core, first conceptualized in 2020 and discussed in multiple WIRED posts on X, is set to come online, marking a milestone. Recent X updates from Tom’s Hardware reinforce that 3D printing is pivotal for nuclear progress, with pioneers slashing construction times dramatically.

Balancing Benefits and Risks

The economic incentives are compelling: faster builds could lower the astronomical costs of nuclear plants, making clean energy more accessible. A New Atlas article details how 3D printing revolutionizes plant construction by anticipating energy booms, while integrating sustainable materials as noted in Complete AI Training.

However, safety advocates call for interdisciplinary collaboration. Combining AI-driven simulations with physical testing could mitigate risks, ensuring that innovations don’t outpace safeguards. As Efosa from TechRadar warns, while these tools offer powerful benefits, caution is essential to prevent oversights in this high-risk field.

Looking Ahead to a Transformed Sector

Looking forward, the synergy of 3D printing and AI could democratize nuclear technology, enabling rapid prototyping for custom solutions in remote or disaster-prone areas. Yet, ongoing research must address material durability under prolonged exposure, with labs like Oak Ridge leading efforts to scale safely.

Ultimately, this technological convergence promises to revitalize nuclear energy, but only if balanced with unwavering commitment to safety. As the industry navigates these advancements, the lessons learned will shape not just reactors, but the future of global energy security.",https://www.webpronews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/xai-tmp-imgen-1550c18b-cb38-476f-b74d-86967a2b8ca8.jpeg,N,,2025-08-10 15:06:09.481911

The data center industry is expected to contribute $9.1 billion in gross domestic product to Virginia’s economy annually.
That’s a prospect that’s hard to ignore for counties with Big Tech knocking on their doors.
“Enough is enough,” said Loudoun County Vice Chair Michael Turner, also a Democrat, who is largely opposing new data centers.
“Both our political parties have been completely captured by Big Tech and are doing the bidding of Big Tech in every way imaginable,” he said.","That debate is inching up the ballot as state lawmakers race to regulate a nascent industry, governors rush to embrace a new economic boon and Big Tech makes major investments in AI growth.

Even as data centers are ready to explode on the national scene, the politics around them don’t cut neatly across party lines. The sites sit at the intersection of a typically partisan divide between pro-business interests and organized labor. Efforts to regulate data centers in Virginia’s Legislature have drawn bipartisan backing, though they’ve been largely unsuccessful because of concerns about local control and excessive bureaucracy. And some Democratic officials appear as eager as their Republican counterparts to attract data centers to help bolster their states’ economies.

“Every governor — Democrat or Republican — is going to want economic development. I think the question is always at what cost — and that’s where you see some of the political rubber meeting the road in terms of cost of energy bills, whether Big Tech’s paying its fair share,” Virginia-based Democratic strategist Jared Leopold said.

But, he added, “it is so nascent that there isn’t a standard Democratic-versus-Republican playbook for dealing with data centers yet.”

Tech companies like Amazon and Microsoft are counting on data centers to power their AI expansions — and the U.S. already has more of these facilities than any other country. President Donald Trump has vowed to “win the AI race,” moving to implement a Biden-era executive order to build the facilities on federal lands and announcing a $500 billion AI and data center sprint with large tech companies known as Stargate, with a site underway in Texas.

But the surge is proving polarizing, particularly in northern Virginia — considered the tip of the spear on this issue with the world’s largest and fastest-growing data center market. The Energy Department is projecting data centers will require up to nearly three times as much energy by 2028, raising fears that the tech sector will turn to polluting sources like coal and natural gas in their rush for power.

The data center industry is expected to contribute $9.1 billion in gross domestic product to Virginia’s economy annually.

In Loudoun County, Virginia, that has meant a $250 million budget surplus and a property tax cut. That’s a prospect that’s hard to ignore for counties with Big Tech knocking on their doors.

“We don’t know where to put the money,” said Democrat Juli Briskman, who sits on the county board of supervisors.

But the typical residential ratepayer in that state could experience a $14 to $37 monthly electric bill increase by 2040, according to a report from Virginia’s Joint Legislative Audit and Review Commission, in part because of the need for infrastructure upgrades whose costs could be spread to all customers.

“Enough is enough,” said Loudoun County Vice Chair Michael Turner, also a Democrat, who is largely opposing new data centers. “The next election for supervisor will hinge on data centers,” adding that two weeks don’t go by where he doesn’t hear from other county officials around the country looking for advice.

In Arizona, Tucson’s city council just unanimously voted against a massive data center proposal from Amazon that promised jobs and millions in tax revenue but stoked fears about its water and energy consumption.

In other cases, public officials of both parties are rushing to capitalize on the promises of AI — and the tax dollars it can bring in.

John Chambers, a spokesperson for Rep. Mike Carey (R-Ohio), said in a statement he attributes the Columbus area’s growth to “tech jobs and data centers that will help America win the AI innovation race” and that he supports “an all-of-the-above energy strategy to ensure electricity is affordable and available for families and businesses in the region.”

Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker, who’s seeking a third term as governor and is considered a potential Democratic presidential contender in 2028, is looking to lure data centers to his state so as not to miss out on the boom.

And down south, De’Keither Stamps, a Democratic member of Mississippi’s Public Services Commission, said data centers could bring positive economic development and the opportunity to finance needed electrical system upgrades “if regulated prudently.”

Not everyone is on board. Ben Inskeep, program director at Indiana-based Citizens Action Coalition, a consumer and environmental advocacy group, sees the issue is up for grabs and at an inflection point as grassroots opposition takes shape.

“Both our political parties have been completely captured by Big Tech and are doing the bidding of Big Tech in every way imaginable,” he said. “This does have all the hallmarks of an issue that could create new, interesting political coalitions.”

In the Virginia Legislature, efforts to put guardrails around the rapid expansion of data centers — such as assessing who’s footing the energy bills for them — drew bipartisan support even as they failed. Youngkin, the Republican governor, vetoed a bipartisan bill that would have required data-center applications complete site assessments because he said he didn’t want to create “unnecessary red tape.”

Still, “It’s less partisan than most issues. It’s more geographic,” said Virginia state Del. Ian Lovejoy, a Republican from Prince William County who unsuccessfully pushed a bill last session to put land buffers between data centers and parks, schools and residential areas.

“So if you’re in an area that is negatively affected by them, then it crosses party lines. And if you’re not in an area that’s really affected by them, neither party really cares that much, because broadly speaking, on the right side of the aisle you have the pro-business desire to build, and on the left side of the aisle, you have the labor movement, where unions really like these data centers because it’s jobs.”

Now, Lovejoy expects state Democrats to loosen fossil fuel restrictions baked into the state’s Clean Economy Act in response to the energy crunch.

Industry efforts to advance data centers have also been targeted at both parties. The nearly quarter of a million dollars the Data Center Coalition has poured into state legislative campaigns in Virginia have been split across the aisle. The group has spent nearly the same amount on federal lobbying and is active in states like California, where it spent $50,000 so far this year. Other players in the sector are targeting northern Virginia officials, too.

“Data centers enjoy bipartisan support across states, but we have also heard our fair share of bipartisan concerns across states,” said Dan Diorio, vice president of state policy at the Data Center Coalition, an industry group. “We are very much an engaged stakeholder in all the states in which our members are active in to work on policies with lawmakers of both sides of the aisle to ensure that states continue to see the economic benefits of data centers while also addressing their priorities.”

As data centers move up the ballot as a campaign issue, the complications for candidates in both parties are playing out in real time. Democrats who are watching their party nationally hemorrhage voters over the economy are scrambling to strike a balance between adding jobs and revenue while stopping energy costs from skyrocketing. And in some cases, Republicans whose party leaders are cracking down on renewable energy are calling for “all of the above” approaches to energy production to keep power prices down — providing tacit backing to a sector Trump is trying to crush even as they follow the president in promoting fossil fuels.

That dynamic is on clear display in Virginia’s gubernatorial race, where data-center regulation has emerged as a focal point. Former Rep. Abigail Spanberger, Democrats’ nominee, is proposing a “statewide strategy” for data centers that calls for boosting local and renewable energy production and charging Big Tech companies to offset rising energy costs for consumers.

“Virginia can benefit from having data centers here — but to reap those benefits, we need to make sure we are accounting and planning for the energy generation, water, and other resources needed to support them,” Spanberger said in a statement.

Her Republican opponent, Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears, wants to open the state to “all kinds of energy” and to reduce red tape around power projects to help meet increasing demand. Earle-Sears’ campaign did not respond to a request for comment.

Rising power prices, which could spike further as more energy-demanding data centers come online, are already roiling politics across the midwest and mid-Atlantic as Democratic governors and candidates blame grid manager PJM for consumers’ higher bills and New Jersey’s gubernatorial candidates clash over how to bring those costs down.

The debate has the potential to spill into next year’s broader slate of gubernatorial contests, with several of those governors — including Pritzker, Pennsylvania’s Josh Shapiro and Maryland’s Wes Moore — up for reelection and Democrats eager to prove they understand voters’ cost-of-living concerns.

The issues surrounding data centers are bleeding into federal politics, too, though ultimately decisions around zoning and electric rates will largely remain in state and local control. Congressional Republicans had pushed a 10-year moratorium on state-level AI regulations — including those around data center permitting — as part of their “big, beautiful” domestic policy bill, though the effort fell apart in the Senate. At the same time, they voted to roll back credits for clean-energy projects from Democrats’ 2022 climate law that could help offset rising energy demand.

“The federal government is going to have to take this on,” said Virginia state Sen. Russet Perry, a Democrat who has spearheaded data center regulatory efforts in her legislature. “In the interim, the state is going to be at the forefront for dealing with it, and it’s going to be bipartisan.”",https://www.politico.com/dims4/default/resize/1200/quality/90/format/jpg?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.politico.com%2Ffc%2Fa0%2Ff976eca94f1aa78d9b6a6ed6624b%2Fhttps-delivery-gettyimages.com%2Fdownloads%2F2161850979,N,,2025-08-10 15:06:17.137927

Not only was this wind turbine project renewable, but it was also extremely big and powerful, and would be the driving force behind Rivian’s new R1 EVs, making their first charge green.
The never-before-seen wind turbine project Rivian partnered with the Virginia-based renewable energy company for its wind turbine project.
According to Rivian, this wind turbine has a 2.8 MW capacity and can supply almost 10 million kWh of power annually.
Who knows, soon other wind turbine projects such as this one may follow suit.","This American automaker has undergone quite a few transitions over the past few years, but since 2011, its vision has become crystal clear. The company has set its sights on playing a major role in the Climate Pledge to achieve zero carbon emissions by 2040, and plans on achieving it with the 10,000,000 kWh from a megascale wind turbine. The entire setup is something that has never been seen before.

The renewable driving force behind these vehicles

The American automaker Rivian was founded in Florida as Mainstream Motors. After rebranding, it became known as Avera Motors and eventually Rivian. In 2011, Rivian set its sights on electric vehicles (EVs), such as trucks and SUVs. The company set a long-term renewable energy vision, which entailed the manufacturing of high-impact projects to decrease its carbon footprint and simultaneously aid communities, customers, and the power grid.

At the beginning of 2022, the company installed a 783 kW solar canopy at its shipping charging area. Later that year, the company announced its plans to install a large-scale wind turbine at its production site, which formed part of its long-term renewable energy vision. Not only was this wind turbine project renewable, but it was also extremely big and powerful, and would be the driving force behind Rivian’s new R1 EVs, making their first charge green.

The never-before-seen wind turbine project

Rivian partnered with the Virginia-based renewable energy company for its wind turbine project. The turbine, once constructed, was less than 510 feet in length. It’s white and has non-reflective blades, and it was installed on the east side of the company’s production site, inside the vehicle test track. According to Rivian, this wind turbine has a 2.8 MW capacity and can supply almost 10 million kWh of power annually. That is enough to charge 150,000 EVs annually.

“To us, our job isn’t done when our vehicles come off the line. While we’re working hard to help electrify transportation, we’re also pushing to accelerate the shift to carbon-free electricity for all. This wind turbine is an early step on that path, and it’s also a beacon of our vision for a clean energy future.” – Andrew Peterman, Rivian Director of Renewable Energy

This entire project also aligns with the automaker’s game plan of installing renewable resources in regions in the country with the highest need. The company also agreed to the Climate Pledge to reach net-zero carbon emissions by 2040, 10 years ahead of the global zero-carbon mission by 2050.

Advantages beyond power production

Now, many people know that traditional wind turbines come with some disadvantages, which, according to Blue and Green Tomorrow, include but are not limited to:

Visual pollution

Noise pollution

Harmful to the surrounding wildlife

Thankfully, Rivian did its homework and researched the project’s potential impacts due to sound and shadow flicker, and its potential impact on endangered species, communication systems, and cultural resources. These impact studies highlighted the following advantages:

It has low noise pollution, as it produces limited sound with an average of 35 decibels and a maximum of 42 decibels (the same as a refrigerator)

Throughout 25 years, it could diminish 177,000 tons of carbon-equivalent emissions (the same as removing 34,000 internal combustion engine vehicles from the roads for one year)

The fact that the turbine has been installed on the company’s production site means that visual pollution is not a concern, especially considering its length.

It is one thing to implement renewable energy sources into your company, but the responsible construction management and necessary environmental impact studies play a crucial role in ensuring that the entire project remains green. Rivian has proven its dedication to keeping its carbon footprint small and to achieving its goal of adhering to the Climate Pledge. Who knows, soon other wind turbine projects such as this one may follow suit.

Of these 63 vetoes, 37 vetoes were accompanied by alternative solutions proposed by the executive.
Belchior announced that a provisional measure establishing the implementation of the LAE – special environmental licensing—will be signed by President Lula, thus authorizing environmental licensing for “economically strategic” businesses, irrespective of their environmental impact.","President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva has approved, with significant vetoes, Brazil’s new law on environmental licensing. The law—commonly referred to as the “devastation bill”—had been approved by Congress on the 17th of July.

In a press conference held on Friday, August 8, Brazil’s environmental minister, Marina Silva, said the government focused on “strategic” vetoes that would “preserve the integrity of environmental licensing”. Silva added that the government’s vetoes sought balance so that “ecology does not clash with the economy”.

During the press conference, Miriam Belchior, Brazil’s Executive Secretary of the Civil House, added that the government’s vetoes aim to “safeguard the rights of Indigenous and quilombola peoples” and to “incorporate innovations that streamline licensing without compromising quality”.

President Lula vetoed 63 of the almost 400 provisions that were approved by Congress. Of these 63 vetoes, 37 vetoes were accompanied by alternative solutions proposed by the executive.

Lula’s government notably vetoed the provision which extended LAC– license by adhesion and commitment—to projects that fall under medium polluting potential. This would mean licensing would be granted through self-declared online forms, eliminating vital impact studies processes.

The provision which allowed for different licensing requirements and processes for attaining licenses in different states was also vetoed.

President Lula’s government also vetoed the bill’s provision which would diminish the power of consulting political organs responsible for protecting quilombolas and Indigenous rights, like Fundação Palmares and FUNAI.

New rules regarding Indigenous and quilombolas (communities of descendants from black slaves who resisted Brazil’s slavery regime) will be proposed by the government and sent to Congress. The bill’s provision which proposed eliminating special protection for the Atlantic Rainforest—an area which is already degraded with only 24% of its original area remaining—was also vetoed.

Belchior announced that a provisional measure establishing the implementation of the LAE – special environmental licensing—will be signed by President Lula, thus authorizing environmental licensing for “economically strategic” businesses, irrespective of their environmental impact. Such a measure will come into force once it’s published in the Official Gazette of the Union, although Congress must also approve it within 120 days for its continued validity.

The new Environmental Licensing Law with President Lula’s 63 vetoes has been sent to Congress in an emergency regime, and the vetoes will be analysed by Congress in joint sessions between the Chamber of Deputies and the Senate.

At Friday’s press conference ministers stressed that both the provisional measure and the modified bill are intended to serve as “dialogue” with Congress, avoiding “possible judicialization of environmental licensing”.

However, with Congress approving the original bill by a majority, there is still a possibility that the president’s vetoes will be overturned.",https://brazilreports.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/GxtbmLYWoAAYvlt-scaled.jpeg,N,,2025-08-10 15:07:12.114480

The US has devolved from a widely respected global powerhouse into the personal self-dealing tool of a convicted felon with astonishing speed, so it’s no surprise to see the promise of a thriving domestic offshore wind industry kneecapped by the White House. Along with direct job losses from canceled projects, the supply chain fallout will bleed thousands of jobs from more than three dozen states, and that’s not even counting missed opportunities for the concrete industry. Yes, the concrete industry.

Offshore Wind And The Concrete Connection

Conventional offshore wind farms are built in relatively shallow waters, where the turbines can perch on top of tall steel monopiles fixed into the seabed. Back in 2022, the US Department of Energy assessed the potential for using steel-reinforced concrete as a much less expensive alternative for monopile turbine foundations, but concluded that more research into stress and fatigue issues was needed.

New research on North Sea wind farms in the UK indicates that the floating offshore wind field is a more immediate opportunity for the concrete industry. As applied to the US, that includes long swaths of deepwater coastline unsuitable for fixed monopiles, including practically all of the energy-thirsty West Coast as well as Maine on the East Coast (see more floating wind background here).

The new study was produced by the UK offshore wind consultancy group OpenWater Renewables, which focuses on floating platforms. “Concrete foundations could be the best option for developers of floating offshore wind farms in the North Sea,” the firm summarized in a posting on the Technology Leadership Board website.

“The material’s durability, low maintenance requirements, lower capital expenditure (CAPEX) and suitability for UK construction could provide a competitive alternative to steel designs,” they added, while advising that developers are challenged by the wide variety of materials choices.

The study is significant because it is available on an open-source basis. “Whilst private wind farm developers and others have performed similar analyses, their results are generally not available in the public domain,” OpenWater explains.

Sorting Through The Floating Wind Variables

TLB’s membership is frontloaded with oil and gas stakeholders, spearheaded by TotalEnergies and the North Sea Transition Authority in collaboration with other North Sea stakeholders. Still, TLB also reflects the extent to which legacy energy firms are transitioning into renewables.

OpenWater deployed its proprietary ranking software to formulate a roster of economically viable floating wind platform options in the North Sea. Making the shortlist were 15 concepts, including three barges, 11 semi-submersible platforms, and one tension leg platform.

Before you get too excited, none of the concepts has achieved Technology Readiness Level 9. TRL is a standard ranking system ranging from back-of-the-napkin Level 1 on up to a successful record of operation at Level 9. Of the 15 options selected by OpenWater, none reached higher than Level 7, the prototype level.

On the plus side, none of the 15 options ranked lower than 5, which refers to successful component tests in the target environment.

Next Steps For The US Offshore Wind Industry

“Critical factors included installation, CAPEX and operating expenditure, financial strength, and project track record. Technical maturity was also a key factor in assessing the concepts,” OpenWater notes, adding that weather conditions in the North Sea also influenced its choices.

“For North Sea projects, ease of installation and repair were seen as key differentiators due to the short weather windows in which critical work has to be done,” OpenWater observes.

If you caught that thing about “short weather window,” that’s where things get interesting for the US offshore wind industry. The North Sea sits farther up the latitude ladder than the US Pacific coast. All else being equal, a larger weather window would improve the economic outlook for new floating offshore wind farms in Hawaii as well as Washington, Oregon, and California.

Except, not. In yet another in a series of anti-wind measures, on Friday, US Interior Secretary Doug Burgum announced a complete overhaul of his agency’s offshore wind regulations.

“We’re taking a results-driven approach that prioritizes reliability, strengthens national security and upholds both scientific integrity and responsible environmental stewardship,” Burgum said in a press release that also included a reminder that Burgum didn’t mean any of it.

“This effort also supports Executive Order 14315, which directs agencies to identify and eliminate favoritism toward unreliable energy sources,” DOI reminded everyone.

“The Department has paused new approvals for offshore wind projects—including leases, permits, rights-of-way and loans—in compliance with the Presidential Memorandum on wind energy, while it conducts a review of offshore wind energy projects and their impact on the environment, national security and the economy,” they added.

Who Voted For This Guy Anyways?

If you caught that thing about “unreliable,” that’s where everything circles back around to personal self-dealing. As helpfully explained by the Interior Department, the White House has adopted a specious definition of energy security in which domestic energy resources are separated into intermittent availability and non-intermittent. That made sense back in the 20th century when both wind and solar power were just a speck on the horizon. However, “reliability” is a poor measure of energy security in the 21st century environment of new energy storage and grid management technologies.

The reliable/unreliable separation does fulfill one key goal. It helps provide US President Donald Trump with cover to pursue his widely reported and highly personal vendetta against wind turbines, without singling out wind alone as a matter of public policy. The “unreliable” canard leaves the US solar industry twisting in the wind, so to speak, alongside the wind industry, while three other significant domestic renewable energy resources — hydropower, biomass, and geothermal — have been left largely untouched, simply because they fit neatly into the 24/7 baseload power generation silo of Trump’s “American Energy Dominance” plan.

On the other hand, Trump ditched many norms of public policy during his first term in office and his 2024 campaign for another turn around the Oval Office foretold of a more thorough trashing of public resources and systems to come. That has all materialized, in spades. Thanks to whoever voted for this guy, the entirety of federal policy is mere putty for his fevered brain to manipulate, with the Republican majority in both the US House and Senate marching happily along in lockstep.

Still, US Presidents come and go, and this one will leave office as scheduled on January 20, 2029 — peacefully, one hopes, this time.

Of course, there were automobiles before Ford launched the Model T more than a century ago. But the Model T, an inexpensive reliable car, changed the automotive industry.

This week, Ford is introducing a next generation electric vehicle that will be roughly half the price of EVs on the road today.

At the news conference, leaders with the Dearborn automaker will share plans to design and assemble electric vehicles in America.

On a July 30 conference call with analysts, Ford CEO Jim Farley said the new vehicles are intended to compete with Chinese EV makers, like Geely and BYD.

“We believe the only way to really compete effectively with the Chinese over the globe on EVs is to go and really push ourselves to radically re-engineer and transform our engineering supply chain and manufacturing process,” Farley told the analysts.

A key component are new Lithium-ion phosphate batteries to be produced in Marshall, Michigan.

It should also be noted this Model T Moment is being announced in Kentucky, not Michigan.

This week’s announcement comes as Ford is delaying other aspects of its EV product line.

Delays in scaling up domestic solar production slow the country’s ability to cut climate pollution.","ARIZONA – A major solar manufacturer has shut down its U.S. facility before production fully took off — a move that has sparked backlash and renewed concern over the country’s ability to support clean energy jobs. One culprit cited was the Trump Administration’s cancellation of solar credits.

What’s happening?

As Electrek detailed, Swiss solar company Meyer Burger closed its Arizona factory in May and laid off 282 employees after stating it couldn’t secure the funding necessary to continue operating.

The Goodyear facility was supposed to produce 1.4 gigawatts of solar panels annually — enough to power hundreds of thousands of homes — but the company never reached full production.

Meyer Burger blamed a severe lack of funds, worsened by a canceled 5-gigawatt supply agreement with cleaner energy investor D.E. Shaw, and fierce competition from Chinese imports.

On June 27 — just weeks after the shutdown — Meyer Burger’s U.S. branch filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, following insolvency proceedings for its parent company in Germany.

Reactions have been intense — and not just from workers. One commenter on Electrek summed up a growing concern: “It won’t be much longer before more companies follow. Future investment in the U.S. by foreign companies? Notta.”

Why is this facility shutdown concerning?

This shutdown is a blow not just to workers in Arizona but to a broader push for clean energy in the U.S. The Goodyear factory was part of an effort to shift solar production away from heavily subsidized Chinese supply chains and create sustainable American jobs in the process.

However, a lack of clear, timely support left Meyer Burger stranded — and it highlights a deeper issue facing the U.S. clean energy sector.

Following the passing of the Big Beautiful Bill, many clean energy incentives from the Inflation Reduction Act are set to be phased out. The removal of these benefits could have a disastrous impact on green-energy companies.

When clean energy projects like this fall through, the ripple effects extend beyond job losses. Delays in scaling up domestic solar production slow the country’s ability to cut climate pollution.

First, it helps build up domestic energy storage capacity in a cost-effective and efficient manner.
As a result, utilities need to ramp up energy storage installation to stabilize inflows and outflows of energy to maintain profitability and to keep the lights on.

“Both GM’s second-life EV batteries and new batteries can be deployed in Redwood’s energy storage systems, delivering fast, flexible power solutions and strengthening America’s energy and manufacturing independence.” As a result, energy storage centers powered by EV batteries are popping up across the nation, and particularly in the Lone Star State.","Used and recycled electric vehicle batteries are getting a second chance at life through energy storage systems across the country. Lithium-ion batteries are retired from their role powering EVs when they still have a lot of life left in them, and repurposing them for one of the fastest-growing energy industry sectors is a no-brainer.

Diverting lithium-ion batteries away from landfill and into storage projects yields multiple overlapping benefits. First, it helps build up domestic energy storage capacity in a cost-effective and efficient manner. According to Dimension Market Research, the global Energy Storage Market is on track to reach USD $204.8 billion by 2033, up from USD 58.9 billion in 2024. This represents a massive compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 14.8%.

As renewable energy sources become more prevalent in the national energy mix, energy prices become more volatile and can even dip into the negatives when supply outpaces demand. This is because wind and solar energy are variable, meaning that they produce energy when the sun is shining and the wind is blowing, irrespective of demand. As a result, utilities need to ramp up energy storage installation to stabilize inflows and outflows of energy to maintain profitability and to keep the lights on.

The second benefit is that reusing EV batteries for energy storage avoids throwing away critical minerals including lithium, nickel and cobalt at a time when supplies for those elements are growing increasingly tight. Currently, China has a chokehold on a huge number of critical mineral supply chains, and reusing batteries helps avoid tariffs and geopolitical complications. Plus, reclaiming critical minerals instead of purchasing new supplies avoids negative environmental impacts associated with mining and refining those minerals.

Third, battery storage provides a safety net for EV battery makers at a time when the market is cooling down in the face of major and unprecedented political pressures. BloombergNEF has lowered both its near- and long-term outlooks for EV sales in the United States for the first time ever as the Trump administration walks back Biden-era policies designed to boost electric vehicle adoption. The new numbers paint a grim picture for battery makers, but energy storage projects could provide a game-saving strategy.

Already, major automotive companies are taking notice and beginning to pivot. Last month, GM signed a “non-binding memorandum of understanding” with Redwood Energy to begin a used-battery powered storage venture intended to serve as an external power bank for data centers.

“The market for grid-scale batteries and backup power isn’t just expanding, it’s becoming essential infrastructure,” said Kurt Kelty, General Motors’ vice president of batteries, propulsion, and sustainability, in a recent statement. “Electricity demand is climbing, and it’s only going to accelerate. To meet that challenge, the U.S. needs energy storage solutions that can be deployed quickly, economically, and made right here at home. GM batteries can play an integral role. We’re not just making better cars — we’re shaping the future of energy resilience.”

The use of batteries as power banks for data centers could also prove to be a critical solution to another major energy issue of the moment. As artificial intelligence places unprecedented strain on power grids and raises the United States’ energy demands after decades of stasis, alternative energy solutions are critical for energy security as well as decarbonization efforts.

“Electricity demand is accelerating at an unprecedented pace, driven by AI and the rapid electrification of everything from transportation to industry,” said Redwood founder and CEO JB Straubel. “Both GM’s second-life EV batteries and new batteries can be deployed in Redwood’s energy storage systems, delivering fast, flexible power solutions and strengthening America’s energy and manufacturing independence.”

As a result, energy storage centers powered by EV batteries are popping up across the nation, and particularly in the Lone Star State. While the sector is relatively small now, it’s going to grow at a breakneck pace. And the timing could not be better, as first-generation EVs begin to proffer a steady stream of retired batteries.

Losing them overnight makes many deals uneconomical, especially for first-time EV buyers.
“$7,500 Federal Tax Credit ends Sept 30,” Tesla wrote on X this Sunday.
Earlier this week, the company raised its Model Y lease pricing by up to 14% and ended a free upgrade incentive for both the Model Y and Model 3.
Latecomers have must place their orders by August 11 for the Model Y and August 18 for the Model 3 to take advantage of it.","The great EV buying frenzy has officially begun. In the last 48 hours, Tesla has seen delivery times for some of its most popular models skyrocket from a few weeks to nearly six months, a clear signal that consumers are stampeding to buy an electric vehicle before a crucial federal tax credit disappears for good.

This is the short-term sales boom that experts have been predicting, a last-chance gold rush for buyers. But for the EV industry, it’s also a sugar rush that could lead to a brutal crash.

The Deadline That Sparked the Madness

The cause of the chaos is the impending expiration of the federal EV tax credits. The credits—a key part of the Biden-era Inflation Reduction Act (IRA)—provided a $7,500 incentive for a new EV and $4,000 for a used one, significantly lowering the barrier to entry for many buyers. Losing them overnight makes many deals uneconomical, especially for first-time EV buyers.

Under the “One Big Beautiful Bill” signed by President Donald Trump on July 4, those credits will officially end on September 30. After that date, the price of a new EV will effectively jump by $7,500 overnight.

Anticipating this, automakers have been bracing for a surge of consumers looking to lock in the savings. Now, the first signs from Tesla, the undisputed market leader, prove the experts were right.

As of Sunday, consumers placing an order for most variants of the Model 3 sedan and all variants of the best-selling Model Y SUV were given a delivery estimate of four to six months, a massive jump from the one-to-three-week estimate seen just two days prior, Gizmodo found. This indicates that Tesla’s current inventory is being rapidly depleted by the surge in demand.

The Catch: You Have to Take Delivery

The long wait times are creating a high-stakes drama for buyers because of a critical rule: to qualify for the tax credit, you don’t just have to order the car by the deadline, you must take delivery of it. This is a point Tesla and its CEO, Elon Musk, are now urgently emphasizing.

“$7,500 Federal Tax Credit ends Sept 30,” Tesla wrote on X this Sunday. “You’ll need to take delivery – not just place an order – by that date to make use of the credit before it’s gone.”

Musk reposted the message, adding an even more alarming note: “Important re-timing of vehicle delivery.” The message is clear: if you wait too long, you’ll miss out.

Tesla Capitalizes on the Chaos

With demand surging and customers growing desperate, Tesla is already capitalizing on the situation. Earlier this week, the company raised its Model Y lease pricing by up to 14% and ended a free upgrade incentive for both the Model Y and Model 3. Latecomers have must place their orders by August 11 for the Model Y and August 18 for the Model 3 to take advantage of it.

The sudden changes, made with no warning, have frustrated some buyers.

“I am sick to vomiting with Tesla doing this to pull demand when they can’t do basic advertising/educating/public relations,” one user posted on X. “Every other company does it. It was cute when Tesla was a startup no more.”

This sales frenzy comes after a brutal second quarter for the automaker, which saw its deliveries fall 13.5% and its net revenue drop 16.3% compared to the previous year as it grappled with brand damage from Musk’s political activities.

What’s the problem? Gas-powered leaf blowers are greater polluters than cars, pound for pound, since their engines are smaller and often less efficient. Using a commercial gas-powered leaf blower for one hour creates as much smog-forming pollution as driving a light-duty car for more than 15 hours, according to the California Air Resources Board.

Leaf blowers also kick up particulate matter, which can cause respiratory and heart problems. Plus, gas-powered versions of the lawn care tool can hit 106 decibels, enough to damage hearing, per the American Speech-Language-Hearing Association.

Changing landscape

An increasing number of communities are trying to keep gas-powered leaf blowers off the streets, according to USA Today:

California has a statewide ban on selling them, though many cities there take it a step further and prohibit using them at all.

In Washington, DC, using a gas-powered leaf blower could land you a $500 fine.

In a strategic partnership, the Department of Energy (DOE) has signed a lease with General Matter Inc. for the development of a new uranium enrichment facility. Situated on a 100-acre plot of land at the former Paducah Gaseous Diffusion Plant in Kentucky, this initiative marks a pivotal step towards reducing dependency on foreign nuclear fuel sources. The project signifies a broader effort to fortify national security, enhance energy production, and support scientific research, setting the stage for a new era in the U.S. nuclear sector.

DOE’s Push for Building Domestic Supply Chains for Nuclear Fuel

The DOE’s decision to partner with General Matter Inc. is part of a larger strategy to develop a domestic supply chain for nuclear fuels. In October 2024, the department selected four companies, including General Matter, for uranium enrichment services aimed at producing high-assay low-enriched uranium (HALEU). This initiative is crucial for the reshoring and expansion of energy resources, particularly for advanced manufacturing and artificial intelligence data centers.

Building domestic supply chains is not merely an economic decision but also a strategic one. The DOE emphasizes that nuclear fuel enrichment is vital for national security, commercial energy production, and research reactors. By investing in domestic capabilities, the U.S. aims to reduce its reliance on international suppliers, particularly from countries like Russia, which have traditionally been significant exporters of nuclear fuel to the United States.

General Matter’s role in fuel-line development is an important component in rebuilding America’s nuclear fuel production base. The partnership seeks to transform the former Paducah site into a key contributor to the nation’s nuclear energy leadership, aligning with broader governmental goals of energy independence and security.

General Matter to Set Up the Uranium Enrichment Facility

Under the lease agreement, General Matter will utilize the 100-acre federal land parcel to establish a uranium enrichment facility. Construction is slated to begin in 2026, with operations expected to commence by the decade’s end. This timeline reflects the urgent need to revitalize domestic uranium processing capabilities in a rapidly changing global energy landscape.

The lease also grants access to a minimum of 7,600 cylinders of existing uranium hexafluoride, which will be reprocessed to supply fuel for future operations. According to the DOE, this initiative will save American taxpayers approximately $800 million by avoiding disposal costs.

Roger Jarrell, Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary of the DOE Office of Environmental Management, emphasized the significance of leveraging the Paducah site’s resources. He noted that the skilled workforce and existing infrastructure at the site are pivotal in attracting private funding and accelerating commercial licensing activities. This approach aligns with broader governmental efforts to reduce barriers to energy development and transform liabilities into opportunities.

Understanding Uranium Enrichment and Its Importance

Uranium enrichment is a critical process in the production of nuclear fuel. Natural uranium contains only about 0.7% of the isotope U-235, which is necessary for nuclear reactions. Enrichment increases the concentration of U-235 to levels suitable for use in reactors. This is typically achieved by converting uranium oxide into uranium hexafluoride (UF6), which can then be processed in enrichment facilities.

The enriched uranium produced is essential for various applications, from powering commercial nuclear reactors to fueling research reactors and supporting national security initiatives. The process of uranium enrichment is complex and requires significant technological and infrastructural investments, underscoring the importance of developing domestic capabilities.

As the U.S. seeks to transition to cleaner energy sources, nuclear power remains a key component of its energy strategy. Ensuring a stable, domestic supply of enriched uranium is crucial for maintaining energy security and meeting the nation’s growing power needs.

Implications for National Security and Energy Independence

The push for domestic nuclear fuel production is not just about energy independence; it is also a matter of national security. The geopolitical landscape surrounding nuclear fuel is complex, with countries like Russia wielding significant influence due to their control over large portions of the global supply chain.

The U.S. administration has recognized the risks of relying on foreign sources for critical energy infrastructure. By investing in domestic enrichment facilities, the U.S. aims to mitigate these risks and enhance its geopolitical leverage. This strategy also supports the development of advanced nuclear technologies, such as small modular reactors, which are being explored to reduce reliance on fossil fuels.

As the international community continues to grapple with energy security concerns, the U.S. is positioning itself as a leader in the nuclear energy sector. The establishment of a domestic uranium enrichment facility is a significant step towards achieving this goal, ensuring that the nation remains at the forefront of clean energy innovation.

The U.S. government’s initiative to revitalize domestic uranium enrichment is a critical component of its broader energy strategy. By reducing dependence on foreign sources and investing in advanced nuclear technologies, the U.S. is taking proactive steps towards ensuring energy security and sustainability. As the world shifts towards cleaner energy solutions, how will these developments shape the future of global energy dynamics?

Ultimately, Washington is likely to lose renewable energy projects because of the added complications, Blackmon said.","Details about how President Donald Trump’s “One Big Beautiful Bill” will change life for everyday Americans are still emerging more than a month after Congress passed the sweeping legislation.

Even some politicians who voted in favor of the bill, which passed with a razor-thin margin, didn’t understand what it would do. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., said she would have voted against the measure if she had fully understood its contents.

Here in Washington state, energy experts and policy wonks are coming to understand that it’s going to mean higher electrical bills.

Precisely when your bills will rise and by how much remain somewhat unclear. But the tax plan will eliminate single-family tax credits, hand out billions to fossil fuel companies and hamstring the very wind, solar and battery projects Washington state is scrambling to build.

The money lost will soar into the billions, according to some estimates.

In the face of widespread voter opposition, illuminated by numerous polls across the country, Republicans in Congress rallied around the bill, squeezing votes out of even their most squeamish party members. Trump and his allies sold the plan as the “largest tax cut in history for middle- and working-class Americans.”

In reality, the average family earning less than $50,000 would save less than $300 in 2027 under the tax plan, while those earning $1 million or more would save around $90,000, according to an analysis by the nonpartisan Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.

Two House Republicans voted against the measure. Washington’s two GOP representatives, Dan Newhouse and Mike Baumgartner, both voted in favor, and neither responded to requests for comment on the topic.

Democrats repeatedly warned that the bill would cut popular programs like Medicaid and SNAP and add trillions to the national debt. Now that it’s law, there appears to be little they can do to offset damage to the renewable energy industry. Politicians and state and local officials talk about challenging the law in court and raising their voices in opposition. Concrete policy proposals to keep rates from rising are few and far between.

The tax plan, broadly seen as the linchpin to Trump’s agenda during his second term, marks the president’s latest shot in his escalating fight against climate science. He’s doubling down on planet-warming fossil fuels and gutting environmental and climate regulations. The latest move amounts to a setback of gargantuan proportions for the renewable industry that boomed under President Joe Biden.

As the political battle plays out, ratepayers in Washington will be forced to absorb higher electrical bills as the cost to build new wind, solar and battery projects increases by perhaps 30% or more.

“It’s going to impact our jobs; it’s going to make your electricity more expensive,” Joe Nguyễn, who directs Washington’s Department of Commerce, said during a roundtable discussion late last month. “And, candidly, it could make us more risky for brownouts or blackouts.”

Now, Washington state, utilities and developers are scrambling to figure out how to pick up the pieces.

Loss of individual tax credits

The quickest way this bill will hit home for some is with the elimination of residential clean energy credits and similar policies. Those credits might have helped the typical household in Washington save between $390 and $900 a year, Washington’s senior Democratic Sen. Patty Murray said at the roundtable discussion.

People who installed rooftop solar panels, heat pumps or similar devices were eligible for a tax credit worth 30% of their cost, but that offering will end by Dec. 31.

Not only are those potential savings gone but the residential clean-energy market could be cut in half or worse, Murray said.

The bill also eliminates a $7,500 consumer rebate for some electric vehicles and a credit for those seeking to audit their home’s energy use and renovations to become more energy-efficient.

Washington state still offers some incentives for these types of purchases, but the money available pales in comparison to the outgoing federal credits and rebates.

Renewable energy projects in jeopardy

Washington stands to lose an estimated $8.7 billion in clean-energy investments, Murray said.

The tax bill phases out credits for large-scale wind and solar farms or battery storage, eliminating Biden-era subsidies that could have cut costs by nearly a third.

Renewable energy project developers proposing work across the state declined to comment on this article for fear of further attracting Trump’s ire.

Take a project like the Horse Heaven Hills wind farm in Benton County. It was originally estimated to cost about $1.7 billion. A 30% investment credit could have cut costs by around $510 million.

Those credits are now largely out the window. Unless a project can be finished by the end of 2027 or break ground by next summer, it won’t qualify.

For context, the Horse Heaven Hills project took around three years just to win the permits needed to start work, and even then, the size of the wind farm was greatly reduced. The developer is still arguing over part of that project in court.

That truncated timeline could be enough to kill a project outright or dramatically shrink its footprint, Glenn Blackmon, manager of Washington’s Energy Policy Office, said in an interview. Other developers might back out because the finances no longer pencil out.

Ultimately, Washington is likely to lose renewable energy projects because of the added complications, Blackmon said.

That’s a problem because Washington needs more clean energy to replace outgoing fossil fuel sources and meet surging demand made and the increasing prevalence of power-hungry data centers.

Whatever renewable projects still make it through the pipeline will be more expensive, and that added cost will be passed on to ratepayers, Blackmon said.

“It doesn’t take a real fancy economic model to think ‘Well, if you increase the price by 30% or 40%, then the cost of electricity is going to be higher,’ ” Blackmon said.

But why must Washington move forward with only renewable energy projects?

The Clean Energy Transformation Act

The first answer to that question is climate change. Fossil fuels like coal, oil and gas are warming our planet. So in 2019, lawmakers in Washington passed the Clean Energy Transformation Act, or CETA for short.

Among other things, CETA requires coal plants in Washington to be closed by the end of the year and it requires the state to free its electrical grid of greenhouse gas emissions by 2045.

So any new energy projects built to meet the rising demand must tap into renewable sources like wind or solar. Hydropower is also on the table, but proposals for new dams are few and far between, and the resource is also suffering from ongoing drought conditions fueled by global warming.

For Seattle City Light, rising demand means the utility must double the amount of available electricity in the next nine years, CEO Dawn Lindell said at the roundtable discussion. Not only will the tax plan hike the cost of all that new energy by perhaps as much as 20% but it’s also a step in the wrong direction for a rapidly warming planet.

“Now is not the time to put our head in the sand,” Lindell said.

Puget Sound Energy, the state’s largest utility, is in a similar position, said Matt Steuerwalt, the utility’s vice president of external affairs. Regardless of whether the tax incentives are revoked, the utility must buy more renewable energy. Once those projects begin generating power, that added cost will then be reflected in customers’ bills, he said.

While the loss of these tax incentives will mean prices trend upward, Blackmon said there might be a silver lining. Fossil fuel prices remain volatile while renewables are trending downward. So in the long run, Washington’s transition toward wind and solar will still be the more affordable option.",https://images.seattletimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/08042025_TZR_Horse_Heaven_Hills-03012025_tzr_125616.jpg?d=1200x630,N,,2025-08-10 13:07:24.553954

WV Rivers will continue working toward a long-term resolution that holds all parties to permitted standards and ensures transparency and accountability around pollution discharges.","WASHINGTON, D.C. – A federal judge has granted the West Virginia Rivers Coalition’s (WV Rivers) request for a preliminary injunction, requiring The Chemours Company FC, LLC (Chemours) to reduce discharges of HFPO-DA, a “forever chemical” also known as Gen-X, from its Washington Works facility in Wood County. The ruling states that the company must operate within its Clean Water Act permit and demonstrate sustained compliance with the discharge limits.

As the Court explained, “For years, Defendant Chemours Company has discharged pollutants into the Ohio River. The level of discharge far exceeds the legal limits that bind Chemours. Those pollutants endanger the environment, aquatic life, and human health. Today, that unlawful, unpermitted discharge stops.”

“This is a victory for public health and the Ohio River,” said Autumn Crowe, Deputy Director of WV Rivers. “The Court recognized what communities have known for years: Chemours has been polluting our water and ignoring its legal obligations.”

WV Rivers, represented by Appalachian Mountain Advocates and Public Justice, filed the lawsuit in response to ongoing discharges of Gen-X chemicals into the Ohio River, which serves as a drinking water source for approximately 5 million people. Chemours had been exceeding permitted limits for many years with increasing frequency and severity. In November 2024, Chemours exceeded its permitted limits for HFPO-DA at Outlet 002 and Outlet 005 as high as 454% and 166%, respectively.

The Court’s decision acknowledges that the permit limits under the Clean Water Act are designed to prevent long-term, incremental harm to people and ecosystems and that Chemours has been ignoring it to the detriment of communities downstream: “Defendant’s permit is not a suggestion; rather, its permit protects public health and environmental life while balancing the needs of manufacturing. But I cannot weigh the scales of that balance to inflict further harm on the communities that rely on clean water for life and livelihood. The Clean Water Act protects the public, and I will enforce it.”

The Court found that Gen-X chemicals are dangerous, persistent, and mobile pollutants. It also found that each unlawful discharge of those chemicals is a direct toxic exposure that causes irreparable harm to every person served by downstream drinking water systems.

“The Court’s decision is an especially strong endorsement of the value of citizen suits in enforcing the Clean Water Act,” said Jim Hecker, Senior Environmental Enforcement Attorney at Public Justice. “The Court’s opinion emphasized that Congress gave citizens that enforcement power ‘precisely for cases like this one,’ where a polluter violates its permit for years and the government fails to enforce the law.”

The Court’s preliminary injunction orders Chemours to comply with its permit immediately and to “take any measures necessary to achieve and maintain compliance, including but not limited to production changes, process modifications, off-site treatment, or temporary cessation of operations.”

“The Court made clear that Chemours has many ways to come into compliance, and thus protect the public, while continuing to operate. Our intent has never been to cause layoffs but rather has always been straightforward: to ensure compliance with environmental safeguards to protect the health and well-being of the public,” said Jennie Smith, Executive Director of WV Rivers.

Hydro says that the sixth and final generating unit on the Site C hydroelectric megaproject in northeast B.C. is now online.

The massive energy project has been under construction since 2015, and its first generating unit became operational last October, when power began being supplied to the grid.

At $16 billion, nearly double of its initial price tag, Site C is considered B.C.'s most expensive infrastructure project.

It went ahead despite court cases from First Nations and other groups, some of which decried the impact of flooding land and changing the course of the massive Peace River in northeast B.C.

Site C was initially approved by the then-B.C. Liberal government in 2010, and the project stayed on course after a review by the B.C. NDP government in 2017.

B.C. Hydro estimates the dam will be able to provide 5,100 gigawatt hours of electricity each year, adding eight per cent to the province's total production capacity.

The hydroelectric project draws from an 83-kilometre-long reservoir, which covers an area of about 5,550 hectares of land, 25 times the size of Stanley Park.

It was filled in with water starting last August, and Energy Minister Adrian Dix said that ""generations of British Columbians"" would benefit from the clean electricity generated by the project.

""The commission of Site C's final generating unit is another step forward to securing B.C.'s clean energy future,"" he said in a statement.

Hazards in area: B.C. Hydro

B.C. Hydro says that, now that the final generating unit is operational, future construction work at Site C will consist of completing the powerhouse and generating station and paving access roads.

The utility estimates it will serve B.C. Hydro customers for the next century, and is now providing enough electricity to power 500,000 homes.

""Work also continues to backfill the tunnels used to divert the Peace River, and revegetate areas no longer required for construction,"" a statement from B.C. Hydro reads.

The utility says that there continue to be a number of hazards in the area around Site C and the surrounding slopes, and it's urging members of the public to stay away for now.

""These potential hazards include floating vegetation debris and the surrounding land and shoreline continuing to stabilize,"" the statement reads.

""The new B.C. Hydro public boat launches will open when the reservoir is deemed safe, which is expected to be spring 2026 at the earliest.""

First Nation opposition

The project was not completed without controversy and opposition.

In 2018, the West Moberly First Nation lost a bid for an injunction order against the project, having argued that the dam would cause irreparable harm to the nation's territory and way of life — rights protected under Treaty 8. The Union of B.C. Indian Chiefs called the ruling a ""grave disappointment.""

Later, in 2022, the nation came to a partial settlement with B.C. Hydro and the provincial and federal governments.

It included an impact and benefits agreement between, 5,000 acres of provincial Crown land transferred to the First Nation and an agreement to release West Moberly's claims against the Site C project.

At the time, Chief Roland Willson told CBC News he had been reluctant to settle out of court, but his community felt it was out of options.",https://i.cbc.ca/1.7605261.1754765217!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_1180/site-c-dam.jpg?im=Resize%3D620,N,,2025-08-10 15:06:39.144978

CATL suspends lithium mine production due to expired permit, highlighting the complex interplay between regulatory compliance, economic viability, and strategic positioning in a rapidly evolving industry.","CATL's Lithium Mine Suspension: Regulatory Challenges and Market Impact

In a significant development for the global battery supply chain, CATL has announced a temporary shutdown at its Jianxiawo lithium mine in Yichun, Jiangxi province. This sudden halt in production could have far-reaching implications for lithium prices, battery manufacturing, and the broader electric vehicle industry.

The Sudden Production Halt

CATL management announced internally that operations at its Jianxiawo mine would be suspended for at least three months, effective August 9, 2025. According to reports from Reuters, the suspension came after the company failed to renew a key mining license that expired on that date.

The Jianxiawo mine represents a crucial link in CATL's vertically integrated battery production strategy. Sources close to the situation indicate that affiliated refineries in Yichun have been formally notified of the closure, with the company preparing for the possibility that the production halt could extend well beyond the initially announced three-month period.

""The company is still in talks with government agencies to renew the license but is preparing for the halt to last months,"" stated one source familiar with the matter. This regulatory hurdle comes at a challenging time for China's lithium industry, which has been facing overcapacity issues for more than two years.

Strategic Significance of the Yichun Operation

Yichun, often referred to as the ""Lithium Capital of Asia,"" hosts critical mineral resources that support China's dominance in the global battery supply chain. The Jianxiawo mine represents a cornerstone of CATL's vertical integration strategy, providing domestic lithium supply that reduces reliance on international markets.

However, the mine has been facing significant economic challenges. Production costs at the facility are approximately RMB 100,000 ($13,920) per ton, according to CnEVPost reporting from September 2024. This cost structure places the operation underwater in the current market environment, where battery-grade lithium carbonate is trading at around RMB 70,000 ($9,744) per ton.

This substantial gap between production costs and market prices raises questions about the economic viability of the operation, potentially complicating the mining permitting process. Regulatory authorities may be considering these economic factors alongside compliance issues in their review of CATL's application.

Impact on the Broader Lithium Market

The suspension comes amid a prolonged downturn in global lithium prices, which have fallen approximately 88% from their November 2022 peak of RMB 590,000 ($82,130) per ton. The current price environment represents a dramatic correction from the 14-fold increase witnessed between June 2020 and November 2022.

For an industry plagued by overcapacity since 2023, the removal of production capacity through CATL's mine suspension could actually provide a stabilizing effect on prices. Analysts suggest this development might offer much-needed relief for other lithium producers facing similar profitability challenges.

The timing aligns with broader trends in the industry. In May 2025, BYD and Tsingshan backed out of lithium cathode plant plans in Chile, citing unfavorable price conditions. These developments collectively point to an industry-wide rationalization phase that could eventually bring supply and demand into better balance.

""CATL's permit trouble and production halt come as the Chinese government is cracking down on overcapacity across multiple industries and intensifying scrutiny of mining operations,"" noted Bloomberg in its report on the suspension.

Regulatory Environment Tightening

The suspension appears to be part of a broader trend of increasing regulatory scrutiny in China's mining sector. Government authorities have been implementing stricter environmental compliance requirements and more rigorous permit review processes across multiple industrial sectors.

This development aligns with China's stated goals of consolidating industries suffering from overcapacity while simultaneously improving environmental standards. The lithium mining sector, which expanded rapidly during the 2020-2022 price boom, is now facing the consequences of that expansion as regulators reassess operations.

The permit renewal process for mining operations typically involves:

Comprehensive environmental impact assessments

Verification of compliance with land use regulations

Review of safety protocols and procedures

Evaluation of community impact and social license to operate

Assessment of resource utilization efficiency

CATL will need to navigate this complex regulatory landscape while demonstrating both compliance and economic viability to secure permit renewal.

Implications for Battery Supply Chains

Lithium represents a significant portion of the cost structure for EV batteries, particularly for lithium iron phosphate (LFP) chemistry, which relies on lithium carbonate and iron phosphate as primary raw materials. While CATL maintains a dominant 37.9% global market share in EV batteries as of H1 2025, this supply chain disruption could potentially affect its production costs and competitive positioning.

The company may need to increase sourcing from third-party suppliers to compensate for the production shortfall, potentially:

Increasing input costs for battery production

Creating logistics challenges for material sourcing

Affecting delivery timelines for battery customers

Impacting margins on battery contracts

For automakers relying on CATL's battery supply, these developments warrant close monitoring. While the overall lithium market remains oversupplied, localized disruptions can still create short-term challenges for specific supply chains.

Market Adjustment Expectations

Industry analysts anticipate several potential outcomes from this development:

Short-term price stabilization: The removal of production capacity could help establish a floor for lithium prices that have been in free-fall.

Accelerated industry consolidation: Smaller, higher-cost producers may face increased pressure, potentially leading to mergers or acquisitions.

Increased focus on operational efficiency: Producers across the value chain will likely intensify efforts to reduce costs to remain viable in the current price environment.

Greater emphasis on regulatory compliance: Companies may proactively address potential regulatory issues to avoid similar disruptions.

While the immediate impact may be limited due to overall market oversupply, the psychological effect on market participants could be significant. This high-profile suspension might signal that the industry is finally addressing its overcapacity issues.

Potential Timeline for Resolution

While CATL has not provided specific details on the permit renewal timeline, similar regulatory processes in China's mining sector typically follow a multi-stage review:

Initial application review (1-2 months): Regulatory authorities assess compliance documentation and identify any deficiencies.

Site inspections and verification (2-3 months): Government officials conduct on-site evaluations to verify conditions and compliance status.

Stakeholder consultation (1-2 months): Local communities and other interested parties may be consulted as part of the process.

Final determination (1-2 months): Authorities make a decision on the application, potentially with conditions attached.

Given this typical timeline, CATL's three-month initial suspension estimate appears optimistic unless significant preliminary work had already been completed before the permit expired.

Broader Industry Context

This development occurs against a backdrop of fundamental changes in the lithium market:

Supply growth outpacing demand: Despite rapid EV adoption, lithium production capacity has expanded even faster.

Price sensitivity increasing: Battery manufacturers and automakers are increasingly focused on cost reduction as EV subsidies phase out in many markets.

Geographical concentration risks: China's dominance in lithium processing has prompted concerns about securing lithium supply for other nations.

Technological shifts: Lithium industry innovations and advancements in direct lithium extraction may alter demand patterns over the medium term.

CATL suspends lithium mine production due to expired permit, highlighting the complex interplay between regulatory compliance, economic viability, and strategic positioning in a rapidly evolving industry.

Looking Ahead: What's Next for CATL and the Lithium Market?

The coming months will be critical for CATL as it navigates the permit renewal process. The company must balance immediate operational concerns with its long-term strategic goals of vertical integration and market leadership.

For the broader lithium market, this suspension represents another data point suggesting that the industry is entering a new phase of rationalization after years of explosive growth followed by painful contraction. Industry participants will be watching closely for signs that supply and demand are moving toward a more sustainable equilibrium.

Investors, battery manufacturers, and automakers should prepare for potential volatility in lithium prices as the market digests this development alongside other global lithium insights. While the long-term outlook for lithium demand remains strong, the path to market balance may continue to be bumpy.

“The (EV) market is not massive.","– As growth in electric vehicle (EV) sales slows down in the US and Europe, competition is accelerating in India’s nascent electric car market with the entry of billionaire Elon Musk’s Tesla and Asian carmakers, such as Vietnam’s VinFast and China’s Leapmotor.

India is the world’s third-largest car market in terms of domestic vehicle sales, and it is predicted to overtake the US and China to become the largest by 2030.

The government hopes that electric cars will make up 30 per cent of total car sales by then, up from a mere 2.5 per cent out of the 4.3 million cars sold in 2024.

But India is also a challenging market with price-conscious consumers, limited charging infrastructure, difficult road conditions, and high import duties on foreign cars.

Telsa

drove into the Indian market in July with two variants of its Model Y

, a popular electric sport utility vehicle (SUV), which come with a hefty starting price tag of around US$70,000 (S$90,000), compared with just US$37,490 in the US, according to Forbes India.

A key reason was the import duty, which can rise to 110 per cent, making the SUV more expensive in India than in many other countries.

Tesla, which is currently operating in Mumbai and plans to expand to Delhi, is testing the market, said Mr Srihari Mulgund, India new age mobility partner at EY-Parthenon India, a consulting company.

“They are trying to see how the market perceives the product. There will be learning, and it will help them develop an India product strategy,” he noted.

The government is working to expand infrastructure for charging EVs, which will be key to their acceptance. More than 12,000 EV charging stations were in use nationwide in 2024, and the government aims to have 3.9 million by 2030.

Leading up to Tesla’s entry on July 15, Mr Musk had criticised the high import duties, remarking that they were “the highest in the world by far, of any large country”.

The US is negotiating lower automotive tariffs as part of the India-US trade deal.

Tesla, which competes in the luxury EV sector, has ruled out manufacturing in India, according to Heavy Industries Minister H.D. Kumaraswamy.

Operating on a different model in another part of the cost spectrum is Vietnamese EV -maker VinFast, which was named one of Time’s 100 most influential companies in 2024.

It is taking orders for two premium SUVs, which will be priced in the range of 1.8 million rupees (S$26,500) to 3.5 million rupees, according to Indian media reports.

VinFast opened its first showroom in the city of Surat, in the western state of Gujarat, on July 27, and its second in the city of Chennai, in the southern state of Tamil Nadu, on Aug 2. It has also tied up with local partners to create a charging network and for after-sales service, with plans to launch 35 dealerships by the year end in 27 cities.

According to VinFast’s press release, its car assembly plant in Tamil Nadu is the company’s third operational facility globally. The facility, which is part of a 160 billion rupee investment pact

inked between VinFast and the Tamil Nadu government in 2024

, will initially make 50,000 vehicles per year.

VinFast Asia chief executive Pham Sanh Chau told NDTV news channel: “This plant lays a solid foundation for us to make Tamil Nadu not just a manufacturing hub for India, but also VinFast’s largest export base for South Asia, the Middle East and Africa.”

Mr Puneet Gupta, director for India and Asean markets at S&P Global Mobility, said: “Tesla and VinFast will both serve as catalysts in driving up EV market share in India. They are expected to attract greater attention from consumers towards electric vehicles and help increase confidence in EV technology.”

Chinese automobile start-up Leapmotor’s electric cars are also being launched in India, by multinational automotive manufacturing corporation Stellantis, which will assemble the vehicles.

India is hoping that such assembly plants, which are at the lower end of manufacturing, will be the starting point for building a manufacturing ecosystem of EVs.

While domestic EV manufacturers are keen to protect their turf, the government is encouraging foreign carmakers to come to India and make it their EV manufacturing hub in the region.

Consumers with higher purchasing power are turning to EVs

Sales of electric cars are inching up in India, the world’s fourth-largest economy.

In 2024, 99,165 electric cars were sold, which is a 20 per cent increase over the previous year, according to the Federation of Automobile Dealers Associations. EV growth in India has been led by two- and three-wheelers that accounted for a majority of the over two million EVs sold in 2024.

The growth is not coming from the entry-level segment, but SUVs – where cars start at around one million rupees – and the premium segment.

Consumers with more purchasing power, who own more than one car and are aware of environmental concerns, are likely leading the trend, said analysts.

When Mr Surinder Gera decided to replace his 11-year-old diesel car with an electric SUV, he spent as much time convincing his 21-year-old son, with whom he runs the family clothing manufacturing business, as he did researching cars and the charging infrastructure. The family already owns a petrol car.

“He told me it’s too much of a risk, as we travel a lot for our business. But I convinced him. I wanted to bring down my family’s carbon footprint,” said the 47-year-old businessman , who is based in the northern Indian city of Ludhiana.

In addition, Mr Gera charted every location he had visited in the last five years to see whether charging stations were present along each route.

He settled on an SUV made by domestic automobile company Mahindra & Mahindra, which fell within his budget. Mahindra’s electric car line-up starts at around 1.5 million rupees.

Vocal for local

Unlike in other parts of the world, where Chinese EV companies have been rapidly increasing their market share, domestic manufacturers dominate the market in India.

China’s BYD’s, the world’s biggest EV-maker, had a US$1 billion investment plan rejected in 2023 amid geopolitical tensions between India and China.

So BYD scaled down its plans for India and relies on its assembly plant in the southern city of Chennai, which has an annual capacity of 10,000 to 15,000 units. BYD also imports many of the cars it sells in India.

Things may improve for Chinese companies as China and India seek to repair ties following a

2020 clash on their border

.

Tata leads with over half of the market share in the electric car segment, followed by MG Motor, which is a joint venture between India’s JSW Group and China’s Saic Motor. They are followed by Mahindra & Mahindra and China’s BYD.

Tata Motors, which once had a 70 per cent share, is finding its dominance in the Indian market challenged as more competitors come in with new car models and offer innovations like allowing buyers to lease EV batteries.

In response, Tata Motors plans to have around 15 models by 2030. Mahindra & Mahindra in 2024 also announced plans to introduce seven new EVs by 2030.

Long and winding road for foreign car brands

Newcomers face a squeeze between the competition and aspirational buyers who want multiple features at a low price, said EY’s Mr Mulgund.

“India is a very heterogeneous market. There is the rural and urban divide. Building up a dealership and service is no mean feat, and finding the right partners takes time. It can be built, but it’s a longer gestation period,” he said.

“The (EV) market is not massive. Price becomes a critical part of any proposition. Indian customers are also ambitious. They want a car at the right price point but want all the bells and whistles. That is a difficult proposition to beat. You need a certain level of scale to deliver that.”

Government push

In order to push foreign carmakers to manufacture in India, the government in 2025 launched the Scheme to Promote Manufacturing of Electric Passenger Cars in India.

Under the scheme, Customs duty is cut to 15 per cent, provided that automakers invest a minimum of 41.5 billion rupees within three years. They can then import 8,000 electric cars with a cost, insurance and freight value of US$35,000 subject to the 15 per cent tax per car.

So far, Tesla has not shown interest, while other car manufacturers such as Mercedes-Benz, Skoda-Volkswagen, Hyundai and Kia have indicated interest, according to Mr Kumaraswamy, the minister.

Volvo Car India’s managing director Jyoti Malhotra told news agency Press Trust of India that, given the level of investment required, the company would do best to continue to assemble its cars in India, as it is doing, for now.

As more benefits are seen, and we anticipate bigger scale, then we can evaluate others, he said.

For India, going electric is an environmental imperative, given how pollution levels are climbing in its urban centres.

According to the World Air Quality Report 2024 by Swiss air-quality technology company IQAir, Delhi is the most polluted capital city in the world and India is the world’s fifth-most polluted country, down from No. 3 in 2023.

Vehicular emissions contributed 51.5 per cent to Delhi’s pollution. Delhi has banned 10-year-old diesel and 15-year-old petrol cars, and on July 1, banned even the refuelling of such cars.

Ms Anumita Roychowdhury, executive director of research and advocacy at the Centre for Science and Environment, said: “For India, electrification is not just an opportunity to clean up the environment, but it is also an industrial opportunity.”

She noted that the government, apart from implementing manufacturing schemes needed to strengthen charging infrastructure, also needed to incentivise consumers more, citing measures like free parking for EVs.

“In India, you require industry to develop its manufacturing capacity adequately. You need a supply chain of critical minerals and battery manufacturing. But the supply chain will evolve only if the (automobile) industry perceives there is a demand in the market. Both have to go hand in hand.”",https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/380f77964cc64b371357a73bdca95a01987d7dacbf29eba9366abbd8cfd31071,N,,2025-08-10 13:06:32.809034

The Green Infrastructure Grant Opportunities (GIGO) program has been made possible by the bipartisan Rebuild Illinois capital plan. The Notice of Funding Opportunity (NOFO) is posted at: https://il.amplifund.com/Public/Opportunities/Details/936ac400-7c97-4c3e-8bbb-2e0c9ee711ca.

“Under Rebuild Illinois, the Green Infrastructure Grant Opportunities program has already infused $20 million into Illinois communities, improving water quality with each new project,” said Illinois EPA acting director Jennings in a press release. “Green infrastructure projects not only control stormwater runoff impacting our rivers, lakes and streams, but also improve the local landscape.”

Illinois EPA is seeking proposals for projects to construct green infrastructure best management practices (BMPs) that prevent, eliminate or reduce stormwater runoff, and reduce localized or riverine flooding in Illinois’ rivers, streams and lakes. Projects that implement treatment trains (multiple BMPs in series) and/or multiple BMPs within the same watershed are encouraged as they may be more effective and efficient than a single large green infrastructure BMP. BMPs may be located on public or private land.

Under the GIGO Program, green infrastructure is defined as any stormwater management technique or practice employed with the primary goal to preserve, restore, mimic or enhance natural hydrology. Green infrastructure includes, but is not limited to, methods of using soil and vegetation to promote soil percolation, evapotranspiration and filtering or the harvesting and reuse of precipitation. Examples of project types/BMPs that may be funded through GIGO can be found at https://epa.illinois.gov/topics/grants-loans/water-financial-assistance/gigo.html.

Illinois EPA has set a maximum grant award of $2.5 million and a minimum grant award of $75,000. Applications for the GIGO Program are due by Nov. 5, at 1:00 PM (CST). Additional information is available on the Illinois EPA website. Applicants must apply for GIGO through the GATA Grantee Portal.",https://muddyrivernews.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/08/Illinois-EPA.png,N,,2025-08-10 12:06:03.118439

Thursday, EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin said on social media the law terminated the agency’s legal ability to distribute the funds.
“With clear language and intent from Congress in the one big, beautiful bill, EPA is taking action to end this program for good.
“The federal funding has already been obligated to Oregon, and the Oregon Solar for All Coalition,” the department statement read.
The Solar for All fund was meant to bring the benefits of solar power to 900,000 households in low-income communities, while reducing greenhouse gas emissions.","Several congressional Democrats Friday slammed the Trump administration’s announcement it will cancel nearly $7 billion in grants to fund solar energy projects for low-income households, saying the move was illegal and would raise families’ energy prices if allowed to proceed.

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency sent notices to states and other recipients of grants through the Solar for All program, which Democrats created in their massive 2022 taxes, energy and domestic policy law, that the agency was canceling all unspent funds from the initiative.

The EPA said Republicans eliminated the federal fund that distributed the program’s money in the “one big, beautiful” law President Donald Trump signed July 4.

Thursday, EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin said on social media the law terminated the agency’s legal ability to distribute the funds.

“The bottom line again is this: EPA no longer has the authority to administer the program or the appropriated funds to keep this boondoggle alive,” Zeldin said in a video posted to X. “With clear language and intent from Congress in the one big, beautiful bill, EPA is taking action to end this program for good. We are committed to the rule of law and being a good steward of taxpayer dollars.”

The move sparked a backlash from Democrats in Congress and the states, who said that rescinding the already-obligated funding violated the law.

“We are appalled and outraged at the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) blatant and unlawful termination of $7 billion in federal funding for the 60 organizations that received awards through the Solar for All program,” the five Democratic members of Oregon’s congressional delegation wrote in a Friday letter to Zeldin and White House Budget Director Russell Vought.

“Solar for All funding has been approved by Congress and signed into law, and cancelling or rescinding these obligated funds is a violation of the law and the Constitution.”

Letters to 60 states, organizations

The 60 recipients of the grant awards, mostly state governments but also tribes and some multistate projects, received letters from the EPA on Thursday informing them the grants were being cancelled.

The letter sent to Oregon’s Department of Energy said the reconciliation bill Trump signed on July 4 rescinded the authorization and appropriations for the fund.

“Any attempt to continue the program’s administration, in the absence of any authorizing legislation or appropriated funds for that purpose, is no longer legally permissible,” the letter said.

“The EPA has been weighing options for the future of the Solar for All program and has made the decision to terminate the SFA program and existing grants because the EPA no longer has a statutory basis or dedicated funding to continue administering and overseeing the nearly $7 billion outlay to approximately 60 grant recipients.”

The letter said the EPA realized that recipients “may have begun to rely” on the program for preliminary budgeting and staffing decisions. But it said that “due to the early nature of such expenditures, we expect any harms to interests suffered to be remedied and remediable.”

In a statement Friday, the Oregon Department of Energy said it had already spent “significant administrative funds” to launch the program later this year, and hinted a legal challenge may come soon.

“The federal funding has already been obligated to Oregon, and the Oregon Solar for All Coalition,” the department statement read. “We are surprised and disappointed to hear the U.S. EPA is moving to rescind these already-obligated funds. ODOE will work with our partners, the Governor’s Office, and Oregon’s Attorney General to consider next steps to ensure these funds continue to serve Oregonians as intended.”

‘A betrayal’

Like the Oregon Democrats, New Jersey Democratic Representative Frank Pallone, the ranking member on the powerful House Energy and Commerce Committee, said the move was illegal and predicted it would raise energy prices.

“The Trump Administration is stealing from working families in broad daylight,” Pallone said in an early Friday statement. “This money was intended for our constituents and communities to help lower energy bills. Clawing these funds back isn’t just brazenly illegal – it’s a betrayal by this Administration of working families who will now pay higher energy bills just so Republicans can grind their axe against clean energy.”

Other Democrats, including Arizona Governor Katie Hobbs, also focused on the economic impact.

“President Trump ran on lowering costs and creating jobs,” Hobbs wrote on X. “Gutting Solar for All will do the exact opposite. It makes our air dirtier, our energy bills higher, and our economy weaker. I will continue to fight for the clean and affordable energy future Arizonans want and deserve.”

Democrats created the Solar for All fund as part of the $27 billion Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund in the law they passed without any GOP support in either chamber and President Joe Biden signed in August 2022.

The new “OBBA” federal tax bill was supposed to be the death knell for the vehicle electrification movement in the US. Guess again. In a living manifestation of the notorious Streisand effect, Costco has put its 50 million or so members on alert that the clock is ticking on the $7,500 EV tax credit, while Ford and General Motors have spent the past week talking up their plans for electric vehicles, electric vehicles, and more electric vehicles. If they go down, they’re going down swinging.

Electric Vehicles & The Streisand Effect

The Streisand effect popped into the vernacular in the early 2000’s. It’s shorthand for a burst of publicity that explodes in all directions when someone with a high media profile inadvertently draws attention to a thing practically nobody knew or cared about — until they drew attention to it.

That sums up the current state of the vehicle electrification movement here in the US, where federal policymakers have been taking various measures to tamp down the enthusiasm for zero-emission mobility.

Some of those measures have probably sailed under the radar of the general public, such as the attempt to halt the federally funded NEVI public charging program (the what?) and dial down the US Postal Service’s plans for adding more electric delivery trucks to its fleet (they were?).

When the topic turns to taxes, though, everybody’s ears prick up and the media spotlight cranks to 11 on the dial. That’s what happened when Congress passed the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” in July. The new tax bill eliminates the $7,500 federal tax credit for electric vehicles after September 30, barely seven weeks from now.

Everybody Is Talking About Electric Vehicles Now

With passage of the OBBA, the pressure is on to keep the EV sales momentum going up to the September 30 deadline. The popular wholesale buying club Costco is among the leading EV stakeholders to spread the word. Though better known for helping households and small-to-medium businesses save money on groceries and other essentials, Costco also offers a Costco Auto service that enables its US members to avail themselves of a “haggle-free” experience at participating car dealers.

The Costco Auto service includes electric vehicles, and GM, for one, is probably happy with the results. Last year, Costco began pitching a $1,000 incentive on the purchase of a 2024 Chevy Equinox EV. Coincidentally or not, the Equinox has been front and center in EV sales growth for General Motors this year.

Costco also reinforced its support for EVs earlier this year with the launch of the new Costco Auto online EV Marketplace. Costco has been adding more EV buyer guides and other features the to EV Marketplace since its launch. Now, with the untimely demise of the EV tax credit looming ahead, last week Costco added new members-only incentives for both GM and Volvo. Costco also emphasizes that their Costco Auto incentives can stack onto manufacturer incentives and the federal tax credit all the way up to September 30, on top of any other incentives available to EV buyers.

Ford & GM Pitch Affordability

The elimination of the tax credit comes at a particularly bad time for Ford and GM. The two automakers initially concentrated on high-end electric SUVs and pickup trucks, aiming to compete in the zero-emission mobility market at industry leader Tesla’s price point while the cost of EV batteries was still running high. Now, just when battery costs have come down and the promise of a more affordable ride is coming into view, federal policymakers have thrown a $7,500 monkey wrench into the works.

Nevertheless, both Ford and GM are sticking to their respective programs. Last year, Ford confirmed that its secret, not-so-secret “skunkworks” EV project was in high gear. By the beginning of this summer, the intention became clear: Stop competing with Tesla and start learning from China’s successful, affordable EV journey.

Last week, Ford announced that a big reveal about its affordable EV plans is forthcoming, complete with a high-profile media event to be held in Kentucky on August 11. Ford enthusiasts and other members of the public can follow along online here at 10:20 AM EST.

Ford is pitching the event as its “Model T Moment,” referring to the secretive project that transformed the entire global auto industry in the early 20th century.

“The Model T was more than a single model or body style — it was a flexible platform. With their capability, reliability and repairability, some early Model Ts were fodder for stunts like driving to the top of Pike’s Peak in the Rocky Mountains, climbing the stairs of a courthouse or competing in a cross-country race from New York to Seattle along the nation’s primitive roads, a contest it won over other higher-powered competitors,” Ford explained on its “Ford From The Road” blog last week.

Ford dropped another hint last week when it officially opened its new Electric Vehicle Development Center in Long Beach, California, repurposing an existing 95-year-old campus. In a blog post on the topic, Ford technical program manager Ann Diep let slip another hint about the August 11 announcement. “I can tell you what’s guiding every decision: simplicity, efficiency, and the desire to spark excitement,” Diep wrote.

The Repairability Factor

So, reading the tea leaves, not too many hints surfaced in last week’s blog post aside from simplicity, efficiency, excitement, flexibility, capability, reliability, repairability, durability, and stunt-worthiness. If one of these sticks out like a sore thumb to you, drop a note in the comment thread. My money is on repairability.

The right-to-repair movement aside, electric vehicles have a head start over conventional cars because service costs are far lower. However, that doesn’t mean repair costs following a collision are any less expensive, so it will be interesting to see if, and how, Ford addresses that issue.

One key angle to consider is damage to the battery. Replacing an EV battery is an expensive proposition. However, four intertwining technologies have emerged to take some of the sting out. One is the falling cost of the battery, and the others are the battery swapping trend, second-life applications, and new battery recycling technologies.

GM Banks On Affordable Electric Vehicles, Too

What do you think, some day in the sparkling green future could a repair shop, or a home DIY enthusiast, pop out an old EV battery and plug in a new one as easily as changing a tire, with a rebate on second-life or recycling value helping to cut down the expense?

Maybe, maybe not. On its part, GM is focusing on the cost of the battery. In a page ripped from the pages of the Chinese EV story, last week GM announced that it would buy low-cost LFP batteries from the top Chinese battery maker CATL for its forthcoming Chevy Bolt over the next two years, while it continues to work on setting up an LFP factory here in the US.

That’s … interesting. As with Ford, GM’s new affordable EVs won’t hit the market until long after the $7,500 tax credit falls into the dustbin of history. On top of the tax credit issue, the tariff wars have thrown the entire US auto industry for a loop. Why not wait just a couple of years for domestic sourcing to come through?

Be that as it may, last week GM also dropped word that its cost-cutting journey also involves a leveling up of its partnership with Hyundai. The two automakers are collaborating on four hybrid and conventional cars for the Latin America market, along with an all-electric commercial van for North America.",https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/ford-electric-vehicles-new-california-campus.jpeg,N,,2025-08-10 13:06:37.772415

Thank you, Henry Schwan, for your excellent reporting on the proposed withdrawal by the EPA from caring for our environment!

As stewards of planet Earth, we must speak up now to stop this move by the EPA. Worcester is doing its share with the Green Worcester Plan, with a goal to reach net-zero carbon emissions citywide by 2045.

Sen. Ed Markey is raising awareness on the EPA’s plan to repeal its 2009 finding that greenhouse gas emissions from the burning of fossil fuels are a threat to public health and human life. This 2009 EPA endangerment finding serves as an underpinning of the federal government’s programs to fight climate change.

The EPA plans to repeal all greenhouse gas emissions regulations for motor vehicles and engines; eliminate wind and solar programs in the Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy; eliminate grants that support state and local air quality improvement as well as grants that reduce diesel emissions; and eliminate environmental justice enforcement along with reductions in civil and criminal enforcement as well as compliance monitoring.

This is an appalling abandonment of the EPA’s long-standing fight to improve our air, water and environment.

We can make our voices heard by leaving a comment about the EPA’s proposed regulations at Regulations.gov.

Thank you, Worcester Telegram and Sen. Ed Markey!

Clinging to fossil-fueled past

Paul Diego Craney’s claim that clean energy mandates “completely fail to achieve their goals” is flatly contradicted by the data (Markey blasts EPA chief, Trump over repeal of climate change finding, July 31).

In 2024 alone, the U.S. added nearly 50 gigawatts of new solar capacity — more than any other source and two-thirds of all new power installations nationwide. Solar electricity generation grew by 27% last year. In April 2025, solar supplied over 10% of U.S. electricity, which no serious energy analyst would call a “failure.”

Far from being “ideological,” the momentum behind solar and wind reflects technological progress, market demand and broad public support for cleaner, more resilient infrastructure. Craney’s view clings to a fossil-fueled past while ignoring the reality on the ground: renewable energy is growing faster, employing more Americans and increasingly powering the grid.

The endangerment finding was based on settled science and upheld by courts. Its repeal won’t unleash innovation — it will delay it. And it will cost us more in health, climate and economic disruption.

Massachusetts has been a leader in clean energy not because it’s “feel-good” policy, but because it’s smart policy. Mr. Craney may prefer ideological rigidity. The rest of us prefer clean air, lower bills and a livable future.

Enrollment down, school budget up

In response to the article titled ""Where did all the kids go? Most districts in Worcester County see declines in enrollment.""

I have been a parent with at least one child as a student in the Wachusett Regional School District for the past 13 years.

The WRSD claims of declining enrollment numbers over the past decade are staggering: They have seen almost an 800-student decline in enrollment over the last decade (with 2024 enrollment at 6,630 students, that puts the loss of enrollment number at well over 10%).

However, the WRSD annual budget during that same period has increased by nearly 50%, from $81.3 million in 2015-16 to $121.9 million in 2024-25.

As a taxpayer contributing to the Wachusett Regional School District budget, I urge other taxpayers in the WRSD to start looking closely at how your tax dollars are spent in the school district and ask the question, ""How does an over 10% decrease in student enrollment equate to an over 50% increase in budgetary need during the same period?""

Kudos to Markey in EPA fight

Kudos to Sen. Ed Markey for taking on the absurd and scientifically ignorant EPA chief Lee Zeldin on the Trump lackey’s recent move to repeal the endangerment finding. The senator is entirely correct in denouncing these bureaucratic maneuverings as institutionalized corruption at an astonishingly high level.

Zeldin’s claims of cost reductions for automobile buyers are about as persuasive as the offer of a massive cash advance on a high-interest credit card. While sticker prices for cars and trucks may well drop, the externalities and collateral costs will rise astronomically, and the only people who’ll benefit financially from ending the endangerment finding are the unscrupulous billionaires whose interests are represented by the vacuously named Fiscal Alliance Foundation.

At a time when climate change is no longer a prediction but a phenomenon with real-life consequences, the EPA’s abandonment of its mission is a betrayal of the thousands of scientists and public servants who’ve dedicated their careers to improving the lives of ordinary Americans. We should call this what it is: a giveaway to the fossil fuel industry.

These heat waves put a strain on the power grid as homes and businesses crank up their air conditioning units, and everyday functions like refrigeration require more energy.
exclaimed Andrew McAllister, commissioner of the California Energy Commission, in a statement.
""Performance was consistent across the event, without major fluctuations or any attrition,"" said Ryan Hledik of the Brattle Group, which conducted an analysis of the VPP test, per Electrek.","In the largest test of its kind ever performed in California and potentially the world, energy from 100,000 home batteries across the state was used to supplement the power grid during a time of peak energy use, according to PG&E, a Northern California utility company.

""At exactly 7:00pm, a massive experiment began,"" PG&E said on its website. ""Across the state, thousands of Tesla Powerwalls and Sunrun home batteries kicked into action.""

""These weren't just helping individual homes–they were working together as one giant, invisible power plant.""

Put differently, instead of ramping up electricity production at large, centralized power plants to meet a temporary peak in demand, PG&E instead supplemented the power grid by drawing off the energy stored in roughly 100,000 home batteries.

""For two hours, this 'virtual power plant' (VPP) delivered 535 megawatts of electricity to the grid,"" PG&E explained. ""That's enough to power hundreds of thousands of homes during peak demand.""

The experiment, which was performed July 29 from 7 p.m. to 9 p.m., was intended to test the performance of the VPP prior to anticipated California heat waves in August and September.

These heat waves put a strain on the power grid as homes and businesses crank up their air conditioning units, and everyday functions like refrigeration require more energy.

In order to ensure that there will always be enough electricity for everyone, electrical grids must be designed with enough capacity to meet the system's peak demand. Adding extra capacity traditionally has meant building more large, centralized power plants.

Building new power plants can be very expensive and, depending on the kind of plant built, it also can be bad for public health and the environment. Plus, it means that much of the system's capacity goes unused at non-peak times.

By creating a VPP from thousands of home batteries, utility operators have hoped to meet peak demand without having to build additional power plants. The statewide VPP experiment was an effort to examine the feasibility of this model.

The test was a resounding success.

""VPPs deliver for the grid!"" exclaimed Andrew McAllister, commissioner of the California Energy Commission, in a statement. ""The test embodies California's innovation economy by applying digital tools to access and aggregate untapped electric resources - supporting grid reliability and helping manage electricity costs.""

Third-party analysts agreed.

""Performance was consistent across the event, without major fluctuations or any attrition,"" said Ryan Hledik of the Brattle Group, which conducted an analysis of the VPP test, per Electrek. Hledik said the test showed ""dependable, planning-grade performance at scale.""

In addition to knowing that they are contributing to their neighbors' energy needs, owners of home battery systems often receive a financial incentive to participate in the program. For example, Sunrun offers customers $150 per battery per season to be a part of the VPP, according to Electrek.

""We're all connected to the same grid, and small contributions from many individuals add up to hugely important, shared benefits,"" said McAllister, the CEC commissioner. ""Even bigger, better things to come!""

Pairing a home battery system with solar panels makes your home more resilient in the event of a power outage, while also lowering your energy bill to practically zero.

The company Magic Valley Energy had sought a permit to build more than 200 wind turbines that would generate an expected 1,000 megawatts.
President Donald Trump temporarily halted the project through an executive order in January, the Idaho Capital Sun reported.
“Idahoans have spoken loud and clear over the last few years: the Lava Ridge Wind Project has no place in our state,” Simpson said Wednesday in an emailed statement.
“Today’s decision confirms that common sense and the will of the people prevailed.” Crapo also celebrated the decision.","The U.S. Department of the Interior announced Wednesday that the Lava Ridge Wind Project is officially canceled.

Department of the Interior Secretary Doug Burgum said he would reverse approval of the large wind farm project that had been approved to be built outside of Twin Falls on land managed by the federal Bureau of Land Management, or BLM.

The company Magic Valley Energy had sought a permit to build more than 200 wind turbines that would generate an expected 1,000 megawatts.

Burgum said in a press release Wednesday that his office reviewed the decision approving the project and “discovered crucial legal deficiencies in the issuance of the approval.”

The project, which began permitting in 2019, drew deep criticism from Idaho Republican officials, including Governor Brad Little, U.S. Rep Mike Simpson and U.S. Senators Jim Risch and Mike Crapo. President Donald Trump temporarily halted the project through an executive order in January, the Idaho Capital Sun reported. His order directed the federal agency to review the project.

“Idahoans have spoken loud and clear over the last few years: the Lava Ridge Wind Project has no place in our state,” Simpson said Wednesday in an emailed statement. “Today’s decision confirms that common sense and the will of the people prevailed.”

Crapo also celebrated the decision.

“This harmful proposal by the previous Administration willfully neglected widespread opposition from the local community,” Crapo said in a statement. “I am glad to see President Donald Trump fulfilling his commitment to making sure Idaho voices on this matter were heard and respected.”

Little in January also issued an executive order in tandem with the presidents’ to direct state agencies to cooperate with the review of the project and encourage the public to share their concerns about it with the federal agency.

Environmental groups encourage other renewable energy projects

When the president first halted the project, the environmental group Idaho Conservation League argued that other renewable energy projects should be considered, especially in Idaho where much of the state’s energy is imported from elsewhere.

Citicore, which is one of the Philippines' largest solar energy producers, is expecting a ninefold increase in production capacity by the end of next year, company CEO Oliver Tan told Reuters.

The company has planned a 1-gigawatt increase in capacity by the end of 2025 and a further 1.17 GW in 2026, bringing its capacity to 2.56 GW.

Even at its current limited capacity, Citicore is the second-largest provider of solar energy in the Philippines, but its push is part of a larger shift in the nation's energy consumption.

The Philippines long relied heavily on coal to provide its power; in 2023, it passed Indonesia as the most coal-dependent nation in all of South Asia, according to Reuters.

Coal is a massive source of both air and water pollution when burned for fuel; it pumps carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, contributing to our warming planet, as well as particulates that can cause respiratory issues and cancer, according to Environment America.

The ash created from burning it poses a serious threat to waterways, and the process of mining it devastates the ecosystems around it.

The country's green energy capacity jumped by 10 percent in 2024, according to government data reported by Reuters. That 9.2 GW of power was more green energy than had been added in the previous three years combined.

Citicore isn't done yet, though. The additions this year are part of a larger plan to add a full 5 GW of solar energy to the Philippine grid by 2030, as the country looks to increase the percentage of its energy that comes from solar power from 3.5 percent to 5.6 percent by 2030.

General Motors Co. will import batteries from China for the upcoming electric Chevrolet Bolt as it works to get a U.S. plant up and running.

GM will buy lithium-iron-phosphate batteries from China’s Contemporary Amperex Technology Co. Ltd., the Wall Street Journal first reported Thursday and a source close to the matter confirmed to The Detroit News on Friday.

Ford Motor Co. also has an agreement to license technology from the Chinese battery giant for a multibillion-dollar battery plant in south-central Michigan, a deal that has faced some political backlash.

“For several years, other U.S. automakers have depended on foreign suppliers for LFP battery sourcing and licensing,” according to a GM statement. “To stay competitive, GM will temporarily source these packs from similar suppliers to power our most affordable EV model. We’re proud that we sell 12 EVs in the U.S. using domestically-produced battery cells, and in 2027 we will bring LFP production to the U.S, further cementing our unique and resilient US-based supply chain.”

The deal highlights the difficulties U.S. manufacturers face to onshore production in response to President Donald Trump’s tariffs.

GM last month unveiled a plan to produce lithium-iron-phosphate batteries in Tennessee in partnership with LG Energy Solution. But production of those EV batteries, which are cheaper to make because of higher iron content, is not expected to begin until 2027.

In the meantime, GM is willing to pay import taxes in exchange for more affordable batteries to go in the redesigned Bolt, a cult favorite discontinued in 2023. The new Bolt is scheduled to begin production late this year at GM’s Fairfax Assembly plant in Kansas.

GM introduced its Bolt to the market in late 2016 and began selling the larger Bolt EUV in 2021. In 2021, the automaker had to recall all Bolts for battery fire risk as the result of manufacturing defects.

Analysts say a key to EV adoption in the United States is affordability, as most EVs are priced at several thousand dollars more than gas-powered counterparts.

It's an investment that proponents say could help change the way America powers its vehicles, homes, and cities.

At 4.7 million square feet — roughly the size of 225 football fields — the $4 billion plant promises to boost clean energy and, in doing so, help cities cut costs and reduce pollution that harms human health.

Mass-producing batteries domestically helps simplify supply chains and potentially lower EV prices, which can also save money for consumers and businesses.

Battery storage also enables more efficient use of renewables like solar. Paired with home panels, the systems can reduce reliance on fossil fuels and cut utility bills. Visit TCD's solar panel guide for installation guidance.

The plant is Panasonic's second in the U.S. It built another within Tesla's Gigafactory campus in Nevada.

The factory is also the largest economic development project in the history of Kansas. Developers say it will bring 4,000 manufacturing jobs and 8,000 extra roles further down its supply chain, Inside EVs reported.

Not only that, but the news outlet reported that it ""comes at a critical moment for EVs in the U.S.""

Global EV demand has softened, and Tesla has seen a slowdown in sales in 2025, with second-quarter deliveries falling 13%. However, the Kansas plant is a strategic hedge. Panasonic said it plans to diversify its customer base beyond Tesla, already supplying Lucid and Mazda.

The Gifford Fire, about 125 miles (201 kilometers) northwest of Los Angeles, had burned 113,648 acres and was 21% contained through Saturday, according to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, commonly known as Cal Fire. So far, 809 people have been evacuated and the Los Padres National Forest was closed because of the flames. There are 3,935 fire crews and support staff on the scene, and at least seven have been injured, according to a joint statement by Cal Fire, the US Forest Service and several local agencies.

The Gifford blaze is the largest of 14 fires across the state, according to Cal Fire.

Large wildfires in Colorado have also caused air quality to drop there, the US National Weather Service said. Alerts are out across western portions of the state, including Vail, the agency said.

Meanwhile, smoke from forest fires in Canada has once again crossed into the US causing air quality alerts to be posted in Minnesota and parts of Wisconsin, the National Weather Service said. There’s also a dense smoke advisory in place across northeast parts of Montana. Across the border, air quality warnings are also in place for parts of Saskatchewan and Manitoba, Environment and Climate Change Canada said.

Across Canada, 714 active fires are burning with 166 raging out of control, according to the Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre. So far this year, 4,277 blazes have charred 7.3 million acres. In the US, there have been 42,854 fires reported on 3.5 million acres, the US National Interagency Fire Center said. While the number of US fires exceeds last year’s 32,727 by this date, the acreage burned is less than the more than 5 million acres consumed a year ago.

US heat advisories and extreme heat warnings are posted across parts of the west, including California, Nevada, Arizona, Oregon, Washington and Idaho. Phoenix is forecast to reach 108F (42C) Sunday, a dip from the record temperatures that gripped the fifth most-populous US city last week.

Phoenix set a new August high temperature of 118F on Thursday.

In New York City and elsewhere in the Northeast, temperatures are set to rise. As many as 12 records may be tied or broken across the region in the coming week, the US Weather Prediction Center said.

Flood watches have been posted across the Midwest, including Milwaukee, the weather service said. The Milwaukee River in Estabrook Park has risen more than 8 feet in the last day cresting at a new record of 11.19 feet, the weather service said.

The US National Hurricane Center is watching two potential storms both in the central Atlantic far from land.

The first is a disorganized patch of thunderstorms that’s moving north into the Atlantic with a 20% chance of becoming a storm in the next week. The second is a broad area of low pressure that is moving off Africa with a 70% chance of becoming a tropical storm or hurricane in the coming week.

The remnants of Tropical Storm Dexter, which has crossed the Atlantic Ocean toward Europe, will set the stage for warmer temperatures to filter in across the UK and Ireland, the UK Met Office said.

So much so that some people around the world are already saying goodbye to wind power after this technological innovation.
Worldwide: According to HTF Market Intelligence, the global offshore solar energy market is expected to grow from US$85 billion to over US$268 billion by 2029.","In the coming years, it won’t be unusual to look out to sea and see veritable “technology islands” floating on the horizon, as is the case now. However, it’s worth noting that these aren’t oil platforms, but rather something much cleaner, quieter, and more ambitious: gigantic solar power plants floating offshore. This is because, instead of occupying agricultural land or urban rooftops, a new generation of energy is emerging directly from the water, literally. This is a bold engineering feat that could transform the seas into strategic allies in the race for clean energy.

Will floating solar conquer the seas or sink under the pressure of the waves?

To better understand this, imagine a floating solar platform the size of 14 football fields. Now, think about it operating offshore, facing waves of up to 8 meters, constant winds, and intense salinity, all without losing efficiency. According to Saipem to Offshore Energy:

“XolarSurf represents a new frontier in floating solar energy, and can be installed anywhere coastal or offshore, even in harsh environmental conditions. It offers an ideal solution for hybrid projects, such as offshore wind farms, both fixed and floating.”

This technology stands out for several reasons, including: it eliminates the need to occupy valuable land; it leverages existing offshore structures, such as wind turbines; it can be scaled up massively, reducing production costs; and the design allows the panels to be moved, reused, or expanded according to energy demand.

Norway just wrote the rulebook: will floating solar now outshine offshore wind?

And which country made all this possible? We’re talking about Norway, which has just released the first official “instruction manual” for installing floating solar power plants offshore. This guide was produced by DNV, a global leader in technical certification, based on a project by the Norwegian company Moss Maritime. This document is even more than a technical tutorial. It serves as a security seal, validating that the technology can be installed reliably, even in the rough waters of the North Sea. It covers the following points:

Safe mooring strategies

Resistance to waves, winds, and currents

Reduction in installation failures

Sharing infrastructure with floating wind turbines

“Compared to wind turbines, solar systems are simpler, cheaper to build, and easier to scale,” says Alexander Minge Thøgersen, VP of Moss Maritime. So much so that some people around the world are already saying goodbye to wind power after this technological innovation. Now, considering who will benefit most, we can even say the entire world, but we separate two main groups:

Aquaculture and isolated communities: Offshore fish farms, for example, require constant power, but are far from the coast and traditional infrastructure. XolarSurf provides clean energy to remote locations, with consumption ranging from 4 to 715 MWh per year.

Worldwide: According to HTF Market Intelligence, the global offshore solar energy market is expected to grow from US$85 billion to over US$268 billion by 2029.

The sun sets on land-based solar: Is the ocean our next power grid?

We need to keep in mind that what Norway has done isn’t just launching a new technology. It’s actually paving a reliable path for the entire world to follow. The creation of the DNV technical manual means other countries now have a safe model to replicate. Furthermore, by utilizing existing structures (such as wind turbine power export cables), deployment costs drop dramatically.

This makes the model viable even for developing countries. The next energy revolution won’t just happen on rooftops or deserts, but also on the high seas. And perhaps the next time you look at the ocean, you’ll see not just waves, but the future shining in the sunlight. That’s why it’s worth mentioning this other eye-catching invention: floating hybrid solar panels.

The U.S. EPA announced Thursday the termination of the $7 billion Solar for All program.

Cincinnati Director of Environment and Sustainability Oliver Kroner says the city planned to use the grant to build a community solar array on a former landfill.

""[It] would provide solar power to 1,300 low-income households in Cincinnati,"" Kroner told WVXU. ""And as part of the grant, we were committed to achieving 20% reduction in energy bills.""

Kroner says the city is evaluating whether the project can move forward with other sources of funding.

""There were a variety of funding sources that the federal government made available between grants and tax credits,"" Kroner said. ""We're watching most of that be eliminated this calendar year. So that changes the financial modeling that we're looking at.""

Cincinnati is a sub-recipient of a Solar for All award to the Industrial Heartland Solar Coalition. Four other Ohio cities are sub-recipients: Akron, Cleveland, Columbus, and Dayton. Each city would have utilized the funding in different ways to promote solar energy and energy savings for low-income households.

A joint statement from all five mayors urges federal officials to preserve Solar for All.

""Electricity bills and broader cost of living expenses are rising, and the Trump Administration is cutting a program that would save participating Ohio households, on average, nearly $400 per year on their utility bills,"" the statement says. ""Terminating Solar for All funding, including grants already awarded, is harmful. It strips away critical planned resources for home energy upgrades, including rooftop solar, to address energy affordability in our communities.""

Separately, Solar for All awarded the state of Ohio a grant of $156,120,000; although specific plans had not yet been announced, the money would have been administered through the Ohio Air Quality Development Authority and the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency.

NPR reports there may be legal challenges over the cancellation of Solar for All grants, since the money has already been obligated.

Although many use these two terms interchangeably, clean energy and green energy are not synonyms.","If you're interested in socially responsible investing, have you thought about investing in renewable energy sources? With a rise in investment opportunities, green energy is becoming one of the most attractive areas for investors.

This global shift happened due to a number of reasons, from climate change challenges to the financial aspect of energy production.

All of this makes investing in green energy not only environmentally responsible but also a lucrative financial opportunity for long-term wealth.

If you're not familiar with the renewable energy industry, this article aims to explore renewable sources, the best ways to invest in them, and whether you need a financial advisor or not.

Short Summary

Renewable energy derives from natural sources that are replenished at a faster rate than they are consumed.

Renewable energy sources include sunlight, wind, water, and geothermal heat as an alternative solution for fossil fuels.

Current best investment opportunities are renewable energy stocks and mutual funds, green energy ETFs, energy storage, etc.

Energy Transition from Fossil Fuels

Fossil fuels were once the backbone of global energy but are now losing their dominance. Investors are increasingly recognizing the risks associated with coal, oil, and gas, and many are reallocating capital into green energy.

Investing in fossil fuels implies high risks, such as stranded assets, market volatility, and divestment trends.

On the other hand, this global shift towards the green energy sector comes with numerous benefits. Higher returns on renewable energy, government incentives, and public and corporate pressure are the most obvious ones.

Investing in fossil fuels is not profitable in the long run because of the strict regulations and competition. Investing in renewable energy, on the other hand, is on the rise due to increasing demand and tech improvements.

When investing both short- and long-term, considering factors like government support and market stability is essential.

That is why so many investors are now moving their assets toward the clean energy sector. After all, it's a smart financial move to invest in something that is the way of the future.

Climate Change

Although investors don't make their decisions based on sustainability, it's a key factor in this energy transition. Climate change has become a powerful force in shaping global financial markets, pushing investors toward clean energy solutions.

As extreme weather events, rising temperatures, and policy changes intensify, investment in renewable energy is more than just an ethical choice.

Stricter climate policies that favor green energy investments while discouraging fossil fuel dependency. Carbon taxes, emission regulations, net-zero commitments, and green incentives are making investment in traditional sources a risky choice.

That is why climate-conscious investors are shifting capital toward more sustainable resources. Two of the most popular choices at the moment are ESG (Environmental, Social, Governance) funds and green bonds.

Keep in mind that pension funds, hedge funds, and asset managers prioritize climate-friendly investments. When it comes to green bonds, many governments and corporations issue green bonds to fund renewable projects. This makes these two types of investments very interesting to a range of investors.

Energy Security

Energy security refers to the availability of a reliable and affordable energy supply. As the world shifts away from fossil fuels, clean energy investments play a crucial role in ensuring long-term energy stability.

On the other hand, investing in solar, wind, and hydropower ensures locally produced, stable energy sources.

By using local, naturally replenished sources like the sun and wind, renewable energy reduces risks like trade restrictions, sanctions, and conflicts.

Governments and corporations are accelerating investments in renewables to reduce energy dependence and enhance national security. They are moving away from fossil fuels towards clean energy. This energy transition has been noticeable for several years now, and it's expected to continue in the future.

Electric Vehicles as the Key Driver of Energy Transition

The electric vehicle revolution is undoubtedly crucial for the green energy transition. As governments push for net-zero emissions and consumers demand cleaner transportation, the EV industry is becoming one of the most attractive investment opportunities in green energy.

Governments worldwide are setting EV adoption targets and banning gas-powered cars. That also implies a higher need for clean electricity and charging infrastructure.

This makes this area of renewable energy great for investments and essential for the overall transition towards clean energy. If you're interested in investing in the EV market, you should take a look at companies such as Tesla, BYD, Rivian, and Lucid Motors.

These three manufacturers are leaders in the market, ensuring growth and stability for investments. They owe their successes to exquisite renewable technologies focused on offering positive answers to climate change.

Before investing, make sure you learn to differentiate natural gas vehicles (NGV) from EVs. Only electric vehicles offer zero tailpipe emissions, while natural gas companies provide lower fuel costs and established refueling infrastructure.

Renewable Energy in Manufacturing Facilities

Manufacturing is a critical part of the renewable energy investment ecosystem. From solar panels and wind turbines to EV batteries and hydrogen fuel cells, clean energy manufacturing facilities are scaling up to meet the increasing demand for renewable technologies.

Investing in companies that build or operate solar panel factories, battery plants, and wind turbine facilities is a smart investment move. In fact, numerous countries are onshoring green energy production to reduce reliance on imports.

As renewable energy adoption accelerates, the demand for solar panels, wind turbines, EVs, and battery storage will skyrocket.

Investing in companies building and operating manufacturing facilities ensures exposure to the entire green energy supply chain.

Green Energy Mutual Funds

Investing in green energy mutual funds is a great way to gain diversified exposure to the growing renewable energy sector without having to pick individual stocks.

These funds are invested in companies across the world that are involved in offering green solutions and products.

If you decide to invest in mutual funds, you should know they are managed by financial experts who research and select the best-performing assets. This simplifies the work as you don't need to track individual stocks or time the market yourself.

When it comes to leading mutual funds in this industry, these are the best investing opportunities:

Naturally Replenished Resources: Solar, Wind, Geothermal Heat, and Hydroelectric Power

One of the biggest advantages of the clean power sector is that it relies on naturally replenished resources. These resources are the sun, wind, water, and geothermal heat.

They provide a sustainable, long-term investment opportunity, reducing reliance on finite fossil fuels and ensuring energy security for the future.

Unlike oil and gas, which are depleting and volatile, hydro, solar, and wind energy are abundant and continuously replenished. Also, the cost of solar and wind energy has dropped significantly, making them more competitive than fossil fuels.

What's important to highlight is that naturally replenished resources reduce dependence on unstable regions, ensuring a more secure energy future.

For the past decades, oil and gas prices have fluctuated due to political conflicts and supply chain disruptions. By using natural resources, these investments become resilient to geopolitical and market risks.

If you're looking to make good investments in this sector, consider investing in companies that work with:

Solar power (solar panels)

Wind power (wind turbines)

Hydropower

Geothermal energy

The Future of Renewable Energy Investment

Green energy investment is becoming one of the most promising and profitable opportunities for the future. Driven by climate policies, technological advancements, and increasing demand for clean energy, the green energy sector is expected to see exponential growth in the coming decade.

Governments across the world are offering tax incentives, grants, and subsidies for renewable energy projects. Even major corporations like Amazon, Google, and Tesla are investing heavily in renewable energy projects and sustainable technology.

The cost of solar panels and wind turbines has dropped significantly, making them cheaper than fossil fuels in many regions.

All of this is skyrocketing the popularity of clean electricity, electric vehicles, and sustainable infrastructure. Consumers and businesses seek eco-friendly solutions, and businesses are transforming their way of doing business to respond to that demand.

It is estimated that this market will reach $2 trillion by 2030, according to the International Energy Agency. This makes it one of the fastest-growing investment sectors. Whether through stocks, ETFs, mutual funds, or direct investments, now is definitely the best time to capitalize on the renewable energy boom.

That said, it will still take a while until we see the entire world transitioning completely to renewable sources. Such a transition requires infrastructure and high initial costs, making this process long. Although any eco-friendly business is projected to be a leader in its industry, not all businesses have the resources to move to greener solutions overnight. All of this will impact investors all around the world, marking a trend for everyone with an investment portfolio.

Conclusion

The shift toward alternative energy is no longer just a trend—it’s a defining move toward a more sustainable and resilient global economy. As traditional energy sources lose ground, renewables offer both environmental and financial benefits. With growing support from governments and corporations, investing in green energy is a smart, future-focused decision that combines long-term growth with real-world impact. Now is the time to take part in shaping the future of energy.

The real-estate mogul turned authoritarian president has long railed against green energy — with a notorious enmity toward windmills, which he bizarrely blames for whale mania and for ruining the offshore vibes of his Scottish golf course.

But Trump also governs like a reactionary when it comes to electricity generated by the sun, renewable power that has exploded in popularity — particularly in red America. Of the top 10 states with the most solar installed last quarter, eight were states Trump won, ranging from Texas to Idaho to Pennsylvania.

Why does Trump hate solar?

The impulse appears to be driven in equal parts by a desire to trash Joe Biden’s legacy, in particular the Inflation Reduction Act, which spurred record green investment. Trump is also transparently seeking to boost the profits of fossil fuel producers, including from methane, oil and coal. (Trump really has a kink for coal). The industry backed Trump’s candidacy to the hilt, and the president is now paying them back — with a crusade for dirty-energy “dominance.”

Trump’s war against solar is happening at a moment when server farms and data centers — including those inflating an artificial intelligence bubble — are spiking demand for electricity, spiking inflation in electricity costs.

Trump is also acting to hobble solar energy even as the world reels from the impacts of carbon-boosted warming, like megafires, superstorms, and deadly heatwaves. Meanwhile, the Trump administration is attempting to make climate denial official policy, with the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) poised to jettison the “endangerment” finding that has enabled the federal government to regulate greenhouse pollution as a threat to human health.

Below a survey of the steps Trump is taking to cast a shadow over solar energy development:

Revoking Solar Tax Credit for Home Owners

Trump has succeeded, through his mega tax-cut-and-spend legislation known as the Big Beautiful Bill, in dismantling key features of the Inflation Reduction Act, which provided Americans with generous incentives to adopt clean power.

Editor’s picks

For homeowners, that included a federal tax credit covering 30 percent of the cost of rooftop home solar installations, typically defraying about $9,000 of the upfront investment. Under Biden’s legislation, that tax credit was funded through 2034. But Trump’s BBB abruptly nixes the credit at the close of this year. (Homeowners looking to take advantage of the credit should act quickly; new systems need to be online before the dawn of 2026.)

Pulling Federal Support From Solar Manufacturers

Biden’s strategy of green energy investment was about more than lowering carbon emissions — it was about reviving America’s industrial base. In 2022, Biden invoked the Defense Production Act to boost the domestic solar production. Adopted during the Cold War, the DPA was intended to ensure that American industry could produce “technology items essential to the national defense.”

Biden’s order put the Department of Energy to work backing domestic solar manufacturers. Jennifer Granholm, then the Energy Secretary, touted that the investment would “increase national security, promote energy independence, help to address the urgent threat of climate change, and drive down energy costs for American consumers.”

But this March, Trump revoked that authority — with his own executive order, blasting Biden’s use of the DPA as a “Green New Scam” while decrying his predecessor’s “mandates for… solar panels.”

Blocking Solar Development on Federal Land

Trump plucked his Interior Secretary from the governor’s mansion of the petrostate of North Dakota. And Doug Bugum has continued to boost the drill-baby-drill contingent with land-use restrictions that only fossil fuel lobbyists could love.

On August 1, Burgum unveiled new guidelines to block solar (as well as wind) development on federal lands, on the basis of a measurement of “capacity density” — or how many megawatts of energy is delivered by each acre developed.

Solar and wind projects are, by nature of the technology, distributed; they require a significant amount of surface area to produce meaningful amounts of power. The Trump administration is suddenly acting as though federal land is in scarce supply and must be jealously defended against green energy land grabs. (This is the same administration that wanted to sell off five percent of federal land for vacation home and golf course development under the Big Beautiful Bill.)

Burgum’s order clarifies that the Interior Department manages a vast portfolio of land — 245 million acres with an additional 3 billion acres of the continental shelf offshore. But it argues — “based on common sense, arithmetic, and physics” — that because fossil fuel facilities can deliver more energy bang for the acre buck that “wind and solar projects are highly inefficient uses of federal lands.”

Burgum even advances an argument that green energy projects could be illegal, alleging that the “disproportionate land use” of renewable power begs “the question on whether the use of federal lands for any wind and solar projects is consistent with the law.”

Unveiling the order, Burgum claimed that “gargantuan, unreliable, intermittent energy projects hold America back from achieving U.S. energy dominance,” insisting they also create a heavy burden for “the American taxpayer and environment.”

‘Pulling the Rug’ on a GOP Deal

The Burgum ban on solar development came in the wake of a Trump executive order titled: “ENDING MARKET DISTORTING SUBSIDIES FOR UNRELIABLE, FOREIGN CONTROLLED ENERGY SOURCES.”

In that order, Trump called for an immediate halt of all federal tax support for clean energy projects. “For too long, the federal government has forced American taxpayers to subsidize expensive and unreliable energy sources like wind and solar,” the order states. It calls on the Treasury Department to “strictly enforce the termination of the clean electricity production and investment tax credits… for wind and solar facilities.”

Not unlike the subsidies for homeowners, these are generous tax credits for utility scale green energy projects. The Trump rush order is being interpreted as an attempt to scuttle an important concession secured by Republicans in the Senate to slow the phase-out of tax credits under Trump’s Big Beautiful Bill.

The deal secured a one-year grace period for projects already in the pipeline to begin construction and still qualify for the incentives. One of the negotiators, Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska), told the Anchorage Daily News that Trump’s order “just pulls the rug out from underneath the deal,” calling it “a total affront to what we had negotiated.” Murkowski was the key vote needed to pass the Big Beautiful Bill.

The dealmakers are not taking the kick in the teeth lightly. Two GOP senators, Charles Grassley of Iowa and John Curtis of Utah, have placed holds on Trump nominations for key Treasury roles in an effort to get the White House to stand down and honor his law.

Taxing Panel Imports

Trump’s war on solar is not new. He got his licks in against solar panels in his first term imposing steep tariffs on panels imported from China. (This is one area of policy where the Biden administration ultimately aligned with Trump, imposing even higher tariffs to help boost domestic solar manufacturers.)

Such protectionism — many environmentalists and economists argue — is self-defeating. First, the dire risks from global warming demand proliferation of green power as quickly as possible. Second, the manufacture of solar panels does little for American jobs, while legions of installers and electricians gain employment when panels are cheap. (A new study finds the original Trump trade distortions cost American consumers billions through 2020.)

Trump’s latest economic disruptions, imposing indiscriminate country-based tariffs are already causing new problems for the solar economy, according to the industry’s trade association, which warns of “supply chain shifts and potential project delays or cancellations, particularly in the utility-scale segment.”

Clawing Back Solar for Non-Rich Folks

The Trump administration is reportedly continuing its quest to claw back already-appropriated funds for clean energy programs.

In the quiet expanses of Maine, where pine forests meet rugged coastlines, a new force is quietly reshaping the state’s energy dynamics. The artificial intelligence boom, fueled by sprawling data centers, is driving unprecedented electricity consumption across the U.S., and Maine is feeling the ripple effects. According to a recent report from the Portland Press Herald, while Maine hasn’t yet become a hotspot for these energy-intensive facilities, the national trend is pushing up costs that could soon impact local residents and businesses.

Data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration highlights a stark reality: residential electricity prices in Maine jumped 36.3% between May 2024 and May 2025, one of the highest increases nationwide. This surge coincides with a broader uptick in demand from AI operations, as noted in an analysis by Axios, where the national average rose by 6.5%. Experts attribute part of this to the power-hungry nature of data centers, which require constant, massive energy inputs to run servers for AI training and cloud computing.

Maine’s Unique Position

Unlike states like Virginia or Texas, which host clusters of data centers, Maine has largely been spared direct influxes of these facilities. State officials, as reported in the Portland Press Herald, are actively working to mitigate potential impacts, emphasizing renewable energy sources and grid enhancements. However, the interconnected nature of the U.S. power grid means that demand spikes elsewhere can influence regional prices, including in New England.

Posts on X (formerly Twitter) reflect growing public concern, with users highlighting how AI-driven data centers are straining supplies and inflating bills. One sentiment echoes warnings about unreliable power in Maine deterring new data center investments, while others point to national cost increases linked to tech giants’ expansions. This aligns with findings from the International Energy Agency, which predicts AI will surge data center electricity demand globally, potentially transforming energy sectors through efficiency gains but also heightening short-term pressures.

Economic Implications for Residents

For Maine’s households, the cost implications are tangible. The state’s already high electricity rates—among the nation’s steepest—are exacerbated by factors like transmission infrastructure investments needed to handle projected loads. A CBS News investigation reveals that utilities are building out capacity for AI demands, with ratepayers often footing the bill through higher tariffs.

Industry insiders note that between 2024 and 2025, data center power usage contributed to an estimated $9 billion in added energy costs nationwide, as detailed in reports from Maine Morning Star. In Maine, this translates to potential monthly bill hikes, prompting calls for policy interventions like separate rate classes for high-usage corporate consumers to shield residential users.

Policy Responses and Future Outlook

Maine’s Public Utilities Commission is exploring strategies to balance growth with affordability, including incentives for renewable integration. As per insights from The Washington Post, similar challenges in states like Ohio underscore the need for proactive measures, such as mandating clean energy for new data centers.

Looking ahead, the tension between AI innovation and energy sustainability will define Maine’s approach. While the state avoids immediate grid overloads, experts warn that without robust planning, costs could climb further. The Daily Caller reports on spiking utility bills amid skyrocketing demand, a trend Maine officials aim to counter through diversified energy sources. Ultimately, as AI evolves, so too must the frameworks ensuring equitable cost distribution.

Innovations and Mitigations

Emerging technologies offer hope. AI itself could optimize energy use in data centers, reducing waste through predictive algorithms, as suggested by the International Energy Agency. In Maine, investments in wind and solar could offset demands, potentially stabilizing prices.

Yet, challenges persist. X posts from energy watchers criticize the lack of reliable power as a barrier to attracting data centers, while others decry the environmental toll. A Fox News piece details how AI facilities in 13 states have driven 20% bill increases, urging regulatory scrutiny. For industry insiders, the key lies in collaborative efforts between tech firms, utilities, and policymakers to harness AI’s potential without burdening consumers.

Broader National Context

Nationally, the story mirrors Maine’s: data centers now consume more power than entire cities, per WebProNews. In hotspots like Louisiana, costs have risen sharply due to new facilities, as covered by Axios New Orleans.

Maine’s sparing from this boom provides a window for strategic positioning. By prioritizing sustainable expansions, the state could emerge as a model for balancing tech growth with energy equity, avoiding the pitfalls seen elsewhere. As 2025 progresses, monitoring these developments will be crucial for stakeholders navigating this high-stakes intersection of innovation and infrastructure.",https://www.webpronews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/xai-tmp-imgen-a9661f5b-ee37-4109-9b63-5190d636760c.jpeg,N,,2025-08-10 13:07:49.711550

If you care about climate, you can choose to source more of your electricity from renewable energy. Your utility predicts demand accurately, plans its investments sensibly, and ensures electricity remains affordable. Would you pay a little more?

This vision is not a distant fantasy. In countries across Europe, North America, and increasingly in Asia, smart grids-grids that are digitally managed, automated, and adaptive-are making such reliability a standard feature, not a luxury. In India’s industrial hubs and Vietnam’s growing manufacturing zones, grid stability is no longer seen as an engineering challenge alone, but as a prerequisite for economic competitiveness.

What is a Smart Grid?

A Smart Grid is an electricity network enhanced with digital technology to allow two-way flows of both electricity and information. It continuously monitors its own performance, detects faults, and makes adjustments to ensure power quality and reliability. In practical terms, this means fewer and shorter outages, better voltage and frequency control, and more flexibility to integrate renewable power sources like solar and wind.

In the traditional model, electricity flows in one direction-from power plants to transmission lines, to distribution networks, and finally to consumers. Operators have limited visibility of what is happening at any point in the system, and response to faults often relies on manual checks and phone calls.

Reliability and Power Quality

To appreciate the value of smart grids, we can start with some basics from high school physics. Electrical power systems in Bangladesh are designed to operate at a frequency of 50 hertz (Hz). This means the alternating current reverses direction 50 times per second. Frequency stability is essential because many devices and industrial processes depend on a constant speed of electrical cycles.

Two measures-System Average Interruption Frequency Index (SAIFI) and System Average Interruption Duration Index (SAIDI)-ensure reliability from the consumer’s perspective. SAIFI records how often, on average, a customer experiences a power outage in a year. SAIDI measures the total duration of those outages. Low SAIFI and SAIDI values are the hallmark of a reliable grid.

Voltage control is equally critical. Voltage can be thought of as the pressure in the electrical system, pushing current through wires and into devices. Too high a voltage can damage sensitive equipment; too low a voltage can cause motors to run inefficiently or stall. Voltage fluctuations also accelerate wear and tear on machinery, leading to higher maintenance costs.

The health of an economy’s industrial base is tied to these technical details. Inconsistent power quality slows production, reduces output, and can deter foreign investors who rely on guaranteed uptime.

Technologies that Enable Smart Grids

Smart Grids are built on a foundation of integrated technologies. The Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) system is the operational nerve centre, allowing utilities to monitor and control substations, feeders, and other assets in real time. SCADA systems collect and display data from sensors, giving operators the ability to respond quickly to faults.

The Advanced Distribution Management System (ADMS) adds intelligence to SCADA. It automates network switching, optimises power flows, and integrates outage management. An Outage Management System (OMS) identifies the exact location of a fault and helps dispatch crews more effectively.

Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI) is another key piece. Smart meters measure electricity consumption in real time and send this data back to the utility automatically. This enables accurate billing, faster detection of outages, and demand management programmes that encourage consumers to shift usage away from peak times.

Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESS) store surplus electricity during low-demand periods and release it when demand peaks. This smoothens out fluctuations, supports frequency control, and enables greater use of intermittent renewable energy.

Bangladesh’s Progress So Far

Several initiatives are underway, though most remain limited in scope. Dhaka Power Distribution Company (DPDC) has begun a smart grid pilot with funding support from the European Union and implementation by AFD, focusing on automation and power quality improvement. Northern Electricity Supply Company (NESCO) is implementing SCADA, OMS, GIS, and a substantial smart meter rollout

In the west, the West Zone Power Distribution Company (WZPDCL) has deployed automation projects, while the Bangladesh Rural Electrification Board (BREB) is rolling out hundreds of thousands of smart meters. These are promising steps, but they are fragmented. Without integration, common data standards, and sector-wide capacity building, these projects cannot deliver the full benefits of a Smart Grid.

Financing and Incentives

Smart Grid deployment demands substantial capital investment. Experience from other countries shows that well-planned projects can recover costs through operational savings and efficiency gains within five to seven years. Yet in Bangladesh, the regulatory framework often undermines incentives for utilities. Efficiency improvements can lead to tariff adjustments that erase any financial gains, discouraging investment in modernisation.

Picture: Bangladesh Energy Curve, retrieved on 8 August 2025

Reforming tariff structures to reward performance, allowing differentiated service levels, and creating market mechanisms for ancillary services-such as frequency control provided by batteries-can attract both domestic and foreign capital. Public-private partnerships could finance elements like EV charging infrastructure and large-scale battery storage.

Lessons from Regional Peers

India has made significant progress in integrating renewable energy into its grid, using wide-area monitoring systems and automated generation control to manage variability. Vietnam has expanded transmission capacity and invested in storage to smoothen out solar generation spikes. Malaysia is upgrading its grid to attract data centre investments, viewing power quality as a cornerstone of its digital economy ambitions.

These examples highlight a critical point: grid modernisation is not just about engineering-it is an economic strategy. Countries that invest in reliable, high-quality electricity supply position themselves to capture the industries of the future.

The Case for Smart Grids: Why is it NOW and not in FUTURE

If you look at the chart below, it illustrates how Bangladesh’s power system draws from a complex mix of fuel and supply sources-domestic gas, imported power via HVDC links, coal, hydro, solar, heavy fuel oil, and cross-border contracts with Tripura and Adani-while managing shortfalls at peak times. Balancing these diverse inputs is a constant operational challenge, with each source carrying different costs, ramping capabilities, and reliability profiles. A smart grid, with advanced forecasting, real-time monitoring, and control can really keep the costs down.

The case for Smart Grids in Bangladesh is also urgent on the distribution side, because of the volume of power the utilities are having to handle. According to utility-wise demand handling of power in IEPMP 2022, Bangladesh has a different hallmark. It is dominated by small consumers, in geographically diverse settings.

The future economy will be driven by sectors that demand uninterrupted, high-quality power: advanced manufacturing, semiconductor fabrication, artificial intelligence data centres, and high-end services. Regional competitors are already upgrading their grids to meet these requirements. Bangladesh must act quickly to remain competitive.

Major blackouts in 2014 and 2022 demonstrated the vulnerability of the current system. Without fast detection and response capabilities, small faults cascaded into nationwide outages. Every such event imposes a hidden tax on the economy in the form of lost production, damaged equipment, and reduced investor confidence.

The choice is clear: continue with incremental upgrades and risk falling further behind, or commit to a coordinated, sector-wide modernisation that makes reliability and quality the standard, not the exception. The Government should form a separate working council akin to SREDA for promotion of Smart Grids. Institutional reforms must happen at the distribution company level.

Every flicker of a lightbulb, every hum of an overloaded motor, every shutdown of a production line is a signal that Bangladesh’s power infrastructure is not yet ready for the demand of the future. It is smarter to invest openly in a grid that delivers stability than to keep paying the hidden costs of one that does not.

General Matter is privately funded and focused on development of uranium enrichment technology to reshore domestic nuclear fuel capacity and power U.S. energy production.","Uranium enrichment company General Matter plans to establish operations in Paducah, Kentucky. The $1.5 billion project is expected to create 140 jobs.

The investment will include the construction of a commercial uranium enrichment facility, located at the former Paducah Gaseous Diffusion Plant, which will produce fuel needed for the next generation of nuclear energy. Operations are scheduled to begin by 2030.

“Seventy-five years ago, the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission selected Paducah to help lead the nation’s original enrichment efforts,” said General Matter CEO Scott Nolan. “We are proud to return to and reactivate this historic site to power a new era of American energy independence, and we thank our partners in Kentucky and at the DOE’s Office of Environmental Management and the Office of Nuclear Energy for supporting us in this landmark investment in American nuclear infrastructure.”

To support the project the Kentucky Economic Development Finance Authority preliminarily approved a 15-year incentive agreement with the company under the Kentucky Business Investment program. The performance-based agreement can provide up to $14 million in tax incentives based on the company’s investment of nearly $1.5 billion and annual targets of: creation and maintenance of 140 Kentucky-resident, full-time jobs across 15 years; and paying an average hourly wage of $64, including benefits, across those jobs.

Additionally, KEDFA approved the company for up to $3.5 million in tax incentives through the Kentucky Enterprise Initiative Act (KEIA). KEIA allows approved companies to recoup Kentucky sales and use tax on construction costs, building fixtures, equipment used in research and development and electronic processing.

“I want to congratulate the team at General Matter on this major step toward what will be the largest economic investment ever for Western Kentucky,” Governor Andy Beshear noted. “This lease reflects Kentucky’s leadership in nuclear energy and our strong partnerships at the federal and local levels, as well as in the private sector. I am looking forward to being back in Paducah soon to celebrate the next key milestone for this exciting and historic project.”

By meeting its annual targets over the agreement term, the company can be eligible to keep a portion of the new tax revenue it generates. The company may claim eligible incentives against its income tax liability and/or wage assessments. In addition, General Matter can receive resources from Kentucky’s workforce service providers. Those include no-cost recruitment and job placement services, reduced-cost customized training and job-training incentives.

“We appreciate General Matter’s partnership and their decision to locate in Paducah,” added Greater Paducah Economic Development President and CEO Bruce Wilcox . “Their investment is among the largest our community has seen in more than 75 years, bringing life-changing opportunities to our residents through strong wages and long-term careers. For many families, the DOE site is personal. Parents helped build it, their children work there today, and now the next generation has a chance to carry that legacy forward.”

An often proposed solution to the nation’s current budget difficulties is to “grow our way” out of the deficit.","The drastic across-the-board sequestration cuts to the federal budget are coming home to roost in unexpected ways:

Case in point is the harm to the nation’s economic growth that may result from cuts to agencies that support scientific research.

According to James Kakalios, the Taylor Distinguished Professor in the School of Physics and Astronomy at the University of Minnesota, scientists are alarmed about the real danger these cuts will cause to research.

A recent open letter to Congress signed by more than 50 Nobel laureates warned that these cuts would severely damage the work being done at scientific agencies -including the U.S. Department of Energy’s Office of Science, National Science Foundation and the National Institute of Standards and Technology, all of which fund cutting-edge research that have led to discoveries that improved quality of life, strengthened national security and enhanced economic growth.

The Internet, laser technologies and GPS are but a few of the myriad discoveries that trace their roots to early scientific research, according to Kakalios.

Polls conducted by the American Physical Society have found that many people don’t recognize the role that basic research plays in their daily lives.

Even more under-appreciated is that most of the research that impacts ordinary people is federally funded, carried out at universities and national laboratories with no immediate expectation of profit.

The U.S. government began supporting scientific research in earnest in 1950, with the establishment of the National Science Foundation.

From elucidating the basic properties of novel semiconductors and metals to studying the magnetic structure of atomic nuclei that led to the development of magnetic resonance imaging, tax dollars have supported advanced, exploratory research that has laid the groundwork for new industries and technologies.

One example is tablet computers or smartphones that allow users to alter the display using one or two fingers. This multi-touch interface actually originated from University of Delaware scientists whose work was initially supported by the National Science Foundation.

The best way to train a research scientist is to have him or her do scientific research.

Over the years, federally funded research through the National Science Foundation, the National Institute of Health, the Department of Energy, the Department of Defense and other agencies has been a tremendously successful jobs program, Kakalios says, enabling the training of legions of scientists and engineers who have gone on to staff high-technology industries, from Apple to Verizon.

An often proposed solution to the nation’s current budget difficulties is to “grow our way” out of the deficit. But new growth always requires proper seeding and cultivation. It’s time for the nation’s leaders to come together on a long-term budget fix, end the sequestration, and find a responsible way to address deficit reduction.

We agree with Kakalios when he says that scientific research, supported by everyone, is one of the best ways to make sure that the nation is home to the next transformative high-tech industry.

Bruce Westerman, R-Hot Springs, is ready for Congress to get back in session after its August recess. He knows there will be a challenge passing a federal budget, but he’d like to focus attention on a popular initiative: permitting reform.

Westerman is a co-sponsor and lead sponsor of the SPEED Act, a bipartisan measure, that he hopes will lead to more economic stimulus and less burdensome business regulation.

SPEED stands for “standardizing, permitting and enhancing economic development.” The Fourth District Congressman said the bill needs to pass to correct well-intended, but misguided precedent over the past few decades.

“We’ll not only see growth in the economy, but I believe we’ll see better protections for the environment as well, because the system that we’ve got now is broken. It’s well-intended. It all hinges around something called the National Environmental Policy Act, or NEPA… but there’s been some high-profile Supreme Court cases regarding NEPA lately.”

Westerman cited some of the recent decisions, particularly one that says federal agencies have been too restrictive through the rulemaking process.

“It takes an average of 4.7 years to go through the NEPA process. You get some projects like mining and offshore energy production that might take decades to get through the NEPA process. What it’s doing is throwing a wet blanket on development and on building things and growing the economy here at home. So I think this is one of the biggest issues that Congress can tackle,” he said. “I think we can potentially get this done by the end of the year.”

Westerman also said he’s hearing from constituents about the impact of tariffs on their businesses. He said he’s been passing concerns to the White House.

“I’ve given them feedback on businesses in my district that are suffering that need some relief. Trade policy gets very complicated,” said Westerman.

He also said that despite uncertainty from tariffs, Westerman believes that President Trump is angling to correct longstanding trade imbalances with other countries.

“It [uncertainty] does affect businesses on a day-to-day basis, and I could go down a list naming businesses in my district that are having issues because of tariffs and trade policies. But, also there’s some excitement around the fact that we’re hopefully going to get to a more level playing field,” he said.

“I think everybody’s ready for all the trade issues to get settled so that businesses can get more certainty in them and that we can start growing the economy and doing the things that I think the economy’s really ready to do. All the indicators are showing that if we just, I think, get the trade policy that our economy’s really going to take off,” he added.",https://talkbusiness.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/BruceWesterman2025.jpeg,N,,2025-08-10 13:07:41.052527

Final Thoughts The global nuclear landscape is diverging.","Nuclear power has always been a paradox. It can produce massive amounts of low-carbon electricity, yet it must constantly battle the headwinds of politics and public perception.

The latest Statistical Review of World Energy shows that while nuclear generation is growing globally—setting a new record high in 2024—the trend is anything but uniform. Some countries are charging ahead, while others are stepping back.

Global Output: Modest Growth, Unevenly Shared

In 2024, global nuclear generation reached 2,817 terawatt-hours, a modest uptick from 2023, but surpassing the previous all-time high set in 2021.

Over the past decade, output has grown at a 2.6% annual rate—slow, but a clear recovery from the post-Fukushima slump. That growth is heavily skewed toward non-OECD countries, which are building new capacity at a faster pace (3.0% annual growth) than the flat-to-declining trend in OECD nations (2.5%).

Asia Pacific: The New Center of Gravity

The most dramatic shift is happening in Asia Pacific, now responsible for over 28% of global nuclear output—over double its share from a decade ago:

As with renewables, China is in a league of its own, with output soaring from 213 TWh in 2014 to more than 450 TWh in 2024—an annual growth rate near 13%.

India and South Korea also posted steady gains, though on a smaller scale.

This marks a clear geopolitical shift. Nuclear power is no longer dominated by Western democracies, but by countries with state-driven, long-term infrastructure agendas.

North America: Stable, but Aging

The United States still leads the world in nuclear output at roughly 850 TWh annually (29.2% of the world’s total nuclear output), but beneath the stability is a slow attrition of older plants and a lack of new construction.

But the U.S. had its biggest nuclear milestone in decades in 2023 and 2024 with the startup of Vogtle Unit 3, followed by Unit 4. Located in Georgia, Vogtle is the first newly built nuclear power plant in the United States in more than 30 years, and its completion marks the end of a long, costly construction saga plagued by delays and budget overruns. Together, the two new reactors added more than 2,200 megawatts of capacity—enough to power over a million homes—and provide a rare example of nuclear expansion in a country where most growth has come from extending the lives of existing plants.

Canada’s output has slipped from 106 TWh in 2016 to 85 TWh in 2024, reflecting plant refurbishments and changing policies. Mexico, a small player, has seen big year-to-year swings, which may indicate operational challenges.

Europe: A Story of Contrasts

Western Europe is drifting away from nuclear:

France, long the gold standard for nuclear reliability, has seen output fall from 442 TWh in 2016 to just 338 TWh last year, hampered by maintenance issues and political uncertainty.

Germany is now at zero after completing its nuclear phase-out.

Belgium, Switzerland, and Sweden are split between retirements and life extensions.

In Eastern Europe, the picture is brighter. The Czech Republic, Hungary, and Slovakia are increasing output, while Ukraine has managed to maintain over 50 TWh annually despite wartime disruptions.

Emerging Regions: Small Shares, Big Moves

In Latin America, Brazil and Argentina are holding steady around 15–25 TWh, with Brazil inching higher. Africa’s only nuclear producer, South Africa, remains flat at about 13 TWh. The Middle East has a new entrant in the UAE, which ramped from zero in 2019 to over 40 TWh in 2024 thanks to the Barakah plant—an impressive buildout in such a short time.

The Outliers

Japan has restarted some reactors, but its output remains far below pre-Fukushima levels—84 TWh last year versus more than 300 TWh in 2010.

Taiwan is phasing out nuclear, with production falling from 42 TWh in 2016 to just 12 TWh in 2024.

Pakistan and Iran continue steady, if modest, growth.

Final Thoughts

The global nuclear landscape is diverging. Some countries are doubling down, driven by the twin imperatives of energy security and climate action, while others are walking away. The center of gravity is moving away from traditional Western producers toward nations prepared to back nuclear with long-term capital and policy support.

For investors, the next wave of growth is likely to come from Asia and the Middle East, not the historical powerhouses of Europe and North America. That shift carries environmental upside as well—especially in China, the world’s largest carbon emitter. Every gigawatt China moves from coal to nuclear represents a major win in the fight to reduce carbon emissions.",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/68977e4f44438134ed10692a/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,N,,2025-08-10 11:03:45.178360

By connecting multiple SMRs, large-scale facilities can be built, enabling competition with existing nuclear power plants.
SMR is evaluated as 100 to 1000 times safer than ordinary nuclear power plants, said Kim Moo-hwan, a professor of advanced nuclear engineering at POSTECH.","SMR (Small Modular Reactor), which received attention only when Microsoft founder Bill Gates declared that he would start ""Terra Power"" in 2006. His choice as a philanthropist was an ambitious project to solve the Earth's energy problems and climate change problems at once, and the answer was nuclear power.

SMR, which is to supply electricity cheaply and eco-friendly, is drawing more attention at the moment when demand for electricity is rapidly increasing in line with the advent of the artificial intelligence (AI) era. This is because AI data centers called ""electricity-eating hippos"" are built everywhere, increasing demand for energy projects that will supply large-scale power. SMR is also being suggested as a solution amid lingering doubts about the safety of existing nuclear power plants such as the Fukushima nuclear crisis in Japan.

SMR has several advantages compared to traditional nuclear power generation. First of all, in terms of safety, it has strengths over existing nuclear power plants, can be built faster, and because it is a small nuclear power plant, it can be built near a city where it is a consumer. As the name ""modular"" indicates, the cost of the project is also significantly lower than that of conventional large-scale nuclear power because each part of a nuclear power plant can be manufactured at the factory. By connecting multiple SMRs, large-scale facilities can be built, enabling competition with existing nuclear power plants. SMR is evaluated as 100 to 1000 times safer than ordinary nuclear power plants, said Kim Moo-hwan, a professor of advanced nuclear engineering at POSTECH. ""Because it is one-tenth the size of a large nuclear power plant, it has the advantage of being able to put it close to where it is needed."" SMR is currently competing with several types of reactors, including sodium and high-temperature gas, he said. ""It will remain on the market to prove that it works well and is safe within a few years.""

According to Precious Research, a global market research company, the SMR market is expected to grow from $6.88 billion this year to $16.13 billion (8.9% per year on average) by 2034. The World Economic Forum (WEF) expects average annual growth to reach 22% by 2040.

According to this market outlook, SMR competition is entering around the world, but Korea is advantageous over other countries because it has existing nuclear power plant construction capabilities.

Doosan Efficiency is planning a foundry business that precisely analyzes the design of each SMR developer from the perspective of the manufacturer based on its 40 years of experience in supplying key nuclear power plants, including nuclear reactors and steam generators, and mass-produces SMR by applying optimal manufacturing processes and technologies. Just as fabless (design company) and foundry (consignment production) companies are divided in the semiconductor industry, it plans to expand its future market based on SMR cycle manufacturing.

Doosan Efficiency is in the process of producing prototypes for SMR's first product, introducing dedicated manufacturing equipment, and building facilities. With the plan to secure production capabilities of 20 units a year, the goal is to win orders for 62 SMR cycles in the future. Doosan Efficiency can be manufactured from materials for nuclear power plants to precision large equipment, and through this, it can secure stable delivery dates, high quality, and price competitiveness. Doosan Efficiency signed a contract with Newscale Power to review the productivity of nuclear reactor modules in 2019 and has been investing in equity and cooperating with module material production.

HD Hyundai collaborated with Terra Power in the U.S. to develop core SMR facilities. The 4th generation Schodium Cooling High Speed Reactor (SFR), developed by HD Hyundai and Terra Power, is a type of SMR, and the reactor vessel is one of SMR's key facilities that stores the core where the nuclear fission reaction occurs and keeps the coolant in high temperature and low pressure safe. For the successful implementation of this project, HD Hyundai Heavy Industries plans to actively utilize the know-how it has accumulated by participating in the development and production of vacuum containers, the main core facilities of international fusion experiments and Korean fusion research devices. Professor Kim suggested, ""Korea is developing only one type of SMR that uses water as a coolant, but it is necessary to develop several types of SMR.""

If the U.S.-leading design and domestic companies' SMR manufacturing capabilities are combined, South Korea and the U.S. are likely to win-win in the SMR market, just like in the shipbuilding sector.

The industry is arguing that it is necessary to create a strategic fostering area to secure the competitiveness of the SMR industry. It is also necessary to provide intensive support for R&D, demonstration, and production fields through the designation of national industrial complexes or special zones, and to lay the groundwork for early expansion of distribution by enacting related special laws.

SMR-related systems are also urgently needed. Safety and certification regulations specialized for SMR should be prepared, and legal grounds for fostering clusters and regulations related to budget support are still known to be insufficient. For companies that are developing SMR, it is also suggested that if it is designated as a national strategic technology under the Special Tax Act, R&D tax credits will be available, which will help international competitiveness.",https://wimg.mk.co.kr/news/cms/202508/10/news-p.v1.20250810.22676be188574ed18ef4ff7b8d95f53e_P1.png,N,,2025-08-10 13:07:20.189126

Reorganizing Agriculture

The Senate on Aug. 1, by a 53-42 vote, rejected an amendment sponsored by Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.), to the Military Construction, Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act (H.R. 3944), that would have barred funding to reorganize the Agriculture Department (USDA) under a plan released in late July, and require a public review of the plan. Van Hollen said Agriculture should “take a step back and provide a transparent, informed, carefully considered plan for any such reorganization before implementing it.” An amendment opponent, Sen. John Hoeven (R-N.D.), said Congress had “a good process” for review, and “we do not need to overly handcuff the USDA as they work to make this transition, which is a transition that we should make.”

By MARC LEVY, The Associated Press

HARRISBURG — Amid rising electric bills, states are under pressure to insulate regular household and business ratepayers from the costs of feeding Big Tech’s energy-hungry data centers.

It’s not clear that any state has a solution and the actual effect of data centers on electricity bills is difficult to pin down. Some critics question whether states have the spine to take a hard line against tech behemoths like Microsoft, Google, Amazon and Meta.

But more than a dozen states have begun taking steps as data centers drive a rapid build-out of power plants and transmission lines.

That has meant pressuring the nation’s biggest power grid operator to clamp down on price increases, studying the effect of data centers on electricity bills or pushing data center owners to pay a larger share of local transmission costs.

Rising power bills are “something legislators have been hearing a lot about. It’s something we’ve been hearing a lot about. More people are speaking out at the public utility commission in the past year than I’ve ever seen before,” said Charlotte Shuff of the Oregon Citizens’ Utility Board, a consumer advocacy group. “There’s a massive outcry.”

Not the typical electric customer

Some data centers could require more electricity than cities the size of Pittsburgh, Cleveland or New Orleans, and make huge factories look tiny by comparison. That’s pushing policymakers to rethink a system that, historically, has spread transmission costs among classes of consumers that are proportional to electricity use.

“A lot of this infrastructure, billions of dollars of it, is being built just for a few customers and a few facilities and these happen to be the wealthiest companies in the world,” said Ari Peskoe, who directs the Electricity Law Initiative at Harvard University. “I think some of the fundamental assumptions behind all this just kind of breaks down.”

A fix, Peskoe said, is a “can of worms” that pits ratepayer classes against one another.

Some officials downplay the role of data centers in pushing up electric bills.

Tricia Pridemore, who sits on Georgia’s Public Service Commission and is president of the National Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners, pointed to an already tightened electricity supply and increasing costs for power lines, utility poles, transformers and generators as utilities replace aging equipment or harden it against extreme weather.

The data centers needed to accommodate the artificial intelligence boom are still in the regulatory planning stages, Pridemore said, and the Data Center Coalition, which represents Big Tech firms and data center developers, has said its members are committed to paying their fair share.

But growing evidence suggests that the electric bills of some Americans are rising to subsidize the substantial energy needs of Big Tech as the U.S. competes in a race against China for artificial intelligence superiority.

Data and analytics firm Wood Mackenzie published a report in recent weeks that suggested 20 proposed or effective specialized rates for data centers in 16 states it studied aren’t nearly enough to cover the cost of a new natural gas power plant.

In other words, unless utilities negotiate higher specialized rates, other ratepayer classes — residential, commercial and industrial — are likely paying for data center power needs.

Meanwhile, Monitoring Analytics, the independent market watchdog for the mid-Atlantic grid, produced research in June showing that 70% — or $9.3 billion — of last year’s increased electricity cost was the result of data center demand.

States are responding

Last year, five governors led by Pennsylvania’s Josh Shapiro began pushing back against power prices set by the mid-Atlantic grid operator, PJM Interconnection, after that amount spiked nearly sevenfold. They warned of customers “paying billions more than is necessary.”

PJM has yet to propose ways to guarantee that data centers pay their freight, but Monitoring Analytics is floating the idea that data centers should be required to procure their own power.

In a filing last month, it said that would avoid a “massive wealth transfer” from average people to tech companies.

At least a dozen states are eyeing ways to make data centers pay higher local transmission costs.

In Oregon, a data center hot spot, lawmakers passed legislation in June ordering state utility regulators to develop new — presumably higher — power rates for data centers.

The Oregon Citizens’ Utility Board says there is clear evidence that costs to serve data centers are being spread across all customers — at a time when some electric bills there are up 50% over the past four years and utilities are disconnecting more people than ever.

New Jersey’s governor signed legislation last month commissioning state utility regulators to study whether ratepayers are being hit with “unreasonable rate increases” to connect data centers and to develop a specialized rate to charge data centers.

In some other states, like Texas and Utah, governors and lawmakers are trying to avoid a supply-and-demand crisis that leaves ratepayers on the hook — or in the dark.

Doubts about states

In Indiana, state utility regulators approved a settlement between Indiana Michigan Power Co., Amazon, Google, Microsoft and consumer advocates that set parameters for data center payments for service.

Kerwin Olsen, of the Citizens Action Council of Indiana, a consumer advocacy group, signed the settlement and called it a “pretty good deal” that contained more consumer protections than what state lawmakers passed.

But, he said, state law doesn’t force large power users like data centers to publicly reveal their electric usage, so pinning down whether they’re paying their fair share of transmission costs “will be a challenge.”

In a March report, the Environmental and Energy Law Program at Harvard University questioned the motivation of utilities and regulators to shield ratepayers from footing the cost of electricity for data centers.

Both utilities and states have incentives to attract big customers like data centers, it said.

To do it, utilities — which must get their rates approved by regulators — can offer “special deals to favored customers” like a data center and effectively shift the costs of those discounts to regular ratepayers, the authors wrote. Many state laws can shield disclosure of those rates, they said.

In Pennsylvania, an emerging data center hot spot, the state utility commission is drafting a model rate structure for utilities to consider adopting. An overarching goal is to get data center developers to put their money where their mouth is.

“We’re talking about real transmission upgrades, potentially hundreds of millions of dollars,” commission chairman Stephen DeFrank said. “And that’s what you don’t want the ratepayer to get stuck paying for.”

The decision to revive the Duane Arnold Energy Center opens a new chapter in the ongoing narrative of nuclear energy in the United States.","In a significant shift in energy policy, NextEra Energy has announced plans to revive the Duane Arnold Energy Center, a nuclear power plant located in Iowa. The plant, which operated for over four decades, was originally shut down in 2020. This decision marks a departure from the company’s previous plans to replace the nuclear facility with a solar energy project. The move also aligns with a broader national trend to reconsider the viability of nuclear power as a carbon-free energy source, amid growing concerns over climate change and energy reliability.

The History of Duane Arnold Energy Center

The Duane Arnold Energy Center, a 615 MWe boiling water reactor, has a storied history. It was initially shut down in 2020 after 45 years of service, primarily due to economic decisions by its main customer, Alliant Energy. This decision led NextEra to terminate its power purchase agreement five years earlier than planned. However, the plant’s closure was accelerated by an unexpected derecho windstorm in August 2020, which severely damaged the cooling towers.

Despite the shutdown, the facility was never completely dismantled. The reactor was defueled, and the nuclear fuel was securely stored on-site. The plant entered SAFSTOR, a deferred decommissioning status allowing for safe maintenance while residual radioactivity decays. This process has preserved much of the plant’s infrastructure, making a potential restart feasible.

Renewed Interest in Nuclear Energy

The decision to reconsider the Duane Arnold Energy Center is part of a broader trend across the United States to revive shuttered nuclear facilities. As the nation grapples with the challenges of reducing carbon emissions, nuclear energy is being reevaluated for its potential as a stable, carbon-free power source. The recommissioning of Duane Arnold could set a precedent for other plants to follow suit.

NextEra Energy’s request to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) to restore interconnection rights underscores this shift. The company aims to accelerate the recommissioning process, prioritizing nuclear energy over solar development. This move is part of a larger strategy to ensure energy reliability and meet climate goals, reflecting changing attitudes towards nuclear power.

Challenges and Opportunities

While the potential restart of the Duane Arnold Energy Center presents opportunities, it also poses several challenges. One of the primary hurdles is the comprehensive engineering evaluation that NextEra must conduct before making a final decision. This assessment will determine the feasibility of restoring the plant to operational status by 2028.

Moreover, the financial and regulatory aspects of recommissioning a nuclear plant can be complex. Navigating federal and state regulations, securing funding, and addressing public concerns about nuclear safety will be critical to the project’s success. However, if successful, the restart could provide a significant boost to local economies and contribute to national energy goals.

The Future of Nuclear Energy in the U.S.

The potential revival of the Duane Arnold Energy Center is indicative of a larger trend in the U.S. energy landscape. As other countries also reconsider nuclear energy, the U.S. is poised to play a leading role in this transition. The successful recommissioning of shuttered plants could serve as a model for other states and nations exploring similar paths.

Overall, the move to restart Duane Arnold highlights the complexities and opportunities inherent in transitioning to a carbon-free energy future. As the U.S. continues to evaluate its energy options, the role of nuclear power will likely remain a topic of considerable debate and strategic importance.

The decision to revive the Duane Arnold Energy Center opens a new chapter in the ongoing narrative of nuclear energy in the United States. As energy demands grow and the push for carbon-free solutions intensifies, will nuclear power emerge as a key component of the nation’s energy strategy?

The fix is simple, scalable, and could reshape green energy storage, the journal Science Advances reported.

Researchers at King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST; Saudi Arabia) have identified a key molecular issue that has been preventing aqueous rechargeable batteries from becoming a safer and more cost-effective option for storing sustainable energy. Published in Science Advances, their study explains how water inside these batteries can damage performance and shorten lifespan. However, by adding inexpensive salts like zinc sulfate, the researchers were able to dramatically reduce this problem and extend battery life by over ten times.

A major factor that influences how long a battery lasts is the anode, the component where chemical reactions take place to produce and store energy. Unfortunately, certain unwanted chemical reactions, known as parasitic reactions, can damage the anode and shorten the battery’s overall lifespan.

The study reveals that free water molecules play a major role in triggering these harmful reactions. The addition of zinc sulfate helps limit the presence of free water, reducing its ability to degrade the anode.

“Our findings highlight the importance of water structure in battery chemistry, a key parameter that has been previously overlooked,” said KAUST Professor and Chair of the KAUST Center of Excellence for Renewable Energy and Storage Technologies (CREST) Husam Alshareef, the principal investigator leading the study.

Free water describes water molecules that are not strongly bonded to other molecules. This state allows free water to engage with more molecules than otherwise, triggering unwanted reactions that consume energy and compromise the anode.

Sulfate was found to stabilize the bonds of free water, acting as what the KAUST team describes as a “water glue,” to change the dynamics of the water molecules that reduces the number of parasitic reactions.

While the bulk of experiments by the KAUST researchers were done on batteries using zinc sulfate, early investigation has shown that sulfate has the same effect on other metal anodes, suggesting the inclusion of sulfate salts into the battery design could be a universal solution for lengthening the lifespan of all aqueous batteries.

“Sulfate salts are cheap, widely available, and chemically stable, making our solution scientifically and economically viable,” said KAUST Research Scientist Yunpei Zhu, who conducted the bulk of the experiments.

Aqueous batteries are gaining significant global attention as a sustainable solution for large-scale energy storage and are projected to exceed a market size of $10 billion by 2030. Unlike lithium batteries, which are often used in electric vehicles, aqueous batteries offer a safer and more sustainable option for integrating renewable energy sources like solar power into electrical grids.

“No federal government to protect us?” “I don’t think anybody could hear these stories without being moved,” Chu said.","On Saturday, Los Angeles-area elected officials, advocacy groups, and community members convened in Pasadena for what was billed as a “People’s Hearing on Extreme Weather.”

Organized by the Climate Action Campaign and its member environmental activist groups, the event drew testimony from wildfire survivors and health officials. They criticized the Trump administration and are seeking to put pressure on California to safeguard climate change programs.

Many speakers cited recent Environmental Protection Agency decisions they claim have weakened climate protection, including the announced intent to roll back the agency’s 2009 finding that greenhouse gases endanger public health.

U.S. Sen. Alex Padilla, in a prerecorded video, contended that climate change is taking a toll in Los Angeles communities, from poor air quality to the devastation brought by wildfires, which a recent study suggests were more deadly than previously reported. “If they can’t even admit that climate change is real,” Padilla asked, “then how can they protect us from it?”

Reps. Judy Chu (D-Monterey Park) and Laura Friedman (D-Glendale) underscored the urgency of action. “This is the human cost of climate change,” Chu said, pointing to displacement, financial insecurity, illness, and deaths. Friedman called the recent EPA actions “part of this administration’s attack on all science.”

The heart of the gathering within Pasadena’s historic Maxwell House was testimony from residents, including survivors of the Eaton and Palisades fires, and community leaders, who sat in front of signs with such slogans as “people over polluters” and “stop EPA’s climate chaos.” The event had political overtones, and many of the two dozen speakers came with prepared speeches.

“These disasters aren’t rare any more. They’re becoming constant,” said Pasadena resident Rosanna Valverde, whose home was damaged in the Eaton fire. “Instead of helping families prepare for what’s clearly already happening, they’re [the current administration] making it worse.”

Fellow Eaton fire survivor Sam Stracich described climate disaster as “not only the abnormally intense and frequent fires … but the long and stressful aftermath,” adding that denying climate change “puts more people’s health, homes and futures at risk.”

Dennis Higgins recounted returning to his home in the Pacific Palisades to find “just rubble.” Referring to the Trump administration’s plan to revisit federal findings from 2009 that declared greenhouse gases a threat to public health, Higgins warned that homes rebuilt in the area would “burn again if we don’t get these protections.”

A student from Palisades High School said she believed policy failures compounded the wildfire’s destruction. “It wasn’t just the fire that destroyed my neighborhood,” said Sophie Smeeton, a rising senior. “It was the systematic denial of risk, the dissolution of safeguards, and the refusal to treat the climate crisis with urgency.”

Chris Chavez, deputy policy director at the Coalition for Clean Air, said air pollution used to be his primary concern.

“I know what it’s like to wake up in the middle of the night being unable to breathe due to asthma. I also know what it’s like to wake up in the middle of the night, being confronted with an approaching wildfire,” Chavez said. “Many Californians can speak about both of those experiences.”

Dr. Alfred Glover, a podiatrist in Los Angeles, described patients with cardiovascular disease and respiratory illnesses as “suffering with the consequences of climate.” He said the mounting health impacts are “really, really destroying our community.”

Marine biologist Barbara Gentile described the effects fires and extreme weather have had on ocean ecosystems, from toxic algae blooms to chemical pollution. The ocean “can’t testify for itself,” she said. “If we don’t speak for the ocean, who will?”

Panelists repeatedly criticized recent federal rollbacks, including cuts to National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration research.

“As a citizen, as a resident, as a physician, why do I feel nation-less at this time?” asked Dr. Jerry Abraham, a hearing board member for the South Coast Air Quality Management District. “No federal government to protect us?”

Demand is projected to outstrip supply in the coming years, largely due to data centers powering artificial intelligence. That leaves the government no choice: To avoid an energy crisis, it needs to supersize the nation’s electrical grid.

The Trump administration, apparently, hasn’t gotten the memo. Instead, it’s allowing its opposition to clean energy sources, such as wind and solar, to stymie growth.

Case in point: The Energy Department’s cancellation last week of a $4.9 billion loan guarantee for a major transmission project in the Midwest. The line, known as the Grain Belt Express, would cross 800 miles of farmland to deliver wind energy generated in Kansas to power more than 3 million homes in the region. This is exactly the sort of development the country needs to strengthen the grid and make use of its natural wind resources.

Yet the administration sided with NIMBYs who have long opposed the project, which has been in the works for more than a decade. The Energy Department explained in its announcement that it was “not critical for the federal government to have a role” in the project. It also claimed that the project is “unlikely” to meet the conditions required for the loan guarantee — without clearly laying out those conditions.

Invenergy, the company behind the project, has said it will pursue private financing. Hopefully that materializes, and ideally such undertakings could happen without any government backing. But the loss of the loan guarantee poses a serious threat to both the transmission line and to the renewable energy projects that would have been built to supply it.

Such paralysis is now typical of the U.S. energy system. Despite ever-increasing demand for electricity, construction of the new transmission lines needed to deliver it has slowed to a glacial pace. That’s because building the infrastructure across multiple jurisdictions is expensive and comes with painful regulatory headaches. And far too often, politics gets in the way, especially when it requires construction on privately owned land.

In 2024, only 322 miles of new high-voltage transmission lines were completed, one of the slowest annual figures in the past 15 years. An Energy Department study last year projected that, to meet the nation’s energy needs most optimally, regional transmission capacity needs to double by 2050 and interregional capacity needs to rise by a factor of 3.5. That would require the nation to build more than 5,000 miles of transmission lines a year, according to Americans for a Clean Energy Grid.

Despite President Donald Trump’s promises to “unleash American energy,” his administration seems to be actively working against that lofty goal. This month, New York’s Public Service Commission halted a new transmission line that would bring the state’s offshore wind power to New York City. Why? Because Trump’s executive order to stop offshore wind developments makes the power lines risky for taxpayers.

Meanwhile, the administration seems to be trying to kill solar and wind projects by a thousand bureaucratic cuts. This month, the Interior Department issued a directive requiring virtually every aspect of such developments on federal lands — or those that pass through it via transmission lines — to receive personal approval from Interior Secretary Doug Burgum or his deputy. That policy change came shortly after Congress passed its reconciliation package, which restricted access to tax credits for any wind and solar project that does not begin construction by July 4, 2026. A bottleneck seems to be the goal.

The administration justifies its antisolar and wind posture by arguing that other forms of energy, such as fossil fuels and nuclear, are more reliable. It also leans on national security concerns, since China controls much of the supply chain for those industries.

But these points don’t stand up to scrutiny. To start, building up the renewable energy sector would help alleviate climate change in the long term, which itself would make the energy sector more reliable and boost national security.

Moreover, many European countries rely heavily on solar and wind and have not experienced the “intermittency” problems that critics warn about. No energy source is 100-percent reliable, which only underscores the need to diversify the United States’ energy sector and modernize its electrical grid with more transmission lines. That would allow electricity from multiple sources to move around the country as needed.

And while China’s chokehold on the renewable energy supply chain is a genuine problem, it hardly justifies giving up on these industries. China’s investments in solar and wind already put the United States to shame. The answer is not to cede the technological advantage to America’s most powerful adversary. It is to compete so that the U.S. can regain its edge.

The great irony here is that, for years, Republicans decried subsidies for renewable energy as the government “picking winners and losers.” Now, they are embracing the same mindset they once opposed, but in the opposite direction. They are intent on making solar and wind losers; if they succeed, U.S. consumers will lose, too.

This story was originally published by Grist and is reproduced here as part of the Climate Desk collaboration.

When the Environmental Protection Agency’s plans to eliminate the Energy Star program became public, pushback from environmental groups was expected. The government-funded labeling system helps consumers identify energy-efficient products and practices, saving them $40 billion annually in energy costs. Since its founding in 1992, Energy Star has helped avoid at least 4 billion tons of greenhouse gas emissions and has been lauded as one of the most effective decarbonization tools in U.S. history.

But over the last few months, a broad and unexpected coalition of industry groups has come out in support of the program. They range from the American Chemistry Council and the National Association of Home Builders to the Spray Foam Coalition, American Bakers Association, and the Pool and Hot Tub Alliance. The American Chemistry Council regularly fights the EPA’s regulation of power plants, and the Pool and Hot Tub Alliance’s previous lobbying efforts have promoted natural gas use in homes. Now, they find themselves aligned with environmental groups like the Sierra Club in defending Energy Star.

It’s an “interesting bedfellows” situation, said Justin Koscher, president of the Polyisocyanurate Insulation Manufacturers Association, which represents manufacturers of a type of rigid insulation used mostly in commercial roofing projects. “It’s not too often you get all of those groups saying the exact same thing on one particular issue.”

Most Americans recognize Energy Star from the iconic cyan-and-white logo on appliances like light fixtures, computers, and refrigerators, signaling that a third party has certified that the product uses less energy than other comparable options. But entire homes and buildings can also be certified as energy-efficient, and the Energy Star Portfolio Manager helps building managers track energy use.

Residential and commercial buildings combined make up about a third of the country’s total energy use, and nearly a quarter of all commercial buildings in the country use the tool. Energy Star incentivizes energy-efficient building practices, guides appliance choice, and drives demand for products like insulation. Koscher worries that if Energy Star disappears, so might the incentive.

Energy Star Portfolio Manager is also the basis for how cities and counties across the nation measure whether buildings within their borders are complying with local-level energy-efficiency regulations. Almost 50 municipalities—and a few entire states—rely on the program, according to the Energy Star website. If Energy Star is privatized or eliminated, there’s currently no adequate replacement, said Paula Cino of the National Multifamily Housing Council, a group representing apartment building owners, developers, and managers.

Energy Star certification can be good for landlords’ bottom line. One study found that after an office building earns the label, rents in the building go up even as utility costs—an indicator of how much energy the building is using—remain unchanged. That suggests the program may be boosting the market value of already-efficient buildings without necessarily reducing energy use. Since the program is voluntary, its opt-in nature also appeals to organizations that prefer it over stricter, local electrification mandates. In March, Cino’s group sent a letter to Trump administration officials asking to roll back a lengthy slate of building and appliance efficiency standards. But even so, the group sees value in Energy Star’s tools.

“There is still a tremendous need for building owners to be able to understand how their building is using energy, and that is expressly what Energy Star Portfolio Manager provides for the business community,” Cino said.

Support for Energy Star in Congress is bipartisan. In July, the Senate Appropriations Committee approved $36 million in funding for the program. The House Appropriations Committee also passed a bill that sets Energy Star’s funding floor for the upcoming year at $32 million. Both are a far cry from the White House’s stated interest in zeroing out funding for Energy Star altogether. But final approval of funding appropriations for the EPA is still months away.",https://www.motherjones.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/GettyImages-2043303030-2.webp?w=1200&h=630&crop=1,N,,2025-08-10 07:59:09.932699

As the country industrialized at a breakneck pace, coal plants became the backbone of its energy system — reliable, abundant, and deeply tied to economic development. Even as the world turned its focus to emissions and climate policy, the country continued to lean heavily on its domestic coal supply, seeing it as a tool for stability and energy security around the world. At the same time, China hasn’t ignored the clean energy race. In fact, it’s been leading it.

China is active in multiple sectors

The country has outpaced global rivals in wind, solar, and battery investments, setting new installation records year after year. Policymakers have promoted green infrastructure, rolled out decarbonization targets, and boosted electric transport. On paper, the energy transition is well underway — and even ahead of schedule in some areas.

But progress on one front doesn’t always mean retreat on another. And as global attention focuses on China’s clean energy surge, a different trend has quietly picked up speed beneath the surface — one that’s raising tough questions about the country’s true way forward and the changes in the project once it appeared to be ready.

New coal-fired power capacity

In 2024, China started building 94.5 gigawatts (GW) of new coal-fired power capacity and resumed work on another 3.3GW of previously paused projects — the highest level of construction seen in the past decade, according to two think tanks. This surge, largely backed by investments from the coal mining industry, brings up big questions about the ability to move away from fossil fuels, the report warns.

While the country massive additions in clean energy are expected to gradually cut coal’s share of electricity generation, especially as the country pushes toward its goals of peaking carbon emissions by 2030 and achieving carbon neutrality by 2060, the rapid growth in coal power presents a clear challenge to those commitments.

The study reports that construction began on 94.5GW of new coal plants in 2024, showing that coal projects continue despite government pledges to limit fossil fuel use. Another 3.3GW of previously paused projects also restarted. Approvals for new coal plants came up in the second half of 2024, reaching 66.7GW, after only 9GW were approved in the first half.

Driven by industry

The report also points out that after a steady decline from 84.3GW in 2015 to 32.1GW in 2021, new and resumed coal projects have been increasing since 2022. From 2022 on, new coal project proposals surged — reaching 146GW in 2022 and 117GW in 2023. On the other hand, proposals dropped to 68.9GW in 2024.

More than 75% of newly approved coal plants are backed by coal mining companies or energy groups involved in coal mining, the study finds. This may be partly due to China’s carbon goals pushing those companies to diversify, seeking steady demand for coal through 2030 and beyond.

Looking forward to 2025

The coal industry forecasts continued growth, which the report says will heighten the conflict between China’s energy security needs and its low-carbon ambitions. To shift the balance, strong policy action will be needed in 2025. That could mean making clear targets to cut coal use, phasing out coal plants, reducing coal plant operation rates, and boosting renewable energy.

Other steps might include stopping approvals for new coal plants and speeding up the retirement of old ones. The report also points to reforms in how power providers are incentivized — such as limiting long-term coal supply contracts and promoting electricity market reforms.

In July, Türkiye witnessed a 2.1 percent increase in electricity production compared to the same month last year, driven by a rise in the contributions of natural gas and solar energy, which compensated for the declining outputs from hydroelectric and wind power plants.

According to data compiled from the Electricity Transmission Corporation (TEİAŞ), electricity production remained stable while consumption rose by 1.4 percent. Production reached 34.85 million megawatt-hours, while consumption totaled 34.59 million megawatt-hours.

The increase in consumption was primarily attributed to higher cooling needs and air conditioning usage due to hot weather conditions.

The production figures for July showed that natural gas generated 8.69 million megawatt-hours, making it the leading source, followed by imported coal at 7.3 million megawatt-hours. Hydroelectric plants produced 5.67 million megawatt-hours, solar energy contributed 4.1 million megawatt-hours and wind power generated 3.56 million megawatt-hours.

Analysts expect US EV sales to ""collapse"" in the fourth quarter of 2025 once the tax credit expires, according to CNBC.","Electric vehicle sales in the United States are experiencing a significant surge as consumers race to take advantage of federal tax credits worth up to $7,500 before they expire on September 30, according to a CNBC report citing auto industry analysts.

The tax breaks, which apply to new, used and leased EVs, are being eliminated under legislation signed by President Donald Trump in July. The original Biden-era Inflation Reduction Act had extended these incentives through 2032.

According to Cox Automotive data cited by CNBC, consumers purchased nearly 130,100 new EVs in July, marking the second-highest monthly sales total on record. This represents a 26.4% increase from June and nearly 20% year-over-year growth.

""We're expecting Q3 may be [a] record for EV sales because of the tax incentives going away,"" Stephanie Valdez Streaty, a senior analyst at Cox Automotive, told CNBC. ""People are rushing out"" to buy, she said.

EV sales in July accounted for about 9.1% of total passenger vehicle sales in the US that month, the largest monthly share on record, according to the report. Used EV sales also hit a record high of nearly 36,700 units in July.

The $7,500 tax credit for new EVs and $4,000 for used EVs helps bridge the price gap between electric and gasoline vehicles. CNBC reported that the average transaction price for new EVs in the US was $55,689 before incentives, compared to $48,078 for traditional vehicles. With the full tax credit, EVs reach near price parity at around $48,189.

Tom Libby, an analyst at S&P Global, noted that the price gap between EV and gasoline cars ""no longer exists,"" but the disappearance of federal tax credits ""jeopardizes"" price competitiveness.

Dealers are capitalizing on the deadline urgency, with Tesla prominently displaying ""$7,500 Federal Tax Credit Ending"" on its homepage. The report noted that dealers provided about $9,800 in additional financial incentives to new EV buyers in July, representing 17.5% of the average transaction price.

Analysts expect US EV sales to ""collapse"" in the fourth quarter of 2025 once the tax credit expires, according to CNBC. However, the used EV market may see continued growth, as most buyers currently don't qualify for the $4,000 tax break anyway.

The September 30 deadline requires consumers to take ownership of their vehicles by that date to qualify for the tax credits.",https://img.autocarpro.in/autocarpro/39532614-29ea-432c-a9e3-5fbfb93c2fac_Screenshot-20250810-135944.png,N,,2025-08-10 06:58:56.203293

But as the climate continues to change, other regions of North America are starting to see elevated wildfire risks as well.

Iowa, for one, is seeing wildfire risk projections grow in some areas of the state.

An interactive map published in February by the Iowa Environmental Council uses layers of data to visualize how different climate change factors may affect the state in the coming years.

The IEC’s Climate Change and Environmental Health Map highlights more than 45 environmental pollutants, climate change threats, and public health data points, and can drill down to individual neighborhoods.

Among the information available through the map are projected agriculture losses, cancer levels, and information about where wastewater discharges occur. The map also can layer environmental risk factors with Iowa demographics, like low-income areas, unemployment and health factors, like asthma.

One of the environmental threats incorporated in the map is wildfire risk. The map displays the share or properties in an area that are at risk of fire over the next 30 years. It assigns a percentile, which is that area’s risk relative to other areas. A higher percentile means that area is more likely than others to experience a wildfire.

Cody Smith, senior policy advocate at the Council, created the map using federal data downloaded from government websites. Smith said much of the data has since been removed from government websites, following President Donald Trump taking office in January.

Of all the environmental risks — or “indicators” — included on the map, Smith said Iowa’s wildfire risk jumped out to him the most.

“It was really surprising to me,” Smith said. “Because I just don’t think a lot about fire risk in Iowa.”

Several areas of the state had higher percentiles for fire risk than he anticipated, Smith said.

For example, a small portion of Woodbury County in western Iowa had a wildfire risk in the 92nd percentile.

According to Wildfire Risk to Communities, an organization that measures wildfire risk across the country using data from the U.S. Department of Agriculture and the U.S. Forest Service, areas that score in the 91st percentile or above for wildfires are considered to have “very high” risk.

For areas like Woodbury County, this means that only 8 percent of areas across the country have a higher risk of wildfire.

In Tama County, areas around the towns of Tama and Toledo are in the 85th and 87th percentiles for wildfire risk. Belle Plaine in Benton County is at the 89th percentile.

And an area in Scott County, just north of Davenport, has a fire risk in the 74th percentile.

A percentile between the 70 and 90 is considered “high.”

“Nationally, these line up with places in California and Colorado and even Tennessee and North Carolina,” Smith said.

The Federal Emergency Management Agency defines a wildfire as an unplanned fire burning in natural or wildland areas such as forests, shrub lands, grasslands, or prairies.

FEMA, which is housed under the Department of Homeland Security, runs the National Risk Index, which rates the risk of wildfire for different communities across the country.

Iowa Ideas In-Depth Week Explores Extreme Weather in Iowa

Iowa Ideas, a project of The Gazette, is hosting a free, virtual In-Depth Week series called Extreme Weather in Iowa, Aug. 11-15.

The week features five sessions, held 12-1 p.m. each day. Full session descriptions, including a list of panelists, and registration can be found at iowaideas.com. Here is the week’s schedule:

• Monday: How has Iowa’s weather changed? As Iowa grapples with changing weather patterns and their impacts, what are the facts when it comes to floods, derechos, microbursts and other extreme weather in the last decade?

• Tuesday: Health impacts of extreme weather: Whether it’s the air quality from Canadian wildfires, humidity, or seasonal allergies, this session will explore the health impacts Iowans face with Iowa’s changing climate.

• Wednesday: Economic threats of extreme weather: Iowans have suffered more than their fair share of natural disasters, and the losses that come with them. How is Iowa’s changing weather impacting the state’s economy?

• Thursday: Hardening of agriculture to withstand weather extremes: Iowa’s agriculture industry is among the most adept at pivoting. What are the benefits and trade-offs of the latest refinement efforts?

• Friday: Designing for the future of increased extreme weather: With the increase of severe weather events in Iowa, lessons have been learned. How is design of infrastructure and housing changing as a result?

Driving the fire risk

David Flory is a teaching professor in the Earth, Atmosphere and Climate Department at Iowa State University.

When it comes wildfire risk, he said drought conditions typically come with it.

“When there are dry conditions and low soil moistures, plants dry out and you have increased fire risk,” Flory said. “You could talk about winds in terms of increased fire risk, but I really think it's the drought conditions that are the biggest player.”

Iowa experienced its longest drought in more than 60 years between 2020 and 2024. The worst of the drought was recorded Dec. 19, 2023, when 35 percent of the state was classified as being in “extreme drought.”

The drought broke in May 2024, but dry conditions crept back in last summer and fall.

Today, the state has no drought conditions, according to the U.S. Drought Monitor — only dry pockets. In fact, July was Iowa’s second-wettest July on record (only 1993 saw more rain), with more than double the average monthly rainfall.

Flory said Eastern Iowa tends to see more precipitation, on average, than the western side of the state or Nebraska. As a result, he said western Iowa uses more irrigation practices to water farmland. In 2017, only about 222,000 of Iowa’s 30 million acres of farmland were irrigated.

But areas like prairies and forested areas are not irrigated. So when drought conditions come in, the plants in those areas stay dry. In those areas, Flory said fire risk can remain high.

Aside from drought and dry conditions, Flory said high winds also can play a role in wildfire risk.

“When you have higher winds and you have ongoing fires, it's really hard to contain them. Embers will float in the winds or get moved around, and that’s really difficult to manage,” Flory said. “Winds are important here, but they do make it difficult to contain fires when they do occur.”

An ‘overlooked’ issue

Jason Walker, fire program leader for the Iowa Department of Natural Resources, said the fire risk in Iowa generally is overlooked.

“The existence of the threat is here, and at some point in time, we ultimately could face something catastrophic and want to be prepared,” Walker said. “We work on those kinds of things annually and try to prepare the best we can.”

Walker and his team from the DNR are currently in Willow Creek, California, working on fire risk prevention in Six Rivers National Forest.

In California, the Gifford Fire has burned at least 131 square miles of Santa Barbara and San Luis Obispo counties, with just 9 percent containment, the Associated Press reported. It is the biggest fire in the state so far this year.

Canada is experiencing its second-worst wildfire season on record, with almost 4,000 fires recorded already this calendar year, NPR reported. The smoke from the fires — many of which are considered “out of control” — drifted south earlier this month, prompting air quality warnings across the Midwest.

Walker said he believes fire threats are overlooked in Iowa because it is predominately an agricultural state.

“That being said, we see some pretty crazy fires every year in our standing cornfields when they're cured in the fall,” Walker said.

Over the last several decades, Walker said environmental agencies and organizations have worked to analyze theoretical wildfire risks across the U.S.

Walker pointed to the work that Northeast-Midwest State Foresters Alliance does with analyzing wildfire risks, especially through its Northeast-Midwest Wildfire Risk Explorer interactive map.

The map looks at fire risk across the Upper Midwest, including Minnesota, Iowa, Missouri, Wisconsin, Illinois, Indiana and Michigan.

The map measures each state’s fire risk based on the potential damage to structures due to wildfires.

According to the map, most of Iowa has a low to moderate fire risk. However, similar to the Iowa Environmental Council’s map, some areas show fire risks that are considered “very high.”

The locations labeled “very high” appear across the entire state, but higher risk areas are clustered on the western side of the state.

Walker said there are multiple factors that go into fire risk assessments, but western Iowa generally is at a greater risk than other parts of the state because more of the land is used for agriculture.

“There's a high percentage of Iowa that most of the year is just literally unburnable. It's either green corn or black dirt,” Walker said. “But when you get into areas like the western part of the state — and the Loess Hills area specifically — you (have) larger tracts of land with burnable fuels.”

Preventing wildfires

With wildfires, Walker said his team at the DNR tries to “preach prevention” when talking with property owners about how to prevent fires and protect their homes.

A lot of prevention comes down to creating a “defensible space.” He said making a defensible space can be as simple as cutting down tall grasses in some fields or near buildings to reduce the amount of fuel fires can pick up as they move.

For homeowners, Walker said this could mean making sure a wooden deck is stained or protected against fire, so that it won’t catch fire or help the fire spread.

“If you have tall grass or highly flammable fuels right up to your house, by the time that fire gets to your house, the firefighters really have no chance at stopping that or slowing that fire down before it consumes your house,” he said. “That's what you see in a lot of instances, like in Los Angeles.”

He said most wildfires that occur in Iowa are grass fires off the edge of an interstate.

“Small flames don't get big news like you do out west and that's really the awareness,” Walker said. “I think people become complacent and don't think about it.”

'Spoke to Senator @LindseyGrahamSC and shared with him the Indian perspective on our energy security, including increasing energy trade with the United States,' Kwatra said in a post on X.

https://x.com/AmbVMKwatra/status/1954206497157616000

The conversation comes after US Senator Lindsey Graham on Friday (local time) urged India to use its influence with Russia to help end the war in Ukraine, calling it one of the most significant steps to improve India-US relations.

'As I have been telling my friends in India, one of the most consequential things they could do to improve India-U.S. relations is to help President Trump end this bloodbath in Ukraine,' Graham posted on X.

'India is the second largest purchaser of Putin's cheap oil, the proceeds of which fuel his war machine. I hope Prime Minister Modi emphasised to Putin in their recent phone call the need to end this war in Ukraine justly, honourably and forever. I have always believed India has influence in this matter and I am hoping they will use it wisely,' he wrote.

His comments came on the same day Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced he had a 'very good and detailed' conversation with Russian President Vladimir Putin.

'Had a very good and detailed conversation with my friend, President Putin. I thanked him for sharing the latest developments on Ukraine,' PM Modi said in a post on X. 'We also reviewed the progress in our bilateral agenda, and reaffirmed our commitment to further deepen the India-Russia Special and Privileged Strategic Partnership. I look forward to hosting President Putin in India later this year.'

However, the meeting with Senator Graham also comes amid escalating trade tensions, after US President Donald Trump imposed an additional 25 per cent tariff on imports from India earlier this week in response to New Delhi's continued purchase of Russian oil. The new tariff, set to take effect after 21 days, will raise the total duty on Indian goods to 50 per cent. Trump cited national security and foreign policy concerns, claiming that India's imports of Russian oil pose an 'unusual and extraordinary threat' to the United States.

According to the White House order, the levy will apply to all Indian goods imported into the US, except for items already in transit or those qualifying for specific exemptions.

In a strong domestic message, Prime Minister Modi addressed the US tariff decision directly on Thursday, reaffirming his government's commitment to protecting the agricultural sector.

'For us, the interest of our farmers is our top priority. India will never compromise on the interests of farmers, fishermen and dairy farmers. I know we will have to pay a heavy price for it, and I am ready for it. India is ready for it,' PM Modi said. (ANI)

The funding, part of the Biden-era's Solar for All program, was awarded to 60 recipients including states, tribes and regions for investments such as rooftop solar and community solar gardens. Solar, a renewable energy, is widely regarded as a way to introduce cleaner power onto the electrical grid and lower energy bills for American consumers.

Under Republican President Donald Trump, officials have pursued dozens of deregulatory measures related to federal rules intended to protect clean air and water. Last week, the EPA proposed rescinding the agency's ""endangerment finding"" which serves as the scientific and legal basis for regulating planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions.

The administration has taken steps to bolster fossil fuels such as coal, oil and natural gas as it pursues American ""energy dominance in the global market.

EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin said in a statement on social media that authority for the solar program was eliminated under the tax-and-spending law signed by Trump last month. It eliminated the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund, approved under the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, that set aside $20 billion for community development projects to boost renewable energy and an additional $7 billion for the solar program.

""The bottom line is this: EPA no longer has the statutory authority to administer the program or the appropriated funds to keep this boondoggle alive,″ Zeldin said. ""Today, the Trump EPA is announcing that we are ending Solar for All for good, saving US taxpayers ANOTHER $7 BILLION!""

Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt, who introduced the Solar for All program to cut electric bills for working families, said Zeldin's action was illegal.

""Solar for All means lower utility bills, many thousands of good-paying jobs and real action to address the existential threat of climate change,″ Sanders said in a statement. ""At a time when working families are getting crushed by skyrocketing energy costs and the planet is literally burning, sabotaging this program isn't just wrong -- it's absolutely insane. We will fight back to preserve this enormously important program.""

Only $53 million of the $7 billion awarded has been spent, according to a tally by the research firm Atlas Public Policy. Several grant recipients this week said their programs were in planning phases.

Stephanie Bosh, senior vice president of the Solar Energy Industries Association, said the EPA has no legal authority to terminate grants already appropriated by Congress.

""These grants are delivering billions of dollars of investment to red and blue states alike,″ she said. Bosh said solar was one of the cheapest energy sources at a time of growing demand for electricity.

""This administration is continuing to dig itself into a hole,"" she said.

The EPA has argued that the tax and policy law allows the agency to rescind the money it has already obligated. The recipients of that money disagree, saying the bulk of the money had already been disbursed and is not affected by the law.

Southern Environmental Law Center litigation director Kym Meyer said if the administration wants to move forward with canceling Solar for All funds, ""we will see them in court.""

Grant recipients have already challenged the administration's actions, and a judge ruled in April the EPA cannot freeze the contracts.

Rhode Island Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, the top Democrat on the Senate Environment Committee, called Zeldin's elimination of the solar program a betrayal ""that will further hike electricity costs and make our power grid less reliable.""

You named the 2022 climate bill as a major achievement.
The good news is, in state after state after state, we continue to make progress.
We have to continue to play the best damn defense, but we can continue to be on offense in state after state after state.","When Gene Karpinski took over as the president of the League of Conservation Voters nearly two decades ago, 20 percent of the candidates the environmental lobbying and political powerhouse endorsed for federal office were Republicans.

Last year, none were.

After almost 50 years as a top progressive advocate in Washington, Mr. Karpinski, 73, retired in the spring from his position leading the L.C.V., which is known for its voting scorecard that rates lawmakers on environmental policy. It was also once known for its record of bipartisanship in backing both Republicans and Democrats for office, a relative rarity for Washington interest groups.

But the polarization of Washington and the growing divide between the parties on climate issues has made bipartisanship much more difficult to embrace. President Joseph R. Biden Jr.’s climate law was enacted three years ago over the uniform opposition of Republicans, who repealed large swaths of it in the recent domestic policy legislation President Trump signed into law.

In a recent interview, Mr. Karpinski, a well-known figure on Capitol Hill who started in Washington in 1977 as one of Ralph Nader’s “raiders” and headed the Public Interest Research Group for 21 years, reflected on the shifting politics of environmental policy.

This interview has been lightly edited and condensed for clarity.

What do you see as your biggest achievement at the L.C.V.?

On the institutional side, we built it from a staff of about 30 to a staff of over 200, from a budget of $12 million to a budget of over $200 million and a state L.C.V. network that has also grown significantly. Just as importantly in the long run, we won some significant victories, including the biggest climate bill that the world has ever seen, which, as you know, passed in August of 2022 after a failed effort back in 2009 and 2010.

Learned a lot of lessons. So built the institution into a much more significant force, and won some important policies. Along the way, helped win a lot of elections and became the biggest player in the progressive community to help win elections, to elect climate champions and defeat climate enemies.

One of the interesting things about your group was that you were bipartisan — you endorsed candidates from both parties. Did that stay true through the end of your tenure?

When I first started, I would say about 20 percent of our endorsements at the federal level were Republicans. You needed to work both sides of the aisle to get things done. But that has shifted in the last bit of time, as the Republican Party, frankly, has become captured by the special interests, particularly the oil, gas and coal industries, and did their bidding.

The environment was historically a bipartisan issue. You remember in 1990, the Clean Air Act passed with over 400 votes in the House, 88 votes in the Senate. George [H.W.] Bush, the president, proudly signed it. That bill would not pass today, because the Republican Party leadership would not let that happen.

So has it become impossible for an environmental group such as the L.C.V. to get behind Republicans?

Not impossible, but much, much, much more difficult. I think it remains easier at the state level. We have a network of 33 state LCVs across the country. They do the same kind of work we do — do elections and win policies. Because the fossil fuel industry is not as powerful in some of these states, they can find more bipartisan support there. In Washington, it’s not impossible, but it’s not easy. [Representative] Brian Fitzpatrick is a shining example, someone from a swing district in Pennsylvania who has the highest Republican score. I think he’s probably got about a 70 lifetime score [out of 100]. There used to be a lot more Brian Fitzpatricks.

I remember when congressional Republicans were among the leaders of the environmental movement.

When I started in 2006, the guy I recruited to be my vice chair was a guy named Sherry Boehlert [former Representative Sherwood Boehlert, Republican of New York]. When he retired in 2006, he chaired the House Science Committee as a Republican and held hearings on climate change, and talked about the problems with climate change. We had a whole slew of folks we would meet with all the time: [then-Representatives] Chris Shays, Wayne Gilchrist, Connie Morella, Mark Kirk and many, many more. We would meet in their offices and strategize with Republicans who cared about the environment. Right now the list is far too short.

You named the 2022 climate bill as a major achievement. Do you worry it will all come undone?

[Mr. Trump’s domestic policy legislation] was a horrible bill that will significantly hamper the ability to go forward at the federal level. The good news is, in state after state after state, we continue to make progress. In 2017, after Trump became president, we weren’t going to make any progress at the federal level on climate, so we went back to the states, elected a lot of new governors, a lot of state legislators. Literally less than 1 percent of the public lived in a state with a policy that said we need 100 percent clean energy back in 2017. Now over 40 percent of the country lives in a state with 100 percent clean-energy policy, and the programs will continue in most states.

The progress at the federal level has been severely impacted by the ugly bill and what the [Environmental Protection Agency and Department Of Energy] are doing as well. And the latest E.P.A. proposal coming out very soon — to declare climate change pollution does not impact public health — is appallingly dishonest, and would be deadly for generations to come. We have to continue to play the best damn defense, but we can continue to be on offense in state after state after state.

One of the subjects that emerged in the debate over the so-called big, beautiful bill was a new push to sell public lands for revenue. One of the main priorities of the L.C.V. is to keep public land public. Does it concern you that there’s a new discussion to unload federal property in the West?

It’s absolutely concerning.

To Mansour, this sight is a testament to China's rapid transformation of cutting-edge technology into accessible vehicles that are reshaping Egypt's automotive landscape.

""A growing number of Egyptian consumers are choosing Chinese cars over their German, Japanese, and other counterparts,"" he told Xinhua, crediting their appeal to a trifecta of strengths: advanced tech, near-premium features, and competitive pricing.

The welding factory, part of a 123-million-U.S. dollar venture between China's Jetour and Egypt's major automotive dealer Kasrawy Group, is expected to assemble and produce Jetour T1 and T2 models next year, with the goal of both local market supply and export.

Mostafa Hussein, vice president of Kasrawy's automotive division for Jetour vehicles, outlined the company's ambitious expansion plans: An existing 55,000-square-meter factory producing Jetour X70 Plus will soon be complemented by an 86,000-square-meter plant slated for 2025 completion.

The team chose public roads near GM’s Milford Proving Ground in southeastern Michigan, finishing in Detroit’s Belle Isle. To accommodate the test, engineers took one-hour driving shifts, each bringing their expertise to the wheel. They traveled at a constant speed of 20 to 25 miles per hour, which they discovered increased efficiency by channeling nearly all battery power to propulsion.

Tires were inflated to their highest recommended pressure to reduce rolling resistance. The spare tire was left behind to shave weight. Wheel alignment was calculated for optimal performance and windshield wiper arms were lowered to cut drag. Climate control was turned off entirely, while hard braking and quick acceleration were avoided to maintain an energy-saving pace.

Driving 20 to 25 miles per hour for 1,059.2 miles isn’t practical for most, but the engineers’ slow, steady pace revealed a truth: this truck’s battery and design can go farther than anyone thought, even under conditions most drivers would never duplicate.

Each mile fed data back to GM’s engineers, giving them insights into battery chemistry, drive unit efficiency and vehicle dynamics. Kurt Kelty, GM’s vice president of battery, propulsion and sustainability, said it was all about teamwork. It required deep integration across software, engineering and driving strategy to get every last mile out of the charge.

When the odometer hit 1,059.2 miles the team didn’t just break the Lucid Air’s 749-mile record they smashed it by 310 miles. This wasn’t an official Guinness World Record, GM treated it as an internal challenge, a proof of concept for their electric vehicle technology. To celebrate they recharged the Silverado EV and used its battery to power a 3D printer and made a trophy for the team’s achievement – a fitting nod to their ingenuity.

Silver linings for First Solar Even though Donald Trump’s new bill curtails many of Joe Biden’s incentives for solar power, there are several silver linings for First Solar.","The US has been undergoing a quiet energy revolution. The amount of energy produced by solar, wind and geothermal sources has more than tripled over the last decade. Solar energy has been one of the big winners.

Total installed capacity has grown eightfold, while solar power’s share of new energy capacity has expanded almost continuously from a minuscule 4% in 2010 to 66% in 2024, a figure that rises to 84% when you include storage. While Trump’s return to the White House has cast doubt on the subsector’s progress, even he may not be able to stop its rise. That is good news for firms like First Solar (Nasdaq: FSLR).

For most of its history, First Solar has focused on making and installing solar panels; it is still the seventh-largest manufacturer of photovoltaic (solar) power cells in the world. However, in the past few years, it has shifted its emphasis from panels for retail customers to utilities and now makes much of its money from building and maintaining solar power plants.

This shift has proved a shrewd move, as power companies have been eager to invest in solar energy in order to secure a range of tax credits and mandates from both the US government and individual states, notably the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022.

Silver linings for First Solar

Even though Donald Trump’s new bill curtails many of Joe Biden’s incentives for solar power, there are several silver linings for First Solar. Firstly, the tax credits for utilities will last longer than those for residential panels, while Trump’s changes won’t affect state-level mandates.

Most importantly, Trump’s tariff policies mean that the solar panels sold by Chinese rivals, who currently dominate the market, accounting for seven out of ten of the world’s largest producers, are now much more expensive. While the tariffs have also increased the price of many components that First Solar imports, the net impact of the tariffs is so positive for First Solar that even when you take the subsidy cuts into account, the group is in a better position than it was before Trump arrived in office, according to management.

First Solar has made excellent progress over the past few years, with sales rising from $3.06 billion in 2019 to $4.21 billion five years later – an increase of 40%. Sales are expected to grow even faster in future, increasing by around 50% in the next two years. Normalised earnings per share have jumped more than tenfold between 2019 and 2024, while operating margins have swelled, and the company now boasts a double-digit return on capital employed. Despite this, First Solar is still valued at only eight times 2026 earnings.

With First Solar recently upgrading its profit forecasts, the stock has been on a tear, beating the wider market over the last six months. It is also trading above its 50-day and 200-day moving averages. I therefore suggest that you go long at the current price of $184 at £11 per $1. In that case I recommend putting the stop-loss at $100, which gives you a total downside risk of £924.",https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5aJKhumDEyJrFX9Tf78koJ.jpg,N,,2025-08-10 04:59:10.215663

If every gasoline-powered vehicle in the US were replaced by an EV, transmission constraints would prevent the cleanest available electricity from reaching many charging locations. This “grid congestion” would force greater reliance on nearby fossil fuel power plants, undercutting the emissions benefits of electrification.

After identifying the issue, the study also recommends a modest set of targeted transmission grid upgrades to alleviate congestion and unlock the full emissions-reduction potential of EV adoption.

Northwestern’s Adilson Motter, the Charles E. and Emma H. Morrison Professor of Physics at Northwestern’s Weinberg College of Arts and Sciences and the director of the Center for Network Dynamics, conducted the research with Chao Duan, a former Research Assistant Professor at Northwestern.

Like a highway system, the power grid is a vast infrastructure that transmits electricity across the US. After being generated at plants, electricity travels long distances through high-voltage transmission lines that span entire states and regions. It then reaches substations, where its voltage is reduced. Power then flows through distribution lines to homes, businesses and EV charging stations.

To analyze electricity’s journey through power lines, the researchers combined data on vehicle usage and power grid infrastructure. Using advanced computer models, the team simulated the flow of electricity across the US under varying levels of vehicle electrification and renewable energy generation. In every scenario with high EV adoption, grid congestion emerged as a critical bottleneck.

As EV adoption increases, so does electricity demand, especially in urban areas. But renewable energy sources such as wind and solar are typically located far from cities, such as on rural wind farms or solar arrays in the desert. While clean energy is available, transmission capacity is often too limited to deliver it where it is needed, including EV charging stations. As a result, the grid draws electricity from closer—but more polluting—power plants that generate electricity by burning coal, oil and gas.

In the study’s most ambitious simulation, scientists converted the entire US vehicle fleet to electric. If the grid had adequate transmission capacity, this shift could eliminate nearly all vehicle-related CO2 emissions once renewable energy matches nonrenewable energy generation. But, with current grid constraints, one-third of those potential emissions savings would be lost.

The charging schedule of EVs can be optimized to align with intermittent renewable generation But even with smart charging, efficient use of clean energy still depends on having enough transmission capacity to deliver it where it’s needed.

—Adilson Motter

To address this bottleneck, the researchers calculated how much additional transmission capacity would be needed. They found that increasing the existing grid’s transmission capacity by as little as 3 to 13% would significantly reduce congestion. This could involve building new high-voltage lines or expanding existing ones—enabling more clean power from remote wind and solar farms to reach the cities and suburbs where EV charging demand is highest.

Motter stresses that the entire grid does not need to be rebuilt. Instead, he recommends targeted upgrades in areas where congestions are most likely to occur. The US grid is divided into three largely independent regions—Eastern, Western and Texas—with limited ability to transfer power among them. Improved connections and coordination among regions would help clean energy reach the areas that need it most.

Power grids began as local networks, where consumption was close to generation. Over time, they evolved into nationwide — even continent-wide — systems. It was a gradual growth process built on existing infrastructure. No one wants to redesign it from scratch, but we do need targeted upgrades that reflect the large-scale reach of today’s grid.

Maintaining a constant speed offers the same energy savings with an EV as it does with gas-powered vehicles.","General Motors Co. engineers unofficially broke industry records for miles driven in an electric vehicle on a single charge, the Detroit automaker said Tuesday, going more than 1,000 miles.

Drivers reached more than double the Environmental Protection Agency’s estimated 493-mile range for the 2026 Silverado EV Work Truck, which Chief Engineer Joe Roy said is GM’s longest-range offering.

The test comes as U.S. adoption of EVs grows much slower than GM and other automakers anticipated, accounting for more than 7% of the market this year. Analysts predict interest will temporarily drop once the $7,500 tax credits for EV buyers end in September and the Trump administration works to roll back emissions regulations that incentivized production despite lagging consumer demand.

Roy said increasing EV range remains a top priority to sway skeptics worried about frequent charging.

“Range is the No. 1 pain point from a customer perspective,” Roy said.

Volunteers drove the Silverado in roughly hour-long shifts, 12 hours a day over the course of seven days to test the extended-range battery’s limits.

Officially, the Lucid Air Grand Touring holds the Guinness World Record for most miles driven on a single charge. A team of three drivers officially earned the title July 5 after driving more than 748 miles from Silvaplana, Switzerland, to Munich, Germany, over the course of two days.

The Silverado’s journey was less intense. Engineers plotted routes for maximum efficiency around metro Detroit. Like the Lucid team, drivers took advantage of optimal warm weather during the summer for the best battery performance.

To maintain battery life as long as possible, drivers also turned off the truck’s air conditioning, despite several 90-degree days. No riders were permitted during most of the test, and the team ditched the vehicle’s spare tire to reduce weight. Testing stopped before nightfall, which avoided using battery power to run headlights. And drivers kept speeds at 20-25 miles per hour as often as possible.

“We’re definitely taking this to the extreme limit here,” said Jon Doremus, who led the range project. “But there is a lot that you can learn from it. Things like looking ahead and driving for efficiency (and) maybe picking routes that are more efficient rather than taking the interstate if you have a little more time to get where you’re going.”

How to get the most range

Don’t drive with a lead foot. Constant acceleration takes energy. Silverado test drivers tried to increase speed before hills and coast up as much as possible before stepping on the “gas.” “When you see a hill coming, make sure you gain speed before it,” Doremus said, “and let it coast up the hill as much as you can.”

Brake slowly for a smooth ride and energy savings. Slamming on the brakes also wastes energy used during acceleration. “Rather than speeding up and then having to stop a lot for every stoplight,” coast as much as possible, Doremus said.

An overarching goal is to get data center developers to put their money where their mouth is.","HARRISBURG, Pa. — Amid rising electric bills, states are under pressure to insulate regular household and business ratepayers from the costs of feeding Big Tech's energy-hungry data centers.

It's not clear that any state has a solution and the actual effect of data centers on electricity bills is difficult to pin down. Some critics question whether states have the spine to take a hard line against tech behemoths like Microsoft, Google, Amazon and Meta.

But more than a dozen states have begun taking steps as data centers drive a rapid build-out of power plants and transmission lines.

That has meant pressuring the nation's biggest power grid operator to clamp down on price increases, studying the effect of data centers on electricity bills or pushing data center owners to pay a larger share of local transmission costs.

Rising power bills are “something legislators have been hearing a lot about. It’s something we’ve been hearing a lot about. More people are speaking out at the public utility commission in the past year than I’ve ever seen before,” said Charlotte Shuff of the Oregon Citizens’ Utility Board, a consumer advocacy group. “There’s a massive outcry.”

Not the typical electric customer

Some data centers could require more electricity than cities the size of Pittsburgh, Cleveland or New Orleans, and make huge factories look tiny by comparison. That's pushing policymakers to rethink a system that, historically, has spread transmission costs among classes of consumers that are proportional to electricity use.

“A lot of this infrastructure, billions of dollars of it, is being built just for a few customers and a few facilities and these happen to be the wealthiest companies in the world,” said Ari Peskoe, who directs the Electricity Law Initiative at Harvard University. “I think some of the fundamental assumptions behind all this just kind of breaks down.”

A fix, Peskoe said, is a “can of worms"" that pits ratepayer classes against one another.

Some officials downplay the role of data centers in pushing up electric bills.

Tricia Pridemore, who sits on Georgia’s Public Service Commission and is president of the National Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners, pointed to an already tightened electricity supply and increasing costs for power lines, utility poles, transformers and generators as utilities replace aging equipment or harden it against extreme weather.

The data centers needed to accommodate the artificial intelligence boom are still in the regulatory planning stages, Pridemore said, and the Data Center Coalition, which represents Big Tech firms and data center developers, has said its members are committed to paying their fair share.

But growing evidence suggests that the electricity bills of some Americans are rising to subsidize the massive energy needs of Big Tech as the U.S. competes in a race against China for artificial intelligence superiority.

Data and analytics firm Wood Mackenzie published a report in recent weeks that suggested 20 proposed or effective specialized rates for data centers in 16 states it studied aren’t nearly enough to cover the cost of a new natural gas power plant.

In other words, unless utilities negotiate higher specialized rates, other ratepayer classes — residential, commercial and industrial — are likely paying for data center power needs.

Meanwhile, Monitoring Analytics, the independent market watchdog for the mid-Atlantic grid, produced research in June showing that 70% — or $9.3 billion — of last year's increased electricity cost was the result of data center demand.

States are responding

Last year, five governors led by Pennsylvania's Josh Shapiro began pushing back against power prices set by the mid-Atlantic grid operator, PJM Interconnection, after that amount spiked nearly sevenfold. They warned of customers “paying billions more than is necessary.”

PJM has yet to propose ways to guarantee that data centers pay their freight, but Monitoring Analytics is floating the idea that data centers should be required to procure their own power.

In a filing last month, it said that would avoid a ""massive wealth transfer” from average people to tech companies.

At least a dozen states are eyeing ways to make data centers pay higher local transmission costs.

In Oregon, a data center hot spot, lawmakers passed legislation in June ordering state utility regulators to develop new — presumably higher — power rates for data centers.

The Oregon Citizens’ Utility Board says there is clear evidence that costs to serve data centers are being spread across all customers — at a time when some electric bills there are up 50% over the past four years and utilities are disconnecting more people than ever.

New Jersey’s governor signed legislation last month commissioning state utility regulators to study whether ratepayers are being hit with “unreasonable rate increases” to connect data centers and to develop a specialized rate to charge data centers.

In some other states, like Texas and Utah, governors and lawmakers are trying to avoid a supply-and-demand crisis that leaves ratepayers on the hook — or in the dark.

Doubts about states protecting ratepayers

In Indiana, state utility regulators approved a settlement between Indiana Michigan Power Co., Amazon, Google, Microsoft and consumer advocates that set parameters for data center payments for service.

Kerwin Olsen, of the Citizens Action Council of Indiana, a consumer advocacy group, signed the settlement and called it a “pretty good deal” that contained more consumer protections than what state lawmakers passed.

But, he said, state law doesn't force large power users like data centers to publicly reveal their electric usage, so pinning down whether they're paying their fair share of transmission costs ""will be a challenge.”

In a March report, the Environmental and Energy Law Program at Harvard University questioned the motivation of utilities and regulators to shield ratepayers from footing the cost of electricity for data centers.

Both utilities and states have incentives to attract big customers like data centers, it said.

To do it, utilities — which must get their rates approved by regulators — can offer “special deals to favored customers” like a data center and effectively shift the costs of those discounts to regular ratepayers, the authors wrote. Many state laws can shield disclosure of those rates, they said.

In Pennsylvania, an emerging data center hot spot, the state utility commission is drafting a model rate structure for utilities to consider adopting. An overarching goal is to get data center developers to put their money where their mouth is.

“We’re talking about real transmission upgrades, potentially hundreds of millions of dollars,” commission chairman Stephen DeFrank said. “And that’s what you don’t want the ratepayer to get stuck paying for.""",https://media.tegna-media.com/assets/CCT/images/fbd1a651-f7ed-42cb-bedc-9a518507ed59/20250809T121407/fbd1a651-f7ed-42cb-bedc-9a518507ed59_1140x641.jpg,N,,2025-08-10 05:58:20.741087

“Heavy Rain and Flooding in China Kill At Least 30”

— Headlines in recent days

Yes, climate change is bad news, arriving as deadly fires and floods, a rush of hurricanes and tornadoes, drought and dangerous heat.

And life gets complicated when we try to mitigate the impacts. Traditional jobs are threatened, people are asked to sacrifice, taxes go higher and familiar ways of doing things go out the window.

Why can’t life be simple? Who the heck wants to pay extra money for an electric car or a roof-full of solar panels?

But there is this problem. Who wants to pretend the climate isn’t changing?

Folks in the Trump administration aren’t dismantling environmental research efforts because they’re expecting rosy results. They’re furloughing scientists to steer clear of findings that leads to difficult, costly and often unpopular choices. The Environmental Protection Agency “plans to ignore science, stop regulating greenhouse gases,” said the technology news site, Ars Technica.

Doing something about climate change, it should be said, might also inconvenience the people who bankrolled the current administration’s rise to power. For those folks, change is welcome so long as it doesn’t happen any time soon.

And so President Donald Trump kicks the can down the road, claiming — all evidence to the contrary — that climate change is a hoax. For too many companies, exemptions from environmental rules are now available for the asking. A recent headline in the New York Times: “Candidate Trump Promised Oil Executives a Windfall. Now, They’re Getting It.”

When the U.S. government pretends there’s nothing to see here, the winner will be China, which means to dominate the market for clean-energy technologies.

Here in Sonoma and Napa counties, we don’t need to search far and wide for examples of the havoc brought about by climate change. People’s lives were forever changed by the 2017 fires, which destroyed more than 5,900 homes and killed 31 people.

Catastrophes happen elsewhere as well. Just ask the folks in the Hill Country of central Texas where people are still missing a month after torrential rains and devastating floods. The death toll sits at 108.

Or ask the folks in Los Angeles where winds and heat in January — January! — caused the costliest fires in U.S. history. The 31st fatality was uncovered last month.

“Across the Northern Hemisphere,” the New York Times reported, “searing temperatures are breaking records, disrupting everyday life and costing lives.”

After taking note of deadly heat waves in Europe, Pakistan, China, Japan and the U.S., the article said the world is getting hotter faster. (Paradoxically, the deadly heat in Pakistan gave way to torrential rains and flooding that led to the deaths of 57 people, including many children.)

Meanwhile, scientists warned that a drought in the southwest United States could last for decades.

“Climate Change Is Making Fire Weather Worse for World’s Forests,” said a recent New York Times headline.

Wildfires are not new to California, but their severity is. There’s a reason 15 of the 20 most destructive fires in state history occurred in the past decade.

No one should wonder why insurance premiums are going through the roof (except, of course, when the insurance company cancels your coverage altogether). Questions now are being raised about the long-term viability of the state program meant to backstop the out-migration of private insurers.

Premiums will go higher, CalMatters reported, as insurers are granted permission to deploy so-called catastrophe modeling.

A new poll from the Public Policy Institute of California found that 79% of likely voters view climate change as a very serious or somewhat serious problem.

“Nowhere is the battle over climate change policy more urgent than in California,” reported CalMatters, teeing up a Sept. 17 conference on California and climate change. “The Golden State leads the nation with more EVs than any other, a gas car phaseout mandate, groundbreaking climate disclosure rules, and a dominance in solar and storage. But in 2025, that leadership is under siege.”

For residents hereabouts, the threat of wildfire stopped being theoretical early in the morning of Oct. 9, 2017. In Santa Rosa, the brooding, dawn sky gave way to thoughts of nuclear winter.

The devastation broke our hearts. We all know so many people who lost their homes and a lifetime of keepsakes. The stories of people fleeing in their bedclothes, of melted cars and of neighborhoods turned to ashes will live with us forever.

The New York Times reported on Wednesday that a new study found the wildfire season is starting earlier in California and human-caused climate change is the main cause.

It’s August. In the North Bay, this means the fire season has arrived, and it’s not going away soon enough.

You know the drill. Pack your go-bag, know your evacuation routes and be careful out there.

That includes more than $117 million for projects in Indiana.

The $7 billion Solar For All program set up under the Biden administration aimed to lower residents' energy bills and reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin made the announcement on X Thursday. He said the agency plans to follow the intent of the ""One Big Beautiful Bill.""

""EPA no longer has the authority to administer the program or the appropriated funds to keep this boondoggle alive,"" Zeldin said.

Lower-income Hoosiers are more likely to live in older, less energy-efficient homes that use more power. Advocates said putting solar on these homes not only lowers their energy bills, but also reduces the need for more power plants — which all electric utility customers pay for.

The funding cut comes at a time when the average Indiana resident's bill has gone up by $28 a month since last year. Mo McReynolds directs Indianapolis's Office of Sustainability.

""Indianapolis, compared to other cities our size, has a particularly high energy burden — meaning the ratio of an average household income that gets paid toward their utility bills. We're particularly good candidate for a program like this,"" she said.

Alison Becker is with Solar Opportunities Indiana, a coalition helping to mange the grant funding. She said, without the federal dollars, most of the solar projects the group oversees won't move forward.

That includes plans to put solar and battery storage at libraries in lower-income, southern Indiana communities — which would help during storms when the power is out.

""The library can be made available to charge cell phones, be warm or be cool, have food available — just a place for the community to be and to be able to be safe,"" Becker said.

Denise Abdul-Rahman is the founder of Black Sunlight Sustainability, which has been helping to connect qualified communities and individuals to the program. She said the land and utility agreements have already been secured for several projects she's working on — but she'll need to find new funding.

""So it's just going to slow the pace, but now that we've done all of this work — there's no way we're going to stop,"" Abdul-Rahman said.

Becker said, according to the grant agreement, installers and other parties are only reimbursed after the work is done.

She said Solar Opportunities Indiana may consider legal action if Congress doesn't follow through with its funding obligations.

Inflation, geopolitical tensions, and regulatory shifts have created a landscape where only the most agile companies can thrive. Enphase Energy (NASDAQ: ENPH) has emerged as a standout, not merely surviving but accelerating its growth trajectory. This article examines how the company's strategic positioning and operational execution have fortified its resilience, offering insights for investors navigating a sector in flux.

Financial Resilience Amid Macroeconomic Headwinds

Enphase's Q2 2025 results underscore its ability to deliver consistent profitability even as broader market conditions tighten. Revenue of $363.2 million, driven by $40.4 million in safe harbor revenue, reflects a diversified revenue stream that cushions against volatility. Non-GAAP gross margins of 48.6% and operating income of $98.6 million highlight a business model that prioritizes efficiency. With $1.53 billion in cash and marketable securities, Enphase's liquidity position is robust, providing flexibility to invest in innovation or weather short-term disruptions.

Strategic Positioning: Innovation and Market Expansion

Enphase's resilience stems from its dual focus on product innovation and geographic diversification. The launch of the fourth-generation Energy System, including the IQ Battery 10C, exemplifies its commitment to solving real-world challenges. The 30% increase in energy density and 62% reduction in wall space requirements address key pain points for residential customers, while the IQ Meter Collar's approval by 29 U.S. utilities accelerates grid integration.

In Europe, Enphase is capitalizing on the energy transition by ramping up shipments of the IQ Battery with FlexPhase to markets like Spain and Germany. The IQ Balcony Solar Kit, tailored for urban dwellers, taps into a previously underserved segment, demonstrating the company's ability to adapt to local demand. Meanwhile, the expansion of the IQ EV Charger 2 into new markets underscores its vision of integrating solar, storage, and electric vehicle infrastructure—a critical edge as the sector converges.

Operational Execution: Leveraging Policy and Supply Chain Strengths

Enphase's operational execution is equally compelling. The company's U.S. manufacturing efforts, which qualify for 45X production tax credits, align with the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA)'s incentives for domestic clean energy production. This not only reduces costs but also insulates Enphase from global supply chain bottlenecks. The $34–38 million net IRA benefit projected for Q3 2025 illustrates how policy tailwinds are being monetized.

Moreover, Enphase's digital platform, Solargraf, is a differentiator. Enhancements like AI-driven design tools and third-party ownership integrations streamline the customer journey for installers, fostering loyalty and scalability. These digital capabilities are critical in a sector where customer experience can dictate market share.

Navigating Challenges: Tariffs, Tax Credits, and Competition

Despite its strengths, Enphase faces headwinds. Reciprocal tariffs and the potential expiration of the 25D tax credit could pressure margins. However, the company's diversified product portfolio and IRA-driven domestic production mitigate these risks. For instance, the shift to U.S. manufacturing reduces exposure to international trade policies, while the IRA's 10-year tax credit window provides a buffer.

Competition from legacy players and new entrants remains a concern. Tesla's Solar Roof and LG's energy storage solutions are formidable, but Enphase's focus on modular, scalable systems for residential markets creates a niche. Its ability to integrate microinverters, batteries, and EV charging into a cohesive ecosystem positions it as a one-stop shop—a rarity in a fragmented sector.

Investment Outlook: A Cautious Bull Case

For investors, Enphase represents a compelling case of strategic foresight and operational discipline. The company's Q3 guidance—$330–370 million in revenue and 43–46% non-GAAP gross margins—suggests continued momentum. However, prudence is warranted. The clean energy sector's volatility means that macroeconomic shifts could test Enphase's resilience.

A long-term investor might consider ENPH as a core holding in a clean energy portfolio, given its leadership in residential solar and storage. Short-term traders, however, should monitor macroeconomic indicators and the company's ability to maintain margins amid rising component costs.

Conclusion

Enphase Energy's resilience lies in its ability to marry innovation with execution. By leveraging policy incentives, expanding into high-growth markets, and refining its product ecosystem, the company has positioned itself as a leader in distributed energy. While challenges persist, its financial strength and strategic agility make it a compelling candidate for investors seeking exposure to the clean energy transition.

Welcome back to another episode of TEN — Transport Evolved News! Thanks for joining me!. This week’s show is quite heavy on US news – I’m sorry – but there’s some call to actions I can’t ignore.

We’re into August now, and that means July sales figures are trickling in. While not every automaker has reported, here’s what we know from the U.S. market.

Ford’s U.S. sales rose five percent year over year, but its EV sales dipped zero point two percent. The Mustang Mach E had its best July yet with just over five thousand three hundred sold, and F150 Lightning sales rose a little. The E-Transit, however, struggled, down eighty-nine percent. Honda logged a strong month, selling over six thousand three hundred Prologue EVs—an eighty-three percent year-over-year increase. That car’s cousin, the Chevrolet Equinox EV, helped GM boost EV sales one hundred and fifteen percent, with eight and a half thousand sold. Hyundai also had a record month for the brand, selling just over five thousand eight hundred IONIQ 5s. And outside of the U.S., Norway continues to lead globally—with ninety-seven point two percent of new cars sold there in July being fully electric.

From sales figures, we move on to quarterlies, with both Rivian and Lucid posting Q2 results this week.

Rivian beat revenue expectations, bringing in one point three billion dollars versus the expected one point two six billion, but posted a larger than expected net loss of one point one two billion. That’s an improvement over last year’s Q2 loss of one point four six billion, but reflects lower sales partly due to a temporary plant shutdown preparing for R2 production. Rivian expects some headwinds from tariffs and policy changes but says it’s on track to meet full-year production guidance, with R2 prep nearly complete. Meanwhile, Lucid posted Q2 revenue of two hundred fifty-nine point four million dollars and a loss of seven hundred ninety million, both missing Wall Street expectations. While Lucid’s figures show progress toward profitability—especially with new overseas sales—it lowered production guidance slightly, citing the “potential impact of continuously changing market environment and external factors,” which we all read as “President Trump”.

EV skeptics often say EVs have a larger lifecycle carbon footprint than internal combustion vehicles, due to the emissions from mining and refining materials for motors and batteries. But BMW has just published the receipts to prove otherwise—at least for its soon-to-launch iX3.

After just twenty-one thousand five hundred kilometers, or about thirteen thousand four hundred miles, its carbon footprint is lower than a comparable gas car when charged using the current European electrical grid mix. A big part of that is thanks to BMW’s low-emission production setup for its Neue Klasse EVs, of which the iX3 is the first. Using one hundred percent renewable energy, the break-even point drops to seventeen thousand five hundred kilometers, or about ten thousand eight hundred miles—making EVs the smart choice if you need a personal car and can’t take public transit.

Mid-week, General Motors and Hyundai announced progress has been made on a memorandum of understanding signed between the brands on shared vehicle platforms.

The two companies now say they will work together on co-developing five new vehicles, and while some of the work will result in hybrid and internal combustion engine models – something I’m personally a little frustrated to see – the collaboration also promises a new, jointly-designed electric commercial van which could launch in North America as early as twenty twenty-eight. While details are sparse right now, the EV development will be led by Hyundai, and result in a van that is smaller than the current BrightDrop delivery vans – vans, I should note, haven’t been selling so well of late.

One week ahead of its next-gen EV reveal, Ford has officially brought its Californian Skunkworks project out of “stealth mode”.

Based in Long Beach, the once-secret site now wears a Ford logo and looks more like a startup than a car company. It’s staffed with former Tesla, Apple, and Silicon Valley engineers, and the group is focused on fast-tracking Ford’s next electric platforms—and the open, modern workspace reflects that mission. Meanwhile, Ford has filed a trademark for the Ranchero name, for use in a future vehicle. Given the original was a muscle-car pickup, and Ford’s fondness for reviving legacy badges for EVs, I suspect that’s the name we’re going to see for Ford’s soon-to-be-revealed lower-cost, smaller-footprint pickup. Since we have just a few days until the event, you can bet we’ll be covering it more next week!

It’s no secret the U.S. Government—under President Trump—is working to eliminate federal support for electric vehicles. But individual states aren’t all following suit.

In Indiana, GOEVIN (that’s Go Electric Vehicle Indiana) just allocated three point three million dollars in funding to state projects that aim to expand DC fast charging and Level 2 charging infrastructure statewide. Half a continent away, the California Energy Commission launched a new fifty-five million dollar Fast Charge California program this week to cover up to one hundred percent of installation costs for EV fast chargers at businesses and public sites across the state, with applications open through October 29th. And, in a separate funding push, CALSTART has announced a fifty-six and a half million dollar program in California to help fund EV charger installations at multifamily homes and other tenant-accessible locations—addressing charging access for renters across the state.

EV startup Polestar — originally a performance sub-brand of Volvo and now a standalone marque — is technically a Chinese company, as it’s owned by Geely, despite many of its vehicles being designed in Sweden and built outside of China.

This week, we learned that while Polestar’s sales in Europe and the U.S. grew by fifty-one percent year-over-year during the first half of 2025, its sales in China have plummeted. According to multiple Chinese media reports, the company now has just one physical retail location in China — in Shanghai — and has halted online sales. Test drives are reportedly only available by appointment, and rumors suggest Polestar may exit the Chinese market entirely by year’s end. Of the more than thirty thousand vehicles Polestar sold globally in the first half of 2025, just sixty-nine were sold in China — a grim figure in a country where the top five EV manufacturers collectively sold more than two million vehicles during the same period.

Since January, we’ve steered clear of covering Tesla due to its CEO’s persistent promotion of far-right rhetoric. However, recent developments have compelled us to mention it beyond the usual recall notices—because of its growing negative impact on the industry.

This week, multiple outlets reported that Tesla owes more than twenty-four million dollars to small independent suppliers and contractors—many of whom have declared bankruptcy while waiting for payment on work completed at the company’s Texas Gigafactory. At the same time, Tesla faces a growing number of lawsuits, including allegations of securities fraud over its Robotaxi claims, wrongful death suits linked to Autopilot crashes, and accusations that it misled crash investigators and plaintiffs. Since many people still treat Tesla as synonymous with EVs, the company’s actions are already affecting the wider electric vehicle market. One study published last week suggests Elon Musk’s behavior is fueling a broader backlash against EV adoption. And yet, Tesla’s board—acting independently of shareholders—has just approved a twenty-nine billion dollar pay package for Musk, despite ongoing legal challenges over past compensation deals. It’s up to the industry—and all of us—to stand up to this kind of behavior.

The U.S. State of Georgia’s statewide initiative, Georgia BRIGHT, launched a new program this week offering qualifying low-income homeowners a chance to get rooftop solar installed for free.

It’s part of the federal Solar for All initiative, a seven billion dollar program funded by the Biden administration to make solar more accessible. In Georgia, the program has enough funding to cover four hundred installations this year for families earning less than eighty percent of their county’s area median income, with another four hundred systems planned for next year. Yet the U.S. EPA just confirmed it’s contacting all the states, non-profits, and Tribal nations that received Solar for All funding—demanding the money back. If successful—and it’s legally murky whether the federal government can claw back funds already appropriated by law—it could devastate low-cost solar programs nationwide.

If you’re in the U.S., this kind of behavior from the federal government is becoming de rigueur—but in a week where President Trump rescinded all Wind Energy Areas in U.S. coastal waters and ordered a sweeping review of all wind turbine permitting nationwide, now is the time to act.

As we noted in last week’s show, the EPA is trying to erase the 2009 Endangerment Finding—a foundational ruling that enabled decades of clean air and pollution regulations. If successful, it could gut fuel economy standards, eliminate polluter fines, and unravel environmental protections nationwide. Before the proposed rollback becomes law, there’s a legally required public consultation period—and it just opened this week. If you’re in the U.S., you have until September fifteenth to make your voice heard, and there are virtual public hearings scheduled for August nineteenth and twentieth.

Links are in the show notes to help you through the process—and let us know in the comments if you’d like a video on how to effectively make your voice heard by the… Enriching Polluters Administration.

And those are your news shorts! There will be more next week!

Our final two stories are coming up next, but first, a quick word from one of today’s sponsors — Energy Sage, who can help those of you in the U.S. green your heating and energy!

Energy Sage connects you with local, verified solar installers across the United States — and now heat pump specialists in select markets — who really know their stuff and can help guide you through installing solar panels or getting a heat pump. Not a homeowner? No worries. Energy Sage can still help you green your electricity by joining a community solar program!

We used Energy Sage ourselves when looking for installers willing to put solar panels on our roof, and their verified pros were knowledgeable and even introduced us to a great credit union to finance the project with low monthly payments.

As I’m sure many of you know, HR1 is now U.S. law, and all incentives for solar — including savings of as much as thirty percent through the federal tax credit — will disappear soon. Solar projects take time, so if you want to lock in these savings, it’s important to act now because… time is running out.

Follow the links below to sign up for Energy Sage’s free, no-obligation service and get started today! And if you choose an Energy Sage installer, we’ll receive a small referral fee — so you’ll be helping us too! Help the grid get greener, save money, gain energy independence, and support our show — it’s a win-win-win-win!

And now, it’s time for those last two stories.

Vehicle-to-grid (V2G) technology is something I’m a big fan of — I even made a video this week showing how I powered this studio from an EV during a power outage.

Many people worry that using V2G or vehicle-to-home (V2H) systems will harm EV battery life. But new research from RWTH Aachen University, a leading German technical university, and The Mobility House Energy shows the long-term impact on battery capacity is minimal. Their study found that after ten years of V2G use, battery capacity drops by about twenty-one percent, compared to eighteen percent for a similar vehicle driven the same distance without V2G. That means only around a six-mile (ten kilometer) difference in WTLP range over ten years — a small effect most won’t notice. So go ahead: use your EV to add energy stability at home without fearing serious battery wear.

And finally,

Automakers love celebrating when their vehicles do something new or unusual—be it a world tour or a speed record—for marketing hype.

A few weeks ago, I mentioned a downhill (still impressive) range test in Europe with a Lucid Air Gravity. It set a new Guinness World Record for longest distance on a single EV charge, though the downhill route helped. This week, GM chased similar attention. Engineers drove the Chevrolet Silverado EV Max Range Work Truck over one thousand fifty-nine miles (about one thousand seven hundred five kilometres) on a single charge—more than double its EPA range. Unlike the Lucid trip, this was done at just twenty to twenty-five miles per hour (around thirty-two to forty kilometres per hour) near GM’s Milford Proving Ground. Drivers hypermiled by turning off AC and inflating tires fully. They celebrated with a 3D-printed trophy, but honestly, it’s mostly a stunt. I’ve got a video planned, so let’s leave it there.

Before I go, a huge thank you to the Electric Vehicle Association for sponsoring today’s show. The EVA has been advocating for electric vehicles since nineteen sixty-seven and remains firmly committed to a cleaner, greener future for all. Join the EVA today to find out how to become an EV educator, meet like-minded fans, get help to make your own transition to electric – help that includes a low-interest loan program to help finance your next step!

If you’d like to support the channel, you can do so for just one dollar and fifty cents a month on Patreon — and if you can, we’d really appreciate it. YouTube is now a cesspool of AI nonsense and trolls, has yet-again reduced creator ad payout, and while we’d love to host elsewhere there’s not really a good alternative right now (and no, Nebula is invite-only). So right now, Patreon really is our only reliable form of income. If just four hundred of our one hundred and fifty-two thousand subscribers who have yet signed up to patreon did so and committed to giving the equivalent of a fancy coffee a month, would put us in a much better financial position. Right now, we’re surviving on the occasional generous stipend that helps boost our coffers, but I’m not going to lie, the lack of YouTube revenue has led to many a sleepless nights. Our team does deserve normal things – like healthcare and a living wage.

I should also note we’re available for third-party video production work in the Portland Oregon area, if you have a business or project you’d like us to work with you on, reach out. You’ll also find merch at our swag store, and amazon affiliate links in this video description or on our website that you can use to support TE when you worship at the altar of Bezos.

We publish every Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday here — and every Sunday we drop two videos on Transport Evolved Take Two, our informal behind-the-scenes channel.

To finish, remember this:

You are valid. You are loved. You belong — no matter what hateful sods try to claim.

Right now, division and hate aren’t just tolerated — they are encouraged by those in power driven by a lust for cruelty. In these times, kindness and empathy become acts of resistance. Empathy is not weakness — it’s a skill we must nurture and regularly practice to hold onto our shared humanity.

This week has been particularly hard on those of us who have been abused, and those of us in the LGBTQIA+ communities, and if you’ve needed to turn off the news or take a rest and step back from the outside world, please know that’s okay. It’s important to take care of yourself. So, when you’re feeling better, you can come back, stronger than before, to stand up for decency, community and justice. Don’t let the … you know what… win. Especially JK Trolling. Which is what my almost blind mother accidentally typed in a message to me this week. That’s what I’m going to call her from now on.

Wherever you are, whoever you are, whoever you love — you are not alone. Be an ally. Be kind. Be the change you want to see. And please — for the sake of everyone’s future — don’t let hate or ignorance win.

Chen says their collective bargaining agreement doesn't involve wages.
Chen said the Trump administration's decision to strip EPA employees of their collective bargaining protections will lead to less safe practices: ""Make no mistake, this move isn’t about government efficiency or national security.
It’s about silencing workers and clearing the way for more deregulation so corporate polluters can have free reign.
Chen said EPA employees work on issues most Americans likely take for granted everyday.","WASHINGTON — On Friday, the Trump administration and the Environmental Protection Agency stripped employees of their collective bargaining agreement, according to union representatives.

Justin Chen, who is the President of the Association of Government Employees Council 238, says there are a lot of mixed feelings from him and the more than 8000 workers he represents.

""It’s a lot of different things,"" he said. ""It’s anger, disappointment.""

But one thing Chen wasn't feeling was shock at the announcement.

""It wasn’t surprising at all,"" he said.

Chen says their collective bargaining agreement doesn't involve wages. That responsibility is left to Congress. But instead, it includes something called a ""scientific integrity article,"" which essentially is a form of free speech.

""That basically guaranteed their right to speak up and be able to go out to the public and voice their unedited opinion as long as they did not make representations on behalf of the agency, but as their own scientific engineer,"" Chen said. ""They could go out and speak their mind, essentially.""

""One of the things apparently that this administration really does not like within our contract is that we have a scientific integrity article,"" Chen added.

President Donald Trump signed an executive order in March invoking the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 to end collective bargaining at dozens of federal agencies by declaring their primary function to be “intelligence, counterintelligence, investigative or national security work.” Federal judges in D.C. and San Franciso granted preliminary injunctions blocking the order, with one, Judge Paul Friedman, saying it appeared to ""target"" unions who've filed many of the legal challenges to Trump's moves to drastically shrink the size of the federal government.

In May, the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals lifted that injunction and earlier this week the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals lifted a similar order, paving the way for the administration to proceed.

Chen said the Trump administration's decision to strip EPA employees of their collective bargaining protections will lead to less safe practices:

""Make no mistake, this move isn’t about government efficiency or national security. It’s about silencing workers and clearing the way for more deregulation so corporate polluters can have free reign. These are the same industries that bankrolled Trump’s campaign and now stand to profit while Americans pay the price with their health and with our environment.""

Chen said EPA employees work on issues most Americans likely take for granted everyday.

""We are people who are dedicated to being public servants. We don’t do this job to get rich,"" he said. ""We do this job because we have a passion to protect the citizens of this country to guarantee them clean air, clean water and uncontaminated soil to be able to live on.""",https://media.wusa9.com/assets/WUSA/images/b3b0f9d4-97e5-4251-b267-b94376be13d9/20250808T025521/b3b0f9d4-97e5-4251-b267-b94376be13d9_1140x641.jpg,N,,2025-08-10 03:57:58.198705

- Bearish Case: Avoid RIVN until the R2's production and demand risks are validated.","Rivian Automotive (RIVN) has long been a poster child for the challenges facing non-Tesla electric vehicle (EV) startups. Despite its bold vision and early hype, the company has struggled with declining deliveries, razor-thin margins, and macroeconomic headwinds. Its Q2 2025 results—$1.12 billion in net losses, a -16% gross margin, and a $667 million adjusted EBITDA loss—underscore the urgency for a turnaround. Enter the R2: Rivian's upcoming midsize SUV, positioned as a lifeline to reverse its fortunes. But can this vehicle truly offset the company's mounting pressures?

The Current Crossroads: Margins, Deliveries, and Macro Risks

Rivian's financial struggles are no secret. The company's Q2 2025 gross loss of $206 million (a -16% margin) marked a stark reversal from positive margins in Q4 2024. This decline is attributed to underutilized production capacity, rising tariffs (25% on EVs and parts), and the impending expiration of the $7,500 U.S. federal EV tax credit on September 30, 2025. Analysts project adjusted EBITDA losses for 2025 to range between $2 billion and $2.25 billion, a 14% increase from prior guidance.

Meanwhile, Rivian's delivery growth has been uneven. While Q2 2025 deliveries rose to 10,661 units (up from 5,979 produced), this was largely due to inventory carryover from Q1. The company's 2025 delivery guidance of 40,000–46,000 vehicles remains ambitious, but its Q2 performance highlights the fragility of demand in a market saturated with competitors like Tesla (TSLA) and BYD.

The R2: A Strategic Pivot to Mass Market

Rivian's R2, slated for a 2026 launch, is its most aggressive attempt yet to break into the mass market. Priced between $45,000 and $50,000, the R2 targets a segment where Rivian currently has no presence: affordable, family-friendly EVs. This is a critical move, as SUVs account for 50% of U.S. vehicle sales, yet Rivian's current R1 lineup (R1S and R1T) is priced well above the median EV buyer's budget.

The R2's strategic advantages are threefold:

1. Cost Efficiency: Rivian has locked in materials costs for the R2 at 50% less than the R1, with a projected bill of materials of $32,000 per unit. This is a game-changer for a company that posted a $335 million automotive gross loss in Q2 2025.

2. Production Scalability: The R2 will be built at Rivian's Normal, Illinois facility, which is being retooled to produce 155,000 units annually. This scale could reduce fixed costs per unit and improve gross margins.

3. Competitive Positioning: The R2's rugged design, genuine off-road capabilities, and NACS compatibility (enabling Tesla Supercharger use) differentiate it from rivals like the Ford Mustang Mach-E and Hyundai Ioniq 5. Its camping-friendly features and sustainable interior materials also cater to Rivian's core audience of outdoor enthusiasts.

Addressing Macro Risks: Tariffs, Tax Credits, and Tariffs

Rivian's CFO, Claire McDonough, has acknowledged that Trump-era tariffs and the loss of EV tax credits will weigh on 2025 cash flows. However, the R2's U.S.-based production (avoiding 25% import tariffs) and eligibility for the full $7,500 tax credit mitigate these risks. The company has also stockpiled batteries to hedge against potential supply chain disruptions.

The R2's timing is equally strategic. With the tax credit set to expire in September 2025, Rivian is pushing buyers to pull forward purchases in Q3 2025. This could provide a short-term sales boost while the R2's launch in 2026 captures demand from consumers priced out of the R1 lineup.

Analyst Projections and Risks to Watch

Analysts remain cautiously optimistic. Zacks Investment Research has revised 2026 EPS estimates upward by 15 cents, reflecting confidence in the R2's potential to drive margin expansion. The $1 billion Volkswagen investment (part of a $5.8 billion joint venture) also signals external validation of Rivian's strategy.

However, risks persist:

- Production Delays: Rivian's Q2 2025 production of 10,661 units fell short of its 14,611-unit output in Q1, raising concerns about its ability to scale. A three-week factory shutdown in September 2025 to retool for R2 production could further strain delivery timelines.

- Demand Uncertainty: Rivian has not disclosed pre-order numbers for the R2. In a market dominated by Tesla's Model Y and BYD's ATTO 3, the R2 must prove its appeal to budget-conscious buyers.

- Margin Pressures: Even with cost reductions, Rivian's Q2 2025 gross margin of -16% suggests that achieving positive margins will require more than just the R2—it will need sustained production efficiency and pricing discipline.

Investment Implications: A High-Risk, High-Reward Play

For investors, the R2 represents a pivotal inflection point. If Rivian can execute on its production and cost-cutting plans, the R2 could catalyze a path to profitability. The vehicle's affordability, U.S. production, and strategic partnerships (e.g., Volkswagen) position it as a strong contender in the midsize EV segment.

However, the risks are significant. Rivian's stock has underperformed Tesla and BYD, and its financials remain unprofitable. A successful R2 launch would require not only strong demand but also disciplined cost management and timely production.

Investment Advice:

- Bullish Case: Buy RIVN ahead of the R2's 2026 launch if Rivian demonstrates progress in production efficiency and secures strong pre-orders. The R2's potential to drive margin expansion and volume growth could justify a re-rating.

- Bearish Case: Avoid RIVN until the R2's production and demand risks are validated. The company's liquidity ($7.5 billion in cash) provides a buffer, but prolonged losses could erode investor confidence.

In conclusion, the R2 is Rivian's best bet to reverse its earnings trends. While the path to profitability is fraught with challenges, the R2's strategic advantages—cost efficiency, scalability, and market positioning—make it a compelling long-term play for investors with a high risk tolerance.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-08-10 13:06:56.965657

Engineers at the automaker recently piloted a 2026 Silverado EV Max Range Work Truck model across 1,059.2 miles on a single battery charge, eclipsing the prior record of 749 miles set by a Lucid sedan. This achievement, conducted over seven days on public roads near GM’s Milford Proving Ground in Michigan and around Detroit’s Belle Isle, highlights not just battery prowess but also the strategic optimizations that can extend range far beyond standard estimates.

The test vehicle, equipped with a massive battery pack estimated at over 200 kilowatt-hours, adhered to production specifications but incorporated minor modifications like aerodynamic wheel covers and low-rolling-resistance tires. These tweaks, combined with hypermiling techniques—driving at speeds as low as 25 mph to minimize energy consumption—allowed the truck to more than double its EPA-rated range of 493 miles. GM’s team rotated drivers in shifts, ensuring continuous operation without recharging, a process that demanded meticulous planning to avoid depleting the battery prematurely.

Engineering Ingenuity Behind the Record

Details from the drive reveal a blend of innovation and pragmatism. As reported by The Verge, the Silverado EV’s Ultium platform played a pivotal role, leveraging advanced cell chemistry for superior energy density. Unlike typical consumer scenarios, where acceleration and highway speeds drain power quickly, this record attempt prioritized efficiency, with the truck averaging under 20 mph over the marathon journey. Such conditions aren’t replicable in everyday use, but they demonstrate the untapped potential in EV hardware when pushed to extremes.

Industry observers note that this isn’t an official Guinness World Record, as it lacked independent verification, yet it serves as a powerful marketing tool for GM amid intensifying competition in the electric pickup segment. Rivals like Ford’s F-150 Lightning and Rivian’s R1T offer ranges around 300-500 miles, but none have attempted such an extended single-charge demonstration. The Silverado’s performance, as detailed in Motor1, underscores how software calibrations and driver behavior can dramatically influence outcomes, raising questions about the relevance of EPA figures in real-world applications.

Implications for the EV Market and Consumer Expectations

For industry insiders, this record illuminates broader trends in battery technology and vehicle design. GM’s investment in larger packs contrasts with efforts by Tesla and others to optimize aerodynamics and weight for efficiency. According to Car and Driver, the slow-speed strategy effectively halved energy use per mile, a tactic that could inform future autonomous or fleet operations where speed is secondary to endurance. However, critics argue that such feats, while impressive, may mislead consumers expecting similar results in daily driving, where traffic, cargo, and climate control sap range.

Looking ahead, this milestone could accelerate adoption in commercial sectors like delivery and construction, where long-haul capability without frequent charging is prized. GM plans to roll out the 2026 Silverado EV with enhanced features, potentially incorporating lessons from this test to refine over-the-air updates for better efficiency. As Electrek points out, the drive’s success challenges assumptions about EV limitations, particularly for heavy-duty trucks, and positions GM as a leader in pushing boundaries.

Challenges and Future Horizons in Electric Mobility

Despite the triumph, hurdles remain. The seven-day duration highlights the impracticality for most users, and environmental factors like temperature weren’t detailed, which can swing range by 20% or more. Publications such as Electrive emphasize that while the Silverado’s battery tech is cutting-edge, scaling such endurance to affordable models requires cost reductions in materials like lithium and nickel.

Ultimately, this record signals a maturation in EV engineering, where hardware meets human ingenuity to redefine possibilities. For automakers, it sets a high bar, prompting investments in next-gen batteries that could one day make 1,000-mile ranges routine, not exceptional. As the industry shifts toward electrification, feats like this from GM may well catalyze innovations that benefit fleets and individual owners alike, bridging the gap between laboratory potential and on-road reality.",https://www.webpronews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/xai-tmp-imgen-321f50bc-ea64-410a-b234-1a239d46af0a.jpeg,N,,2025-08-10 02:07:58.502920

An engineering team within the Detroit automotive giant managed to push the single-charge EV range record into triple digits, beating out the ever-slippery Lucid Air GT sedan by over 300 miles (483 km) with the Silverado EV. A pickup truck.

As announced last October, the 2025 Silverado EV Max Range Work Truck (8WT) boasts an EPA-estimated range of 492 miles (792 km), shooting right past the Teslas and Rivians of the world to park comfortably behind the 516-mile (830-km) Lucid Air Grand S Touring at the tippity top of the US market range leader list. Its 68-mpg-e efficiency is far less impressive, but you can't call it a slouch when it comes to long-hauling on a single charge.

Well before Lucid's sedan had set its recent 749-mile (1,205-km) mark, itself a full 100 miles (161 km) farther than the previous record, some GM engineers began theorizing about how far the Silverado Max Range WT commercial pickup might actually go with a little bit of forethought and precise execution. Some voices among the group were particularly ambitious: 1,000 miles (1,609 km) didn't seem out of reach.

A proper challenge was formulated, and the team began driving a production Silverado MR WT to fine-tune their hypermiling strategies.

""Getting this kind of range on a full charge doesn’t happen by accident,"" explained Kurt Kelty, GM VP of battery, propulsion and sustainability. ""It takes deep integration across battery chemistry, drive unit efficiency, software and vehicle engineering.""

Each engineer brought in his or her own expertise when developing driving strategies, and the team quickly dialed in a holistic game plan. Some of the strategies were fairly obvious mileage-boosting techniques and/or luxuries available to an engineering team that might not be available to an everyday driver. For instance, the driver was mostly alone to cut out the additional weight of passengers, and the truck's spare tire was left behind to further slash weight.

Heavily modifying the vehicle would have gone completely against the spirit of the challenge, but the team did make some slight alterations that stayed within the letter of the user manual. They inflated all tires to the highest recommended pressure to cut rolling resistance, fine-tuned the wheel alignment for optimal performance, and set the windshield wipers as low as possible to minimize drag. They also added a tonneau cover over the bed for smoother airflow.

The timing of the feat was no coincidence, either, as the Michigan summer afforded the best possible ambient conditions for battery performance. It didn't, however, provide the best possible ambient conditions for driving around with no A/C whatsoever – GM's team took one for science and left the climate control off for the duration of the driving mission.

The final strategy might make the challenge especially difficult – or at least highly tedious – to repeat for regular Silverado EV owners. Whenever safe to do so, each driver maintained a speed in the 20- to 25-mph (32- to 40-km/h) range, which was determined to be the most efficient possible cruising range. At such low speeds, they found, virtually all of the truck's battery power was directed into propulsion, with minimal energy getting sucked up by other systems and functions.

GM calls that 20- to 25-mph sweet spot ""a realistic pace for neighborhood or city driving in southeast Michigan,"" which is fair enough, but it's a tough pace to maintain when actually aspiring to travel a full 1,000 miles – or 492 miles, for that matter. Drivers could always circle their residential neighborhood hundreds of times, try to get stuck in slow-moving city traffic for days on end, or otherwise drive 1,000 miles without really going anywhere, but we think the ""safe to do so"" caveat would prevent holding that speed on long A-to-B trips, particularly if the definition of safety extends to not creating a massive tail of angry drivers behind you.

The purpose here, though, was entirely on pushing the Silverado EV, and its hulking 205-kWh battery, to its absolute limit so recreating any type of realistic driving scenario was not a prerequisite. Drivers took one-hour shifts to fit the challenge into their regular workdays, driving the truck around a pre-mapped section of public roads near GM’s Milford Proving Ground, ultimately wrapping up in Detroit's Belle Isle – essentially 1,000 miles worth of driving inside 50 miles of point-to-point distance.

We actually just rounded to a clean, even 1,000 miles, but to get precise, the team pushed the Silverado EV all the way to 1,059.2 miles on a single charge, a full 310 (500 km) beyond Lucid's Guinness World Record mileage from last month. Lucid need not worry, though, as its record still sits comfortably in the Guinness book. GM makes no mention of Guinness or any third-party verification and really treated the feat as an internal engineering and R&D challenge.

As Washington Pivots, Automakers Face a Rocky Road for Electric Cars, But the Road Ahead Remains Electrified.

The rumble of internal combustion engines has long been the soundtrack to American life, a symbol of freedom and industrial might. But as the nation hurtles toward a future increasingly defined by electric vehicles (EVs), a significant shift in the political landscape threatens to put the brakes on this transformative journey. The incoming Trump administration, backed by a Republican Congress, has signaled a clear intent to dismantle federal incentives that have been crucial in nurturing the nascent EV market. While this move is poised to slow the transition, the fundamental forces driving EV adoption – technological advancement, evolving consumer demand, and global automotive industry trends – suggest that the rise of electric cars may be more resilient than it appears.

This article delves into the implications of the Trump administration’s anti-EV policies, examining the context and background that led to this point, analyzing the potential impact on automakers and consumers, and exploring the broader pros and cons of such a regulatory shift. We will also highlight key takeaways, offer a glimpse into the future outlook for EVs in the United States, and consider what actions might be necessary to navigate this evolving landscape.

Context & Background: A Shifting Political Climate

The adoption of electric vehicles in the United States has been a story of steady, albeit sometimes uneven, growth. For years, a bipartisan consensus, at least at the federal level, acknowledged the environmental and economic benefits of transitioning to cleaner transportation. This led to the establishment and continuation of various federal incentives designed to encourage EV adoption. These incentives typically took the form of tax credits for consumers purchasing qualifying electric vehicles, alongside investments in charging infrastructure and research and development.

The Biden administration, in particular, made significant strides in promoting EVs. The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), a cornerstone of its climate agenda, significantly expanded and extended tax credits for EV purchases, making them more accessible to a wider range of consumers. The administration also set ambitious targets for EV sales and charging infrastructure deployment, aiming to solidify the U.S. as a leader in the global EV race. These policies were instrumental in boosting consumer confidence and providing the automotive industry with a clear roadmap and financial support for its massive investments in EV technology and manufacturing.

However, a significant political realignment has brought Donald Trump back to the presidency, with a Republican majority in Congress. Throughout his previous term and during his recent campaign, Trump has expressed skepticism, if not outright opposition, towards policies aimed at combating climate change and promoting renewable energy. His rhetoric has often favored traditional industries, including fossil fuels, and he has frequently criticized EVs as impractical, expensive, and a threat to American jobs in the automotive sector. The elimination of federal EV incentives is a direct manifestation of this ideological stance.

The rationale behind the proposed rollback of incentives, as articulated by Trump and his allies, often centers on cost-effectiveness and consumer choice. They argue that tax credits are an unnecessary government expenditure that distorts the market and that consumers should be free to choose the vehicles they prefer without federal subsidies. Furthermore, there’s a narrative that the push for EVs is driven by environmental elites and is not aligned with the economic realities of many American workers, particularly those in manufacturing and fossil fuel-dependent regions.

In-Depth Analysis: The Ripple Effect of Withdrawn Incentives

The removal of federal EV incentives will undoubtedly have a profound impact on the automotive market. For consumers, the most immediate effect will be an increase in the upfront cost of purchasing an electric vehicle. The tax credits, which could reduce the price of an EV by thousands of dollars, were a critical factor in bridging the initial price gap between EVs and comparable gasoline-powered cars. Without these subsidies, the sticker price of many EVs will become a significant barrier for a substantial segment of the buying public.

This could lead to a slowdown in the rate of EV adoption, particularly among mass-market consumers who are more price-sensitive. While early adopters and environmentally conscious buyers may continue to invest in EVs, the broader consumer base that the incentives were designed to attract might be deterred. This could disproportionately affect lower and middle-income households, widening the accessibility gap for cleaner transportation options.

For automakers, the impact is multifaceted. On one hand, car manufacturers have already committed billions of dollars to developing and producing EVs. This investment is driven by a confluence of factors beyond government policy, including increasingly stringent global emissions regulations, a growing demand from international markets, and the realization that the future of personal transportation is electric. Companies like General Motors, Ford, and Tesla have invested heavily in battery technology, new manufacturing facilities, and retraining their workforces for the EV era. They cannot simply turn off these investments overnight.

The challenge for automakers will be to absorb the increased cost of EVs or find ways to reduce production costs more rapidly to maintain competitive pricing without federal support. This could lead to a greater reliance on their existing internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicle sales to subsidize their EV operations, a strategy that may not be sustainable in the long run as the market inevitably shifts. Some automakers might be forced to re-evaluate their EV production targets or even delay the introduction of certain EV models.

Furthermore, the rollback of incentives could create a less predictable and more volatile market for EV manufacturers and suppliers. The absence of a consistent federal policy framework can make long-term planning more difficult. Companies may become more hesitant to make significant new investments in battery plants or charging infrastructure without the assurance of government backing.

The impact on charging infrastructure development is another crucial consideration. While private investment is growing, federal support has played a vital role in expanding the public charging network, especially in rural areas and underserved communities. A reduction in federal funding could slow the pace of this expansion, creating range anxiety for potential EV buyers and further hindering adoption.

Pros and Cons: A Balanced Perspective

The decision to eliminate federal EV incentives, like most policy decisions, presents a range of potential benefits and drawbacks. Understanding these is key to grasping the broader implications.

Potential Pros:

Reduced Government Spending: The most direct benefit cited by proponents is the reduction in federal spending on subsidies. This can free up taxpayer money for other priorities or contribute to deficit reduction.

Market-Driven Innovation: A purely market-driven approach, proponents argue, will force manufacturers to innovate and reduce the cost of EVs more aggressively to compete on price alone. This could lead to more efficient and cost-effective solutions in the long run.

Consumer Choice: Removing incentives allows consumers to make purchasing decisions based solely on their preferences and budgets, without the influence of government mandates or subsidies.

Focus on Other Priorities: A shift away from EV incentives could allow the government to redirect resources towards other critical areas, such as traditional infrastructure projects or national defense, depending on the administration’s priorities.

Fairness for Existing Owners: Some argue that removing incentives addresses a perceived unfairness towards owners of traditional gasoline-powered vehicles who do not benefit from EV subsidies.

Potential Cons:

Slower EV Adoption: The most significant drawback is the anticipated slowdown in the rate of EV adoption, hindering progress towards climate goals and reducing air quality improvements.

Increased Upfront Cost for Consumers: Without tax credits, the initial purchase price of EVs will be higher, potentially making them inaccessible to a large portion of the population.

Impact on Domestic Auto Industry: Automakers that have heavily invested in EV production may face increased financial pressure, potentially leading to job losses or a slowdown in domestic manufacturing expansion if international demand doesn’t fully compensate.

Reduced Competitiveness in Global EV Market: Other countries are continuing to offer strong incentives for EVs, potentially putting U.S. automakers at a disadvantage in the global market.

Slower Charging Infrastructure Development: Reduced federal investment could lead to a less robust and slower expansion of public charging networks, exacerbating range anxiety.

Missed Environmental Opportunities: A slower transition to EVs means continued reliance on fossil fuels for transportation, contributing to greenhouse gas emissions and their associated environmental consequences.

Key Takeaways

Federal incentives for electric vehicle (EV) purchases are being eliminated under the new Trump administration and Republican Congress.

This policy shift is expected to slow the rate of EV adoption in the United States due to increased upfront costs for consumers.

Automakers have made substantial, long-term investments in EV technology and manufacturing and will likely continue to produce EVs, but may face financial pressures.

The pace of charging infrastructure expansion could also be affected by reduced federal funding.

While a setback for rapid EV transition, global market trends, technological advancements, and growing consumer interest suggest that the long-term rise of EVs is likely to continue, albeit at a potentially slower pace.

The economic and environmental implications of this policy shift are significant and will likely be debated for years to come.

Future Outlook: Navigating the New Landscape

Despite the removal of federal incentives, the trajectory of the automotive industry suggests that the transition to electric vehicles is unlikely to be entirely halted. Several powerful forces are working in favor of EVs, even in a less supportive policy environment:

Global Regulatory Trends: Many other major automotive markets, including Europe and China, are implementing even more aggressive policies to promote EVs and phase out internal combustion engines. U.S. automakers that wish to remain competitive globally will continue to invest in and produce EVs to meet these international demands.

Technological Advancements: Battery technology is constantly improving, leading to increased range, faster charging times, and falling costs. These inherent improvements in EV technology will make them more attractive to consumers regardless of government incentives.

Consumer Demand: While price is a significant factor, consumer awareness of environmental issues, the desire for lower running costs (electricity is often cheaper than gasoline per mile), and the appeal of new technology are also driving demand for EVs. This organic demand is likely to persist and grow.

Automaker Commitments: As mentioned, major automakers have already made massive investments and public commitments to electrifying their lineups. Abandoning these commitments would incur significant financial penalties and reputational damage. They will likely continue to push their EV strategies, perhaps with a greater emphasis on cost reduction and efficiency.

The future may see a bifurcated market. The most affordable EVs, those with shorter ranges or less advanced features, might struggle to gain traction without subsidies. Meanwhile, premium EVs or those with compelling technological advantages might continue to sell well to a more affluent customer base. The success of Tesla, a company built on innovation and direct-to-consumer sales without relying heavily on traditional dealer networks or early federal subsidies, offers a potential model for navigating a less supportive policy environment.

State-level policies will also become increasingly important. States like California, which have their own emissions standards and aggressive EV mandates, may continue to drive EV adoption within their borders, potentially creating regional markets that influence national trends.

Call to Action: Charting a Course for Electrification

The current policy shift presents both challenges and opportunities. For consumers, it underscores the importance of thorough research into the total cost of ownership for EVs, considering fuel savings and potential maintenance benefits that can offset higher upfront prices. Staying informed about state-level incentives and the evolving charging infrastructure landscape will be crucial.

For the automotive industry, the imperative is to accelerate innovation focused on cost reduction and to advocate for policies that foster a predictable and supportive environment for EV manufacturing and sales. This includes exploring partnerships for charging infrastructure development and engaging in public education campaigns to highlight the benefits of EVs.

Policymakers, at all levels, have a role to play. While federal incentives may be on the chopping block, there is still an opportunity to foster the EV transition through other means, such as investing in charging infrastructure, supporting research and development for battery technology, and implementing clear, long-term emissions standards that provide industry certainty. Open dialogue between government, industry, and consumers is vital to ensure that the transition to electric mobility, however it unfolds, benefits the nation as a whole, contributing to economic growth, energy independence, and a cleaner environment for future generations.",https://ibossumind.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/IBOSSUMIND-Digital-Design-Banner2.png,N,,2025-08-10 16:00:05.390080

Scientific research shows it’s not too late to implement large-scale measures to stop and even reverse climate change if society acts now.
Even the issue of insurance premiums would be addressed if we had a government that put people’s needs first.","Climate change is leading to more frequent and intense weather events. As a result, many insurance companies are raising their rates or even exiting certain markets altogether because they cannot make a profit. Insurance is a huge industry claiming to care for people in their most difficult times, which in reality exists to make a profit by gambling on the chance that most consumers will not actually need their services.

Meanwhile as climate change-linked storms cause costly damages and companies increase rates, the Trump administration is doubling down on climate denialism. This dynamic can be seen in Illinois.

Beginning Aug. 15, about one third of Illinois homeowners will see an increase in their insurance premiums. State Farm stated last month their premiums would be going up. How much will the working class be expected to pay? The increase will cost the average policyholder around $350 annually. According to State Farm, the increase in premiums is due to more intense and damaging storms in the Midwest, as well as the rising costs in home replacements.

In 2024, for every $1.00 in homeowner’s premiums collected from Illinois policyholders, State Farm paid out $1.26 in total costs.

This isn’t the first time that State Farm has used extreme weather as an excuse to hike up prices for homeowners. Last year, the company said that Illinois had $638 million in hail damage claims, second in the nation only to Texas, which had $1.1 billion in damages. In their filing, the company stated: “Over the last several years, our catastrophe provision has proven to be inadequate when compared to our actual catastrophe loss experience. While there is volatility associated with extreme weather events, our Illinois catastrophe losses have exceeded the year’s catastrophe provision in 13 of the last 15 years, signaling the provision used in rating has been insufficient in recent history.”

Illinois is one of the least restrictive states in the country when it comes to insurance. Unlike many other states, insurers in the state of Illinois are able to hike their prices without regulatory approval before or after the fact. Insurers in Illinois are only required to inform the regulators when they do so.

State Farm, headquartered in Bloomington, Illinois, has been criticized by Illinois governor J.B. Pritzke: “These increases are predicated on catastrophe loss numbers that are entirely inconsistent with the Illinois Department of Insurance’s own analysis — indicating that State Farm is shifting out-of-state costs onto the homeowners in our state . . . Hard-working Illinoisans should not be paying more to protect beach houses in Florida.” Pritzker is now advocating for more regulations in the state to help prevent more hikes here in the state of Illinois.

However, Illinoisans aren’t the only ones experiencing premium hikes. In fact, homeowners all over the country can expect to see increases happening soon. Extreme weather events don’t discriminate and we have seen this in real time as places like California, Florida, Texas and many more states have been hugely impacted in the last couple of years. Homeowners have experienced hikes in their insurance premiums and will most likely continue to see them unless immediate action is taken. The Consumer Federation of America published a report in April showing U.S. homeowners’ premiums increased by an average of 24% over the last three years. CFA found homeowners, nationally, saw premiums rise twice as fast between 2021 and 2024, which amounts to a $21 billion total price hike.

The truth is that extreme weather events are rising and becoming the new normal. These extreme climate events aren’t just happening in the state of Illinois. The entire country has been hit repeatedly. According to NOAA’s National Centers for Environmental Information, in 2024 there were 27 individual weather and climate disasters that resulted in at least $1 billion in damages. These disasters caused at least 568 direct or indirect fatalities. In the last 45 years, it has been estimated that the cost in damages due to these extreme weather events has been approximately $182.7 billion.

Climate change heightens the risks of wildfires, tornadoes, hail and other natural disasters. As a result, companies no longer make a profit from the policies that they sell so they are now passing down the bill to consumers. This problem is being exacerbated by the passing of Trump’s “Big Beautiful Bill.”

The bill was passed on July 4, with major cuts seen in important policies that would have supported wind and solar power and clean energy services that could help diminish such catastrophic disasters. Rather than investing in the well-being of the working class and the future of our planet, this new bill will boost the use of fossil fuels and dismantle much of the progress that has been made in order to fight climate change. The bill essentially gives the oil industry everything that it wants including opening up federal lands to drilling and making it cheaper to operate there. Trump has also made it harder for climate change to be taken seriously by appointing three climate skeptics — John Christy, Roy Spencer and Steven E. Koonin to advisory roles in the Department of Energy.

Who are these climate contrarians?

John Christy and Roy Spencer are both research scientists at the University of Alabama at Huntsville and Steven E. Koonin is a researcher at Stanford University’s Hoover Institution. Koonin previously served at the Department of Energy under the Obama administration and was also a scientist for BP, an oil and gas company. Koonin, along with others, pushed for a public “red team” debate on climate science finds during the first Trump administration, but was ultimately overruled by political advisors in the White House at the time. The “red team” debate would have essentially been a platform where conservative groups could push back on mainstream climate science and challenge the prevailing scientific consensus about humans’ impact on climate change.

Christy and Spencer have long maintained that satellite data does not show the same trends and extent of global warming as surface weather data. They have used this to discredit mainstream scientific data. Many in the scientific community have rebutted the message that these “experts” have put out. Andrew Dessler, a climate scientist at Texas A&M University stated, “Hiring Koonin, Spencer, and Cristy is not just irregular, it’s a recognition that none of the normal channels would give them the answer they want. This seems to be a thread running through this administration. They don’t seek legitimate expert opinion; instead, they find people to give them the answer they want.”

The Trump administration’s billionaire agenda is invested in climate denialism because the capitalist class cannot see beyond this quarter’s profits. Making the changes required to address the climate crisis would cut into their profits right now. Instead they are focused on rolling back climate and other environmental protections to assure the unfettered flow of wealth into their coffers.

What needs to be done?

Climate change is accelerating and the end of the window to avoid catastrophic consequences is rapidly approaching. Scientific research shows it’s not too late to implement large-scale measures to stop and even reverse climate change if society acts now. The obstacle to implementing these measures is the chokehold on political and economic power held by the capitalist class, which is willfully focused on short term profits over the long term survival of life on this planet.

Even the issue of insurance premiums would be addressed if we had a government that put people’s needs first. Much could be done to prevent storm damage, for instance, by requiring residences to be built to climate resilient standards while retrofitting existing homes. Repairing damage after storms would be a guaranteed right along with the right to a home. Parasitic insurance companies need to go extinct, not the human species! The question before us is how to organize and win political and economic power for the working class to create a government that can implement these necessary changes.

In June, the U.K. Labour government introduced stricter environmental rules for fossil fuel projects, which are expected to affect two North Sea oil and gas fields operated by Shell and Equinor.
Upon taking office, Prime Minister Kier Starmer increased the tax rate on profits from oil and gas extraction to 78 percent.
The U.K. Energy Minister Ed Miliband said in April that the country’s reliance on fossil fuels meant “markets went into meltdown and prices rocketed” after Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022.
U.K. oil and gas production is set to decline in the coming decades if the government does not plan to approve new licenses.","Since the Labour Party came into power in the U.K. two years ago, the government has introduced stricter regulations on fossil fuels in a bid to shift to green energy. This has resulted in an uncertain investor environment in Britain’s North Sea, as many energy companies instead invest in renewable energy projects. It has also spurred higher levels of gas imports, and, in recent weeks, U.S. President Donald Trump said he thought the U.K. should backtrack on its green transition in favour of fossil fuels.

In June, the U.K. Labour government introduced stricter environmental rules for fossil fuel projects, which are expected to affect two North Sea oil and gas fields operated by Shell and Equinor. The move means approval for new projects must account for the environmental impact of emissions from using or burning the fuels extracted, also known as downstream emissions. The U.K. Department for Energy Security and Net Zero said this “will ensure the full effects of fossil fuel extraction on the environment are recognised in consenting decisions.”

This follows several blows to oil and gas projects in recent years. For example, in January, a Scottish court ruled that the approval of Shell's Jackdaw and Equinor and Ithaca Energy’s Rosebank were unlawful, and the projects must be reassessed. The oil majors are expected to submit new assessments based on the current environmental guidelines. While the government said last year that it would not issue any new oil and gas licences, it also decided it would not revoke any licenses granted by the previous government.

While the new regulations are stricter than previously, they could provide the basis needed for Shell and Equinor to complete the assessments required to get the green light for their projects, by evaluating the full scope of carbon emissions they would produce. Decisions on the two projects are expected to be made by the Autumn or later.

Equinor responded to the new rules, saying, “We are currently reviewing today’s announcement. We remain committed to working closely with all relevant stakeholders to advance the Rosebank project.” The company added, “We welcome clarity and can confirm that we will submit a downstream end user combustion emissions assessment in full compliance with the government’s new environmental guidance.”

Some suggest that higher taxes and stricter limits on North Sea drilling could prevent the U.K. from tapping into its full fossil fuel production potential. Upon taking office, Prime Minister Kier Starmer increased the tax rate on profits from oil and gas extraction to 78 percent. While oil and gas output is expected to rise this year and next as Shell’s Penguins oil field and BP’s Murlach oil field come online, this follows a decline of 11 percent in 2023 and 2024, with crude output averaging 564,000 bpd last year. The industry association Offshore Energies U.K. stated, “Operators overwhelmingly view the UK continental shelf as uncompetitive for investment ... especially compared to overseas opportunities [and] in comparison to offshore wind and carbon capture and storage.”

The U.K.’s gas import dependency is expected to rise from 55 percent at present to 68 percent in 2030, 85 percent in 2040 and 94 percent in 2050, even if new oilfields are approved, as Britain has already used most of the gas in the declining basin.

In a recent visit to Scotland, U.S. President Trump attacked the country’s growing wind power industry and called on the government to produce more fossil fuels, calling the North Sea a “treasure chest” that the U.K. was missing out on because of high taxes. Following the visit, he wrote on Truth Social, U.K. government ministers have “essentially told drillers and oil companies that, ‘we don’t want you.’ Incentivise the drillers, FAST. A VAST FORTUNE TO BE MADE for the U.K., and far lower energy costs for the people!”

However, the Labour government has repeatedly doubled down on its aims for a green transition. The U.K. Energy Minister Ed Miliband said in April that the country’s reliance on fossil fuels meant “markets went into meltdown and prices rocketed” after Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022. He added, “The cost-of-living impacts caused back then still stalk families today… So, the argument for the clean energy transition is not just the traditional climate case but the social justice case too – it is working people who pay the greatest price for our energy insecurity.”

Miliband warned that an anti-net-zero agenda would not only risk “climate breakdown” but would “forfeit the clean energy jobs of the future,” while a green power transition will help secure social justice and national security.

U.K. oil and gas production is set to decline in the coming decades if the government does not plan to approve new licenses. Meanwhile, the country’s renewable energy and nuclear power output is expected to increase significantly as the government finances a green transition and encourages private investors to do the same. It seems like the U.K. is now finally on the track that the U.S. started on under President Biden, before Trump backtracked on a plethora of favourable climate policies.

The union, which represents 8,000 EPA employees, is planning a legal response to the decision, said Mr Justin Chen, president of the agency’s chapter of the American Federation of Government Employees, in a statement on Aug 8.

The decision gets Mr Trump closer to his goal to strip hundreds of thousands of federal workers of the ability to collectively bargain with US agencies.

Eliminating union deals would allow agencies to more easily fire or discipline employees, according to attorneys representing federal workers.

“EPA is working to diligently implement President Trump’s Executive Orders with respect to AFGE, including ‘Exclusions from Federal Labor-Management Relations Programs’, in compliance with the law,” an EPA spokesperson said in a statement, referring to the executive order Mr Trump issued in March.

The order involves removing collective bargaining rights at more than 30 federal agencies, including the EPA, and is currently being challenged in court by unions who say it violates free speech and obligations to bargain with workers.

The EPA had more than 16,000 employees as of March 2025, according to federal HR records. That figure does not include employees that accepted buyouts.

The agency said in July it would cut the size of its workforce by at least 23 per cent and close its scientific research office as part of Mr Trump’s

By selectively vetoing 63 provisions of the controversial “Devastation Bill,” Lula has struck a delicate balance between economic ambition and environmental preservation. This recalibration not only addresses global climate commitments but also creates a more predictable framework for investors seeking to capitalize on Brazil's vast natural resources.

Lula's Vetoes: A Calculated Compromise

The original bill, backed by agribusiness lobbies, sought to streamline licensing by allowing self-declared permits for “medium-impact” projects and sidelining Indigenous communities from decision-making. Lula's vetoes, however, preserved rigorous oversight for strategic projects, reinstated Indigenous consultation rights, and introduced a “Special Environmental License” to fast-track critical infrastructure without compromising ecological safeguards. Of the 63 rejected provisions, 26 were struck down outright, while 37 were revised to align with Brazil's 2030 deforestation and emissions targets.

This approach has been lauded by environmentalists and NGOs, who argue it prevents a “death blow” to the Amazon and Atlantic Forest. Yet, it also retains enough flexibility to attract capital. For instance, the government's push to fast-track lithium and rare earths projects in Minas Gerais and the Amazon basin aligns with global demand for clean energy materials. The BNDES Strategic Minerals Investment Fund, a $200 million initiative, further de-risks projects for private investors, while the public tender system has already drawn 7x more applications than previous methods.

Mining and Energy: A Dual-Track Opportunity

Brazil's mining sector is now a linchpin of its energy transition strategy. In Q3 2024, mineral exports surged to $11.18 billion, with iron ore (70.1%), copper (9.3%), and gold (8.5%) leading the charge. The National Mining Agency (ANM) has streamlined 70,000 pending licenses, creating a pipeline of ready-to-develop projects. Meanwhile, lithium production is accelerating: 11 projects in Minas Gerais are expected to attract $2.8 billion in investment by 2030, with AMG Brazil's $250 million lithium carbonate plant set to reduce reliance on Chinese processing.

Energy infrastructure is equally promising. The government's “Special Environmental License” could expedite oil exploration at the Amazon's mouth, while the National Energy Transition Policy (PNTE) aims to integrate renewables into Brazil's energy matrix. Strategic partnerships with the U.S. (via the Inflation Reduction Act) and the EU (through technology transfers) are opening new markets for Brazilian minerals, positioning the country as a critical node in global supply chains.

Navigating Risks and Rewards

While the reforms reduce regulatory uncertainty, challenges remain. Conservative lawmakers in Congress may attempt to override Lula's vetoes, potentially triggering legal battles. Environmental groups, though satisfied with the vetoes, remain vigilant, warning that weakened provisions could still lead to deforestation and pollution. Investors must also weigh the political risks of a polarized Congress and the reputational costs of projects near Indigenous lands.

However, the upside is compelling. Brazil's lithium reserves, coupled with its strategic location in the “Lithium Valley,” offer a unique opportunity to supply the EV and battery industries. Similarly, the government's focus on rare earths—critical for green technologies—could unlock value as global demand outpaces supply. For infrastructure, the fast-tracking of strategic projects (e.g., transmission lines, ports) will require $150 billion in investment by 2030, per the World Bank.

Strategic Entry for Investors

The window to act is narrowing. With the 2025 UN Climate Summit (COP30) in Belém approaching, Brazil's environmental policies will face global scrutiny. Investors who align with the government's “neoindustrialization” agenda—focusing on ESG-compliant projects and partnerships with state agencies—stand to benefit from first-mover advantages.

Consider the following opportunities:

1. Lithium and Rare Earths Producers: Companies like AMG Brazil and Anglo American's Minas Gerais ventures.

2. Infrastructure Developers: Firms involved in renewable energy transmission or port expansions.

3. ESG-Focused Funds: Those targeting Brazil's green bonds or sustainable mining ventures.

Conclusion: A Market at the Crossroads

Brazil's revised licensing framework is a masterstroke of political pragmatism. By preserving environmental integrity while accelerating resource development, Lula has created a regulatory environment that appeals to both global climate goals and investor appetites. For those willing to navigate the political and ecological nuances, Brazil's mining and energy sectors represent a high-conviction opportunity in a market poised for transformation. The question is no longer whether Brazil can balance growth and sustainability—it's whether investors can act swiftly enough to secure their stake in this evolving landscape.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-08-10 03:58:02.312437

The Environmental Protection Agency is weighing the termination of its $7 billion Solar For All program, a move that would strip Nevada of millions of dollars in federal funding for residential solar development.

Last year, the Nevada Clean Energy Fund — a nonprofit bank created by state legislation — was awarded a $156 million grant under the Solar for All program to finance community solar projects that would benefit low-income households.

Now that funding is jeopardized by the Trump administration’s proposal to axe the Biden-era program created under the Inflation Reduction Act, a 2022 law that dedicated nearly $370 billion to the clean energy transition.

In a statement, an EPA spokesperson said the agency is “working to ensure Congressional intent is fully implemented in accordance with the law” after the passage of Trump’s “One Big Beautiful Bill” last month.

The tax and spending bill eliminated the IRA’s $27 billion Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund – which finances the Solar for All grant – and scrapped all unobligated money under the fund. Nevada’s Solar for All funds have already been contractually obligated, which could make terminating the states’ grant more difficult.

Solar for All is the only surviving grant under the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund after EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin announced the cancellation of the fund’s other two federal grants in March.

The Nevada Clean Energy Fund said it has not received a Solar for All termination notice as of Wednesday. The nonprofit is still accepting applications, and encourages anyone interested in the program to apply.

“We hear from Nevadans every day that they desperately need the relief that comes from our Nevada Solar for All program, and we have been working hard over the past year to get these funds into the hands of the households that need them,” said Kirsten Stasio, CEO of the Nevada Clean Energy Fund.

Nevada has been racing to get money out the door after funding for the program was frozen in February as the result of an executive order from President Donald Trump. The EPA unfroze those funds the following month in response to court orders.

The Nevada Clean Energy Fund selected its first project under the program last month, which would provide low-cost solar power for The Empowerment Center’s new sober living facility in Reno.

“We received a Nevada Solar for All investment that is transformational for our organization and the women we serve,” said Roxanne DeCarlo, executive director of The Empowerment Center, which helps low income and at-risk women recovering from substance abuse.

“Lower energy costs mean we can focus more resources on what matters most: helping women rebuild their lives in a safe, stable environment,” DeCarlo said.

Nevada is one of 60 grant recipients, including 49 state agencies, that could lose millions in federal funding if the program is successfully terminated.

Nevada was awarded the largest Solar for All grant per capita of any state. Nevada received the same award amount as Florida, Illinois, and Pennsylvania — states with significantly higher populations.

If terminated, the Nevada Clean Energy Fund said the state could lose high paying jobs and hundreds of millions of dollars in additional private investment.

Mark Dickson, president of Simple Power Solar, called Nevada’s Solar for All program “a critical stabilizer” for the solar industry as it navigates difficult economic headwinds.

“Our workforce of over 35 employees, along with thousands of others from dozens of other companies statewide, rely on the continued support and demand generated by this program,” Dickson said.

Nevada’s solar industry is already facing strain after Trump’s “Big Beautiful Bill” rolled back most federal support for renewable energy last month, including tax credits that fueled solar development.

Under the tax and spending bill, solar projects that start construction after July 4, 2026 will not be eligible for the 30% Clean Electricity Investment Credit — phasing out the credit six years ahead of schedule. If those projects are not in service by the end of 2027 they also won’t get the full credit. The 30% Residential Clean Energy Credit ends entirely at the end of 2025.

The loss of the residential solar credit is “already disrupting clean energy businesses,” said Steve Hamile, the CEO of Sol-Up, the company slated to install the Empowerment Center’s solar project.

“Sol-Up employs nearly 200 people, and the stability and demand from this program are important for sustaining our workforce,” Hamile said.

The early termination of solar tax credits would likely require the Nevada Clean Energy Fund to cover more solar installation costs in the state while funding less projects, said Greg Zegas, the managing director of investments at the Nevada Clean Energy Fund.

Nevada’s Clean Energy Fund already lost a $20 million grant from the EPA in May that would have funded the construction of critical water and energy infrastructure on the Walker River Paiute Tribe reservation in Northern Nevada.

Solar for All funds were expected to lower energy costs by at least 20% for more than 50,000 low-income and disadvantaged households in Nevada by 2029.

Without the program, low-income households will be left with fewer options to address rising energy costs, said Beth Dunning, the director of community development at Nevada Rural Housing.

“Nevada Solar for All will lower electricity bills for many rural families who otherwise would be unable to access these savings and increase energy reliability in rural and remote communities that face frequent power outages,” Dunning said.",https://cdn.thisisreno.com/conradcomm/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/pexels-photo-356049.jpeg,N,,2025-08-09 20:58:56.962037

Reporting from Peru

Each morning, Rosa Chamami wakes to flames licking at cardboard scraps in a makeshift stove in her yard.

The boxes she brought home once held 800,000 high-tech solar panels. Now, they fuel her fire.

Between 2018 and 2024, those panels were installed at Rubí and Clemesí, two massive solar plants in Peru's Moquegua region, about 1,000 kilometres south of the capital, Lima. Together, they form the country's largest solar complex – and one of the biggest in Latin America.

From her home in the small settlement of Pampa Clemesí, Rosa can see the rows of panels glowing under white floodlights. The Rubí plant is just 600 metres away.

Yet her home – and the rest of her village – remains in total darkness, unconnected to the grid the plant feeds into.

Power from the sun, but not at home

None of Pampa Clemesí's 150 residents have access to the national power grid.

A few have solar panels donated by Rubí's operator, Orygen, but most can't afford the batteries and converters needed to make them work. At night, they use torches – or simply live in the dark.

The paradox is striking: the Rubí solar power plant produces around 440 GWh a year, enough to supply electricity to 351,000 homes. Moquegua, where the plant is located, is an ideal site for solar energy, receiving over 3,200 hours of sunshine annually, more than most countries.

And that contradiction becomes even sharper in a country currently experiencing a renewable energy boom.

In 2024 alone, electricity generation from renewables grew by 96%. Solar and wind power depend heavily on copper due to its high conductivity – and Peru is the world's second-largest producer.

""In Peru, the system was designed around profitability. No effort was made to connect sparsely populated areas,"" explains Carlos Gordillo, an energy expert at the University of Santa María in Arequipa.

Orygen says it has fulfilled its responsabilities.

""We've joined the government project to bring electricity to Pampa Clemesí and have already built a dedicated line for them. We also completed the first phase of the electrification project, with 53 power towers ready to operate,"" Marco Fragale, Orygen's executive director in Peru, told BBC News Mundo, the BBC's Spanish-language service.

Fragale adds that nearly 4,000 metres of underground cable were installed to provide a power line for the village. The $800,000 investment is complete, he says.

But the lights still haven't come on.

The final step – connecting the new line to individual homes – is the government's responsibility. According to the plan, the Ministry of Mines and Energy must lay about two kilometres of wiring. Work was slated to begin in March 2025, but hasn't started.

BBC News Mundo tried to contact the Ministry of Mines and Energy but received no response.

A daily struggle for basics

Rosa's tiny house has no sockets.

Each day, she walks around the village, hoping someone can spare a bit of electricity to charge her phone.

""It's essential,"" she says, explaining she needs the device to stay in touch with her family near the border with Bolivia.

One of the few people who can help is Rubén Pongo. In his larger home – with patios and several rooms – a group of speckled hens fights for rooftop space between the solar panels.

""The company donated solar panels to most villagers,"" he says. ""But I had to buy the battery, the converter, and the cables myself – and pay for installation.""

Rubén owns something others only dream of: a fridge. But it only runs for up to 10 hours a day, and on cloudy days, not at all.

He helped build the Rubí plant and later worked in maintenance, cleaning the panels. Today, he manages the warehouse and is driven to work by the company, even though the plant is just across the road.

Crossing the Pan-American Highway on foot is prohibited by Peruvian law.

From his rooftop, Rubén points to a cluster of glowing buildings in the distance.

""That's the plant's substation,"" he says. ""It looks like a little lit-up town.""

A long wait

Residents began settling in Pampa Clemesí in the early 2000s. Among them is Pedro Chará, now 70. He's watched the 500,000-panel Rubí plant rise almost on his doorstep.

Much of the village is built from discarded materials from the plant. Pedro says even their beds come from scrap wood.

There's no water system, no sewage, no rubbish collection. The village once had 500 residents, but due to scarce infrastructure, the majority left – especially during the COVID-19 pandemic.

""Sometimes, after waiting so long, fighting for water and electricity, you just feel like dying. That's it. Dying,"" he says.

Dinner by torchlight

Rosa hurries to her aunt's house, hoping to catch the last of the daylight. Tonight, she's cooking dinner for a small group of neighbours who share meals.

In the kitchen, a gas stove heats a kettle. Their only light is a solar-powered torch. Dinner is sweet tea and fried dough.

""We eat only what we can keep at room temperature,"" says Rosa.

Without refrigeration, protein-rich foods are hard to store.

Fresh produce requires a 40-minute bus ride to Moquegua – if they can afford it.

""But we don't have money to take the bus every day.""

With no electricity, many in Latin America cook with firewood or kerosene, risking respiratory illness.

In Pampa Clemesí, residents use gas when they can afford it — wood when they can't.

They pray by torchlight for food, shelter, and water, then eat in silence. It's 7pm, their final activity. No phones. No TV.

""Our only light is these little torches,"" Rosa says. ""They don't show much, but at least we can see the bed.""

""If we had electricity, people would come back,"" Pedro says. ""We stayed because we had no choice. But with light, we could build a future.""

A soft breeze stirs the desert streets, lifting sand. A layer of dust settles on the lampposts on the main plaza, waiting to be installed. The wind signals that dusk is coming – and that soon, there will be no light.

For those without solar panels, like Rosa and Pedro, the darkness stretches on until sunrise. So does their hope that the government will one day act.

Like so many nights before, they prepare for another evening without light.

But why do they still live here?

""Because of the sun,"" Rosa replies without hesitation.

""Here, we always have the sun.""",https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/eecd/live/06dbdfb0-617b-11f0-960d-e9f1088a89fe.jpg,N,,2025-08-09 20:58:48.877582

Comparing 1970s climate predictions to modern climate science is like comparing a horse and buggy to an electric vehicle.","The Gateway, Black Canyon, and Meeker fires burning across our region are just part of a nationwide crisis: Communities from California to Florida are grappling with extreme heat, flooding, and hazardous air from fires intensified by warming temperatures and prolonged drought. These aren’t abstract future threats; they’re today’s reality here on the Western Slope and across our nation.

The science Is overwhelming

Walcher characterizes the EPA’s 2009 Endangerment Finding as “controversial,” but this framing ignores scientific reality. A comprehensive 2021 study in Environmental Research Letters analyzed over 88,000 peer-reviewed climate studies published between 2012-2020. The result? 99.9% of climate scientists agree that climate change is occurring and is primarily caused by carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from burning fossil fuels. Only 28 studies — all published in minor journals — expressed any skepticism.

This isn’t a matter of opinion or political preference. It’s established science, as solid as our understanding of gravity or the link between smoking and cancer.

The real economic threat is climate inaction

While Walcher focuses on the costs of regulating pollution, he ignores the staggering price of inaction. Colorado has endured billions of dollars in wildfire damage, agricultural losses from persistent drought, and infrastructure destruction from extreme weather. The 2021 Marshall Fire in Boulder — the most destructive in state history — caused over $2 billion in damages in a single day. The economic toll from our current regional fires is still being calculated, but the emotional toll on affected communities is already immeasurable.

Nationally, climate disasters cost $165 billion in 2022 alone, and these costs are accelerating. Meanwhile, the clean energy transition has become an economic driver. Colorado’s renewable energy sector employs over 67,000 people, often at wages exceeding traditional energy jobs.

Rather than asking what climate action costs, we should ask what prosperity looks like in a stable climate versus an unstable one.

Misleading historical comparisons

Walcher attempts to undermine climate science by citing decades-old predictions about food shortages and global cooling. This comparison is profoundly misleading. Those earlier predictions were based on limited data and primitive models, often by individual researchers.

Today’s climate science represents the largest scientific collaboration in human history, involving thousands of researchers across dozens of countries, sophisticated computer models, satellite data, and multiple lines of converging evidence. Comparing 1970s climate predictions to modern climate science is like comparing a horse and buggy to an electric vehicle.

Walcher also mischaracterizes CO2 as simply “a naturally occurring compound vital to life.” While CO2 is indeed naturally present in our atmosphere, he misses the fundamental issue: CO2 is the primary driver of the greenhouse effect that warms our planet. Atmospheric CO2 has increased from 280 parts per million before industrialization to over 425 ppm today — a 50% increase in just 150 years. As with any essential substance, the dose makes the poison.

A path forward

Rather than relitigating settled science, we should focus on solutions that protect both our economy and environment. Colorado has proven this is possible, reducing emissions while maintaining economic growth. We need policies that deliver dependable, affordable energy by accelerating the clean energy transition, support communities affected by extreme weather, and prepare for unavoidable climate impacts. Reversing the EPA’s Endangerment Finding will achieve none of this — it will only delay necessary action while costs mount.

The debate Walcher calls for has already happened — in peer-reviewed journals, scientific conferences, and research institutions worldwide. The verdict is clear: Climate change is real, human-caused, and requires urgent action.

Looking across our smoke-filled valley, I don’t need more debate about whether climate change is real. I need leaders who will act on the science to protect our communities and our children’s future. I hope you will join me in asking Rep. Jeff Hurd and Sens. Michael Bennet and John Hickenlooper to support science-based climate policies that serve Colorado’s interests.

Under new mandates proposed by the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR), beginning in 2028, a total of 1% of America’s LNG exports must be carried via U.S.-flagged vessels. From 2029 onwards, 1% of U.S. LNG exports should be shipped on U.S.-flagged and U.S.-built vessels.

This number will gradually rise over the decades, and by 2047, a total of 15% of all U.S. LNG exports should be carried on U.S.-built U.S.-flagged LNG tankers.

Just 1% of exports may look like a negligible figure if one doesn’t consider that the United States is the world’s largest LNG exporter, the current operational global LNG fleet has just one U.S.-flagged vessel (but built in France), and that building an LNG tanker in the United States will take years and probably cost two to four times the price of building a vessel in South Korea or China.

It is countering China’s dominance and reviving America’s shipbuilding that’s the key goal of the proposed USTR rules.

However, energy industry groups and analysts say the mandate would harm U.S. LNG exports more than it would crimp China’s dominance.

The oil and LNG lobby groups are calling on the USTR to scrap the provision for LNG tankers, as compliance with the mandate is impossible.

The Center for Liquefied Natural Gas (CLNG), the U.S. trade association promoting LNG exports and including LNG exporters and project developers, says that compliance with the USTR mandate is impossible as “There are currently no U.S.-made or enough U.S.- flagged vessels capable of exporting the quantity of LNG necessary to support current or increased U.S. LNG exports.”

The U.S. does not have the shipyard capacity, technical capability, or supply chains to significantly ramp up shipbuilding of U.S. LNG carriers to meet the USTR requirements. In addition, the U.S. currently lacks the highly specialized and skilled crews for the operation and maintenance of LNG ships, CLNG said.

The U.S. exported a total of 1,396 LNG cargoes last year. At the same time, the global LNG vessel fleet has 792 operating tankers, per data cited by the CLNG trade association. Of these, only one is a U.S.-flagged ship, but it is half the capacity of a modern LNG carrier and primarily serves to deliver LNG to Puerto Rico.

CLNG and the American Petroleum Institute (API) last month jointly filed comments on the proposed USTR mandates, saying that the restrictions on LNG shipping do not directly address China’s unfair practices and “instead penalize U.S. LNG exporters.”

The requirement “is unrealistic and will continue to disproportionately impact the U.S. LNG industry and not Chinese entities,” API and CLNG said.

Last year, about 1,400 cargoes of U.S. LNG were delivered to buyers around the world, and that number is slated to nearly double by the end of the decade as terminals that are currently under construction enter service, the associations said.

Under USTR’s requirements for 1% of U.S. LNG exports starting in 2029 to be transported on U.S.-built vessels, as many as six U.S.-built LNG vessels would be required by the end of the decade, which is not feasible.

The U.S. built its last LNG carrier in 1980.

Moreover, the groups note that there is a limited ability to access key shipbuilding components and build LNG vessels in the U.S., while the United States lacks the skilled labor necessary to build LNG carriers and probably a more daunting challenge of crewing and manning these vessels, API and CLNG said.

Analysts say the industry needs clarity on what would constitute a U.S.-built vessel.

“Could the majority of the vessel be manufactured overseas and completed in the U.S.? Is it a U.S.-made engine?” Jason Feer, global head of business intelligence for Poten & Partners, told CNBC.

Other experts say that the mandate, if it stays, will require flexibility in interpretation of what constitutes a U.S.-built ship and waivers for the industry if the Trump Administration wants its American LNG export dominance to succeed.

“Without some common-sense flexibility or a phased-in approach, the math just doesn’t add up,” Louis Sola, a former commissioner at the Federal Maritime Commission appointed by President Trump, and now a partner at lobbying firm Thorn Run Partners, told CNBC.

“We risk bottling up our own LNG exports and opening the market to the competition right when our allies need American energy the most.”

With rising gas prices and the growing popularity of electric vehicles, many drivers are wondering if switching to a Tesla makes financial sense compared to sticking with a reliable gas-powered SUV like the Subaru Forester.

The monthly fuel costs reveal a clear winner.

Tesla Monthly Charging Costs

Based on available data, Tesla owners can expect varying monthly charging costs depending on their driving habits and local electricity rates. Using the average charging cost of 4.56 cents per mile and typical monthly driving of 1,100 miles, this calculates to approximately $50 per month for home charging. For comparison, charging exclusively at home could increase your electric bill by $50-$100 monthly, according to GOBankingRates.

Subaru Forester Monthly Gas Costs

The 2025 Subaru Forester achieves 29 MPG combined (26 city in the city, 33 on highway), according to Edmunds. Using current national gas prices of approximately $3.20 per gallon and typical monthly driving of 1,100 miles, this calculates to about $122 per month in fuel costs for Forester owners.

The Cost Comparison

Based on these calculations, Tesla owners spend roughly $50 monthly on electricity, while Forester drivers pay about $122 for gas. This represents potential monthly savings of approximately $72 when choosing Tesla over the Subaru Forester.

Over a year, Tesla drivers could save around $864 compared to Forester owners, assuming consistent home charging for Tesla and regular gas prices for the Forester.

Additional Considerations

However, the comparison isn’t purely about fuel costs. Charging at Tesla Supercharger stations costs about 25 cents per kWh, meaning a full recharge to 250 miles would cost about $22, which is more expensive than home charging but still competitive with gas prices.

Tesla’s lower operating costs extend beyond fuel savings, including reduced maintenance requirements compared to traditional gas engines. Meanwhile, the Forester offers advantages like lower upfront costs, established service networks, and no range anxiety.

For budget-conscious drivers prioritizing monthly fuel expenses, Tesla provides significant savings over the Subaru Forester based on these calculations, making electric vehicle ownership increasingly attractive from a purely operational cost perspective.",https://cdn.gobankingrates.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/shutterstock_editorial_12587099d-1.jpg,N,,2025-08-10 02:06:47.832120

That matters a great deal in Virginia, where expanding wind and solar is a priority and where the effects of a warming planet and a changing climate pose an increasing problem to residents. It’s why the commonwealth needs its officials, both state and federal, to oppose White House policies that promise to hold America back.

Some 27 miles from the Virginia Beach Oceanfront, Dominion Energy’s Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind project continues to take shape. Since the two test turbines began operating in 2020, work has expanded as the company seeks to build 174 additional turbines, generating enough energy to power up to 660,000 homes.

When completed, it will be the largest offshore wind farm in the United States. That status has helped expand the green energy sector in the region, as companies and academic institutions pivot toward jobs and training to support renewable development and growth. Dominion has estimated the project will support 1,100 jobs and result in more than $143 million of annual economic output and $57 million in annual wages and benefits.

Green energy development accelerated under the Virginia Clean Economy Act, which the General Assembly passed in 2020. It sets a goal of generating 100% of the commonwealth’s power by renewable sources by 2050, an ambitious goal that has been complicated by the commonwealth’s growing demand for power — driven, in large part, by the proliferation of data centers, which are voracious energy consumers.

Virginia Republicans almost uniformly oppose the VCEA, calling it impractical, unreliable and too costly. But even Gov. Glenn Youngkin recognizes the value of expanding renewable energy sources, as reflected in his “all-of-the-above” energy plan released in 2022.

While the governor’s plan called for changes to the VCEA and urged continued reliance on fossil fuels such as natural gas, it also notes that Virginia “can benefit from increased wind generation” and that “solar also offers an opportunity for Virginia to become a leader.”

VCEA supporters may criticize the Youngkin administration’s conclusions, but should appreciate the governor’s recognition that undercutting the growth of renewable development would be unnecessary and harmful to the commonwealth.

The president could learn a thing or two from that approach.

Trump unabashedly favored oil and gas interests during his first term, and his second term has already featured much of the same. That’s no surprise given that, as a candidate, he pressured oil and gas executives to donate $1 billion to his campaign.

But even industry insiders didn’t expect the second Trump administration to seek the total destruction of wind and solar development and deployment. One of his first acts was to freeze leases for renewable development and halt permitting for new projects. He subsequently directed the Interior Department to conduct new reviews of approved projects, withdrew leases for offshore development and has made the permitting process cumbersome enough to discourage companies from pursuing renewable development.

Add to that provisions in the recently approved spending bill, which saw Republican lawmakers cancel most Biden-era green-energy tax credits, and the environment has never been more hostile to energy alternatives.

These are self-inflicted wounds and indefensible decisions given the emphasis China, among others, has placed on being a leader in this sector.

The Solterra was Subaru's first battery-powered vehicle after a long history of customer loyalty with internal combustion engine vehicles, commonly known as gas-powered. According to Inside EVs, more than 21,000 Solterras were sold last year, and, in 2025 alone, sales are already up by 21%. Subaru's investment in electric is paying off — and they're not slowing down.

""The Uncharted is Subaru's fashionable new EV with 300+ miles of range and a feature-packed cabin,"" reported Inside EVs. The Uncharted is most similar to the Crosstrek hatchback, and maintains what makes that car so popular: its spaciousness, off-road capabilities, and versatility.

According to Inside EVs, the vehicle will be available in front-wheel drive or all-wheel drive. ""The FWD will get more than 300 miles of Subaru-estimated range with 221 horsepower. The AWD will have identical output as the C-HR: 290 miles of range and 338 horsepower. Its 0-60 miles per hour acceleration time will be less than five seconds,"" explained Inside EVs.

Subaru is smart to capitalize on the massive potential of electric vehicles. Public opinion on EVs is slowly changing for the better, especially as common myths about EVs — like range anxiety, battery waste, and mineral mining — are dispelled.

The manufacturing process for all cars emits carbon, whether by digging minerals out of the earth for the battery, or shipping the car from international factories. However, after just 13,500 miles of emissions-free driving, a workhorse EV like Tesla's Model 3 has completely neutralized the environmental costs associated with its manufacturing.

Although we haven't moved entirely away from dirty electricity yet, we do know that even when EVs are charged with a typical combination of power sources — like sun, wind, and coal — they are still far cleaner than gas-powered cars. One study from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology found that gas cars create an average of 350 grams of carbon air pollution per mile driven over their lifetimes, and this value was only 200 for EVs that operate on batteries charging on an average U.S. power grid.

Many EV owners opt out of dirty energy completely and install solar panels to save even more money and make their EV charging completely carbon-neutral. EnergySage has an easy-to-use tool for comparing quotes from vetted local solar installers, whether you're just curious or ready to buy. EnergySage can help you identify any local or federal tax credits and save up to $10,000 on solar installations.

How will the rest of the world respond to this growing dominance in critical raw materials?","In the depths of Hunan Province, China, a geological discovery is poised to reshape the global balance of critical raw materials. A significant lithium deposit has been unearthed in the Jijiaoshan mining area, Linwu County. As the world electrifies and competition for energy transition metals intensifies, this find further solidifies China’s dominant position in the battery value chain. This discovery comes at a time when the demand for lithium, a key component in electric vehicle batteries, is soaring. With China already holding a substantial share of the world’s lithium reserves, this discovery could reinforce its strategic advantage.

The Enormous Deposit and Its Strategic Location

Local authorities and scientists from the Hunan Mineral Resources Research Institute have reported that the deposit contains nearly 490 million tons of rock with lithium, equating to approximately 1.31 million tons of lithium oxide. This wealth is embedded in altered granite—a geological structure well-known for favorable extraction conditions. Unlike brine deposits, which are more complex and slower to exploit, hard rock allows for more straightforward separation and processing methods.

This type of deposit offers another advantage: it is often multimetal-rich. In addition to lithium, geologists have identified other strategically important metals such as tungsten, tin, and rubidium. Rubidium, a rare element, is highly valued for atomic clocks and emerging photovoltaic technologies. These additional resources could prove invaluable as demand for advanced technologies continues to grow.

China’s Pre-existing Strong Position

This discovery does not occur in a strategic void. As of 2024, China already held 16.5% of the world’s lithium reserves, second only to Chile, and more significantly, over 70% of the global refining capacity. This makes China an essential player in transforming raw ore into usable materials for lithium-ion batteries, the technological heart of electric vehicles and stationary storage.

Moreover, Beijing continues to explore its subsurface. Exploration campaigns are underway in a vast spodumene geological belt in Tibet, spanning 2,800 miles. Initial estimates suggest up to 30 million tons of potential lithium. If these figures are confirmed, it could significantly alter the global resource balance, further cementing China’s leading role in the lithium market.

Responding to Explosive Demand

The race for lithium is not accidental. With over 60% of the world’s electric vehicle fleet, China expects its lithium demand to double by 2030, according to projections. It also dominates battery manufacturing, accounting for over three-quarters of global production. In the face of this growth, ensuring a reliable domestic supply has become a strategic priority.

The exploitation of the Jijiaoshan deposit aligns with this strategy: securing resources, accelerating their local processing, and thus enhancing the country’s industrial autonomy. This focus on domestic resources underlines China’s commitment to maintaining its leadership in the burgeoning electric vehicle and renewable energy sectors.

A Context of Global Competition

As geopolitical tensions rise around critical resources, Western countries are attempting to respond. Alliances like the United States-European Union Partnership on Raw Materials aim to reduce dependence on China. However, the gap is significant, particularly in refining and extraction technologies.

Meanwhile, China is advancing its initiatives: public subsidies, comprehensive exploration, and innovations in rare metal extraction processes. Recently, Chinese researchers developed a method to isolate ultra-pure rubidium chloride from low-concentration brines, opening new avenues for exploiting marginal resources. These advancements could further entrench China’s position in the global resource landscape.

A Major Piece on the Energy Chessboard

The discovery at Jijiaoshan is not just an additional deposit. It exemplifies China’s methodical strategy to secure access to the metals of the future. If exploitation proceeds as planned, this reserve could quickly supply the country’s battery factories while strengthening its position in international negotiations.

As the global energy transition relies on limited resources, the rocks of Hunan might play a decisive role. Beneath the granite, China may not have found gold, but something far more valuable for the 21st century. How will the rest of the world respond to this growing dominance in critical raw materials?

Wyoming-based All Solar has seen steadily increasing demand in recent years among homeowners and small businesses seeking some level of “energy independence,” including some clients that might surprise.

“It runs the gamut,” All Solar Head of Operations Riley Pieper told WyoFile, “from Rocky Mountain Power [customers] to people in the oilfield that you wouldn’t really expect. They love their solar equipment.”

The company currently has more than 100 installs scheduled and has been preparing to expand operations in the state and potentially open new branches in Montana and Nebraska. But those ambitions might be on hold for a while, Pieper said.

The long-running 30% tax credit for residential rooftop solar will close at the end of this year due to a provision in the One Big Beautiful Bill. A lot of All Solar’s past and prospective clients rely on the tax credit, according to Pieper. When it goes away, “it won’t make as much [economic] sense for a lot of people,” she said. “It is definitely not ideal.”

Since returning to the White House, President Donald Trump and the Republican-led Congress have frozen or cut consumer-level renewable energy and energy efficiency initiatives, as well as halted permitting for commercial-scale wind and solar projects and gutted research budgets and grant programs for the industries.

Speculation abounds about the actual impacts for Wyoming homeowners and small businesses, as well as commercial wind and solar developers. Not only will the new policy moves take time to play out in the market, but many are likely to be tied up in court challenges, according to sources who spoke with WyoFile.

Rising costs

The stakes are high for a lot of Wyoming households. Many have already seen electric bills increase by double digits, and one analysis predicts the nation’s current policy direction could spike bills here by another 29% over the next decade.

“For low-income residents in particular, they’re just going to be subject to increasing [electric] rates, which is just going to continue to exacerbate as we have data centers coming online and wildfire risk continuing to drive [utilities’] insurance costs to go up,” Lander-based Wyoming Outdoor Council Energy and Climate Associate Jonathan Williams told WyoFile, referring to a mounting insurance cost and litigation dilemma for both electric utilities and their customers.

The council has been working for years on another federal program it believes is a particularly good fit in Wyoming, according to Williams.

Solar For All, created under the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, was aimed at helping low- and medium-income households, along with nonprofits and Native American tribes, to pay for solar panel installations. Some $30 million was set aside for qualifying Wyoming applicants, and $5 million of that was set aside for the Wind River Indian Reservation.

But the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency is reportedly preparing to cancel some $7 billion in grants already awarded under the program, throwing into doubt Wyoming’s share.

Big Wind Carpenter, a member of the Northern Arapaho tribe, serves as the Outdoor Council’s tribal engagement coordinator. Some workforce training was already underway, they said, and the tribes had identified several housing project facilities as ideal candidates for rooftop solar.

“Putting rooftop solar on those houses would have saved [money for] a lot of people who are already lower-income families,” Big Wind said.

The council estimated that perhaps more than 30% of all Wyoming households might have qualified for assistance under the Solar for All program.

The potential lost opportunity in Wyoming is compounded by the administration putting into limbo more than $50 million for the Home Energy Savings Program to help low-income households cope with rising electric utility rates “and access more reliable energy by providing rebates for home energy efficiency projects,” according to a 2024 state presentation.

“Just across the board, on numerous programs similar to [Solar for All], which is an intent to reduce electricity bills, folks have seen uncertainty and new headwinds that have popped up,” Williams added.

Part of the drive behind the Solar for All program, according to Lander-based Creative Energies co-founder Scott Kane, was in response to the long-running tax credit for rooftop solar and criticism that it too narrowly catered to households that could afford the investment.

“The solar for all program was trying to push the energy transition in our country,” Kane said. “But it was also really motivated by environmental justice. It was really trying to make sure that the benefits of clean energy were accruing to all of society, not just the healthier economic tiers. That’s the thing that hurts so much about the loss of the Solar for All program: They’re pushing solar back to a time when only higher-income families could afford solar.”

Support, criticism for wind and solar

Despite Wyoming’s deep roots in fossil fuels and skepticism of renewables — particularly wind turbines proliferating across the landscape — more residents are warming to renewable energy, especially for powering their homes. Rising electricity rates likely play a big role.

The increasing costs are changing attitudes, Williams suggested, noting that about 70% of Wyoming residents support rooftop solar, citing the University of Wyoming’s 2022 report, Social License for Wyoming’s Energy Future.

Lander Republican Sen. Cale Case said he has mixed feelings about the fate of federal energy assistance programs, especially those that encourage rooftop solar. Case admits to being perhaps the state’s most notorious critic of rooftop solar — he’s sponsored several bills to overhaul the state’s rooftop solar net-metering law.

“I think pricing is not very good under a net-metering situation, because the person that’s making the installation avoids fixed costs and the utility makes up those costs from other customers,” he said.

A large portion of Case’s district includes the Wind River Reservation. He said he supports energy assistance efforts there, and for low-income communities and households across the state. But, “I do want to have that dialogue about fixing that — net-metering — and a lot of other things.”

Last year, Gov. Mark Gordon established the Grants Management Office to assist local governments, businesses and nonprofits in pursuing state and federal grant programs, including initiatives under the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, Inflation Reduction Act and CHIPS and Science Act. The office has already fielded 500 requests, according to an annual report.

For his part, Gordon “recognizes that the Trump administration may have different priorities than the previous administration,” Gordon’s Communications Director Michael Pearlman told WyoFile via email. “Ultimately, this is a decision being made at the federal level and the Governor respects whatever the final decision is on the status of those programs.”

Following multiple fatalities caused by electric devices in San Francisco, traffic safety advocates are pointing to a need for stronger regulation and classification for electric-powered or motorized modes of transportation.
The stakes, said Christopher White, executive director of the San Francisco Bike Coalition, can be life or death.
The San Francisco Bike Coalition, however, said that based on eyewitness accounts and videos circulating online, they believe Mederer was riding a more powerful, faster vehicle, most likely an e-moped, which requires a motorcycle license.
“It can propagate narratives in the minds of the public that are not true about the safety or lack of safety of different devices,” White said.","On July 21, Janarden Dangi was working a dinner shift at Nepa Indian Cuisine, a restaurant near Divisadero and Fell streets in San Francisco’s Panhandle neighborhood, when he saw police sirens.

Outside, he joined a small crowd looking out at a gruesome scene — a crash between two pedestrians and a rider of an electric-powered vehicle — near the intersection around 11 p.m.

Dangi saw a “white-haired” man lying on the pavement.

“He was half covered by his helmet,” Dangi said. “It was really bad.”

In its initial report, San Francisco Police stated that the person, identified as Matthias Mederer, 64, was riding an e-bike at the time of the crash, which also injured two people.

But in the days and weeks following, confusion arose: was it an e-bike, which doesn’t require a special license to operate — or something else?

Following multiple fatalities caused by electric devices in San Francisco, traffic safety advocates are pointing to a need for stronger regulation and classification for electric-powered or motorized modes of transportation.

The stakes, said Christopher White, executive director of the San Francisco Bike Coalition, can be life or death.

“We just want to make sure that the public has the information that is true and accurate,” White said. “That is what should be guiding policies that develop to keep people safer on the streets.”

In a subsequent statement to KQED on Aug. 8, SFPD again reiterated that the crash involved an e-bike.

The San Francisco Bike Coalition, however, said that based on eyewitness accounts and videos circulating online, they believe Mederer was riding a more powerful, faster vehicle, most likely an e-moped, which requires a motorcycle license.

Dangi also told KQED that the vehicle in question appeared to be “a modified moped.”

“It was not a proper motorbike,” Dangi said. “It was modified with a big sound.”

Dangi added that the corner is often busy and that “people have to be very careful in this intersection.”

The tragedy unfolded against the backdrop of ongoing conversations among state legislators on the prevalence of e-bikes and motorized scooters, and a possible need for increased safety laws.

Under California law, the term “e-bike” can only apply to three classes of electric bicycles with pedals that are capped at 28 miles per hour.

White said they’re commonly confused and misreported as e-mopeds and e-motorbikes: vehicles that go way above that speed and require a motorcycle license.

“It can propagate narratives in the minds of the public that are not true about the safety or lack of safety of different devices,” White said.

White pointed to a fatal collision on Market and Sixth streets just days before the fatal accident on July 21 as a case study: an elderly pedestrian was struck by an electric scooter on July 18 while he crossed the intersection, later succumbing to his injuries at a local hospital.

When SFPD initially responded to the scene, it reported that the vehicle involved was a Lime e-scooter, but later said it remained unclear what kind of scooter it was. Lime also confirmed that the rider was not on one of the company’s electric scooters.

The distinction is significant, White said, because electric scooters have their own classification and the California DMV mandates a 15 mph limit for motorized scooters.

But still, with reports on all sides unconfirmed, the gray area in how motorized devices are classified is starkly apparent.

White recommended that the city develop what he called a “hierarchy of road vulnerability,” or an awareness campaign about the kinds of vehicles on streets and what dangers they pose to pedestrians.

“Those on the streets who can cause more harm to others because of the speed or the heaviness of their vehicles or devices, bear greater responsibility,” White said. “To keep more vulnerable road users, whether that’s pedestrians, seniors, people with disabilities, safe in how they behave.”",https://cdn.kqed.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2025/08/250808-MOPEDDEATH-16-KQED.jpg,N,,2025-08-09 20:12:40.284833

The plan involves storing thermal energy – heat – in giant piles of dirt alongside this leftover, formerly coal-fired infrastructure.
This assessment would certainly extend to dirt batteries.
As of 2022, the energy storage market was valued at $198.8 billion.
By helping to align energy supply and demand as variable energy sources become more dominant in local and national energy mixes, energy storage is critical to energy security as well as the industry bottom line.","The Trump administration is attempting to breathe new life into the nation’s declining coal industry, but greater market forces indicate that the dirtiest fossil fuel will likely continue its terminal decline. Though the sitting president has signed an executive order aimed at “Reinvigorating America’s Beautiful Clean Coal Industry,“ there are zero new coal plants under construction as utilities “continue to prioritize adding renewables, batteries, gas and nuclear power ahead of new coal-fired capacity based on the cost and efficiency.”

It’s undeniable that the domestic coal industry is aging out. “There's been six times more coal power plants retired than constructed in the U.S. this century, which underscores the scope of the challenge facing even the most ardent coal bulls as they try to engineer an industry revival,” Reuters reports. Experts agree that the United States coal industry peaked about two decades ago, as lowering prices for natural gas and solar rendered the industry obsolete.

But energy industry insiders think that there may be new life coming down the pike for decommissioned coal plants. However, that new life will not contribute to the United States’ fossil fuel renaissance, but instead to the stymied but ongoing clean energy transition. A team of researchers at Stanford University is working on turning retired coal plants into energy storage facilities by taking advantage of the plants’ turbine blades and connected generators.

The plan involves storing thermal energy – heat – in giant piles of dirt alongside this leftover, formerly coal-fired infrastructure. “Most dirt includes naturally heat-resistant materials, such as silicon dioxide and aluminium oxide,” reports New Scientist. Industrial heaters within the insulated dirt pile can maintain temperatures of about 600° Celsius (1,112° Fahrenheit). When renewable energy sources create a surplus of energy, that extra energy can be stored as heat until it is needed on the grid, at which point it would be piped out via steam, which would then turn a turbine to create electricity.

While it may sound too low-brow (a pile of dirt?) to be a real energy solution of the future, the plan has real-world precedent. In Finland, two similar batteries – stored in heaps of sand rather than dirt – are already up and running, and providing energy and heat to whole towns in the dead of Nordic winters. “With high specific heat, low thermal conductivity, and no risk of fire, sand-based energy storage systems are gaining traction in grid-scale and industrial heating applications,” Interesting Engineering reported earlier this month. This assessment would certainly extend to dirt batteries.

One of the critical benefits of these battery types is that they are ridiculously cost-effective. As New Scientist reports, perhaps unnecessarily, “dirt is cheaper, more abundant and more widely available than other types of long-term energy storage, such as lithium batteries or hydrogen fuel.”

Another key benefit is that repurposing shuttered coal plants as energy storage centers could bring much-needed jobs and tax revenue to coal country and contribute to a just transition in which fossil-fuel-dependent local economies are not left behind.

If developed intentionally and with a just transition in mind, energy storage projects would not merely function as a bandaid over much bigger economic issues in coal country – they could serve as a real lifeline. As of 2022, the energy storage market was valued at $198.8 billion. Allied Market Research estimates that this will climb to $329.1 billion by 2032, with a compound annual growth rate of 5.2% from 2023 to 2032.

By helping to align energy supply and demand as variable energy sources become more dominant in local and national energy mixes, energy storage is critical to energy security as well as the industry bottom line. Due to its central role in decarbonizing energy grids, energy storage is heating up to be “clean energy’s next trillion-dollar business.” All of this means that storage on unused coal plants while taking advantage of existing infrastructure is a no-brainer, especially when the required materials come dirt cheap – literally.

These energy-storage systems offer numerous – and significant – benefits over conventional designs. Solid-state packs have higher energy density for greater range. These batteries are also less likely to catch on fire, have a longer lifespan, and can charge faster than conventional batteries. Solid-state electron reservoirs sound like an absolute EV game-changer, and countless automakers, academics, and supplier companies alike are researching the technology, though curiously, Tesla may not be as bullish on the technology as others are.

Existing Designs Still Have A Lot Of Life Left

Lars Moravy, Tesla’s vice president of vehicle engineering, shared a few thoughts about solid-state batteries during an interview at the X Takeover 2025 event in San Mateo, California. “You know, if you look year-over-year, battery improvements have always been incremental … about three-percent energy density improvement year-over-year, something like that, and maybe similar in fast charge,” Moravy explained. “And I think that that’s going to keep going for a long time, and we’re going to find a lot more improvements in the batteries that we make in our vehicles,” the engineering executive added.

Over the years, Tesla and its partners – companies like CATL, LG, and Panasonic – have figured out how to dramatically enhance their battery cell designs. As Moravy explained, incremental improvements in the electrolytes used, how cathodes are designed, and what kind of anodes are employed have resulted in significant gains. Also, manufacturing technology has changed, which results in better packing density for a longer vehicle range.

Expect This Trend To Continue

“You can go back decades to figure out when the first lithium-ion battery happened, and follow that linear trend,” said Moravy. “And I think we’ll continue on that trend, and [we’ll] continue to refine it. Every couple of years or so, we change over our entire battery cell factories with our vendors.”

Existing lithium-ion battery designs will almost certainly continue getting better in the future but, “That doesn’t mean we don’t also look at trends like solid-state batteries and super caps (capacitors) and other things that might provide other alternatives of energy,” noted Moravy. “But you know, lithium-ion and lithium iron-phosphate, those cells have really proven their worth in terms of like energy density and capability, and I really think we’re only in the beginning of that. I still think there’s a lot of gains to be made in microchemistry and in those formfactors.”

It’s not clear that any state has a solution and the actual effect of data centers on electricity bills is difficult to pin down. Some critics question whether states have the spine to take a hard line against tech behemoths like Microsoft, Google, Amazon and Meta.

But more than a dozen states have begun taking steps as data centers drive a rapid build-out of power plants and transmission lines.

That has meant pressuring the nation’s biggest power grid operator to clamp down on price increases, studying the effect of data centers on electricity bills or pushing data center owners to pay a larger share of local transmission costs.

Rising power bills are “something legislators have been hearing a lot about. It’s something we’ve been hearing a lot about. More people are speaking out at the public utility commission in the past year than I’ve ever seen before,” said Charlotte Shuff of the Oregon Citizens’ Utility Board, a consumer advocacy group. “There’s a massive outcry.”

Not the typical electric customer

Some data centers could require more electricity than cities the size of Pittsburgh, Cleveland or New Orleans, and make huge factories look tiny by comparison. That’s pushing policymakers to rethink a system that, historically, has spread transmission costs among classes of consumers that are proportional to electricity use.

“A lot of this infrastructure, billions of dollars of it, is being built just for a few customers and a few facilities and these happen to be the wealthiest companies in the world,” said Ari Peskoe, who directs the Electricity Law Initiative at Harvard University. “I think some of the fundamental assumptions behind all this just kind of breaks down.”

A fix, Peskoe said, is a “can of worms” that pits ratepayer classes against one another.

Some officials downplay the role of data centers in pushing up electric bills.

Tricia Pridemore, who sits on Georgia’s Public Service Commission and is president of the National Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners, pointed to an already tightened electricity supply and increasing costs for power lines, utility poles, transformers and generators as utilities replace aging equipment or harden it against extreme weather.

The data centers needed to accommodate the artificial intelligence boom are still in the regulatory planning stages, Pridemore said, and the Data Center Coalition, which represents Big Tech firms and data center developers, has said its members are committed to paying their fair share.

But growing evidence suggests that the electricity bills of some Americans are rising to subsidize the massive energy needs of Big Tech as the U.S. competes in a race against China for artificial intelligence superiority.

Data and analytics firm Wood Mackenzie published a report in recent weeks that suggested 20 proposed or effective specialized rates for data centers in 16 states it studied aren’t nearly enough to cover the cost of a new natural gas power plant.

In other words, unless utilities negotiate higher specialized rates, other ratepayer classes — residential, commercial and industrial — are likely paying for data center power needs.

Meanwhile, Monitoring Analytics, the independent market watchdog for the mid-Atlantic grid, produced research in June showing that 70% — or $9.3 billion — of last year’s increased electricity cost was the result of data center demand.

States are responding

Last year, five governors led by Pennsylvania’s Josh Shapiro began pushing back against power prices set by the mid-Atlantic grid operator, PJM Interconnection, after that amount spiked nearly sevenfold. They warned of customers “paying billions more than is necessary.”

PJM has yet to propose ways to guarantee that data centers pay their freight, but Monitoring Analytics is floating the idea that data centers should be required to procure their own power.

In a filing last month, it said that would avoid a “massive wealth transfer” from average people to tech companies.

At least a dozen states are eyeing ways to make data centers pay higher local transmission costs.

In Oregon, a data center hot spot, lawmakers passed legislation in June ordering state utility regulators to develop new — presumably higher — power rates for data centers.

The Oregon Citizens’ Utility Board says there is clear evidence that costs to serve data centers are being spread across all customers — at a time when some electric bills there are up 50% over the past four years and utilities are disconnecting more people than ever.

New Jersey’s governor signed legislation last month commissioning state utility regulators to study whether ratepayers are being hit with “unreasonable rate increases” to connect data centers and to develop a specialized rate to charge data centers.

In some other states, like Texas and Utah, governors and lawmakers are trying to avoid a supply-and-demand crisis that leaves ratepayers on the hook — or in the dark.

Doubts about states protecting ratepayers

In Indiana, state utility regulators approved a settlement between Indiana Michigan Power Co., Amazon, Google, Microsoft and consumer advocates that set parameters for data center payments for service.

Kerwin Olsen, of the Citizens Action Council of Indiana, a consumer advocacy group, signed the settlement and called it a “pretty good deal” that contained more consumer protections than what state lawmakers passed.

But, he said, state law doesn’t force large power users like data centers to publicly reveal their electric usage, so pinning down whether they’re paying their fair share of transmission costs “will be a challenge.”

In a March report, the Environmental and Energy Law Program at Harvard University questioned the motivation of utilities and regulators to shield ratepayers from footing the cost of electricity for data centers.

Both utilities and states have incentives to attract big customers like data centers, it said.

To do it, utilities — which must get their rates approved by regulators — can offer “special deals to favored customers” like a data center and effectively shift the costs of those discounts to regular ratepayers, the authors wrote. Many state laws can shield disclosure of those rates, they said.

In Pennsylvania, an emerging data center hot spot, the state utility commission is drafting a model rate structure for utilities to consider adopting. An overarching goal is to get data center developers to put their money where their mouth is.

“We’re talking about real transmission upgrades, potentially hundreds of millions of dollars,” commission chairman Stephen DeFrank said. “And that’s what you don’t want the ratepayer to get stuck paying for.”

Last week, an appeals court authorized President Trump’s order instructing agencies to end collective bargaining agreements to move forward while challenges to the order played out in court.

The lawsuit said that migrants often sleep on the concrete floor or sitting upright, lack access to legal counsel and are subjected to a “horrific stench” emanating from toilets next to where they sleep.

A video recorded by a migrant who sneaked in a cellphone last month appeared to confirm some of those complaints, as has recent reporting by The New York Times.

The lawsuit was filed in Manhattan federal court by Sergio Alberto Barco Mercado, a Peruvian immigrant who entered the United States in July 2022 and lives in New Jersey. He was arrested by ICE on Friday as he was leaving a routine appearance in immigration court, where he was facing deportation proceedings and applying for asylum after being charged with entering the country unlawfully.

Mr. Barco Mercado, a father of two, including a 3-month-old, is being held at 26 Federal Plaza, where the lawsuit said dozens of people were often crammed into a space that was just 215 square feet. His lawyers are seeking that a judge certify the suit as a class-action lawsuit.

“People are being deprived of their basic rights, facing medical neglect, and they lack access to adequate food and hygiene,” said Harold Solis, a co-legal director of Make the Road New York, an immigrant advocacy group representing Mr. Barco Mercado. “This cruel detention policy is immoral and inhumane.”

The Department of Homeland Security, which oversees ICE, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The agency has denied claims of unsanitary conditions at 26 Federal Plaza, telling The Times recently that “overcrowding or subprime conditions at ICE facilities are categorically false.” Agency officials have described the holding cells as temporary processing centers, not long-term detention facilities. They have used that designation to justify denying access to members of Congress who have sought to inspect the cells in recent months.

The 10th-floor cells hold undocumented immigrants arrested by agents at the city’s immigration courts, one of which is just two floors above the cells. Immigrants held there are typically processed and shuttled to detention centers elsewhere in the New York area or in other states, including Pennsylvania and Texas.

New federal data analyzed by The Times shows that about half of the more than 2,300 people arrested by ICE in the New York City area since Mr. Trump returned to office in January have been held at 26 Federal Plaza. Concerns about detention facility conditions have surfaced across the country as Trump officials race to find enough space to hold the migrants whom Mr. Trump wants to expel as part his mass deportation campaign.

The lawsuit argued that detainees have no way to communicate with their lawyers while being held in the Lower Manhattan cells, are denied access to their prescribed medications and are served meals so meager that one detainee lost 24 pounds. It also said that ICE was violating its own policies that limit stays at such facilities to 72 hours. The lawsuit said that some detainees have been held for more than a week and that one person was held for 10 days.

Mr. Barco Mercado is also being represented by the American Civil Liberties Union, the New York Civil Liberties Union and the law firm Wang Hecker.

Some of the same groups filed a lawsuit in Manhattan federal court last week challenging the federal government’s practice of arresting migrants showing up for routine hearings in immigration court. That lawsuit, coming two weeks after a similar class-action lawsuit was filed in Washington, D.C., argued that the arrests had turned the courts “into traps.”

The courthouse arrests have driven a spike in the detention of undocumented immigrants without criminal records in New York, according to the recent Times analysis. The lawsuit filed last week in Manhattan argued that the arrests have undermined due process and discouraged migrants from appearing for their mandated court hearings, which in turn puts them at risk of deportation.

Trump officials have defended the courthouse arrests as a “common sense” tactic to easily arrest and swiftly deport migrants who entered the country illegally under former President Joseph R. Biden Jr. without having to send ICE agents into neighborhoods.

Democratic members of Congress from New York have sought access to the holding cells at 26 Federal Plaza but have repeatedly been denied entry by ICE. A dozen Democratic lawmakers — including Representatives Adriano Espaillat and Dan Goldman of New York — sued the federal government last month because of its refusal to allow members into immigration facilities in California, New York, Texas and elsewhere.

Many migrants held at 26 Federal Plaza are moved to detention centers in the New York City region, including a new facility in Newark known as Delaney Hall, a county jail on Long Island that began holding immigrants for ICE this year, and longstanding facilities in the Hudson Valley and near Buffalo.

Under a recent agreement with the Bureau of Prisons, ICE also began holding more than 100 detainees at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn, which has a long history of conditions that some federal judges have described as “barbaric.”

Mr. Goldman and Mr. Espaillat, along with Representative Nydia Velázquez, a fellow Democrat of New York, were denied access to the Metropolitan Detention Center on Wednesday after showing up to conduct oversight.

On the same day, Commerce Secretary Howard W. Lutnick sent a letter to Alan M. Garber, Harvard’s president, claiming that the university had not lived up to its obligations surrounding federally funded patents, which are worth hundreds of millions of dollars. According to the letter, the agency will begin a comprehensive review of Harvard’s compliance with federal law.

The additional pressures on Harvard come during a week when the government had also taken significant steps to bring other schools into line with its agenda. President Trump issued a directive that would require colleges and universities to submit reams of new data on students to check whether they are complying with a Supreme Court decision that ended race-based affirmative action. The White House also intensified its campaign against the University of California, Los Angeles, which it stripped of hundreds of millions in research funds over a list of issues.

In the court case involving Harvard, the Justice Department was asking a judge to throw out one of two pending lawsuits filed by Harvard against the administration, this one involving the right of the nation’s oldest university’s right to host international students.

Earlier in the year, Kristi Noem, the homeland security secretary, moved to end Harvard’s right to host the students. Harvard sued. When Judge Allison Burroughs of federal court in Boston temporarily blocked the administration action, the White House countered in June by issuing a proclamation blocking international students that invoked a different provision of law.

Judge Burroughs, who has expressed skepticism of the Trump administration’s crusade against Harvard from the bench and also in written orders, also blocked that effort, issuing a preliminary injunction.

On Friday, the government moved to dismiss the lawsuit entirely. (The government’s motion on Friday applied only to the case involving international students. It has no effect on the university’s lawsuit against the administration about research funding cuts, a case that focuses heavily on constitutional and procedural concerns.)

The government’s effort could have disrupted the lives of about 5,000 international students attending Harvard last spring, another 2,000 recent graduates, as well as a new cohort of students who plan to arrive this fall.

“Without its international students, Harvard is not Harvard,” the lawsuit said. The university has accused the government of retaliating against it for its refusal to bend to the White House’s efforts to control the university’s “governance, curriculum and the ideology of faculty and students.”

In its filing Friday, the administration denied that contention. Instead, it listed a number of accusations it has made in previous filings and statements about the school, including that violent crime has increased on campus.

Harvard pointed to reporting showing its campus has very low-crime overall. The university’s student newspaper, the Harvard Crimson, has reported that the campus police responded to nearly twice as many crimes on campus in 2023 as in 2021, mostly over reports of stolen electric bikes and scooters.

There was no evidence that international students were involved in the crimes.

In a statement, Harvard said the motion on Friday “has no impact on Harvard’s ability to enroll international students and scholars.”

“The university will continue to defend its rights — and the rights of its students and scholars,” the statement added.

In a separate move on Friday, the administration added to its pressure campaign against Harvard when the Commerce Department said it would investigate whether the university was complying with federal laws and regulations around intellectual property that emerge from government-backed research.

The investigation is expected to examine whether Harvard complied with myriad requirements related to how the university procures and maintains patents for its ideas and research.

In his letter to Dr. Garber, Mr. Lutnick said that his department “places immense value on the groundbreaking scientific and technological advancements from the government’s partnerships with institutions like Harvard.” But, Mr. Lutnick warned, Harvard was also required to follow rules designed to maximize “the benefits to the American public.”

Mr. Lutnick did not include any evidence showing that Harvard, whose researchers generally secure scores of patents each year, had violated the law, but he said that the Commerce Department thought that the university had “failed to live up to its obligations to the American taxpayer.”

Patents can be extraordinarily lucrative for research universities, with their collective values climbing far into the millions of dollars. But if a university does not follow an array of regulatory requirements, the government can essentially dilute or strip a school of its financial stake.

Mr. Lutnick said the government was “initiating” that process. His department asked Harvard to provide a range of records to the government by Sept. 5.

In a statement on Friday, Harvard blasted the Commerce Department’s letter as “unprecedented” and “yet another retaliatory effort targeting Harvard for defending its rights and freedom.”

“Technologies and patents developed at Harvard are lifesaving and industry-redefining,” the university said, adding that it was “fully committed” to complying with federal law.

During those hearings, F.A.A. officials assigned to air traffic control facilities testified that managers had ignored or otherwise rejected appeals for increased staffing, route changes and other measures that might have improved safety. Taking such steps, they said, might have kept the pilots of an Army Black Hawk helicopter from flying into the path of American Airlines Flight 5342 before the January collision.

The audit comes after a bipartisan appeal from lawmakers, who formally requested in June that the Transportation Department’s inspector general undertake the effort. Their appeal was backed by Sean Duffy, the Transportation Department secretary, who oversees the F.A.A.

The audit “will demand answers about why the F.A.A. ignored over 15,000 dangerous helicopter incidents and allowed military aircraft to fly without critical safety equipment in DCA’s congested airspace,” Senator Maria Cantwell of Washington, the top Democrat on the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation, said in a statement.

But she noted that the Army’s inspector general, whom the senators urged to begin a parallel investigation, had yet to commit to doing so.

The transportation inspector general’s audit will focus on an examination of how the F.A.A. oversaw the flight routes around Reagan National Airport, including any safety gaps. It also will scrutinize the F.A.A.’s exemption policies from requirements that aircraft utilize real-time tracking technology that broadcasts their location to control towers.

The Army Black Hawk that crashed into the commercial jet on Jan. 29 had its real-time tracking system, known as ADS-B Out, turned off. Subsequent scrutiny revealed its technology was nonfunctional, the chairwoman of the N.T.S.B., Jennifer Homendy, told reporters last week. She added that the technology was not working for eight of the 16 UH-60L Black Hawk helicopters in that Army unit’s fleet.

Lawmakers had asked the Army’s inspector general to investigate how the military coordinates its Washington operations with the F.A.A., and scrutinize policies regarding pilot training and qualifications, and the condition and use of the tracking technology in its Black Hawk helicopters. It also asked the military to look into its system for cataloging and responding to near-miss events when its helicopters flew too close to commercial aircraft.

In a statement, a group of the family members of passengers of Flight 5342 admonished the Army for not yet announcing a similar probe.

“The concerns raised in recent N.T.S.B. hearings demand a systemwide, transparent review of their role in protecting shared airspace, not incremental or closed-door adjustments,” the statement read. “We owe it to the 67 lives lost — and to every passenger who boards a plane — to ensure these lessons lead to lasting, lifesaving change.”

A spokeswoman for the Army did not respond to a request for comment.

The F.A.A. has said it is working to hire more air traffic controllers amid a persistent shortage and has imposed restrictions on the airspace around Reagan National Airport since the crash, revising helicopter routes and closing one known as Route 4 between Hains Point, the tip of a small island in the Potomac River north of the airport, and the Wilson Bridge, to the airport’s south.

It has also limited the number of helicopters that are allowed to traverse the airspace without their ADS-B Out technology turned on, with exemptions for a handful of V.I.P. events or national security missions, and only when the area has been cleared of commercial traffic.

Fannie and Freddie, which have been under the government’s control since the housing market meltdown of 2008, remain a linchpin of the $12 trillion mortgage market.

Mr. Trump and his advisers have said the companies could be valued at around $500 billion collectively, according to two of the people.

While some shares of the companies still trade over the counter, the new shares would be listed on a major stock market and could yield tens of billions of dollars.

Proceeds from the proposed stock sale, which was first reported by The Wall Street Journal, could help the government generate a return on the money it spent bailing out the companies in 2008, while also infusing the mortgage firms with private capital.

Mr. Trump telegraphed his intent to pursue a public offering in May, writing on his Truth Social platform that he was giving “very serious consideration to bringing Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac public.”

At the time, Mr. Trump wrote that the companies were “throwing off a lot of CASH, and the time would seem to be right.”

But those plans appear to have accelerated over the past three weeks, as Mr. Trump summoned chief executives of the nation’s largest banks into meetings at the White House.

In those meetings, Mr. Trump told the Wall Street executives and their deputies that he was intent on moving quickly, according to two people briefed on the meetings.

Mr. Trump asked bank executives, including Jamie Dimon of JPMorgan, David Solomon of Goldman Sachs, Brian Moynihan of Bank of America and Jane Fraser of Citigroup, to explain how they would execute a deal.

It’s unclear just how the plan would work. A critical question that was not resolved in the meetings with bankers is whether Fannie and Freddie would remain under government control after the stock sale. On one hand, a government-controlled company would mitigate the risks to investors and the mortgage market, but it would also leave investors with less sway over the company’s decisions.

Plans for taking Fannie and Freddie out of a government conservatorship have been discussed on and off for years without any agreed-upon solution for doing so.

In addition to the bankers invited to the White House, other Wall Street investors and advisers have been invited recently to meet with Treasury officials to discuss the stock sale, two of the people said.

It’s unclear exactly how stock market investors would value the mortgage giants and whether that valuation would be anywhere near the $500 billion price tag the Trump administration is discussing.

Neither Fannie, which is officially called the Federal National Mortgage Association, nor Freddie, the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation, actually make loans.

They buy mortgages from banks and package those loans into securities that are sold to big investors. In creating those mortgage-backed securities, Fannie and Freddie guarantee bond investors that they will be made whole if too many mortgage borrowers default. That guarantee helps keep mortgage rates low.

In 2008, bond investors and investors in shares of Fannie and Freddie panicked as more and more homeowners defaulted on their mortgages. The government ultimately stepped in with a $187 billion bailout to prevent the firms from filing for bankruptcy.

A public stock offering could help some wealthy investors, including William A. Ackman and the Trump donor and adviser John Paulson, who invested in the mortgage firms at deeply discounted prices. A stock offering doesn’t guarantee them a windfall, though, because the issuance of new shares could also dilute the value of their existing stock

Mr. Ackman has been arguing for years that the conservatorship should be ended. In January, he prepared a 104-page presentation called The Art of the Deal that lays out his case for ending the conservatorship. (The presentation’s title is an allusion to Mr. Trump’s book of the same name.)

Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent previously has said that while he favors ending the government control of Fannie and Freddie, he would not do anything that would cause an increase in mortgage rates, which have risen in recent years, constraining housing sales.

Bill Pulte, director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency, has been taking bold steps at Fannie and Freddie. One of Mr. Pulte’s first acts as director was to appoint himself as the chair of both Fannie and Freddie — an unprecedented act.

It is unclear how much investor appetite exists for shares in the mortgage firms, particularly given the likely scale of the offering. Fannie and Freddie must sell enough in any offering to pay back investors and the federal government on the equity stakes they still hold and have sufficient cushion to cover any losses from the mortgages they guarantee.

The stock offering would be a boon for Wall Street banks that garner giant fees for advising on the deals. Because of the sheer size of the listing and the number of individual government entities involved, a slew of different banks would take part.

“We’re going to get some back, and we’re going to get some switched,” Mr. Trump said while hosting the leaders of Armenia and Azerbaijan for a peace summit at the White House. “There’ll be some swapping of territories to the betterment of both, but we’ll be talking about that either later, or tomorrow.”

The meeting, the first in-person summit between an American and Russian president since President Joseph R. Biden Jr. met with Mr. Putin in June 2021, reflects Mr. Trump’s confidence in his ability to persuade Mr. Putin in a face-to-face encounter, a goal that has eluded Mr. Trump and his predecessors. For Mr. Putin, the meeting itself is a victory after he spent the past several months largely isolated from the international community, with NATO leaders — other than Mr. Trump — refusing to communicate directly with him.

The meeting also presents a host of challenges. Ukrainian leaders have adamantly opposed relinquishing any of their land to Russia, and the country’s constitution bars President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine from ceding any territory.

There would also be numerous political and military hurdles for Ukraine in turning over land to Russia, as well as questions including security guarantees for Ukraine and the future of frozen Russian assets. And many diplomats have suggested that Mr. Putin may be more interested in dragging out diplomacy to give him time to pummel Ukraine than in securing a peace deal.

White House officials declined to say exactly where in Alaska the two leaders would meet or why Mr. Trump decided to hold the meeting there, though it is the closest U.S. state to Russia. In 2021, the Biden administration held talks with China in Anchorage, Alaska.

Mr. Trump also provided little additional detail about the meeting, what territory could be swapped or the broader contours of a peace deal, saying earlier Friday that he did not want to overshadow the peace pledge between Armenia and Azerbaijan. But he told European leaders earlier this week that he planned to follow up his session with Mr. Putin with a meeting with Mr. Putin and Mr. Zelensky.

Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina and an advocate for U.S. support of Ukraine, praised Mr. Trump’s announcement of the meeting.

“To those who criticize President Trump for being willing to meet with Putin to end the bloodbath in Ukraine — remember Reagan met with Gorbachev to try to end the Cold War,” he posted on social media. “I’m confident President Trump will walk away — like Reagan — if Putin insists on a bad deal.”

Secretary of State Marco Rubio said Thursday in an interview with EWTN, a Catholic media organization, that the United States has “some understanding” of what the Russians want “to stop this war from a diplomatic standpoint.”

“Now, I’m not claiming that what the Russians would need and what Ukraine would need are the same,” he said, without providing specifics. “There’s a difference, and there’s a gap there.”

He added: “Can we bridge the gap between the Ukrainian side and the Russian side on this close enough so the president can come in as part of any sort of meeting and maybe be the closer on this deal?”

Even a successful meeting between Mr. Trump and Mr. Putin would be just an opening move in any deal. Beyond the question of territory, a number of equally thorny issues would need to be settled. Among them is whether Mr. Zelensky would get security guarantees from Europe, the United States or NATO to keep Russia from pausing, then resuming, a war to try to take the rest of the country.

In the past, Mr. Putin has also demanded sharp limits on the number and quality of arms that the West could provide to Ukraine, and he has argued for a variety of steps that could change the government, including elections, which he would presumably try to influence by seeking to place a more pro-Russia leader.

Russian officials have demanded that Ukraine cede the four regions that Moscow claimed to have “annexed” from Ukraine in late 2022, even as some of that land remains under Ukrainian control.

Mr. Trump has grown increasingly frustrated with his inability to end a conflict that, as a candidate for president, he promised he would settle in 24 hours. And since taking office, he has oscillated in his approach to Russia. Earlier in his term, he showed considerable deference to Mr. Putin, to the point of joining North Korea in opposing a United Nations resolution condemning Russia for its 2022 invasion.

He also berated Mr. Zelensky in the Oval Office earlier this year for not showing enough gratitude to the United States for its military support, telling the Ukrainian leader that he didn’t “have the cards” to negotiate a peace deal. But more recently, he has criticized Mr. Putin for not accepting the terms of a proposed cease-fire, and for prolonging the conflict.

Steve Witkoff, Mr. Trump’s special envoy, met with Mr. Putin in Moscow on Wednesday, a session Mr. Trump said was “highly productive.” But shortly after the meeting, Mr. Trump announced he would increase tariffs on India to 50 percent, as a penalty for purchasing Russian oil.

Friday also marked the deadline for Russia to agree to a cease-fire before Mr. Trump imposed additional sanctions on its oil exports, though it appeared Mr. Trump would not follow through on that threat after announcing his meeting with Mr. Putin.

The new label reads: “On Jan. 13, 2021, Donald Trump became the first president to be impeached twice. The charge was incitement of insurrection based on his challenge of the 2020 election results and on his speech on Jan. 6. Because Trump’s term ended on Jan. 20, he became the first former president tried by the Senate. He was acquitted on Feb. 13, 2021.”

The change came after the National Museum of American History in Washington last month took down a temporary addition to an exhibition about the American presidency that referred to President Trump’s two impeachments to update it as part of what museum officials described as a review of the institution’s content for bias.

The new labeling that went up on Friday also changed the description of President Trump’s first impeachment, in 2019, adding the word “alleged” to a line that now reads: “The charges focused on the president’s alleged solicitation of foreign interference in the 2020 presidential election and defiance of Congressional subpoenas.”

The Smithsonian said in a statement Friday that “at the heart of the Smithsonian’s work is a steadfast commitment to scholarship, rigorous research, and the accurate, factual presentation of history.”

“Adhering to principles foundational to our role as the nation’s museum, we take great care to ensure that what we present to the public reflects both intellectual integrity and thoughtful design,” the Smithsonian said.

It noted that the placard it had replaced had been put up as a temporary exhibit in 2021, and that it had blocked some of the other items in the display case. “We removed it to make way for a more permanent update to the content inside the case,” the Smithsonian said.

Samuel J. Redman, a history professor at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, said that while historians were bound to continually revise their takes on history, he found some of the changes “troubling.”

“The resulting chilling effect seems clear,” he said. “The Smithsonian curators and museum specialists are walking a tightrope, attempting to stick to factual interpretations about the recent past while experiencing pressure to minimize any bad information about the Trump administration.”

The new labeling is accompanied by new artifacts: admission tickets to the Senate gallery after Mr. Trump’s first impeachment. The updated display also includes a rewrite of the main exhibit panel to more fully explain the mechanics of impeachment, the Smithsonian said.

The removal of the original text in July came after the Smithsonian’s Board of Regents, which governs the institution, had committed to reviewing its content after pressure from the Trump administration. Mr. Trump has called for what he has described as a more positive framing of the country’s history in Smithsonian museums. After the president announced this spring that he had fired the director of another museum, the National Portrait Gallery, the Smithsonian asserted that it holds the power over personnel. But the director then resigned.

The temporary removal of the label about Mr. Trump’s impeachment became national news, and some critics accused the Smithsonian of bowing to pressure from the White House to rewrite history. The Smithsonian said it had received no presidential instruction to take it down, and that it made the changes because the temporary display did not meet its usual presentational standards.

The labeling was part of an exhibit on the American presidency that opened at the Museum of American History in 2000. The exhibit also includes information about the impeachments of former Presidents Andrew Johnson and Bill Clinton, and notes that former President Richard M. Nixon was facing possible impeachment when he resigned from office.

A label referencing Mr. Trump’s two impeachments was added in 2021. Mr. Trump is the only American president to have been impeached twice, in 2019 and again in 2021. He was acquitted both times after facing trials in the Senate.

The Smithsonian has been closely scrutinized by Mr. Trump, who issued an executive order in March asserting that the country had “witnessed a concerted and widespread effort to rewrite our nation’s history” by the institution. He argued that the Smithsonian had “come under the influence of a divisive, race-centered ideology.”

In the order, he called on Vice President JD Vance, a member of the Smithsonian’s board, to work with Congress to prohibit expenditures on exhibitions or programs that “degrade shared American values, divide Americans by race or promote ideologies inconsistent with federal law.”

A gregarious and colorful personality, Mr. Long had tried to cultivate a connection with the depleted and demoralized I.R.S. work force. He visited I.R.S. locations around the country and repeatedly sent emails to all I.R.S. employees allowing them to leave work early on Friday afternoons.

“With this being Thursday before another FriYay, please enjoy a 70-minute early exit tomorrow. That way you’ll be rested for my 70th birthday on Monday!” Mr. Long wrote to staff on Thursday.

His departure intensifies the management turmoil that has plagued the agency since Mr. Trump took office. Mr. Bessent will serve as the acting head of the I.R.S. while the Trump administration finds and confirms a new commissioner, a senior administration official said, making the Treasury secretary the seventh individual to lead the tax agency this year.

Mr. Long wrote on social media that he would be nominated to become the next U.S. ambassador to Iceland. “It is a honor to serve my friend President Trump and I am excited to take on my new role as the ambassador to Iceland,” Mr. Long wrote. “I am thrilled to answer his call to service and deeply committed to advancing his bold agenda. Exciting times ahead.”

In another post on Friday afternoon, Mr. Long clarified that filing season would not start late next year. “Rest assured tax filing season will start at the customary time,” he wrote.

Mr. Long had remarked to some colleagues that he had to ask Mr. Bessent for permission for everything he did at the I.R.S., two of the people familiar with the decision to remove him said. Others added that the Trump administration officials had been considering moving Mr. Long to a new position for several weeks.

One person familiar with the decision maintained that Mr. Bessent had been supportive of Mr. Long and had pushed the Senate to confirm him, which it did in June along party lines.

In a statement, the Treasury Department thanked Mr. Long “for his commitment to public service and the American people,” and said a new commissioner would be announced “at an appropriate time.”

The I.R.S. is at the center of one of the Trump administration’s top priorities, carrying out the huge tax cut Republicans passed into law last month. The agency, along with the Treasury Department, is responsible for writing the rules for and disseminating information about several tricky issues in the law, including who can claim new tax breaks for tipped income and overtime pay.

That is a tall task that former I.R.S. officials said would only become more challenging amid the internal turbulence. More than 25,000 people have left the agency under Mr. Trump, roughly a quarter of the staff it had at the start of January, according to the Treasury’s inspector general for tax administration. Congress is also eyeing steep budget cuts to the I.R.S.

“It has to have some impact on the agency’s ability to deliver this major piece of legislation,” said Terry Lemons, who led the I.R.S.’s communication efforts before retiring this year. “The people who are left, are they going to be able to handle this high volume with fewer staff and the potential for more budget cuts hanging over their heads?”

Mr. Trump had broken from recent precedent when he said would nominate Mr. Long last year. For decades, I.R.S. commissioners served five-year terms, an attempt to insulate the technocratic yet powerful position from partisan politics. Daniel Werfel, President Joseph R. Biden Jr.’s choice to lead the I.R.S., stepped down in January.

A string of acting commissioners then led the agency, several of whom quit earlier this year as the Trump administration leaned on the I.R.S. to abandon its longstanding protections of taxpayer information and share data with immigration officials. One of the previous acting commissioners, an I.R.S. agent named Gary Shapley, was replaced within just a few days this spring after Mr. Bessent protested to Mr. Trump that Elon Musk had installed the I.R.S. leader without consulting him, The New York Times previously reported.

“In just a handful of months, Trump and his crew have already gutted taxpayer service, weaponized IRS data against innocent taxpayers and set us up for disaster when next year’s filing season comes around,” Senator Ron Wyden, Democrat of Oregon, said in a statement.

There had been hope among some at the I.R.S. that Mr. Long would restore some amount of stability to the agency, even though he had supported legislation calling for its abolition while in Congress. Instead, John Koskinen, who served as I.R.S. commissioner in the Obama and Trump administrations, said Mr. Long may have had the shortest tenure ever for a Senate-confirmed leader of the agency.

“It has to be a new American record for the shortest I.R.S. tenure in history,” he said. “Obviously, he had no background in tax and no background in management. You give him a 75,000-person agency in charge of the tax code, and it is a bit of a challenge.”

Republicans have long taken a hostile approach to the I.R.S., seeking to cut its budget and weaken its ability to conduct audits. Republican members of Congress had cheered Mr. Long’s decision to place two top I.R.S. officials, including the leader of the large-business and international division, on administrative leave. Before he left, Mr. Long amplified a post on social media about the need to “purge” the agency’s work force.

The I.R.S. did not respond to a request for comment.

A key part of the breakthrough was an announcement from Armenia giving the United States exclusive development rights to a transit corridor through its territory, connecting Azerbaijan, which sits east of Armenia, to Nakhichevan, a noncontiguous enclave to Armenia’s west that features Azerbaijan’s only border with Turkey, an important ally.

The 27-mile corridor will be named the Trump Route for International Peace and Prosperity, and run along Armenia’s southern border with Iran.

At the meeting on Friday, Mr. Trump described the naming of the route as a “great honor for me.”

Mr. Pashinyan called the joint declaration a “game-changing outcome,” heralding a new chapter “of peace, prosperity, security and economic cooperation in the South Caucasus.” He cited the “blessed are the peacemakers” passage of the Bible as he praised Mr. Trump for mediating the deal.

Mr. Aliyev also credited Mr. Trump for bringing the decades-long conflict with Armenia closer to an end.

“If not for President Trump and his team,” he said, “probably today Armenia and Azerbaijan would have been again in this endless process of negotiations.”

Both men said they would endorse Mr. Trump for the Nobel Peace Prize.

“Thirty-five years of death and hatred, and now it’s going to be love and success together,” Mr. Trump said.

For a president who ran on an “America First” agenda eschewing United States involvement abroad, Mr. Trump has shown an eagerness to cast himself as a global peacemaker, even as the conflicts he has promised to end — in Ukraine and Gaza — are still boiling.

In open pursuit of a Nobel Peace Prize, Mr. Trump has involved himself in peace negotiations between Cambodia and Thailand; the military conflict between Israel and Iran; and tensions between India and Pakistan. The United States has also been involved in a temporary peace deal between Rwanda and the Democratic Republic of Congo.

“I’ve stopped six wars,” Mr. Trump said last month in Turnberry, Scotland. “I’m averaging about a war a month.”

The latest agreement comes after months of shuttle diplomacy between Armenia and Azerbaijan, capped off with a series of more recent face-to-face sessions between Mr. Pashinyan and Mr. Aliyev, including gatherings at the Kremlin and in Abu Dhabi.

While not a peace deal, the joint declaration is the first formal, signed commitment aimed at permanently ending the conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan, apart from various cease-fire agreements following periods of the conflict that broke into all-out war. The region has been embroiled in conflict since the two countries declared their independence from the Soviet Union in the early 1990s.

But there are still many potential hurdles between it and its goal of producing a lasting, durable peace.

Azerbaijan and Armenia have had closed borders since the late 1980s, when they began fighting over control of Nagorno-Karabakh, a breakaway region within Azerbaijan’s borders that had, until recently, been populated with ethnic Armenians. In 1993, Turkey also closed its border with Armenia in solidarity with Baku.

The long-running conflict between the Turkic Muslims of Azerbaijan and the Christian Armenians was punctuated by charges of ethnic cleansing on both sides, the forced displacement of hundreds of thousands of people, and the deaths of tens of thousands over almost four decades.

According to the White House, the deal does not resolve the two countries’ competing claims to sovereignty over key regions or delineate the borders between Armenia and Azerbaijan, one of the fundamental issues underpinning their long-running standoff. It also does not address lingering human rights claims resulting from Azerbaijan’s 2023 takeover of Nagorno-Karabakh.

Azerbaijan has insisted that Armenia must amend its constitution to wipe out any claims to Nagorno-Karabakh. While Armenia’s constitution does not directly reference Nagorno-Karabakh, its preamble cites the country’s Declaration of Independence, which refers to the “reunification” of the territory with Armenia.

Still, Mr. Aliyev has said in the past that without such a change, a peace agreement is not possible.

Armenia has been agitating for Azerbaijan to release political prisoners and guarantee that the roughly 150,000 ethnically Armenian residents expelled during the takeover of Nagorno-Karabakh can return to their homes.

Both countries have raised claims against each other in competing cases before the International Court of Justice. It is not clear if those appeals will be withdrawn once the joint declaration committing to a peace agreement is signed. Upon signing, however, Armenia and Azerbaijan will withdraw from the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe’s Minsk Group, a mediation format led by Russia, France and the United States that has been trying since 1997 to resolve the conflict, without success.

The creation of the transit corridor named for Mr. Trump is expected to bring its own set of challenges. Already, there have been warnings of a backlash from Tehran, which sees the introduction of an exclusive U.S. economic development zone along its border as a potential threat.

Earlier this week, Ali Akbar Velayati, a top foreign policy adviser to Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, wrote on social media that the creation of such a corridor would prompt “a firm response from Iran.”

For Azerbaijan, the corridor is a critical overland link between Baku and Turkey; for Armenia, agreeing to it — and striking a peace deal with Azerbaijan — could be critical steps toward normalizing relations with Turkey, the subject of continuing negotiations.

But Armenians in the diaspora have raised concerns that even if Yerevan retains legal authority over the corridor, Azerbaijan could try to use its guaranteed unfettered economic access to try to expand its footprint in the area, and challenge Armenia’s sovereignty.

“What we’re seeing is an agreement rewarding Azerbaijan’s aggression, undermining Armenia’s sovereignty and denying justice to the 150,000 Armenians forced from their homes,” said Alex Galitsky, the policy director for the Armenian National Committee of America.

When asked about potential obstacles to peace, Mr. Aliyev told reporters that “there should be no doubt or no suspicions that any of the sides will step back.” He added that the leaders would not have signed an agreement in the White House if they had not been committed to seeing a deal through.

“What has happened today will result in peace, long-lasting peace, eternal peace in the Caucasus,” Mr. Aliyev added.

“Fully agree, and nothing to add,” Mr. Pashinyan replied.

If U.C.L.A. accedes to the demand, it would be the largest payout — by far — of any university that has so far reached a deal with the White House. Columbia University agreed to pay $221 million in connection with its settlement with the government, and Brown University pledged to spend $50 million with state work force programs.

The University of California’s president, James B. Milliken, said in a statement on Friday that the university had “just received a document from the Department of Justice and is reviewing it.”

He added, “As a public university, we are stewards of taxpayer resources, and a payment of this scale would completely devastate our country’s greatest public university system as well as inflict great harm on our students and all Californians.”

Administrators at the campus in Los Angeles did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Julio Frenk, U.C.L.A.’s chancellor, said this week that about $584 million in research funding was already “suspended and at risk.” The university, like many other top schools, is deeply dependent on federal research money; about 11 percent of its revenues come from federal grants and contracts.

The Trump administration has largely targeted elite private universities in recent months as a part of what it has depicted as a campaign to fight antisemitism and reshape institutions that it views as cathedrals of liberalism.

But its turn toward U.C.L.A. has been sharp. On July 29, the day the University of California settled a lawsuit that accused U.C.L.A. of allowing pro-Palestinian protesters to block Jewish students on campus, the Justice Department said it believed U.C.L.A. had committed civil rights violations.

Dr. Frenk announced later that week the federal government had started freezing research money.

The White House’s demands of U.C.L.A. fit into a broad pattern of how the Trump administration has targeted California. The state’s governor, Gavin Newsom, is one of President Trump’s top political foes and a potential candidate for the White House.

On Thursday, the day before the terms of the White House’s proposed settlement emerged, Mr. Newsom suggested the University of California would not bow to the federal government.

“I will fight like hell to make sure that doesn’t happen,” said Mr. Newsom, an ex officio member of the university’s board of regents. “There’s principles. There’s right and wrong, and we’ll do the right thing, and what President Trump is doing is wrong, and everybody knows it.”

He added that he would “do everything in my power to encourage them to do the right thing and not to become another law firm that bends on their knees, another company that sells their soul, or another institution that takes a shortcut and takes the easy wrong versus the hard right.”

But the University of California has shown a willingness to talk to the federal government. Mr. Milliken, the system’s newly installed president, said on Wednesday that the university had agreed “to engage in dialogue with the federal administration.” Mr. Milliken, though, sharply criticized the administration’s moves against funding.

“These cuts do nothing to address antisemitism,” said Mr. Milliken, who started his job on Aug. 1. “Moreover, the extensive work that U.C.L.A. and the entire University of California have taken to combat antisemitism has apparently been ignored.

The White House’s proposed terms, some of which were first reported by CNN, were not exclusively financial. Among other conditions, the government is seeking the appointment of a monitor to enforce the settlement’s terms, the abolition of scholarships connected to race or ethnicity and the cessation of diversity statements in hiring.

But the government included a provision, as it did with Brown and Columbia, that would seem to keep U.S. officials from using the settlement to interfere directly with academic freedom, admissions and hiring.On Friday, Governor Newsom, along with several other state officials, called the White House’s proposal “a billion-dollar political shakedown.”

“Trump has weaponized the Department of Justice to punish California, crush free thinking, and kneecap the greatest public university system in the world,” the officials said in a statement, adding, “We are united against Trump’s assault and will fight like hell because California will not bow to this kind of disgusting political extortion.”

The administration is negotiating with a handful of universities, including Cornell and Harvard. And although Brown and Columbia each agreed to payments, the government’s settlement with the University of Pennsylvania included no financial penalties.

Among the universities that have been targeted by the Trump administration, Harvard is the only one that has sued, arguing the government’s moves are illegal. It was unclear whether U.C.L.A. would take that step.

Even as Harvard’s case moves through the court system, the school has been in talks with the Trump administration in an effort to end the conflict.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/08/08/multimedia/08trump-news-promo9p-kwbp/08trump-news-promo9p-kwbp-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-08-09 18:07:57.560909

The ""Solar for All"" program had aimed to help more than 900,000 low-income households reduce pollution, and utility bills.
Solar for All funded efforts around the country to provide rooftop solar panels, community solar farms, and battery storage.
A key element of the Solar for All program is helping low-income households.
The EPA under Biden had estimated that the program would produce over $350 million in annual savings on electric bills for low-income households across the country.","The Trump Administration says it will end a $7 billion program to help low-income households and communities get access to affordable solar energy. The move is part of President Donald Trump's effort to reverse former President Biden's climate agenda and boost fossil fuels instead.

The ""Solar for All"" program had aimed to help more than 900,000 low-income households reduce pollution, and utility bills. Solar for All funded efforts around the country to provide rooftop solar panels, community solar farms, and battery storage.

Now, the fate of the program is in question, the Trump administration argues, because of a massive spending and tax bill Republicans passed last month.

Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin said in a social media post that the new law repeals ""the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund, including a $7 billion program called Solar for All."" Zeldin did not offer details about how and when the program would be cut back or shut down.

The Solar for All money had already been obligated to state entities like the West Virginia Office of Energy, the Kentucky Energy and Environment Cabinet, and the Michigan Department of Environment. Under the program, the entities then gave grants to lending institutions that fund solar and battery projects, and to installers and project developers themselves. Some funding also went to organizations focused on expanding solar for tribal communities. And some money went through multistate solar programs like GRID Alternatives.

Because the money was considered obligated, grantees argue the Trump administration can't reclaim it now.

""We and many others are prepared to take them to court,"" says Jillian Blanchard, vice president of climate change and environment justice at Lawyers for Good Government, which is working with grantees. Blanchard says the new law ""rescinded only a much smaller portion of money — of unobligated funds.""

A key element of the Solar for All program is helping low-income households.

Having solar ""means that people can essentially have more money to pay for other essential needs, such as food and healthcare. Both of which are rising in price simultaneously,"" says Sanya Carley, professor of energy policy at the University of Pennsylvania.

""By removing this program, a program that was designed specifically to help low and moderate income households, it essentially means that these households won't be able to benefit from these reduced bills,"" Carley says.

A year ago the EPA awarded Colorado's Solar for All program $156 million. The governor's office said that would expand access to solar power to more than 20,000 Coloradans.

""The Trump Administration is seeking to rip cost-saving solutions out of the hands of hardworking Coloradans and push us backwards into an over reliance on non-renewable resources,"" Democratic Gov. Jared Polis said in a statement.

The EPA under Biden had estimated that the program would produce over $350 million in annual savings on electric bills for low-income households across the country.

The data centers needed to accommodate the artificial intelligence boom are still in the regulatory planning stages, Pridemore said, and the Data Center Coalition, which represents Big Tech firms and data center developers, has said its members are committed to paying their fair share.
In other words, unless utilities negotiate higher specialized rates, other ratepayer classes — residential, commercial and industrial — are likely paying for data center power needs.
In Oregon, a data center hot spot, lawmakers passed legislation in June ordering state utility regulators to develop new — presumably higher — power rates for data centers.
An overarching goal is to get data center developers to put their money where their mouth is.","Amid rising electric bills, states are under pressure to insulate regular household and business ratepayers from the costs of feeding Big Tech's energy-hungry data centers.

It's not clear that any state has a solution and the actual effect of data centers on electricity bills is difficult to pin down. Some critics question whether states have the spine to take a hard line against tech behemoths like Microsoft, Google, Amazon and Meta.

But more than a dozen states have begun taking steps as data centers drive a rapid build-out of power plants and transmission lines.

That has meant pressuring the nation's biggest power grid operator to clamp down on price increases, studying the effect of data centers on electricity bills or pushing data center owners to pay a larger share of local transmission costs.

Rising power bills are ""something legislators have been hearing a lot about. It's something we've been hearing a lot about. More people are speaking out at the public utility commission in the past year than I've ever seen before,"" said Charlotte Shuff of the Oregon Citizens' Utility Board, a consumer advocacy group. ""There's a massive outcry.""

Not the typical electric customer

Some data centers could require more electricity than cities the size of Pittsburgh, Cleveland or New Orleans, and make huge factories look tiny by comparison. That's pushing policymakers to rethink a system that, historically, has spread transmission costs among classes of consumers that are proportional to electricity use.

""A lot of this infrastructure, billions of dollars of it, is being built just for a few customers and a few facilities and these happen to be the wealthiest companies in the world,"" said Ari Peskoe, who directs the Electricity Law Initiative at Harvard University. ""I think some of the fundamental assumptions behind all this just kind of breaks down.""

A fix, Peskoe said, is a ""can of worms"" that pits ratepayer classes against one another.

Some officials downplay the role of data centers in pushing up electric bills.

Tricia Pridemore, who sits on Georgia's Public Service Commission and is president of the National Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners, pointed to an already tightened electricity supply and increasing costs for power lines, utility poles, transformers and generators as utilities replace aging equipment or harden it against extreme weather.

The data centers needed to accommodate the artificial intelligence boom are still in the regulatory planning stages, Pridemore said, and the Data Center Coalition, which represents Big Tech firms and data center developers, has said its members are committed to paying their fair share.

But growing evidence suggests that the electricity bills of some Americans are rising to subsidize the massive energy needs of Big Tech as the U.S. competes in a race against China for artificial intelligence superiority.

Data and analytics firm Wood Mackenzie published a report in recent weeks that suggested 20 proposed or effective specialized rates for data centers in 16 states it studied aren't nearly enough to cover the cost of a new natural gas power plant.

In other words, unless utilities negotiate higher specialized rates, other ratepayer classes — residential, commercial and industrial — are likely paying for data center power needs.

Meanwhile, Monitoring Analytics, the independent market watchdog for the mid-Atlantic grid, produced research in June showing that 70% — or $9.3 billion — of last year's increased electricity cost was the result of data center demand.

States responding

Last year, five governors led by Pennsylvania's Josh Shapiro began pushing back against power prices set by the mid-Atlantic grid operator, PJM Interconnection, after that amount spiked nearly sevenfold. They warned of customers ""paying billions more than is necessary.""

PJM has yet to propose ways to guarantee that data centers pay their freight, but Monitoring Analytics is floating the idea that data centers should be required to procure their own power.

In a filing last month, it said that would avoid a ""massive wealth transfer"" from average people to tech companies.

At least a dozen states are eyeing ways to make data centers pay higher local transmission costs.

In Oregon, a data center hot spot, lawmakers passed legislation in June ordering state utility regulators to develop new — presumably higher — power rates for data centers.

The Oregon Citizens' Utility Board says there is clear evidence that costs to serve data centers are being spread across all customers — at a time when some electric bills there are up 50% over the past four years and utilities are disconnecting more people than ever.

New Jersey's governor signed legislation last month commissioning state utility regulators to study whether ratepayers are being hit with ""unreasonable rate increases"" to connect data centers and to develop a specialized rate to charge data centers.

In some other states, like Texas and Utah, governors and lawmakers are trying to avoid a supply-and-demand crisis that leaves ratepayers on the hook — or in the dark.

Doubts about states protecting ratepayers

In Indiana, state utility regulators approved a settlement between Indiana Michigan Power Co., Amazon, Google, Microsoft and consumer advocates that set parameters for data center payments for service.

Kerwin Olsen, of the Citizens Action Council of Indiana, a consumer advocacy group, signed the settlement and called it a ""pretty good deal"" that contained more consumer protections than what state lawmakers passed.

But, he said, state law doesn't force large power users like data centers to publicly reveal their electric usage, so pinning down whether they're paying their fair share of transmission costs ""will be a challenge.""

In a March report, the Environmental and Energy Law Program at Harvard University questioned the motivation of utilities and regulators to shield ratepayers from footing the cost of electricity for data centers.

Both utilities and states have incentives to attract big customers like data centers, it said.

To do it, utilities — which must get their rates approved by regulators — can offer ""special deals to favored customers"" like a data center and effectively shift the costs of those discounts to regular ratepayers, the authors wrote. Many state laws can shield disclosure of those rates, they said.

In Pennsylvania, an emerging data center hot spot, the state utility commission is drafting a model rate structure for utilities to consider adopting. An overarching goal is to get data center developers to put their money where their mouth is.

""We're talking about real transmission upgrades, potentially hundreds of millions of dollars,"" commission chairman Stephen DeFrank said. ""And that's what you don't want the ratepayer to get stuck paying for.""

August 9, 2025 - OAKLAND — On Friday, California Attorney General Rob Bonta and the California Air Resources Board joined a coalition of 23 states and cities in submitting a comment letter opposing the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) proposal to repeal all greenhouse gas (GHG) emission standards for fossil fuel-fired power plants and to eliminate the basis for those standards — the determination that power plant GHG emissions cause harmful climate change. The coalition asserts in its comments that these standards protect against increased emissions and further acceleration of climate change. The proposal, if finalized, could increase carbon dioxide pollution contributing to climate change by eliminating existing requirements for power plants to take steps to control their carbon dioxide emissions.

“Rolling back emission standards for dirty power plants jeopardizes critical progress at a time when it is most needed to confront the escalating impacts of climate change,” said Attorney General Bonta. “We’ve seen these impacts in California just this year with ravaging fires across Los Angeles. The EPA must stop ignoring the facts and immediately withdraw this reckless proposal.”

The EPA proposal includes a sweeping rollback of all GHG emission standards for new and existing fossil fuel-fired power plants. If finalized, the proposal would repeal both the 2015 New Source Performance Standards and the 2024 Carbon Pollution Standards, which limit carbon emissions from new natural gas-fired and existing coal-fired power plants. It would also rescind EPA’s 2015 finding that power plant GHG emissions significantly contribute to harmful climate change.

Fossil fuel-fired power plants in the United States are collectively one of the largest contributors to climate pollution anywhere in the world. Failing to control their carbon dioxide emissions will exacerbate significant threats facing California and Californians, intensifying and increasing heat waves, severe storms, flooding, disease, worsening air quality, and harming regional ecosystems. In the last year alone, California has experienced two of the most destructive fires in state history, the Palisades Fire and the Eaton Fire, both in Los Angeles County, with over 37,469 acres damaged, 30 deaths, multiple first responders injured, and over 16,251 structures destroyed.

In the comment letter, the coalition asserts that:

EPA’s proposed rule would significantly undermine efforts to address climate change and thus expose communities — particularly low-income and frontline communities — to greater environmental harm.

EPA’s proposed finding that power plants do not “contribute significantly” to greenhouse gas emissions violates the law and common sense.

The proposal arbitrarily and capriciously disregards effective measures plants can take to control their carbon dioxide emissions.

Despite unlawfully and illogically assuming reducing greenhouse gas emissions has zero benefit, EPA still admits that the rules it proposed to repeal are net beneficial to the American public.

In submitting the comment letter, Attorney General Bonta and CARB join the attorneys general of Arizona, Colorado, Connecticut, Hawaii, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington, Wisconsin, and the District of Columbia, and the Chief Legal Officers of the City and County of Denver, and the Cities of Boulder, Chicago, and New York.",https://goldrushcam.com/sierrasuntimes/images/2018/december/oil.jpg,N,,2025-08-09 20:08:55.819385

Any information about disparities in pollution and the health impacts of climate change have been the biggest targets of deletion.
“That story is yet to unfold.” So far, the EPA’s climate change website is still intact.
Scientists raised alarm in July when the Trump administration took down the federal website that houses national climate assessments.
Farmers and environmental groups have also filed suit to force the Trump administration to restore federal resources.","Now that we’re about halfway into the first year of President Donald Trump’s second term, we can take stock of his administration’s destruction of online environmental resources. It’s worse than last time. It’s also, seemingly, just the beginning — paving the way forward for the president’s polluting agenda.

A watchdog group that monitors publicly-available environmental data has recorded 70 percent more federal website changes during Trump’s first 100 days in office in 2025 compared to the start of his first term in 2017.

Federal agencies are taking broader swings to ax public resources from their websites this time around, the report shows. They’re hiding which communities are most affected by pollution. The Trump administration has not only tossed out the most authoritative national reports on climate change, they’re starting to replace facts and evidence with disinformation. We’re seeing a revisionist history unfold.

“You can say anything you want to say if you remove evidence to the contrary.”

“If you suppress data … you can say anything you want to say if you remove evidence to the contrary,” says Gretchen Gehrke, one of the lead authors of the report published this week by the Environmental Data & Governance Initiative (EDGI).

Looking just at the first 100 days of Trump’s second term compared to the start of his first term, EDGI noted 632 important changes to federal websites this year compared to 371 in 2017. That’s despite EDGI only keeping tabs this year on 20 percent of the websites it monitored during the first term, due to capacity constraints and because the group chose to home in on webpages it thought would be most vulnerable.

They’ve tracked 879 significant changes to 639 different federal webpages during the first 6 months of the current administration. That includes changes to content, like replacing the term “climate change” with “extreme weather,” and the wholesale removal of entire webpages.

Any information about disparities in pollution and the health impacts of climate change have been the biggest targets of deletion. The Environmental Protection Agency’s EJScreen mapping tool, designed to show which populations are disproportionately impacted by air pollutants and other public health hazards across the US, was one of the first resources lost. Federal agencies had essentially purged any of their publicly-available websites on environmental justice by mid-February, according to the report.

“The thing that is the most different is this total erasure of information about environmental racism and the evidence of environmental racism,” Gehrke says. “In the second Trump administration, information control was about removing evidence of inequality.”

As global warming pushes up sea levels, for example, a 2021 EPA report found that Hispanic and Latino individuals are roughly 50 percent more likely than others to live in coastal areas with the highest estimated increases in traffic delays from worsening high-tide flooding. A press release and PDF of the report are still available online. (Did it escape scrutiny because it’s described as a “social vulnerability report” rather than an environmental justice report?) A link in the press release to more “information about environmental justice,” however, is dead. It simply says “Sorry, but this web page does not exist.”

“Information control was about removing evidence of inequality.”

For resources on climate change more broadly across federal websites, changes have “started really ramping up,” Gehrke says. “That story is yet to unfold.” So far, the EPA’s climate change website is still intact. But the Trump administration has terminated the content production team behind climate.gov, and the URL started redirecting people to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) website in June. It’s a warning sign that “it is possible that another significant removal of climate change information is currently unfolding as of the writing of this report,” the EDGI report notes.

Scientists raised alarm in July when the Trump administration took down the federal website that houses national climate assessments. The Congressionally-mandated assessments show how climate change affects each region of the US, from threatening ice fishing in the Midwest to raising the risk of window-smashing hail over the Northern Great Plains. During his first term, Trump got flak for releasing the report on a Friday after Thanksgiving — accused of trying to bury it during a holiday weekend. This year, the Trump administration just went ahead and dismissed all the researchers working on the next iteration of the report. Secretary of Energy Chris Wright went so far as to suggest in an interview with CNN this week that the administration would review previously published assessments and “will come out with updated reports on those.”

Wright, who led an oil and gas company before joining Trump’s cabinet, also commissioned climate skeptics to release a misleading report on greenhouse gas emissions last week that rejects scientific consensus on climate change, It comes on the heels of the Trump administration attempting to take away the EPA’s ability to regulate planet-heating pollution by countering the landmark 2009 “endangerment finding” that accurately finds that greenhouse gas emissions endanger public health. Climate change, caused by greenhouse gas emissions, is projected to lead to roughly 250,000 additional deaths each year from malnutrition, malaria, diarrhea and heat illness between 2030 and 2050, according to the World Health Organization.

Neither the Department of Energy nor NOAA immediately responded to inquiries from The Verge. “President Trump was elected with a mandate from the American people to create a more effective and efficient federal government that serves all Americans, and EPA is doing just that,” Brigit Hirsch, EPA Press Secretary, said in an email to The Verge.

Access to as much as 20 percent of the Environmental Protection Agency website was removed throughout Trump’s first term, according to research EDGI published in 2021.

Fortunately, EDGI and other groups have also been working to make data available elsewhere online for the public. The nonprofit Internet Archive’s Wayback Machine can pull up snapshots of what webpages have looked like over the years. Archiving tool Webrecorder also has created mirrors of climate.gov and the US Global Change Research Program website that used to house national climate assessments.

Farmers and environmental groups have also filed suit to force the Trump administration to restore federal resources. Farmers won a legal battle to bring climate content back to US Department of Agriculture webpages. Sierra Club and other groups have sued to bring back EJScreen. In the meantime, a copy of the tool is available from The Public Environmental Data Partners.",https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/chorus/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25531807/STK175_DONALD_TRUMP_CVIRGINIA_A.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&crop=0%2C10.732984293194%2C100%2C78.534031413613&w=1200,N,,2025-08-09 18:08:01.887105

Between us, we run nearly two dozen assembly plants, building cars, trucks, and SUVs spread across key markets worldwide. And we’re both in the top 50 for U.S. patents – a clear sign that innovation drives what we do.

I’m excited to share an update on the progress GM and Hyundai have made since the beginning of our partnership last year. Today, we are announcing that we’re going to co-develop five brand new vehicles. Four of these will serve the Central and South American markets, including a mid-size pickup, as well as compact cars, pickups, and SUVs. And for North America, we’re working on an electric commercial van, a smaller sibling to Chevrolet’s BrightDrop vans.

GM will take the lead on the mid-size truck platform, while Hyundai heads up the platforms for the other new models. Each company will sell these vehicles under their own brands, with unique interior and exterior designs. But no matter the badge, everything we build together will carry the stamp of both GM and Hyundai’s engineering, manufacturing, and innovative spirit.

The first of these vehicles are scheduled to roll out in 2028, and we expect production to reach more than 800,000 vehicles a year.

We are also planning joint sourcing initiatives in North and South America for materials, transport, and logistics, including raw materials, components, and complex systems. We will also explore collaboration on low-carbon emissions steel as part of our commitment to sustainable manufacturing.

So, why work with Hyundai? The answer is clear:

By teaming up, we can reduce costs, streamline manufacturing, and launch new models faster.

Joint sourcing and logistics boost efficiency and deliver savings, with room to scale further across raw materials and complex systems.

Our collaboration expands customer choice in key markets and strengthens our competitive edge.

We’re also exploring future propulsion technologies, including fuel cells.

By joining forces with Hyundai, we can broaden our lineup, while making our R&D, logistics, design, and manufacturing teams even more effective. Put simply: together, we’re more than the sum of our parts.

When GM CEO Mary Barra signed our agreement with Hyundai a year ago, she put it well: “GM and Hyundai have complementary strengths and talented teams. Our goal is to unlock the scale and creativity of both companies to deliver even more competitive vehicles to customers faster and more efficiently.”

We’re off to a fantastic start, and I can’t wait to see where else this collaboration takes us.",https://mitechnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/GMHyndai.jpg,N,,2025-08-09 18:08:07.189464

NBC news reported that many automakers appeared to have absorbed the tariff costs for now. But recent government data showed that retail prices for groceries, furniture and appliances started creeping up in June. GM estimated the tariffs will cost it $4 billion to $5 billion this year, and analysts expect these costs to trickle down to consumers. Foreign governments don’t pay tariffs, American consumers do. Tariffs are a tax on the American people.

Electric vehicle (EV) sales are hitting historic highs as Americans scramble to claim generous federal tax credits before they vanish at the end of September. The credits, worth up to $7,500 for new EVs and $4,000 for used EVs, have been a major driver of adoption in recent years. But new legislation will eliminate them after September 30.

The change comes far earlier than expected. Under the forward-thinking Biden administration’s Inflation Reduction Act, the incentives were set to run through 2032. Their sudden expiration is fueling a last-minute buying surge that analysts say could make the third quarter of 2025 the strongest ever for EV sales.

“People are rushing out,” Stephanie Valdez Streaty, senior analyst at Cox Automotive said to CNBC. “We’re expecting Q3 may be a record for EV sales because of the tax incentives going away.”

Sales Surge Across the Market

The numbers back up that prediction. In July, Americans purchased nearly 130,100 new EVs, the second-highest monthly total on record, trailing only the 136,000 sold last December. That’s a 26.4% jump from June and a nearly 20% increase compared to July 2024.

EV market share also reached a new milestone in July, representing 9.1% of all passenger vehicle sales, the highest monthly share ever recorded in the U.S.

The used EV segment is also booming. Nearly 36,700 used EVs were sold in July, setting a record monthly high. Certain models have been standout performers: the Chevy Equinox EV, Honda Prologue, and Hyundai IONIQ 5 all posted record monthly sales. The Equinox EV alone moved 8,500 units, the highest monthly sales for any non-Tesla EV in U.S. history.

Tesla, meanwhile, has seen sales slow, with two consecutive quarterly declines, down 9% in Q1 and 12% in Q2 year-over-year.

“We’re seeing significant volume in new EVs,” Liz Najman, director of market insights at Recurrent, an EV marketplace and data provider, told CNBC.

Why the Rush to Buy?

Federal tax credits have been central to making EVs financially competitive with gasoline vehicles. In July, the average new EV sold for $55,689, while the average gasoline vehicle came in at $48,078, according to Cox Automotive data. With a $7,500 tax credit applied, an EV buyer’s effective price would be around $48,189, essentially matching the cost of a comparable gas-powered car.

According to CNBC, “The price gap between EVs and gasoline cars no longer exists,” wrote Tom Libby, analyst at S&P Global, in July. Removing the credits, he warned, “jeopardizes” EV price competitiveness.

EVs are the Most Eco-Friendly Transportation

These credits also serve a policy purpose. Transportation is the single largest source of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions, and shifting from gasoline to electric is a key step in cutting climate pollution. EVs, according to MIT research, are “unambiguously better” for the environment than traditional internal combustion vehicles.

Dealers Push Urgency with Incentives

Car dealers are seizing the moment to boost sales before the September 30 cutoff. To entice buyers, dealers have been offering unusually high discounts and incentives. In July, the average new EV purchase came with about $9,800 in additional dealer incentives, roughly 17.5% of the average transaction price. That’s the highest share since October 2017, before EV adoption began to accelerate.

Importantly, the September 30 deadline isn’t just for purchase agreements, buyers must take delivery and drive the car off the lot by that date to qualify.

How Will Loss of the Credit Affect EV Sales?

Analysts expect a steep drop in EV sales during the fourth quarter of 2025 once the credits vanish, as buyers adjust to higher effective prices. However, the used EV market could remain resilient. Most current used EV buyers already don’t qualify for the $4,000 federal incentive, so its expiration won’t affect them as much. With more used EVs hitting the market and new EV prices likely rising, the pre-owned segment may even grow faster in the coming months.

The roughly 9.1% share is the highest percentage dating back to October 2017, which was before the “new era of EV adoption” when monthly sales volume was quite low, Streaty told CNBC.

EV sales are likely to “collapse” in the fourth quarter of 2025, once the tax credit expires and the market adjusts to a new financial reality, Streaty said.

For now, the clock is ticking. Whether you’re eyeing a brand-new model or a used EV bargain, now until September 30 could offer the best deals you’ll see for years.

EVinfo.net’s Take: Now is the Time to Go New or Used EV

If you’ve been considering getting a new or used EV, now is the time, before federal EV tax credits expire and tariffs raise all new and used EV, hybrid and ICE prices.

We disagree with Streaty’s statement that EV sales are likely to “collapse” in the fourth quarter of 2025. We predict that there will be another EV sales growth slowdown after credits are cut, but by no means will it be a “collapse,” but rather just another sales growth slowdown, which we have seen many times before. Not a big deal at all.

I purchased an EV and got into the EV business because of being a lifelong environmentalist. Every major environmental organization worldwide supports EV adoption. The American Lung Association also supports EVs, because of the cleaner air they provide.

However, the significant cost-savings that EVs provide over time is what will move the needle for most new adopters, as the eco-conscious crowd has mostly already adopted. See how much you can save with EV savings calculators at “Electric for All” by Veloz.

When I bought a 2024 used EV recently, I didn’t get the federal credit, as used EVs must be three years old to qualify. However, I did get a $1,000.00 rebate from SDG&E, my utility provider.

Between July heat waves and January cold snaps, sealing a house in the Cleveland area isn’t just good for the planet.","By CALEIGH WELLS

CHAGRIN FALLS, Ohio (AP) — A significant share of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions comes from heating, cooling and powering homes — about 15%, according to one estimate by the Environmental Protection Agency. So if you want to reduce your carbon footprint, the home is an effective place to start.

There are so many factors involved in a household’s energy consumption, including whether you have gas or electric heat and how you use your kitchen appliances, washer and dryer. It’s often overwhelming to figure out where to begin.

That’s why experts recommend a home energy assessment conducted by a professional. The room-by-room examinations help homeowners determine energy use, discover inefficiencies and create a plan to reduce both. In addition to helping the environment, improving efficiency saves money over the long term.

The assessments typically last several hours and cost anywhere from $100 to more than $1,000. Until the end of the year, the Inflation Reduction Act, a major U.S. climate law passed in 2022, helps cover the cost. Congress recently rescinded many of those benefits, which will be phased out.

I’m a climate reporter, so I’ve written about responsible energy use more than a few times. But in May, after years of apartment-dwelling, I moved into the first home I’ve ever owned.

So, I signed up for a home energy assessment.

My home, outside of Cleveland, is more than 100 years old. When I blast the air conditioning, it’s still hot and humid upstairs. I can hear birds chirping outside no matter how hard I shut the windows. And there’s a giant pipe in my basement held together by duct tape and prayers.

My assessment delivered pretty bad news. But with it came with lots of room for improvement. Here’s how the day unfolded:

The HVAC tests

Tim Portman, owner of the HVAC company Portman Mechanical in northeast Ohio, started with an hourlong interview about my goals of having a more comfortable and climate-friendly house. Then he headed into the basement to test my furnace, air conditioner and water heater.

The water heater pressure was normal, so Portman said there was no major risk of a water burst. However, the pressure in both the furnace and air conditioner was too high.

Which reveals my first problem: They are too big for the duct work. That’s inefficient, and it wears on the equipment. Making matters worse, Portman noticed a bunch of unnecessary turns in the ducts.

He equated it to having great water pressure in a kinked garden hose.

“If you don’t get the kink out of that garden hose, you’re never going to have a good experience,” he said.

The highlight of my basement woes was a giant pipe that feeds heating and cooling to the rest of the house. It just … wasn’t connected. It was jammed together like two straws without a junction. It bugged him enough that he paused to fix it.

And who am I to stop him?

The blower door

After the basement, Portman assembled a contraption called a blower door. He jammed a bunch of airtight plastic in my front doorway, shoved a big fan through the middle and turned it on so that it was blowing air out of my house.

“It literally sets up a vacuum in the house. So anywhere where there are leaks, you can see where those leaks are,” he said.

Seconds later, my home got hot and musty as the fan pulled outdoor air through all the leaky seams. Portman guessed the primary culprit immediately. I followed him upstairs into what felt like a sauna near the opening to the attic.

“You literally have hot, humid air — and your attic’s warmer than outside — just pouring into the second floor,” Portman said.

The blower door measures how many cubic feet of air flow through per minute. In a well-sealed house, the number should be less than or equal to the square footage. In my 1,500 square-foot (139-square-meter) house, the blower door number was 4,500. Three times as leaky as it should be.

Portman called it a worst-case scenario.

“It’s like driving your car around with the AC on and the windows rolled down,” he said.

The thermal camera

Next, Portman grabbed a thermal camera. The goal, since it was 80 degrees Fahrenheit (27 degrees Celsius) outside, was to see if leaks would show up as hot spots on the camera.

There were a lot. On the screen, yellow revealed a hot spot. The coolest spaces were dark blue. The leaky door frame around the attic lit up bright yellow.

“Do you think that’s a problem?” Portman joked.

“Oops,” I said.

“Yeah,” he said. “Oops is the right answer.”

There were a few unsurprising finds, including a leaky bathroom fan and gaps around the hundred-year-old windows. Downstairs we also found major gaps in the living room’s exposed beams.

Thermal images proved Portman’s theory that my walls were not insulated. That’s because my house still has some knob and tube wiring, a system of ceramic supports and porcelain-wrapped wires that’s a relic of the early 20th century. Because of how it heats up, only certain insulation can be used with it. It can also be very expensive to remove.

In the basement, the camera revealed major gaps next to pipes and some other just … random holes. They were maybe where wiring used to be, or just hollow spots in the old wooden framing. But the air seepage was strong enough to make the cobwebs flutter frantically, as if reflecting my dread discovering them.

The verdict

After his review, Portman’s first recommendation was to call an electrician about the old wiring.

“Getting knob and tube out of your house opens the door to have insulation in your walls,” he said.

Once that’s addressed, Portman said I need to upgrade my electrical panel to support an eventual switch to a heat pump and an electric water heater, though those appliances don’t fit my budget this year.

One electrician I spoke to by phone guessed it would cost $30,000 to remove the old wiring. But another said as long as he inspects the wiring and doesn’t find any dangerous modifications, I could leave it and replace the panel for roughly $3,000.

I went with the second guy.

Through the end of 2025, federal tax credits will help subsidize weatherization upgrades, including insulation, windows, doors and electrical panels.

In the meantime, my husband and I have a different homework assignment: use a caulk gun and spray foam to plug the holes that we found on the thermal camera.

Between July heat waves and January cold snaps, sealing a house in the Cleveland area isn’t just good for the planet. It’s a good investment.

U.S. production of coal amounted to 512.1 million short tons in 2024, according to preliminary data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA).

Earlier this week, the Trump administration approved a permit to increase coal mining by green-lighting Montana’s Rosebud Mine, which the Department of the Interior says ""enables the recovery of approximately 33.75 million tons of federal coal and extends the mine’s operation through 2039.""

The move represents the fourth time in Trump’s second term that a coal mining permit has been granted or extended, including three new permits and one permit expansion.

Other sites opened up include Hurricane Creek Mining, in Tennessee, a project the administration says could produce up to 1.8 million tons of coal over the next 10 years and create 24 local jobs, and Navajo Transitional Energy Company in Montana, which enables the production of 39.9 million tons of federal coal and creation of 280 full-time jobs.

The two other sites are in Montana in the form of the Spring Creek Mine, which supplies coal to states across the country in addition to Japan and South Korea, and Signal Peak Energy, which had its mining plan modification at the Bull Mountains coal mine approved by DOI in June.

Additionally, the DOI has ended the moratorium on coal leasing and reopened federal lands in states including Montana and Wyoming. In April, President Trump signed a proclamation granting relief from Biden-era coal regulations and signed an executive order backing the coal industry.

In one of the executive orders, the president instructed the National Energy Dominance Council’s head to ""designate coal as a ‘mineral’ under Executive Order 14241,"" a measure Trump signed in March that the White House said at the time would ""boost American mineral production"" and ""streamline permitting.""

Reclassifying coal as a mineral ""opened up the door to speed up the permitting process"" and ""make more federal lands eligible for producing coal,"" according to Price Futures Group senior market analyst and FOX Business contributor Phil Flynn.

""It also opens coal production and usage to a whole wide range of financial incentives, loans and subsidies that can support the production and exporting [of] U.S. coal,"" he told FOX Business. ""This is going to make coal more competitive with other fuel sources and will be a positive, because U.S. production of coal is cleaner than other countries and our use of coal is also cleaner and better for the environment as well.""

The administration is also touting 13 other projects that are currently at various stages in the permitting process including 8 Lease by Applications and 5 Lease Modification Applications.

The administration also says that under former President Biden, no new coal permits were granted and touted the president’s efforts in a statement to Fox News Digital.

A Jeff Bezos-backed startup aims to appeal to American car buyers’ patriotism and pocketbooks.

Slate Auto plans to debut a small electric-powered, American-made pickup for less than $20,000 with federal subsidies. [Note: This Bloomberg article was published before the budget and tax bill became law. The Senate passed it on July 1, the House of Representatives passed it on July 3, and President Donald Trump signed it into law on July 4.] The bare bones, two-seater truck is designed to make a splash in a market where demand for EVs has softened — due in part to high prices that Cox Automotive estimates averaged $59,205 in March, 25% more than a gas vehicle.

The startup, which counts Amazon.com founder Bezos among its key investors, is headquartered in the Detroit suburb of Troy, Michigan, and employs about 400 people, Jeff Jablansky, a company spokesman, said Friday.

Its base model lacks creature comforts like power windows and the battery — which Korean Economic Daily reports is supplied by SK On Co. — has a maximum range of about 240 miles. It will be assembled at a plant in Indiana, the company said, with the first vehicles delivered as soon as late 2026. Kits will be sold separately to modify the truck into a SUV.

“The definition of what’s affordable is broken,” Chris Barman, Slate’s chief executive officer, said at an event late Thursday. “We are building the affordable vehicle that has long been promised but never delivered.”

The low sticker price relies on EV tax incentives President Donald Trump aims to eliminate. Slate Auto’s spokesman said the truck will still be competitive and affordable without such federal support, but he did not specify a price without those incentives.

Multiple Hurricane Helene aid programs in North Carolina are clearing key bureaucratic hurdles, state officials said Friday, as thousands in the mountains await help for their homes and farms nearly one year after the storm.

A new state fund created to reimburse farmers for lost crops has received more than 7,000 applications. And Renew NC, the state’s home building and repair program, is one step closer to funding after a key agreement with federal officials this week.

State lawmakers created the crop reimbursement program as part of a March aid bill. It sets out $300 million to pay farmers for crops that were washed away or destroyed last year. Two-thirds of that money is for Helene-impacted farms, and the rest is for other storms in 2024.

Applications for the program closed in May. The Department of Agriculture received around 7,500 applications total when accounting for incomplete or duplicate ones, assistant commissioner Kaleb Rathbone told the governor’s committee on western recovery.

In the months since, officials have sought to verify all of those applications. Farms will be reimbursed for their losses based on a formula outlined in state law. Payment is expected “mid-summer,” according to the department’s website.

“We can’t send money out for a category until we’ve reviewed and calculated the payments, so that nobody gets left behind,” Rathbone said.

The vast majority of applications — around 6,400 — are for farms affected by storms other than Helene. Of the roughly 1,100 Helene-impacted applicants, 500 of them involve farm infrastructure damage.

Applications remain open through the end of the year, meanwhile, for the state’s primary homebuilding and repair program, Renew NC.

Many home repairs out west have already begun — paid for by a combination of homeowners’ own capital, FEMA’s individual assistance payments and philanthropic groups. But Renew NC will be the state’s biggest effort at restoring damaged homes, primarily for low-income families.

Thus far, only single-family housing is open to applications. The state has received 920 applications so far, said Matt Calabria, director of the governor’s recovery office. Around 350 of those have been deemed eligible and will now move into scheduled inspections.

State officials do not yet have access to the $1.4 billion in federal grant funds that will fuel the program. But they signed an agreement with federal officials this week, Calabria said, a key step toward unlocking the money. Other requirements remain, like environmental reviews, before the money is made available.

“We are on the precipice of a lot of work getting done,” Calabria said.",https://www.agriculture.com/thmb/3NU9dXLpiCHCZFOJqUmVeMcJfrQ=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Ag-extension-helene-651972a208dd4aa4bf81d72f58c59ba3.jpg,N,,2025-08-09 20:10:59.340766

Xiaomi Is More Than A Car Company But there is more to the story.","Apple spent 10 years and $10 billion on Project Titan — the codename for its electric car initiative. In the end, Apple shut down Project Titan with very little to show for its efforts. Xiaomi is a smartphone manufacturer in China that decided to build an electric car. Compared to BYD, which sold 4 million vehicles with plugs last year, Xiaomi is just a blip on the radar screen.

But Jim Farley, the CEO of Ford, brought one of its SU7 sedans to Detroit for 6 months of testing. When it was time to return the car to China, Farley said he didn’t want to part with it. Readers may recall that another SU7 — a prototype known as the SU7 Ultra — set a new lap record for 4-door sedans at the Nurburgring earlier this year, hitting speeds of more than 200 mph on the straights. High praise from Farley, and record setting performance in Germany. Clearly, Xiaomi has built a “compelling electric car,” as Elon Musk begged manufacturers to do a decade ago.

Which raises the question, why did Xiaomi succeed where Apple failed? The New York Times dug into that question earlier this year, and the answer reveals a great deal about what it will take for companies to be successful in the auto manufacturing business in the future and how that business is changing.

The first conclusion that Times reporters Meaghan Tobin and Claire Fu came to was that the “ability to succeed where Apple could not shows how thoroughly China has come to dominate the supply chain for electric vehicles. Chinese companies have mastered electric vehicle manufacturing. By tapping that infrastructure, Xiaomi was able to get components quickly and cheaply.”

Xiaomi & Government Subsidies

Many people complain that Chinese EV manufacturers have benefited from billions of dollars in government support. That level of government assistance has helped them gain control of the supply chain, down to the very minerals inside the batteries of electric cars — car batteries. That in turn has made it possible for BYD and CATL to become the biggest electric battery makers in the world. Those complaints are typified by a comment to the Times story that said, “China has a near slave workforce which are forced to live, sleep and eat in company dormitories 24/7. Their lives revolve around long work shifts and manufacturing output. They have no civil rights under the Chinese government. Their economy isn’t like ours with capitalist freedom. This is why they can dominate any industry they target.”

Such comments are heard frequently when talking about China, but they ignore a couple of important items. First, the US has subsidized many industries by allowing them to avoid the costs of cleaning up the toxic messes they leave in their wake. Such measures are now seen as government overreach. Second, the US invented lithium-ion battery technology, solar panel technology, and computer chip technology via government subsidies, but never followed up on them, preferring to allow others to capitalize on those early breakthroughs. To complain now that others have taken that ball and run with it while the US was mesmerized by horizontal drilling techniques and fracking the Earth to a faretheewell is disingenuous at best.

Third, the US is pretty good at using government to promote new industries when it wants to. The proof is in the $90 billion this failed administration has promised to tech billionaires so they can dominate artificial intelligence. But doing so will require something the US has chosen to de-emphasize — education. As another Times commenter put it, “The supply chain is a long chain of human ingenuity and relations. It is not a mechanical robot who produces [cars]. The US does not have the educated and motivated laborers to do this kind of job, quickly on a large scale.”

Our national preference for ignorance will do more to hobble the US economy in the future than any supposed assistance the Chinese government gives to its domestic manufacturers. In fact, China operates on a much more rigorous form of capitalism than the US ever thought about. It does not bail out those who fail; they simply go out of business. It doesn’t get any more efficient in the allocation of capital than that, though the results can have brutal consequences for those who fail.

Xiaomi Is More Than A Car Company

But there is more to the story. Xiaomi is not primarily a car company. It makes a number of electronic devices, from robot vacuum cleaners to air conditioners. All of them, including the SU7, share the Xiaomi operating system and are controlled by the company’s app. “The SU7 is, in some ways, just another gadget. It can use data collected from other devices about a driver’s daily routine to determine the best time to charge the car’s batteries,” the Times reports. “Xiaomi has really started infiltrating your home,” said Gary Ng, an economist with Natixis Corporate & Investment Banking. “Everything is linked together, and this is something other companies couldn’t do.”

Xiaomi’s experience gained in the manufacture of many consumer products has allowed it to surpass many traditional automakers in China. It makes it possible for the company to bring new models to market quickly and focus on making software that they can continually update, said Stephen W. Dyer, head of Asia Automotive at AlixPartners, a consultancy.

Intense competition at home has pushed many Chinese carmakers to explore export markets in order to absorb some of their excess production. It is just a matter of time before Xiaomi begins to sell its cars outside of China, said Cui Dongshu, secretary general of the China Passenger Car Association.

Xiaomi’s popularity as a maker of all kinds of consumer electronics gave it a deep well of knowledge about Chinese consumer preferences. On the first day SU7s were delivered, buyers could go to Xiaomi’s app store and get accessories to personalize their cars — things like analog clocks for their dashboards or a row of physical switches that attach to a touchscreen panel. “The strength of the brand puts Xiaomi ahead of a lot of their competitors,” said Tu Le, a managing director of the consultancy Sino Auto Insights. “That’s what it takes to sell cars globally, because it’s not just a consumer product, it’s an emotional product.”

For any sales professionals, that last thought is telling. People buy on emotion and justify their decision later with facts. A company that understands that first principal of sales has a big head start on the competition. Xiaomi found a way to make that connection; Apple did not. And thereby hangs a tale.",https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/2024-10-Xiaomi-SU7-Ultra-crop.jpg,N,,2025-08-09 16:02:51.528223

It’s not clear that any state has a solution and the actual effect of data centers on electricity bills is difficult to pin down. Some critics question whether states have the spine to take a hard line against tech behemoths like Microsoft, Google, Amazon and Meta.

But more than a dozen states have begun taking steps as data centers drive a rapid build-out of power plants and transmission lines.

That has meant pressuring the nation’s biggest power grid operator to clamp down on price increases, studying the effect of data centers on electricity bills or pushing data center owners to pay a larger share of local transmission costs.

Rising power bills are “something legislators have been hearing a lot about. It’s something we’ve been hearing a lot about. More people are speaking out at the public utility commission in the past year than I’ve ever seen before,” said Charlotte Shuff of the Oregon Citizens’ Utility Board, a consumer advocacy group. “There’s a massive outcry.”

Not the typical electric customer

Some data centers could require more electricity than cities the size of Pittsburgh, Cleveland or New Orleans, and make huge factories look tiny by comparison. That’s pushing policymakers to rethink a system that, historically, has spread transmission costs among classes of consumers that are proportional to electricity use.

“A lot of this infrastructure, billions of dollars of it, is being built just for a few customers and a few facilities and these happen to be the wealthiest companies in the world,” said Ari Peskoe, who directs the Electricity Law Initiative at Harvard University. “I think some of the fundamental assumptions behind all this just kind of breaks down.”

A fix, Peskoe said, is a “can of worms” that pits ratepayer classes against one another.

Some officials downplay the role of data centers in pushing up electric bills.

Tricia Pridemore, who sits on Georgia’s Public Service Commission and is president of the National Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners, pointed to an already tightened electricity supply and increasing costs for power lines, utility poles, transformers and generators as utilities replace aging equipment or harden it against extreme weather.

The data centers needed to accommodate the artificial intelligence boom are still in the regulatory planning stages, Pridemore said, and the Data Center Coalition, which represents Big Tech firms and data center developers, has said its members are committed to paying their fair share.

But growing evidence suggests that the electricity bills of some Americans are rising to subsidize the massive energy needs of Big Tech as the U.S. competes in a race against China for artificial intelligence superiority.

Data and analytics firm Wood Mackenzie published a report in recent weeks that suggested 20 proposed or effective specialized rates for data centers in 16 states it studied aren’t nearly enough to cover the cost of a new natural gas power plant.

In other words, unless utilities negotiate higher specialized rates, other ratepayer classes — residential, commercial and industrial — are likely paying for data center power needs.

Meanwhile, Monitoring Analytics, the independent market watchdog for the mid-Atlantic grid, produced research in June showing that 70% — or $9.3 billion — of last year’s increased electricity cost was the result of data center demand.

States are responding

Last year, five governors led by Pennsylvania’s Josh Shapiro began pushing back against power prices set by the mid-Atlantic grid operator, PJM Interconnection, after that amount spiked nearly sevenfold. They warned of customers “paying billions more than is necessary.”

PJM has yet to propose ways to guarantee that data centers pay their freight, but Monitoring Analytics is floating the idea that data centers should be required to procure their own power.

In a filing last month, it said that would avoid a “massive wealth transfer” from average people to tech companies.

At least a dozen states are eyeing ways to make data centers pay higher local transmission costs.

In Oregon, a data center hot spot, lawmakers passed legislation in June ordering state utility regulators to develop new — presumably higher — power rates for data centers.

The Oregon Citizens’ Utility Board says there is clear evidence that costs to serve data centers are being spread across all customers — at a time when some electric bills there are up 50% over the past four years and utilities are disconnecting more people than ever.

New Jersey’s governor signed legislation last month commissioning state utility regulators to study whether ratepayers are being hit with “unreasonable rate increases” to connect data centers and to develop a specialized rate to charge data centers.

In some other states, like Texas and Utah, governors and lawmakers are trying to avoid a supply-and-demand crisis that leaves ratepayers on the hook — or in the dark.

Doubts about states protecting ratepayers

In Indiana, state utility regulators approved a settlement between Indiana Michigan Power Co., Amazon, Google, Microsoft and consumer advocates that set parameters for data center payments for service.

Kerwin Olsen, of the Citizens Action Council of Indiana, a consumer advocacy group, signed the settlement and called it a “pretty good deal” that contained more consumer protections than what state lawmakers passed.

But, he said, state law doesn’t force large power users like data centers to publicly reveal their electric usage, so pinning down whether they’re paying their fair share of transmission costs “will be a challenge.”

In a March report, the Environmental and Energy Law Program at Harvard University questioned the motivation of utilities and regulators to shield ratepayers from footing the cost of electricity for data centers.

Both utilities and states have incentives to attract big customers like data centers, it said.

To do it, utilities — which must get their rates approved by regulators — can offer “special deals to favored customers” like a data center and effectively shift the costs of those discounts to regular ratepayers, the authors wrote. Many state laws can shield disclosure of those rates, they said.

In Pennsylvania, an emerging data center hot spot, the state utility commission is drafting a model rate structure for utilities to consider adopting. An overarching goal is to get data center developers to put their money where their mouth is.

“We’re talking about real transmission upgrades, potentially hundreds of millions of dollars,” commission chairman Stephen DeFrank said. “And that’s what you don’t want the ratepayer to get stuck paying for.”",https://www.wishtv.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/09/As-electric-bills-rise-evidence-mounts-that-data-centers-share-blame.-States-feel-pressure-to-act-scaled-e1754765270582.jpg,N,,2025-08-09 16:04:18.414432

At the same time, they used their power to shutter energy plants, like Dunkirk NRG.
The result, is that New York was left with an aging, shrinking power supply and no realistic plan to meet growing demand.
According to NYISO’s 2025 Power Trends Report, New York is losing generating capacity and still relying on plants built during the Carter and Reagan years.
While our state government promotes and subsidizes renewable energy our energy supply is becoming more compromised.","On June 24, New York came frighteningly close to a blackout. A brutal heatwave forced air conditioners into overdrive, and the New York Independent System Operator (NYISO) declared an “Energy Warning.” That’s not a minor notice, it means our grid reserves were so low that officials were preparing for the possibility of cutting power to homes and businesses to avoid a total collapse. This is yet another wake-up call.

As Zilvinas Silenas of the Empire Center recently warned in A Warning for New York’s Energy Policy, our state’s power grid is under mounting strain because Albany leaders continue to put political ideology ahead of practical reality. His assessment of the looming energy crisis could not be more timely, or more accurate. For five years, the Governor, and our State Legislature, have pursued energy policies that put political ideology ahead of practical reality. In 2019, they made the Climate Leadership and Community Protection Act (CLCPA) a focal point, which promised a green-energy utopia. At the same time, they used their power to shutter energy plants, like Dunkirk NRG. The result, is that New York was left with an aging, shrinking power supply and no realistic plan to meet growing demand.

According to NYISO’s 2025 Power Trends Report, New York is losing generating capacity and still relying on plants built during the Carter and Reagan years. While our state government promotes and subsidizes renewable energy our energy supply is becoming more compromised. Wind and Solar combined provide less than 6 percent of our electricity.

New York’s energy price fixing scheme is expensive and irresponsible, but it is also increasingly intolerable. As our government imposes mandates for electric cars, buses, trucks and home heating, while knowing full well our grid can’t handle the load. They’ve driven away investment in reliable gas and oil plants, suffocated projects with red tape, and left families footing the bill for skyrocketing energy costs. This isn’t leadership. It’s negligence. And it’s dangerous.

If our Governor and State Legislature had been honest, they would have admitted years ago that New York simply doesn’t have the electricity supply to meet their radical mandates. Instead, they’ve gambled with our economy, our wallets and our safety, and June 24 showed just how close that gamble came to failure. It doesn’t have to be this way.

We should hit pause on the push for total electrification until we have the power to support it. We should invest in common-sense energy efficiency, like weatherizing homes to cut bills and reduce demand. We should modernize our existing plants with cleaner, more efficient technology instead of letting 50-year-old generators limp along until they break. And we must embrace every available source of reliable energy, including nuclear, natural gas and next- generation technologies, without Albany’s endless bureaucratic roadblocks.

Albany Democrats have had six years to get this right. The warning lights are flashing. If we don’t change course now, the next time the grid falters, it may not just be a warning, it may be the lights going out.

PLI Scheme Spurs Growth in Integrated Solar Manufacturing

As of June 30, 2025, data from manufacturers and the Approved List of Models and Manufacturers (ALMM) shows the PLI scheme has helped establish:

*18.5 GW of solar module capacity

*9.7 GW of solar cell capacity

*2.2 GW of ingot-wafer capacity

This reflects a significant step toward building an end-to-end solar PV manufacturing ecosystem in the country.

Phased Implementation Underway

The minister noted that timelines for operationalising awarded capacities depend on several factors, including land acquisition, financial closure, equipment procurement, and installation timelines.

Leading Companies Driving First and Second Tranches

Under the first tranche of the PLI scheme, Letters of Award have been issued to:

*Shirdi Sai Electricals

*Reliance Industries

*Adani New Industries

Together, they are developing 8.737 GW of fully integrated solar PV module manufacturing units. In the second tranche, 11 successful bidders have secured approvals to establish 39.6 GW of fully or partially integrated solar PV manufacturing facilities across India.

National Capacity Expands, Eyes 42 GW by 2026

India’s total installed solar cell manufacturing capacity currently stands at 26.35 GW, with plans to expand this to approximately 42 GW by June 1, 2026, the MNRE confirmed. This aggressive scale-up supports India’s broader clean energy transition and aims to make the country a global manufacturing hub for solar technologies.

Reducing Import Dependence

The PLI scheme has already started to reduce India’s reliance on imported solar modules. According to Commerce Ministry data, India’s solar module imports declined from USD 3.36 billion in FY2022 to USD 2.15 billion in FY2025—a clear indicator of rising domestic capability.

Policy Measures Backing Local Manufacturing

To further support Indian manufacturers, the government has taken several decisive steps. Mandated use of domestically manufactured modules for schemes such as:

*CPSU Scheme Phase-II

*PM-KUSUM Components B & C

*PM Surya Ghar: Muft Bijli Yojana

*Imposed Basic Customs Duty (BCD) on imported solar PV cells and modules

*Exempted customs duties on select inputs used by domestic solar manufacturers",https://chemindigest.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/PLI-Scheme-Powers-Solar-Manufacturing-to-18.6-GW-Capacity.jpg,N,,2025-08-09 20:08:08.630971

Gas demand is beginning to boom thanks to the electricity feeding frenzy from data centers, skyrocketing liquefied natural gas (LNG) exports, and the ongoing retirements of aging coal plants being replaced by relatively cleaner-burning gas.
“Now we’re talking about power and data centers and LNG essentially doubling over the next few years.
For instance, since mid-June, natural gas prices and stock values have slumped a bit because of milder weather and rising gas storage levels.
“It’s a pretty exciting time for natural gas,” said Expand CEO Nick Dell’Osso in the second-quarter earnings call.","Natural gas has always been the overlooked little brother to crude oil that drives the fossil fuel industry dating back to the famed Drake Well in 1859 in Pennsylvania, which launched the U.S. oil and gas industry.

The dynamics have changed now—especially in the heart of the gassy Marcellus Shale in Pennsylvania. Gas demand is beginning to boom thanks to the electricity feeding frenzy from data centers, skyrocketing liquefied natural gas (LNG) exports, and the ongoing retirements of aging coal plants being replaced by relatively cleaner-burning gas.

Many of the nation’s top gas producers, including Expand Energy, EQT, Range Resources, and Antero Resources, all have major Appalachian footprints and market cap values that have spiked by 25% to 75% the past 12 months.

Meanwhile, crude oil-weighted stocks are almost all down, mired in a prolonged slump of middling pricing, weaker demand growth, and surging OPEC production hikes.

“With the resource-rich potential in this [Marcellus] basin and the growing demand component for AI and data centers and power, it really is setting us up well to help shape this AI revolution that’s going to take place here in the United States,” Range Resources CEO and President Dennis Degner told Fortune.

A decade ago, the gas industry’s fortunes focused on seasonality and how cold each winter would prove, Degner said. “Now we’re talking about power and data centers and LNG essentially doubling over the next few years. Those are all big, diverse demand components that really get us excited about the durability of our business model.”

The Appalachian region—primarily the Marcellus and Utica shale plays in Pennsylvania, West Virginia, and Ohio—produces just over one-third of the nation’s gas—and very little oil—with proximity to Virginia’s growing Data Center Alley and, now, more AI infrastructure expected within Appalachia.

After a couple of decades during which U.S. power demand remained relatively stagnant, domestic electricity consumption is expected to surge by 25% from 2023 to 2035 and roughly 60% from 2023 to 2050, driven largely by AI and data centers, according to the International Energy Agency.

Likewise, record-high LNG exports will roughly double by 2030. Based on new construction underway or greenlit along the U.S. Gulf Coast, LNG exports are expected to rise from 15 billion cubic feet per day in 2024 to at least 30 billion daily by the end of 2030.

“It’s really night and day when you look at the gas names versus the oil names,” said Gabriele Sorbara, energy analyst at Siebert Williams Shank & Co. “The fundamentals for gas are very strong. You’re going to have massive tailwinds.”

Appalachia’s tech boom

Antero chairman and CEO Paul Rady said in his earnings statement that the industry now expects natural gas demand to soar 25% by 2030, led by LNG growth and then by data center power thirst.

That’s an astonishing jump for a U.S. sector that pumps out 107 billion cubic feet of gas per day—already double the amount since the nation’s shale gas boom kicked off 20 years ago.

The top gas producers are all exceeding their production estimates this year with goals to continue ramping up for at least the next two or three years. But they’re doing it without huge spending hikes because of the operational efficiencies gained through drilling and completing wells.

Range Resources, for instance, aims to grow its production 20% by the end of 2027. But Range is doing it while only operating two drilling rigs. For comparison, Big Oil giant and leading Permian Basin producer Exxon Mobil has at least 35 rigs operating in the huge West Texas oil basin.

“These [Marcellus] wells are just massive,” Sorbara said.

Instead, the question marks focus on the exact extent of demand growth, the timing, and the gas pricing, making gas players relatively conservative when it comes to ramping up production, building new pipelines, and inking fixed-pricing deals with data center developers.

For instance, since mid-June, natural gas prices and stock values have slumped a bit because of milder weather and rising gas storage levels. But that’s not slowing the bullishness.

Range sends about half of its Pennsylvania gas toward the U.S. Gulf Coast and LNG exports but, because of pipeline constraints, additional growth is almost all coming from regional data center demand.

In July, Trump touted $92 billion in energy and AI investments in Pennsylvania from hyperscalers, power generators and more. Range, for instance, has a new partnership with Imperial Land industrial park developer in Pennsylvania to fuel new gas-fired power generation for data centers.

Pennsylvania’s Homer City complex will soon become the nation’s largest gas-fired power plant. The massive 1.9 coal plant east of Pittsburgh is being converted to natural gas with up to 4.5 gigawatts of power capacity to serve a sprawling data center campus.

The largest Marcellus gas producer, EQT, recently inked deals to provide gas to Homer City and to Pennsylvania’s planned Shippingport Power Station, also being converted from coal. And EQT is providing pipelines services to fuel planned gas plants in West Virginia in the heart of coal country.

“The cluster effect of these AI data centers and these ecosystems will only continue to build on themselves,” EQT CEO Toby Rice said in his earnings call. “As momentum grows in our operational footprint, we think the opportunity could get larger.

“One of the reasons why people are selecting this region to build their data centers is because they’re building on top of a lot of gas infrastructure,” he added.

There may be a current bottleneck on gas turbines for building power plants, but manufacturing is ramping up and most of the hyperscalers’ projects are a few years from coming online.

The nation’s top natural gas producer is little-known Expand Energy because it was formed just 10 months ago through the combination of Chesapeake Energy and Southwestern Energy. Expand has huge presences in both Appalachia and northern Louisiana’s gassy Haynesville Shale near the LNG hubs.

“It’s a pretty exciting time for natural gas,” said Expand CEO Nick Dell’Osso in the second-quarter earnings call. “You have people recognizing the value that gas plays in the economy, the efficiency that gas creates for the growth in power demand, which is all tied to our growing economy fueled by the innovation associated with AI.”

The gas players are increasingly confident they’re not going to boom and bust. The Marcellus has ample reserves for decades so long as they don’t overproduce.

“We can do this for decades to come, and now you’re talking about a [data center] demand component that’s coming that’s heavily dependent on reliability, repeatability, and the [gas] inventory,” Range’s Degner told Fortune. Of course, Range thrives on all three, he emphasized.

By 2023, natural gas and coal exports exceeded the region’s imports, with export values reaching 29 million tonnes of natural gas equivalent and 146 million tonnes of coal equivalent, respectively.
The region ranks among the top global liquefied natural gas exporters, shipping to China, Japan and South Korea.
For fossil fuel companies and lenders to the fossil fuel industry, retiring those assets early would require them to forego cash flows.
ASEAN leaders must increase the share of green energy in the ASEAN Power Grid initiative.","As Southeast Asian countries undertake their 2025 Nationally Determined Contribution climate action plans, the region stands at a pivotal moment. The question is whether ASEAN leaders will seize this opportunity to accelerate renewable energy deployment or whether they will reinforce their reliance on fossil fuels.

The global energy landscape is experiencing a seismic shift. Since 2021, electricity generation from coal and gas has remained stagnant, while solar power generation has grown significantly, signalling a decisive move towards clean electricity as ageing fossil fuel plants phase out. At the heart of this transformation is China’s manufacturing dominance in solar panels, wind turbines, electric vehicles and batteries, positioning the nation as a central force in the global green energy supply chain.

But Southeast Asia has relied heavily on fossil fuels to power its development. Only 15.6 per cent of ASEAN’s total primary energy supply was renewable energy in 2022. For a more balanced perspective, it is worth noting that in ASEAN, the cost of electricity from hydro, solar and geothermal is becoming cheaper than bioenergy and coal, reflecting a growing momentum in the power sector. In the region, solar power capacity increased from 11 gigawatts in 2019 to 26 gigawatts in 2023. But coal remained dominant in the region’s energy mix, accounting for 30.5 per cent and natural gas — often cited as a ‘transition’ fuel — contributed 19.7 per cent.

Despite early calls for a phase-down, baseline scenario projections forecast that coal and natural gas will remain substantial components of ASEAN’s energy mix up until 2050 — though the region can expect advancements in renewable energy technologies, declining costs and growing renewable energy investments.

Southeast Asia is emerging as a significant exporter of liquefied natural gas and coal. By 2023, natural gas and coal exports exceeded the region’s imports, with export values reaching 29 million tonnes of natural gas equivalent and 146 million tonnes of coal equivalent, respectively. The region ranks among the top global liquefied natural gas exporters, shipping to China, Japan and South Korea.

But while ASEAN is projected to become a net importer of natural gas by 2027, coal exports are anticipated to continue until at least 2050, though their balance will likely decline.

ASEAN governments are caught between safeguarding the revenues they raise from coal and gas exports — and preparing for when those markets dry up or become costly imports — and reaching for a cleaner, more secure future.

Yet the human and environmental costs of continued fossil fuel reliance grow harder to ignore. Cities like Jakarta and Bangkok wake up under haze while farmers in the Mekong Delta watch fisheries collapse as river ecosystems experience both drought and flood. Without targeted and systematic decarbonisation efforts, climate events are expected to increase in frequency and severity.

But change is not easy. For fossil fuel companies and lenders to the fossil fuel industry, retiring those assets early would require them to forego cash flows.

Renewable energy investment in ASEAN is influenced by factors including costs, environmental awareness, social norms, energy consumption habits and the attribution of responsibility for environmental outcomes.

Yet, there is reason for cautious optimism. Sun and wind resources are abundant in Southeast Asia and solar panel and wind turbine costs continue to fall. Ambitious targets already exist — ASEAN aims to lift renewable capacity to 35 per cent in installed power capacity by 2025, a goal that would require a 15 per cent jump from the region’s post-Paris baseline. If ASEAN governments hold firm on policies like competitive auctions, feed-in tariffs and streamlined permitting, they could unleash a wave of investment in renewables.

On the finance side, new partnerships are taking shape. Blended finance models — mixing concessional loans from development banks with private capital — can lower risks for early renewable projects. Indonesia and Vietnam are adopting Just Energy Transition Partnership financing packages despite the United States’ withdrawal from these agreements leading to a reduction in funding. With well-structured deals, coal sector workers can access retraining programs and social support, while stranded asset funds buy out plants and channel resources into green industries.

But a truly regional approach could be most potent. ASEAN leaders must increase the share of green energy in the ASEAN Power Grid initiative. By harmonising regulations and sharing research and development on battery storage between member states’ business sectors, ASEAN countries can smooth variable output and cut costs for everyone. Joint procurement of panels, turbines and pumped hydro could deliver bulk discounts — just as the European Union does in various sectors. Operationalising Article 6 of the Paris Agreement by establishing a regional carbon market mechanism would enable member states to mobilise climate finance.

As countries sharpen their climate pledges in the run-up to COP30 in Belem, they should enshrine precise coal phase-out dates, stop developing new coal power plants and establish firm renewable energy ratio targets. Stronger Nationally Determined Contributions would not only signal global ambition but unlock new pools of multilateral funding and spur domestic reforms that would boost investor confidence.

Southeast Asian leaders’ decisions will determine whether the region can break free from the chains of fossil fuel dependency and join the global renewable energy movement to achieve the ASEAN 2045 Vision.

Kwatra also said that he held a discussion with Graham on increasing energy trade with Washington.

“Spoke to Senator @LindseyGrahamSC and shared with him the Indian perspective on our energy security, including increasing energy trade with the United States,"" the Indian envoy said in a post on X.

It is noteworthy that Graham was one of the Senators who had issued warnings to countries doing business with Russia that US President Donald Trump would impose massive tariffs on their goods.

In an interview with Fox News, the US senator had said, “Trump is going to impose tariffs on people that buy Russian oil—China, India, and Brazil,"" arguing that the countries were helping fund the war in Ukraine as they accounted for around 80 per cent of Russia’s crude exports.

“If you keep buying cheap Russian oil to allow this war to continue, we will tariff the hell out of you. And we’re going to crush your economy, because what you are doing is blood money,"" he added.

His warning had come weeks before Trump’s 25% reciprocal tariff announcement for India. The US President intensified his tirade against New Delhi later, with an additional 25% tariff announcement for buying Russian oil. While the reciprocal tariffs have come into force, the additional duties will take effect starting August 27.

Meanwhile, India has defended its energy strategy, saying that its crude oil purchases from Russia are “a necessity compelled by global market conditions"" and not a political endorsement of Moscow.

CARMEL — Indiana electric cooperative lineworkers are traveling to Guatemala today to re-energize approximately 670 homes in seven villages in Central Guatemala as part of an international initiative to bring electricity to developing areas in Guatemala.

“Project Indiana: Empowering Global Communities for a Better Tomorrow” will bring electricity to a part of the Central American country where it has been out of service for nearly two years.

The crew will spend August 8 through 17 inspecting and repairing the electric distribution system that provides electricity to the homes served by the Coopersa cooperative in Guatemala. This region’s power is produced by a hydro generator that was built approximately 20 to 25 years ago and has been inoperable for approximately two years.

Over the last year, Project Indiana has worked with the cooperative and a local business with industry expertise to pinpoint the problem, identify funding sources, order the necessary parts and facilitate the repair.

The electric distribution system in one of the seven villages served by this cooperative — Sepamac — was first built in 2015 by a crew of Indiana electric cooperative lineworkers.

The project crew is composed of:

Jamie Bell, NineStar Connect.

Ethan DeWitt, Northeastern REMC.

Clint Heeke, Southern Indiana Power.

Cody Campbell, South Central Indiana REMC.

This is Indiana electric cooperatives’ seventh trip to Guatemala. In August 2012, 28 Hoosier lineworkers from 17 of Indiana’s electric cooperatives spent four weeks working across the mountainous terrain to bring electricity to 184 homes, a church and a school in three villages.

In April 2015, 14 lineworkers battled extreme heat and the rugged land to bring electricity to 164 homes, a school and a church. In 2017, 14 lineworkers endured extreme temperatures to power 68 homes, a school, a church and a health clinic.

In 2019, 14 lineworkers brought electricity to nearly 90 homes, two churches, and a school and ensured that every home they wired for electricity had a properly vented wood-burning cooking stove installed to replace the open fires villagers have used for years. In 2023, 14 lineworkers brought electricity to 26 homes and a school.

And, on the last trip this year, 16 lineworkers brought electricity to 197 homes, one restaurant and one store.",https://www.inkfreenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Project-Indiana-Team-2025.jpg,N,,2025-08-09 15:04:57.051863

Because clean energy projects are being deployed worldwide, costs are plummeting, helping drive further growth and adoption.
China leads the world in solar power and generation, with more than 830 terawatt-hours of electricity produced in 2024, per Ember Energy.
António Guterres, the U.N. secretary-general, stressed the urgency for tech giants to switch to clean energy to power their operations by 2030.
The sun is rising on a clean energy age,"" Guterres said at a recent conference.","Dirty fuels could be on their way out sooner than we think. As the cost of renewable technologies continues to drop, the United Nations secretary-general believes a society powered by sustainable energy is on the horizon.

As The Guardian reported, a recent analysis by the International Renewable Energy Agency found that over 90% of renewable energy projects are more cost-effective than their fossil fuel counterparts. In 2024, renewables helped avoid nearly $470 billion in dirty fuel costs, signifying their capacity to promote a cleaner, safer world and boost energy security.

Because clean energy projects are being deployed worldwide, costs are plummeting, helping drive further growth and adoption. China leads the world in solar power and generation, with more than 830 terawatt-hours of electricity produced in 2024, per Ember Energy. It also dominates the market for solar panel manufacturing and exports, supplying a large portion of the world's solar panels.

All this growth is spurring large investments in clean energy, with The Guardian reporting that investors contributed a staggering $2 trillion last year, representing a 70% increase over the last 10 years.

At the same time, energy demands are soaring in part because people are using more air conditioning as the climate warms and because of the tremendous growth of data centers to power artificial intelligence and cryptocurrency. António Guterres, the U.N. secretary-general, stressed the urgency for tech giants to switch to clean energy to power their operations by 2030.

Meanwhile, billions of dollars in subsidies are still given to fossil fuel giants, but Guterres is optimistic that society will wean itself off polluting fuels sooner rather than later as renewables become more cost-competitive. Along with being better for the economy, clean energy is a major win for the public, as it leads to improved health as well as job creation and investment opportunities for individuals and firms alike.

According to the Department of Energy, the global market for renewable energies is expected to be worth around $23 trillion by 2030, which translates to ""millions of well-paying, stable jobs, creating a reliable, lower-cost domestic supply chain, and supporting opportunities in communities across the country.""

Fossil fuel stocks have been underperforming for at least a decade, according to the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis, and while green energy stocks are volatile because of interest rate fluctuations and changes in government policies, the long-term outlook for renewable energy remains positive.

""We are on the cusp of a new era. Fossil fuels are running out of road. The sun is rising on a clean energy age,"" Guterres said at a recent conference.

Bill Hare, founder and CEO of Climate Analytics, a global climate science and policy institute, added, ""Any investment in new fossil fuels now is a fool's gamble, while joining the race to renewables can only bring benefits — not just jobs and cheaper energy at stable prices, but energy independence and access where it's needed most.""",https://www.thecooldown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/renewable-energyimage-rec6nPEaDtrmvTTwg.jpg,N,,2025-08-09 14:05:52.322818

For two years in a row, PJM’s process for ensuring the grid has sufficient power plant capacity has resulted in record high prices, which will get passed on to consumers. The results are tied to rising electricity demand for data centers and a bottleneck in approving grid connections for new projects.

Almost everything about these events is bound up in layers of complexity.

To explain what’s happening, my colleague Rambo Talabong put together some charts and I spoke with energy policy experts. Together, we aim to make this situation understandable.

PJM, based in Valley Forge, Pennsylvania, oversees the grid and electricity markets in a territory that stretches from New Jersey to Chicago. The organization has roots in a 1920s partnership between utilities in Pennsylvania and New Jersey.

“It’s a bunch of utilities who have come together and said, ‘We can provide more reliable, less expensive electric service to customers if we work together and have a mutual aid pact,'” said Abe Silverman, an energy research scholar at Johns Hopkins University who has a background working in utility regulation and the energy industry. “When a customer in New Jersey can buy power from a power plant in New Jersey, or a power plant in Pennsylvania or a power plant in Ohio, it’s going to be cheaper than if they were just buying from power plants from New Jersey.”

One of the ways PJM manages its system is by holding an auction in which power plant owners compete to see who will offer the lowest prices to be available to the grid at all times.

The result is a “capacity price,” which is the price set to ensure that there are enough resources to meet the region’s needs on the hottest days of summer. The price sets the level of payments to participating power plants, which is an important income source for them in addition to what they make from selling electricity.

Last year, the auction produced a result so unusual that this topic, usually reserved for the business press, became general news. The new price, which took effect two months ago, was $269.92 per megawatt-day, an increase from $28.92 per megawatt-day in the previous delivery year.

The most recent auction was last month, yielding an even higher price, $329.17 per megawatt-day. This price will take effect next June.

Since a megawatt-day (which is 24 megawatt-hours) is a unit that most people don’t use or understand, it’s easier to put these results in terms of how many billions of dollars power plant owners stand to receive in aggregate. The change from two years ago is dizzying, going from a low of $2.2 billion to the most recent result of $16.1 billion.

Governors across PJM territory have voiced their displeasure. Maryland Gov. Wes Moore, a Democrat, said, “What PJM has laid out is a slap in the face.”

Why did costs go up so much? There are many reasons, but the main one is that electricity demand is soaring, largely due to the development of data centers. The upward curve in PJM’s long-term forecast is in contrast to the prior decade-plus of flat growth.

“Supply and demand,” said Daniel Lockwood, a PJM spokesman, when asked about the reasons for rising costs. “Unprecedented and continuing growth in demand from the proliferation of high-demand data centers in the region.”

Silverman from Johns Hopkins agreed that this is, by far, the leading factor.

When demand is flat, old and inefficient power plants often struggle to compete, leading plant owners to close the plants that are losing money or barely profitable. Since 2000, PJM has seen a shift as coal-fired power plants reached the end of their lives and were replaced by natural gas plants and some renewables.

The retirement of old coal plants was good for the environment, but the rapid loss of those plants has helped to intensify the supply crunch that’s now happening.

But plant retirements are only part of the picture.

One of the reasons PJM is struggling to secure enough power plant capacity is the organization’s challenges in connecting new plants to the grid.

PJM has an online queue in which owners of prospective power plants get in line to gain approval to hook up to interstate power lines. Ideally, this would be a fast process, but the queue has turned into a quagmire of long waits, meaning the grid isn’t getting some of the new power plants that would otherwise be ready.

Most of the affected projects are solar arrays, the results of a solar boom across much of PJM territory.

Some caveats: Some of the projects in the queue are highly speculative and unlikely to get built, so the numbers can be misleading. Also, some projects are held back by more than just PJM, with challenges getting local permits and other factors.

As of June, there were 63 gigawatts of projects waiting in PJM’s interconnection process that should be completed by the end of 2026, according to Lockwood, the PJM spokesman. He noted that there are 46 gigawatts of projects that have agreements to plug into the grid today, but some aren’t being built because of factors beyond PJM’s control, such as siting, permitting and financing.

Clean energy and consumer advocates have said PJM often acts as an obstacle to reducing dependence on fossil fuels.

“The power grid operator’s policy decisions too often favor outdated, expensive power plants and needlessly block low-cost clean energy resources and battery projects from connecting to the grid and bringing down prices,” said Sarah Moskowitz, executive director of the Citizens Utility Board of Illinois, in a statement. “This extended price spike was preventable.”

So, how much is a household’s electricity bill rising because of all this?

I asked several of the largest utilities in PJM for specifics. Their answers had wide variations, which helps to show differences in rate structures, state regulations and other factors that affect how and when the PJM charges reach consumers.

PSEG, the largest utility in New Jersey, notified customers in February of an impending 17 percent rate increase that was largely due to the rise in PJM charges. As of June, a household using 650 kilowatt-hours per month now paid $183, which was $27 more than before.

ComEd, which serves the Chicago area, has increased its residential bills by roughly 10 percent because of the surge in PJM charges that took effect in June. A typical household, which uses 609 kilowatt-hours per month, is paying $117, which is $11 more than before.

Dominion, which is the largest utility in Virginia and also has PJM customers in North Carolina, said its customers were largely insulated from PJM costs because the company gets most of its electricity from power plants that it owns. This is different from most large utilities in PJM, which do not directly own power plants and use market-based systems to obtain electricity for customers.

The total monthly cost for PJM capacity, even after the increase, would be less than $2 per month, according to a Dominion spokesman.

Just like PJM’s capacity prices have gone up, they can come back down. But for that to happen, some of the market fundamentals will need to change. I don’t expect that to happen any time soon.

So you’re probably going to keep hearing about PJM in the context of explanations for high electricity prices.

GM will import Chinese batteries despite Trump’s tariffs

General Motors, the largest U.S. automaker, is moving forward with its plans to import electric vehicle (EV) batteries from China’s Contemporary Amperex Technology Co. Ltd. (CATL) to power the upcoming version of its Chevrolet Bolt.

According to sources familiar with the matter, GM will rely on CATL’s lithium iron phosphate (LFP) batteries for around two years, while its battery manufacturing joint venture with South Korea’s LG Energy Solution prepares to begin local production of the same battery type in Tennessee by 2027.

The new generation Bolt, which General Motors plans to begin assembling at its Fairfax Assembly Plant in Kansas later this year, will arrive in dealerships in 2026. It will be the most affordable electric vehicle in GM’s lineup, priced at around $30,000.

Despite the 80% tariff on Chinese EV batteries, GM views the arrangement as a necessary measure to keep its pricing competitive and its production timelines on track.

“For several years, other U.S. automakers have depended on foreign suppliers for LFP battery sourcing and licensing,” General Motors said in a statement. “To stay competitive, GM will temporarily source these packs from similar suppliers to power our most affordable EV model.”

Auto maker has to handle cost pressures and tax policy

According to Sam Abuelsamid, an analyst at Telemetry, LFP batteries are roughly 35% cheaper to produce than nickel- and cobalt-based alternatives.

LFP battery chemistry was first developed in the U.S. in the late 1990s, but Chinese companies like CATL and BYD have since commercialized and dominated the production and supply of these batteries.

Ford, GM’s key rival, is currently licensing CATL’s LFP technology and manufacturing process for a new factory in Michigan. That facility will supply batteries for a planned small electric pickup truck.

Tesla previously used CATL’s LFP batteries in some Model 3 units until it ceased the arrangement following an escalation in U.S. tariffs earlier this year.

Currently, GM sources batteries for all 12 of its EV models, including the $35,000 Chevrolet Equinox EV and the $340,000 Cadillac Celestiq from U.S.-based manufacturing. None of those vehicles utilizes the cheaper LFP chemistry.

The adoption of these cost-effective batteries, coupled with other efficiencies General Motors has achieved in EV production, could allow the new Bolt to be “marginally profitable” or “close enough,” even with the tariff burden.

Adding further rationale to GM’s move, the U.S. EV tax credit policy that provided a $7,500 federal tax credit for EV purchases will be scrapped starting next month. Previously, the new Bolt would have been ineligible for the incentive due to the use of Chinese-made batteries, but with the credit now eliminated for all qualifying vehicles, GM’s Bolt will no longer be at a comparative disadvantage in the marketplace.

The Bolt was first introduced in 2016 and discontinued in 2023. The model is expected to make a comeback as part of GM’s goal to expand affordable EV options. A board member, Jon McNeill, hinted that the Bolt could be put on sale in the low $20,000s after factoring in the tax credit. With the incentive gone, the base price is expected to settle around $30,000.

Speaking at its Institutional Investors Meeting for Q1 FY26, the company outlined its goal to increase module manufacturing capacity from 10 GW to 26 GW and solar cell capacity from 5.4 GW to 16 GW by FY27.

The expansion blueprint also includes establishing 10 GW of ingot-wafer capacity, a 3.5 GWh battery energy storage system (BESS) facility, 3 GW inverter production, and a 300 MW hydrogen electrolyser plant. These moves aim to position Waaree as an integrated “full-stack energy solutions provider,” capturing up to 90 percent of the customer wallet share.

Waaree’s order book currently stands at 25 GW worth INR 49,000 crore, with a project pipeline exceeding 100 GW. In Q1, 67 percent of revenue came from the Indian market and 33 percent from exports. The company is also ramping up its U.S. operations, expanding local manufacturing from 1.6 GW to 3.2 GW, to meet demand driven by AI data centers, EV adoption, and manufacturing reshoring. The strategy ensures compliance with Foreign Entity of Concern (FEOC) rules and maintains eligibility for 45X tax credits.

The company reported profit after tax surged 93 percent year-on-year to INR 773 crore, revenue rose 31.5 percent to INR 4,597 crore, and EBITDA jumped 83 percent to INR 1,169 crore, with margins improving 700 basis points to 25.4 percent. Quarterly production hit an all-time high of 2.3 GW.

The company is promising “breakthrough electric vehicles” made in America.
That strategy could give Ford a weapon in the fight for EV affordability, a challenge even Tesla hasn’t fully solved.
A “Model T Moment” for the EV Age Ford is clearly leaning into the symbolism.","Ford is promising a revolution. The company plans to make a big announcement on August 11 about its electric vehicle future, an event it is hyping as a “Model T moment.”

In a blog post, Ford invoked the spirit of its most iconic creation, the car that “put the world on wheels” by making transportation “accessible to the masses.” The message is clear: Ford believes it is on the verge of launching a breakthrough EV that is both capable and, crucially, affordable. But what is it?

A new clue, uncovered by the site Ford Authority, suggests that Ford’s futuristic revolution will be powered by a ghost from its past. Just days before its big announcement, Ford has filed a new trademark for the name “Ranchero,” specifically for use on “Electric vehicles,” namely “pick-up trucks.”

For Ford, this is a familiar playbook. The company has mastered the art of raiding its own archives, using beloved, gas-guzzling names from its history to sell a radically new electric future. They did it with the Mustang Mach-E, weathering a storm of outrage from purists to turn it into a best-selling electric SUV. They did it again with the F-150 Lightning, attaching their most trusted truck name to their flagship EV pickup. And with the Maverick, they revived another classic name to win over a new generation of buyers.

The Ranchero trademark filing signals that Ford is about to do it again. But this time, the stakes are even higher. The company is promising “breakthrough electric vehicles” made in America. According to reports, Ford is developing a low-cost electric platform meant to underpin a range of future models, starting with a midsize pickup. That strategy could give Ford a weapon in the fight for EV affordability, a challenge even Tesla hasn’t fully solved.

The Ranchero nameplate hasn’t been seen on U.S. roads since 1979, but its history is unlike anything else in Ford’s lineup. Launched in 1957, the original Ranchero blurred the lines between car and truck, offering the comfort and style of a sedan with the practicality of a pickup bed. It quickly found a following among farmers, tradespeople, and California surfers alike.

It competed head-to-head with Chevrolet’s El Camino, part of a wave of so-called “car-truck hybrids” that traced their lineage back to Australian “utes” of the 1930s, multipurpose vehicles that could haul hay bales in the morning and churchgoers in the afternoon.

A “Model T Moment” for the EV Age

Ford is clearly leaning into the symbolism. In the blog post, the company’s heritage team invoked the birth of the Model T, the 1908 car that put the world on wheels by making personal transportation accessible to the masses. Born in secrecy on the third floor of Ford’s Piquette Plant, the Model T was designed to be universal: affordable, repairable, and adaptable for everything from climbing Pike’s Peak to serving as a snowmobile. Ford says it wants to recreate that breakthrough, this time with EVs.

“Now Ford is going back to its roots for another Model T moment,” the company wrote. “Ford leaders will share more about our plans to design and assemble breakthrough electric vehicles in America.”

If the Ranchero is part of that vision, it could bring back the practicality and personality of the car-pickup hybrid for a new generation. This time powered by electrons, not gasoline. And if history is any guide, the electric version of the Ranchero could bridge the gap between work and play in a market where most EV pickups still aim for size and luxury, not versatility and price.",https://gizmodo.com/app/uploads/2024/09/A-Ford-F-150-on-a-sales-lot-in-Miami.jpg,N,,2025-08-09 15:02:56.089575

This boastful comment came from U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin, as he announced plans to quash a key 2009 ruling that reins in planet-warming burning of fossil fuels. Under threat now is a directive that has worked to reduce risk and protect public health in the U.S., called the “endangerment finding.”

This announcement triggered a 45-day public comment period, with a September 15 deadline. Here is where you can submit your comments.

For regular readers of this sustainability and environment column, you may recall my May 31 alert. At that time, I described draft documents leaked to the press that argued that fossil fuel burning “does not contribute significantly to dangerous pollution,” as I warned that a proposal was on the horizon. The EPA proposal is wider ranging than I anticipated, seeking to remove restraints on stationary source greenhouse gas (GHG) power plant emissions as well as non-point source polluters such as cars and trucks.

While EPA arguments seize on the ubiquity of carbon dioxide in our world and question the efficacy of the endangerment finding anyway, do not be fooled. This effort to repeal and repel the realities of 21st-century climate change may again signal nostalgic regression to yesteryear. Yet, it has been clear for many years that carbon dioxide, methane and other GHGs from fossil fuel-burning activities drive human-caused climate change and endanger public health.

Back in the 1950s and 1960s, the U.S. was making scientific and policy progress on climate change. In 1957, U.S. President Dwight Eisenhower established the President’s Scientific Advisory Committee (PSAC) to advise on policy-relevant scientific issues. It also was the International Geophysical Year that marked international scientific partnerships and cooperative efforts to study transboundary environmental problems like climate change. In 1965, a PSAC Environmental Pollution Panel was convened by U.S. President Lyndon Johnson. Their final report noted, “pollutants have altered on a global scale the carbon dioxide content of the air and the lead concentrations in ocean waters and human populations.” They wrote that atmospheric carbon dioxide “will modify the heat balance of the atmosphere to such an extent that marked changes in climate.”

They concluded: “The combustion of coal, oil, and gas in our homes, vehicles, and factories results in the discharge into the air of sulfur dioxide, carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, oxides of nitrogen, and partially burned hydrocarbons. Some of these gases, together with gasoline and natural gas vapors, undergo chemical change in air and in sunlight, and become the noxious constituents of smog; others, like carbon dioxide, are accumulating in such large quantities that they may eventually produce marked climatic change.”

The panel recommended investments to alleviate negative impacts of local air pollutants and GHG emissions.

This time also marked the establishment of the U.S. National Center for Atmospheric Research in 1960. NCAR — based here in Boulder — was designed by the National Science Foundation (NSF) to serve as a hub for modeling, improving and coordinating atmospheric research, including “the CO2 question.” In 1959 — in creating NCAR — NSF remarked that human “activities in consuming fossil fuels during the past hundred years … have been on a sufficient scale to make it worthwhile to examine the effects these activities have had upon the atmosphere.”

While scientists have been examining links between CO2 and climate change for over a century, in 1969, U.S. Congress held a hearing that led to the passage of the Clean Air Act in 1970. CAA provided guidance for the newly established EPA to set emissions limits and standards on air pollution, including GHGs. A legal test of CAA culminated in a 2007 Supreme Court ruling that the EPA did have authority and responsibility to regulate GHG emissions because GHGs were determined to be air pollutants that endangered public health and welfare. That 2007 Supreme Court decision led to the 2009 finding that’s currently under threat.

While the company explores alternative materials for its products, the energy that powers its factories and production lines proves just as crucial.

This dual focus shapes its approach to sustainability, where cleaner energy supports the shift to circular production.

Energy transition plays key role in LEGO's green mission

LEGO sets out to reduce its carbon emissions by relying more heavily on renewable energy.

The company powers all its factories using renewable sources and commits to reaching net zero by 2050.

To back this aim, it has invested in two solar parks in Texas and has signed a 15-year power purchase agreement with solar energy firm Enel North America.

The solar parks are expected to produce enough energy annually to match the electricity use of more than 100,000 homes in the US.

This helps LEGO meet its renewable energy target while supporting the grid.

By investing directly in renewable infrastructure, the company aligns energy use with its wider sustainability targets.

“This campaign is a way to celebrate the progress we’re making on our sustainability journey and to recognise the durability of the LEGO brick that fans have come to know and love,” says Annette Stube, Chief Sustainability Officer at the LEGO Group. “With half of the materials we buy to make LEGO bricks now produced with renewable sources, we’re proud of how far we've come.""

She adds: “As we continue to transition to more sustainable initiatives, we remain committed to the highest standards of safety, durability and quality, ensuring our bricks are always ready for generations of play.”

LEGO matches these actions with broader industry collaboration. The company joins RE100, a global corporate initiative focused on 100% renewable electricity. Through this group, it shares knowledge and best practices with other businesses aiming to reduce their emissions.

Supporting the next generation through sustainable action

Beyond bricks and buildings, Lego links its climate commitments to its purpose: to inspire and develop children.

The company plans to spend US$1.4bn over four years on environmental initiatives.

This includes money for renewable energy projects, sustainable materials research and upgrades to production lines.

It also sets targets to reduce emissions across all scopes – including direct emissions from factories (Scope 1), emissions from purchased electricity (Scope 2) and all other indirect emissions across its value chain (Scope 3).

LEGO reports that around 98% of its emissions fall into the Scope 3 category, covering everything from raw materials to product transport.

The business is transparent about the challenge of reducing those emissions, noting it will require innovation and cooperation across the supply chain.

To that end, LEGO supports suppliers to switch to renewable electricity and improve efficiency.

LEGO’s sustainability goals are now built into business decisions.

(AP) — Amid rising electric bills, states are under pressure to insulate regular household and business ratepayers from the costs of feeding Big Tech’s energy-hungry data centers.

An overarching goal is to get data center developers to put their money where their mouth is.","HARRISBURG, Pa. (AP) — Amid rising electric bills, states are under pressure to insulate regular household and business ratepayers from the costs of feeding Big Tech’s energy-hungry data centers.

It’s not clear that any state has a solution and the actual effect of data centers on electricity bills is difficult to pin down. Some critics question whether states have the spine to take a hard line against tech behemoths like Microsoft, Google, Amazon and Meta.

But more than a dozen states have begun taking steps as data centers drive a rapid build-out of power plants and transmission lines.

That has meant pressuring the nation’s biggest power grid operator to clamp down on price increases, studying the effect of data centers on electricity bills or pushing data center owners to pay a larger share of local transmission costs.

Rising power bills are “something legislators have been hearing a lot about. It’s something we’ve been hearing a lot about. More people are speaking out at the public utility commission in the past year than I’ve ever seen before,” said Charlotte Shuff of the Oregon Citizens’ Utility Board, a consumer advocacy group. “There’s a massive outcry.”

Not the typical electric customer

Some data centers could require more electricity than cities the size of Pittsburgh, Cleveland or New Orleans, and make huge factories look tiny by comparison. That’s pushing policymakers to rethink a system that, historically, has spread transmission costs among classes of consumers that are proportional to electricity use.

“A lot of this infrastructure, billions of dollars of it, is being built just for a few customers and a few facilities and these happen to be the wealthiest companies in the world,” said Ari Peskoe, who directs the Electricity Law Initiative at Harvard University. “I think some of the fundamental assumptions behind all this just kind of breaks down.”

A fix, Peskoe said, is a “can of worms” that pits ratepayer classes against one another.

Some officials downplay the role of data centers in pushing up electric bills.

Tricia Pridemore, who sits on Georgia’s Public Service Commission and is president of the National Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners, pointed to an already tightened electricity supply and increasing costs for power lines, utility poles, transformers and generators as utilities replace aging equipment or harden it against extreme weather.

The data centers needed to accommodate the artificial intelligence boom are still in the regulatory planning stages, Pridemore said, and the Data Center Coalition, which represents Big Tech firms and data center developers, has said its members are committed to paying their fair share.

But growing evidence suggests that the electricity bills of some Americans are rising to subsidize the massive energy needs of Big Tech as the U.S. competes in a race against China for artificial intelligence superiority.

Data and analytics firm Wood Mackenzie published a report in recent weeks that suggested 20 proposed or effective specialized rates for data centers in 16 states it studied aren’t nearly enough to cover the cost of a new natural gas power plant.

In other words, unless utilities negotiate higher specialized rates, other ratepayer classes — residential, commercial and industrial — are likely paying for data center power needs.

Meanwhile, Monitoring Analytics, the independent market watchdog for the mid-Atlantic grid, produced research in June showing that 70% — or $9.3 billion — of last year’s increased electricity cost was the result of data center demand.

States are responding

Last year, five governors led by Pennsylvania’s Josh Shapiro began pushing back against power prices set by the mid-Atlantic grid operator, PJM Interconnection, after that amount spiked nearly sevenfold. They warned of customers “paying billions more than is necessary.”

PJM has yet to propose ways to guarantee that data centers pay their freight, but Monitoring Analytics is floating the idea that data centers should be required to procure their own power.

In a filing last month, it said that would avoid a “massive wealth transfer” from average people to tech companies.

At least a dozen states are eyeing ways to make data centers pay higher local transmission costs.

In Oregon, a data center hot spot, lawmakers passed legislation in June ordering state utility regulators to develop new — presumably higher — power rates for data centers.

The Oregon Citizens’ Utility Board says there is clear evidence that costs to serve data centers are being spread across all customers — at a time when some electric bills there are up 50% over the past four years and utilities are disconnecting more people than ever.

New Jersey’s governor signed legislation last month commissioning state utility regulators to study whether ratepayers are being hit with “unreasonable rate increases” to connect data centers and to develop a specialized rate to charge data centers.

In some other states, like Texas and Utah, governors and lawmakers are trying to avoid a supply-and-demand crisis that leaves ratepayers on the hook — or in the dark.

Doubts about states protecting ratepayers

In Indiana, state utility regulators approved a settlement between Indiana Michigan Power Co., Amazon, Google, Microsoft and consumer advocates that set parameters for data center payments for service.

Kerwin Olsen, of the Citizens Action Council of Indiana, a consumer advocacy group, signed the settlement and called it a “pretty good deal” that contained more consumer protections than what state lawmakers passed.

But, he said, state law doesn’t force large power users like data centers to publicly reveal their electric usage, so pinning down whether they’re paying their fair share of transmission costs “will be a challenge.”

In a March report, the Environmental and Energy Law Program at Harvard University questioned the motivation of utilities and regulators to shield ratepayers from footing the cost of electricity for data centers.

Both utilities and states have incentives to attract big customers like data centers, it said.

To do it, utilities — which must get their rates approved by regulators — can offer “special deals to favored customers” like a data center and effectively shift the costs of those discounts to regular ratepayers, the authors wrote. Many state laws can shield disclosure of those rates, they said.

In Pennsylvania, an emerging data center hot spot, the state utility commission is drafting a model rate structure for utilities to consider adopting. An overarching goal is to get data center developers to put their money where their mouth is.

“We’re talking about real transmission upgrades, potentially hundreds of millions of dollars,” commission chairman Stephen DeFrank said. “And that’s what you don’t want the ratepayer to get stuck paying for.”

“With every stroke of the pen and deletion, Trump can try to eliminate environmental and climate justice from his administration, but he won’t erase our communities,” Ashley Williams, executive director of Just Transition Northwest Indiana, said in a statement. “We are a testament that the fight will continue because everyone should have access to a clean, healthy environment and a better quality of life.”

The Environmental Data and Governance Initiative released a 55-page report detailing how the Trump administration has altered the availability of environmental information in the last six months.

Information about environmental justice and climate change have disappeared from federal websites, according to the organization.

“The pace and severity of this administration’s attacks on environmental information in its first six months have been far worse than in the first Trump administration,” Izzy Pacenza, lead author of the Environmental Data and Governance Initiative study, said in a news release.

The Environmental Data and Governance Initiative’s website governance team monitored more than 4,000 federal environmental pages to find changes for the report. According to its data, the organization found 70% more website changes in Trump’s first 100 days in office in 2025 compared to during his first term in 2017.

The organization is monitoring 20% of the webpages it tracked for changes during the first Trump administration.

Information about climate change has been altered and removed, including from the U.S. Global Change Research Program website and informational resources from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration website.

Climate change information remains “virtually unaltered” on the Environmental Protection Agency’s website, according to the report.

“The Trump administration’s changes to public information are part of a broader agenda to reshape the form and function of the federal government,” according to the report.

Changes relating to environmental justice and diversity, equity and inclusion have been made most frequently, according to the report. Information about environmental racism has been “entirely excised” from federal websites, according to the report.

Environmental racism is the intentional pollution and waste facilities in communities primarily made up of people of color, according to the Natural Resources Defense Council. Those communities are disproportionately exposed to fumes, toxic dust, ash, soot and other pollutants, according to the NRDC. Gary was one of the communities visited by EPA officials in 2022 due to its history of heavy industry and proximity to five Superfund sites. At the time, residents were encouraged to keep tabs on environmental data.

Removing language about environmental racism denies facts and generates misinformation, as well as undermines the collective ability to address issues.

“Trustworthy information is critical for a functioning democracy,” Gretchen Gehrke, study lead author, said in a news release. “These removals reflect a broad deregulatory agenda by this administration to disavow the intersecting issues of environmental justice and climate change.”

Carolyn McCrady, member of Gary Advocates for Responsible Development, responded to the Environmental Data and Governance Initiative Study’s findings, calling federal cuts relentless, ruthless and lawless, especially for communities of color.

“While (they are) depriving organizations, cities and states of the funds needed to repair environmental damage, they are also destroying the laws that provided protection since the inception of the EPA,” McCrady said in a text. “But the assault will only strengthen the resolve of people to fight to protect and preserve the very foundation of life in these targeted communities. No one is giving up.”

Earlier this year, in Indiana, Gov. Mike Braun signed two executive orders that target the environment, including one to make state regulations consistent with national ones and one prohibiting the use of the phrase “environmental justice” in permitting, enforcement and grant decisions.

“…the concept of ‘environmental justice’ has become increasingly politicized and has often led to the introduction of subjective, non-scientific factors into environmental policy and regulation…” according to one executive order.

Northwest Indiana activists previously told the Post-Tribune that Braun’s executive orders were concerning, and targeting environmental justice would be harmful for the public health and wellbeing of region communities.

In July, Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin announced a plan to rescind the 2009 Endangerment Finding at an Indianapolis auto dealership, which Braun and other Indiana officials supported in person. The 2009 Endangerment Finding found six greenhouse gases threaten public health and welfare of current and future generations.

The American Lung Association announced in April that Hoosiers are breathing some of the nation’s most polluted air in its “State of the Air” report. The Indianapolis metro area ranked at the 54th worst in the nation for ozone pollution and 21st worst for particle pollution.

In Northwest Indiana, the American Lung Association gave Lake County failing grades in three categories: ozone pollution, 24-hour particle pollution and annual particle pollution. Porter County only received a passing grade for annual particle pollution.

Ozone and particle pollution can cause premature death and other health effects, including asthma attacks, heart attacks, strokes, preterm birth and impaired cognitive function, according to the American Lung Association. The organization also found particle pollution can cause lung cancer.

An overarching goal is to get data center developers to put their money where their mouth is.","HARRISBURG, Pa. (AP) — Amid rising electric bills, states are under pressure to insulate regular household and business ratepayers from the costs of feeding Big Tech's energy-hungry data centers.

It's not clear that any state has a solution and the actual effect of data centers on electricity bills is difficult to pin down. Some critics question whether states have the spine to take a hard line against tech behemoths like Microsoft (MSFT), Google, Amazon (AMZN) and Meta (META).

But more than a dozen states have begun taking steps as data centers drive a rapid build-out of power plants and transmission lines.

That has meant pressuring the nation's biggest power grid operator to clamp down on price increases, studying the effect of data centers on electricity bills or pushing data center owners to pay a larger share of local transmission costs.

Rising power bills are “something legislators have been hearing a lot about. It’s something we’ve been hearing a lot about. More people are speaking out at the public utility commission in the past year than I’ve ever seen before,” said Charlotte Shuff of the Oregon Citizens’ Utility Board, a consumer advocacy group. “There’s a massive outcry.”

Not the typical electric customer

Some data centers could require more electricity than cities the size of Pittsburgh, Cleveland or New Orleans, and make huge factories look tiny by comparison. That's pushing policymakers to rethink a system that, historically, has spread transmission costs among classes of consumers that are proportional to electricity use.

“A lot of this infrastructure, billions of dollars of it, is being built just for a few customers and a few facilities and these happen to be the wealthiest companies in the world,” said Ari Peskoe, who directs the Electricity Law Initiative at Harvard University. “I think some of the fundamental assumptions behind all this just kind of breaks down.”

A fix, Peskoe said, is a “can of worms"" that pits ratepayer classes against one another.

Some officials downplay the role of data centers in pushing up electric bills.

Tricia Pridemore, who sits on Georgia’s Public Service Commission and is president of the National Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners, pointed to an already tightened electricity supply and increasing costs for power lines, utility poles, transformers and generators as utilities replace aging equipment or harden it against extreme weather.

The data centers needed to accommodate the artificial intelligence boom are still in the regulatory planning stages, Pridemore said, and the Data Center Coalition, which represents Big Tech firms and data center developers, has said its members are committed to paying their fair share.

But growing evidence suggests that the electricity bills of some Americans are rising to subsidize the massive energy needs of Big Tech as the U.S. competes in a race against China for artificial intelligence superiority.

Data and analytics firm Wood Mackenzie published a report in recent weeks that suggested 20 proposed or effective specialized rates for data centers in 16 states it studied aren’t nearly enough to cover the cost of a new natural gas power plant.

In other words, unless utilities negotiate higher specialized rates, other ratepayer classes — residential, commercial and industrial — are likely paying for data center power needs.

Meanwhile, Monitoring Analytics, the independent market watchdog for the mid-Atlantic grid, produced research in June showing that 70% — or $9.3 billion — of last year's increased electricity cost was the result of data center demand.

States are responding

Last year, five governors led by Pennsylvania's Josh Shapiro began pushing back against power prices set by the mid-Atlantic grid operator, PJM Interconnection, after that amount spiked nearly sevenfold. They warned of customers “paying billions more than is necessary.”

PJM has yet to propose ways to guarantee that data centers pay their freight, but Monitoring Analytics is floating the idea that data centers should be required to procure their own power.

In a filing last month, it said that would avoid a ""massive wealth transfer” from average people to tech companies.

At least a dozen states are eyeing ways to make data centers pay higher local transmission costs.

In Oregon, a data center hot spot, lawmakers passed legislation in June ordering state utility regulators to develop new — presumably higher — power rates for data centers.

The Oregon Citizens’ Utility Board says there is clear evidence that costs to serve data centers are being spread across all customers — at a time when some electric bills there are up 50% over the past four years and utilities are disconnecting more people than ever.

New Jersey’s governor signed legislation last month commissioning state utility regulators to study whether ratepayers are being hit with “unreasonable rate increases” to connect data centers and to develop a specialized rate to charge data centers.

In some other states, like Texas and Utah, governors and lawmakers are trying to avoid a supply-and-demand crisis that leaves ratepayers on the hook — or in the dark.

Doubts about states protecting ratepayers

In Indiana, state utility regulators approved a settlement between Indiana Michigan Power Co., Amazon, Google, Microsoft and consumer advocates that set parameters for data center payments for service.

Kerwin Olsen, of the Citizens Action Council of Indiana, a consumer advocacy group, signed the settlement and called it a “pretty good deal” that contained more consumer protections than what state lawmakers passed.

But, he said, state law doesn't force large power users like data centers to publicly reveal their electric usage, so pinning down whether they're paying their fair share of transmission costs ""will be a challenge.”

In a March report, the Environmental and Energy Law Program at Harvard University questioned the motivation of utilities and regulators to shield ratepayers from footing the cost of electricity for data centers.

Both utilities and states have incentives to attract big customers like data centers, it said.

To do it, utilities — which must get their rates approved by regulators — can offer “special deals to favored customers” like a data center and effectively shift the costs of those discounts to regular ratepayers, the authors wrote. Many state laws can shield disclosure of those rates, they said.

In Pennsylvania, an emerging data center hot spot, the state utility commission is drafting a model rate structure for utilities to consider adopting. An overarching goal is to get data center developers to put their money where their mouth is.

“We’re talking about real transmission upgrades, potentially hundreds of millions of dollars,” commission chairman Stephen DeFrank said. “And that’s what you don’t want the ratepayer to get stuck paying for.""

“This money was intended for our constituents and communities to help lower energy bills,” Energy and Commerce Committee Ranking Member Frank Pallone, D-N.J., stated Friday. “Clawing these funds back isn’t just brazenly illegal—it’s a betrayal by this administration of working families who will now pay higher energy bills just so Republicans can grind their axe against clean energy.”

The repeal of the program, however, directly implements orders from the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which President Donald Trump signed into law a month ago. Among multiple other green energy policies, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act repeals the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund, which the Solar for All program falls under.

The program, funded by taxpayer dollars via the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, has already promised funds to 60 grant recipients across the U.S. The money was meant for the creation or expansion of solar programs meant to lower electricity bills for approximately 900,000 low-income households and increase their access to solar-produced energy.

The abrupt rescinding of the funds, though allowed for by law, will disrupt plans in 49 states. However, EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin said that “very little money” has actually been spent and that recipients are still “very much in the early planning phase, not the building and construction process.”

“But the bottom line again is this: EPA no longer has the authority to administer the program or the appropriated funds to keep this boondoggle alive,” Zeldin added.

Republicans targeted dozens of similar federal green energy programs and grants in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act arguing that such subsidies create a false demand for unreliable sources of electricity that have minimal positive impact on the environment.

The Solar for All program in particular wasted taxpayer dollars, Zeldin said, by diluting the billions of dollars through pass-through entities, with middlemen taking a 15% cut of total funds “by conservative estimates.”

Additionally, the program received an exemption from the Build America, Buy America law, which requires federal agencies to use American workers, products and infrastructure for projects funded by American taxpayers.

States including Ohio, Illinois, Arizona, Missouri, Virginia and Michigan had each been awarded more than $100 million from the Solar for All program and have already planned on how to disperse the promised funds.

Democratic governors were quick to condemn the EPA’s decision, with Gov.

An overarching goal is to get data center developers to put their money where their mouth is.","HARRISBURG, Pa. — Amid rising electric bills, states are under pressure to insulate regular household and business ratepayers from the costs of feeding Big Tech's energy-hungry data centers.

It's not clear that any state has a solution and the actual effect of data centers on electricity bills is difficult to pin down. Some critics question whether states have the spine to take a hard line against tech behemoths like Microsoft, Google, Amazon and Meta.

But more than a dozen states have begun taking steps as data centers drive a rapid build-out of power plants and transmission lines.

That has meant pressuring the nation's biggest power grid operator to clamp down on price increases, studying the effect of data centers on electricity bills or pushing data center owners to pay a larger share of local transmission costs.

Rising power bills are “something legislators have been hearing a lot about. It’s something we’ve been hearing a lot about. More people are speaking out at the public utility commission in the past year than I’ve ever seen before,” said Charlotte Shuff of the Oregon Citizens’ Utility Board, a consumer advocacy group. “There’s a massive outcry.”

Not the typical electric customer

Some data centers could require more electricity than cities the size of Pittsburgh, Cleveland or New Orleans, and make huge factories look tiny by comparison. That's pushing policymakers to rethink a system that, historically, has spread transmission costs among classes of consumers that are proportional to electricity use.

“A lot of this infrastructure, billions of dollars of it, is being built just for a few customers and a few facilities and these happen to be the wealthiest companies in the world,” said Ari Peskoe, who directs the Electricity Law Initiative at Harvard University. “I think some of the fundamental assumptions behind all this just kind of breaks down.”

A fix, Peskoe said, is a “can of worms"" that pits ratepayer classes against one another.

Some officials downplay the role of data centers in pushing up electric bills.

Tricia Pridemore, who sits on Georgia’s Public Service Commission and is president of the National Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners, pointed to an already tightened electricity supply and increasing costs for power lines, utility poles, transformers and generators as utilities replace aging equipment or harden it against extreme weather.

The data centers needed to accommodate the artificial intelligence boom are still in the regulatory planning stages, Pridemore said, and the Data Center Coalition, which represents Big Tech firms and data center developers, has said its members are committed to paying their fair share.

But growing evidence suggests that the electricity bills of some Americans are rising to subsidize the massive energy needs of Big Tech as the U.S. competes in a race against China for artificial intelligence superiority.

Data and analytics firm Wood Mackenzie published a report in recent weeks that suggested 20 proposed or effective specialized rates for data centers in 16 states it studied aren’t nearly enough to cover the cost of a new natural gas power plant.

In other words, unless utilities negotiate higher specialized rates, other ratepayer classes — residential, commercial and industrial — are likely paying for data center power needs.

Meanwhile, Monitoring Analytics, the independent market watchdog for the mid-Atlantic grid, produced research in June showing that 70% — or $9.3 billion — of last year's increased electricity cost was the result of data center demand.

States are responding

Last year, five governors led by Pennsylvania's Josh Shapiro began pushing back against power prices set by the mid-Atlantic grid operator, PJM Interconnection, after that amount spiked nearly sevenfold. They warned of customers “paying billions more than is necessary.”

PJM has yet to propose ways to guarantee that data centers pay their freight, but Monitoring Analytics is floating the idea that data centers should be required to procure their own power.

In a filing last month, it said that would avoid a ""massive wealth transfer” from average people to tech companies.

At least a dozen states are eyeing ways to make data centers pay higher local transmission costs.

In Oregon, a data center hot spot, lawmakers passed legislation in June ordering state utility regulators to develop new — presumably higher — power rates for data centers.

The Oregon Citizens’ Utility Board says there is clear evidence that costs to serve data centers are being spread across all customers — at a time when some electric bills there are up 50% over the past four years and utilities are disconnecting more people than ever.

New Jersey’s governor signed legislation last month commissioning state utility regulators to study whether ratepayers are being hit with “unreasonable rate increases” to connect data centers and to develop a specialized rate to charge data centers.

In some other states, like Texas and Utah, governors and lawmakers are trying to avoid a supply-and-demand crisis that leaves ratepayers on the hook — or in the dark.

Doubts about states protecting ratepayers

In Indiana, state utility regulators approved a settlement between Indiana Michigan Power Co., Amazon, Google, Microsoft and consumer advocates that set parameters for data center payments for service.

Kerwin Olsen, of the Citizens Action Council of Indiana, a consumer advocacy group, signed the settlement and called it a “pretty good deal” that contained more consumer protections than what state lawmakers passed.

But, he said, state law doesn't force large power users like data centers to publicly reveal their electric usage, so pinning down whether they're paying their fair share of transmission costs ""will be a challenge.”

In a March report, the Environmental and Energy Law Program at Harvard University questioned the motivation of utilities and regulators to shield ratepayers from footing the cost of electricity for data centers.

Both utilities and states have incentives to attract big customers like data centers, it said.

To do it, utilities — which must get their rates approved by regulators — can offer “special deals to favored customers” like a data center and effectively shift the costs of those discounts to regular ratepayers, the authors wrote. Many state laws can shield disclosure of those rates, they said.

In Pennsylvania, an emerging data center hot spot, the state utility commission is drafting a model rate structure for utilities to consider adopting. An overarching goal is to get data center developers to put their money where their mouth is.

“We’re talking about real transmission upgrades, potentially hundreds of millions of dollars,” commission chairman Stephen DeFrank said. “And that’s what you don’t want the ratepayer to get stuck paying for.""",https://media.wwltv.com/assets/CCT/images/fbd1a651-f7ed-42cb-bedc-9a518507ed59/20250809T121407/fbd1a651-f7ed-42cb-bedc-9a518507ed59_1140x641.jpg,N,,2025-08-09 14:06:45.325815

This legislation was designed to reduce US dependence on Chinese supply chains, especially by discouraging the use of Chinese-made batteries, while also investing in cutting-edge technologies for the future, with a strong focus on clean energy.

However, with the EV tax credits set to expire on September 30th, a major player like BMW is reconsidering his strategies, finding it more cost-effective, at least in the short term, to source low-cost batteries from China once again.

BMW, and another big one like General Motors, would have preferred to use US-made batteries for their upcoming EVs if federal incentives hadn’t ended prematurely. The $7,500 consumer tax credit was crucial to offset the high costs of EVs, driven mainly by battery prices, while manufacturers worked to ramp up local production and supply chains. But then, US clean energy programs stalled.

Today, BMW (and GM) rely heavily on China’s proven battery manufacturing expertise. The Wall Street Journal reported GM will buy lithium iron phosphate (LFP) batteries from CATL, the world’s largest battery maker, for the next-gen Chevy Bolt EV. Despite facing tariffs of roughly 80%, CATL’s scale and expertise may still offer GM a financial edge. BMW faces a similar challenge. Its battery supplier, Automotive Envision Supply Corporation (AESC), a Japanese company with plants in China, halted expansion of two facilities earlier this year due to political and market uncertainty.

In it, Rickards warns that America’s greatest national asset isn’t digital or financial—it’s physical. And it's been neglected for decades.

“We’ve had this rich endowment, as I call it, right under our feet. Yet for years, we refused to touch it.”

Why U.S. Energy Independence Was a Mirage

In the presentation, Rickards outlines how past administrations celebrated “energy independence” while importing critical materials from China and restricting access to the nation’s most resource-rich regions.

He points to large-scale deposits of copper, lithium, uranium, and rare earth elements sitting untouched across vast stretches of federal land.

“We have all these essential materials right under our feet. Incredibly… the United States is the only nation in the world that locks them up.”

The Real Bottleneck Isn’t Oil—It’s Access

Rickards says the problem isn’t finding energy or minerals—it’s bureaucracy. He calls out a decades-long pattern of permitting delays and federal restrictions that have stalled major projects for years—even decades.

“There’s a huge copper deposit in Arizona… enough to supply 25% of what we need. It’s been sitting there for 29 years.”

“The Thacker Pass Lithium Mine in Nevada is the largest known deposit of its kind… shut down since 1978.”

A Nation Sitting on a Resource Superhighway

According to Rickards, nearly one-third of the U.S. landmass is federally owned—and much of it contains strategic minerals needed for everything from national defense to electric vehicles and grid infrastructure.

“Roughly 28% of all land in the U.S. belongs to the public. And it contains world-class mineral deposits.”

He argues that tapping even a fraction of this land would give America a decisive edge in supply chains, manufacturing, and military strength—especially as tensions rise with foreign powers.

The Next Phase of American Strength Is Subsurface

Rickards believes the next evolution of U.S. leadership won’t be decided on the stock market or in Silicon Valley, but in places like Nevada, Texas, and Alaska—where deep reserves of strategic materials remain largely untouched.

“For decades… the U.S. government has blocked us from tapping into our birthright. But that’s all about to change.”

Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) continues to be a focal point of debate among investors, reflecting a mix of optimism and skepticism. The company’s stock has been volatile, influenced by CEO Elon Musk’s fluctuating popularity and strategic shifts. Recently, Tesla has been focusing on expanding its capabilities beyond electric vehicles, venturing into AI and robotics. Notably, Tesla’s Q2 2025 earnings highlighted significant developments, including the rollout of robotaxi operations in Austin and record profits in its energy division. These moves are seen as potential billion-dollar opportunities, with plans to produce 1 million Optimus 3 humanoid robots in the next five years. Despite these ambitious goals, Tesla faces challenges such as tariff concerns and the loss of consumer tax credits, which have pressured its margins.

The company’s decision to disband its Dojo supercomputer team has raised concerns about its position in the AI race. However, Tesla’s recent rideshare license in Texas marks a significant step toward launching its robotaxi service, a move that has positively impacted its stock. As Tesla transitions from an automotive company to a technology powerhouse, it continues to attract both bullish and bearish views from investors. The stock currently holds a consensus Hold rating, with a 12-month average price target suggesting a slight downside. As Tesla navigates these developments, its future remains a topic of keen interest in the financial markets.",https://blog.tipranks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/884ea72f8a3868a03348539b3275a949-750x406.png,N,,2025-08-09 20:07:34.622750

The storage system has an energy content of 25 MWh. Other smaller projects in California followed later.

Four plants around San Antonio

Now, B2U Storage Solutions wants to scale up the business model and is planning to set up four large battery storage facilities with second-life batteries near the Texas city of San Antonio over the next twelve months. Together, these are expected to have a storage capacity of 100 MWh. B2U has already started construction of the first facility in Bexar County near San Antonio.

The company considers Texas a very suitable location, as there are already many solar parks. Once commissioned, B2U’s systems can store electricity at times of day when the state’s huge solar plants are running at full capacity and prices are low, and feed it back into the grid at times when there is little sun and peak demand. On the one hand, the battery storage systems have a stabilising effect on the grid and on the other, good money can be earned from the price differences. “Texas has been a very strong market with ever more volatility,” said CEO Freeman Hall to Canary Media. “And that’s the strength of storage: they use volatile conditions to their advantage.”

Better durability than expected

Another exciting question is how long second-life batteries from electric cars will last during daily charging and discharging. B2U’s first project in Lancaster, California, was initially designed to get 2,000 charge cycles out of the first batch of early Nissan Leaf batteries, says CEO Hall, but these batteries have now exceeded this target.

Another positive aspect is that of the 2,000 battery packs that B2U has installed in stationary storage units to date, technicians have only had to remove a single-digit number for maintenance work, says Hall. This has given the company the confidence to use the batteries a little more intensively. Thanks to real-time monitoring of the batteries, B2U is also “not as concerned about degrading the batteries,” Hall continues: “They’re turning out to be pretty strong workhorses that don’t degrade as people thought they might.”",https://www.electrive.com/media/2025/08/solar-park-second-life-battery-storage-b2u-santa-barbara-california.jpg,N,,2025-08-09 12:04:52.181661

EVs can drive in the rain -- no car company would make one you can't.

You won't be stranded without a charger -- there are nearly 200k public charging stations available.

EVs are faster than gas cars -- performance wise, electricity wins.

It should come as no surprise that EV sales have risen over 10% each year since 2014, and even though they might not reach that number in 2026 due to tax credits ending in September, there are still some out there that are unsure about the validity of the platform.

I have my own opinions about how these companies are operating, but there's no denying that, as a day-to-day vehicle, EV cars are a responsible purchase. However, there are some out there who still believe some things that weren't even true back when EVs first hit the market well over a decade ago now. A myth is defined as a ""widely held but false belief or idea."" If we want to have a good dialogue around EVs, these five myths need to die a quick death sooner than later.

1 ""EVs can't drive in the rain""

Who would make a car that couldn't?

This first one stems from a pretty basic fear more than anything else -- the fear of electricity and water in the same space. I'll grant that this is warranted. After all, nobody wants to go swimming during a lightning storm for a very good reason, but in that same vein, what manufacturer would make a car that you couldn't drive in the rain? That makes no sense to me. Sure, I've welded a few rear differentials in my time, and those were sketchy in the rain at best, but most EVs are on all-wheel-drive platforms, anyway. There's quite literally no real difference between using a drill in the rain and what an EV does with its motors.

This fear is more rampant than you might think, though. In a truly shocking study, nearly 20 percent of drivers thought that they couldn't take an EV through a car wash. Come on, people -- we've got to be better than that. No car company would produce something that can't be used in the rain, full stop.

2 ""You'll be stranded without a charger""

They're more available than you might think

When EVs first hit the market, I'll relent that the infrastructure simply wasn't where it needed to be for the vast majority of people. However, this is 2025, and even though some like to think it hasn't, time always marches on. Now, there are nearly 200,000 public charging stations in the US alone, and nearly every major metropolitan area has a plethora of stations where EV owners can charge up in a hurry. Additionally, most gas stations built to support interstate travel have implemented them along most major highways, making road tripping in an SUV more doable than ever before.

These figures only represent the amount of public charging options available. There are estimated to be just as many if not more private chargers at homes and businesses across the country.

Arguably the best thing about owning an EV, though, is that you can simply opt to charge it yourself at home. Some companies offer free home charger installation with the purchase of an EV, but even if you do have to pay for one out-of-pocket, it sure beats the long-term money you'll spend on traditional gasoline going from place to place.

3 ""EVs are slower than gas cars""

This was never true, and the math backs it up

As someone who grew up going to the racetrack, and still spends quite a lot of time there, I so want this to be true. However, reality has other ideas, as EVs are far and away more impressive than their internal combustion counterparts at just about every turn. The real performance beauty comes when molding the two together, such as what's being done right now in Formula One, but when it's a straight-up head-to-head contest between electric and gas power, there really isn't any competition.

Electricity wins that match-up more times than not. It takes serious firepower to stack up to even basic levels of EV acceleration, and that's before getting into the high-performance models like the Tesla Model S, Lucid Air or the Rimac line. For instance, Carwow posted a video recently of a Kia EV6 GT, which is by no means a chart-topper in terms of performance, beating a new Lamborghini in a standing 1/4 mile drag race. Don't believe me? Then it's a good thing I've got evidence.

4 ""Cold weather kills your range""

These aren't AAA batteries we're talking about

This one is further down the list because, admittedly, freezing temperatures do hamper the EV range, but not nearly as much as some naysayers would have you think. Much like the block heaters in pickup trucks, most EV companies now release cars with heat pump technology to maximize range under even the most strenuously cold circumstances. We've talked about this issue before, and there is plenty of room to work around.

In a Recurrent study, researchers found that on models with heat pumps installed, the maximum range dropped by around just 10 percent on some of the most popular EV models on the market, like the Tesla Model X and Model S. While some lower-tier cars like the Volkswagen ID.4 did see a more significant drop-off, it wasn't tested with a heat pump. Simply put, if you live in an area of the country that regularly sees freezing temperatures in the winter months, buy an EV with a heat pump, and the problem will essentially fix itself. If you have a home charger installed alongside it, you probably wouldn't even notice a difference in the performance of your car, regardless of temperature.

5 ""You can't tow with an EV""

One look at torque figures will tell a much different story

For a while, EVs were limited to the sedan and SUV space, which led some to believe that towing with an EV was a futile venture. However, that could not be further from the truth in 2025. In fact, there are now brands on the market, like Rivian, that solely produce EV trucks and SUVs designed to fit into a more rugged lifestyle than the traditional EV buyer lives. Major automotive brands like General Motors and Ford also produce full-sized pickup trucks in EV form now with astounding torque figures.

This is a myth that simply isn't founded in logic anymore.

I'm not sure how much more proof we need that some of these myths need to go by the wayside. In 2025, it still feels like EVs are battling the same things that they did at their inception, despite making big strides towards being a more consumer-friendly option off the lot. I'm by no means the biggest proponent of EVs that there is on the planet, but if we ever want to have a real, open discussion about their validity, we need to get our facts straight, and these five myths are preventing anyone from doing just that.",https://static1.pocketlintimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/model-s_68.jpg,N,,2025-08-09 16:02:13.087848

An overarching goal is to get data center developers to put their money where their mouth is.","HARRISBURG, Pa. — Amid rising electric bills, states are under pressure to insulate regular household and business ratepayers from the costs of feeding Big Tech’s energy-hungry data centers.

It’s not clear that any state has a solution and the actual effect of data centers on electricity bills is difficult to pin down. Some critics question whether states have the spine to take a hard line against tech behemoths like Microsoft, Google, Amazon and Meta.

But more than a dozen states have begun taking steps as data centers drive a rapid build-out of power plants and transmission lines.

That has meant pressuring the nation’s biggest power grid operator to clamp down on price increases, studying the effect of data centers on electricity bills or pushing data center owners to pay a larger share of local transmission costs.

Rising power bills are “something legislators have been hearing a lot about. It’s something we’ve been hearing a lot about. More people are speaking out at the public utility commission in the past year than I’ve ever seen before,” said Charlotte Shuff of the Oregon Citizens’ Utility Board, a consumer advocacy group. “There’s a massive outcry.”

Some data centers could require more electricity than cities the size of Pittsburgh, Cleveland or New Orleans, and make huge factories look tiny by comparison. That’s pushing policymakers to rethink a system that, historically, has spread transmission costs among classes of consumers that are proportional to electricity use.

“A lot of this infrastructure, billions of dollars of it, is being built just for a few customers and a few facilities and these happen to be the wealthiest companies in the world,” said Ari Peskoe, who directs the Electricity Law Initiative at Harvard University. “I think some of the fundamental assumptions behind all this just kind of breaks down.”

A fix, Peskoe said, is a “can of worms” that pits ratepayer classes against one another.

Some officials downplay the role of data centers in pushing up electric bills.

Tricia Pridemore, who sits on Georgia’s Public Service Commission and is president of the National Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners, pointed to an already tightened electricity supply and increasing costs for power lines, utility poles, transformers and generators as utilities replace aging equipment or harden it against extreme weather.

The data centers needed to accommodate the artificial intelligence boom are still in the regulatory planning stages, Pridemore said, and the Data Center Coalition, which represents Big Tech firms and data center developers, has said its members are committed to paying their fair share.

But growing evidence suggests that the electricity bills of some Americans are rising to subsidize the massive energy needs of Big Tech as the U.S. competes in a race against China for artificial intelligence superiority.

Data and analytics firm Wood Mackenzie published a report in recent weeks that suggested 20 proposed or effective specialized rates for data centers in 16 states it studied aren’t nearly enough to cover the cost of a new natural gas power plant.

In other words, unless utilities negotiate higher specialized rates, other ratepayer classes - residential, commercial and industrial - are likely paying for data center power needs.

Meanwhile, Monitoring Analytics, the independent market watchdog for the mid-Atlantic grid, produced research in June showing that 70% - or $9.3 billion - of last year’s increased electricity cost was the result of data center demand.

Last year, five governors led by Pennsylvania’s Josh Shapiro began pushing back against power prices set by the mid-Atlantic grid operator, PJM Interconnection, after that amount spiked nearly sevenfold. They warned of customers “paying billions more than is necessary.”

PJM has yet to propose ways to guarantee that data centers pay their freight, but Monitoring Analytics is floating the idea that data centers should be required to procure their own power.

In a filing last month, it said that would avoid a “massive wealth transfer” from average people to tech companies.

At least a dozen states are eyeing ways to make data centers pay higher local transmission costs.

In Oregon, a data center hot spot, lawmakers passed legislation in June ordering state utility regulators to develop new - presumably higher - power rates for data centers.

The Oregon Citizens’ Utility Board says there is clear evidence that costs to serve data centers are being spread across all customers - at a time when some electric bills there are up 50% over the past four years and utilities are disconnecting more people than ever.

New Jersey’s governor signed legislation last month commissioning state utility regulators to study whether ratepayers are being hit with “unreasonable rate increases” to connect data centers and to develop a specialized rate to charge data centers.

In some other states, like Texas and Utah, governors and lawmakers are trying to avoid a supply-and-demand crisis that leaves ratepayers on the hook - or in the dark.

In Indiana, state utility regulators approved a settlement between Indiana Michigan Power Co., Amazon, Google, Microsoft and consumer advocates that set parameters for data center payments for service.

Kerwin Olsen, of the Citizens Action Council of Indiana, a consumer advocacy group, signed the settlement and called it a “pretty good deal” that contained more consumer protections than what state lawmakers passed.

But, he said, state law doesn’t force large power users like data centers to publicly reveal their electric usage, so pinning down whether they’re paying their fair share of transmission costs “will be a challenge.”

In a March report, the Environmental and Energy Law Program at Harvard University questioned the motivation of utilities and regulators to shield ratepayers from footing the cost of electricity for data centers.

Both utilities and states have incentives to attract big customers like data centers, it said.

To do it, utilities - which must get their rates approved by regulators - can offer “special deals to favored customers” like a data center and effectively shift the costs of those discounts to regular ratepayers, the authors wrote. Many state laws can shield disclosure of those rates, they said.

In Pennsylvania, an emerging data center hot spot, the state utility commission is drafting a model rate structure for utilities to consider adopting. An overarching goal is to get data center developers to put their money where their mouth is.

“We’re talking about real transmission upgrades, potentially hundreds of millions of dollars,” commission chairman Stephen DeFrank said. “And that’s what you don’t want the ratepayer to get stuck paying for.”",https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2025/08/09/Electricity_Prices_Data_Centers_38875_c61-0-3242-1856_s1200x700.jpg?546181bf4129e33721e2a4efaaef9f0032d2145e,N,,2025-08-09 12:05:35.977266

Tesla Supercharger Access Wasn’t A Game Changer One of the reasons I felt confident embarking on my first EV road trip was Tesla Supercharger access.","I've owned an EV for more than a year. I scored a deal on a 2024 Hyundai Ioniq 5 SEL AWD. I've enjoyed the car. I've put more than 5,000 all-electric miles on it. I've evangelized about how hassle-free EV ownership can be. What I had not done was the most anxiety-inducing part of EV ownership: taking a road trip. Not a really long drive. But a 600-plus-mile round-trip trek with my wife and kids in tow, requiring planning and multiple charging stops. I finally got the chance a few weekends ago, when friends invited us to their cottage in a picturesque part of Northern Michigan best left unmentioned to New Yorkers.

The experiences in this piece are those of the author and in no way mean to suggest that everyone's experiences will be similar or that infrastructure difficulties will always be this way.

My trip was neither perfect nor painless. But it wasn't a complete disaster. My family made it home with relationships intact. But my experience proved eye-opening. I'm not quite ready to bail on EVs and buy a hybrid. But I have compiled a few, hopefully helpful thoughts on the infrastructure and what I'll be looking for when I buy my next EV.

Range Is Important For EVs

This point is obvious. But it's worth reiterating: the more range your EV has, the less stressful your road trip will be. My threshold for what constitutes ""enough"" range has increased since I took the road trip. The EPA estimates that my 2024 Hyundai Ioniq 5 SEL will achieve 260 miles of range on a single charge. It’s probably a hair less after a year of ownership. But we can use that for the sake of the argument. Typically, I charge to 80 percent. That gives me a little over 200 miles of range to play with in optimal conditions. I don’t commute. My kids attend school within walking distance of our home. I have a Level 2 home charger. I can get to the airport and almost anywhere in Metro Detroit using less than 50 miles of range, round trip. Range is never an issue.

Road trips are atypical. I charged to 100% before leaving. However, after that first leg, I was left with about 200 miles of range to use between stops when charging to 80% – in theory. The car's functional range, presuming one doesn't wish to drain the battery completely, is less than that. For me, double-digits remaining was when the anxiety began creeping in. I started cutting my speed, rationing the air conditioning, and monitoring the delta between the range and distance remaining like a hawk. Hitting my first charging stop with the car showing 30 miles of range left was cutting it closer than I would have liked.

Not everyone can afford a Lucid Air or a Rivian Max Pack. However, even increasing the range from 250 miles to above 300 miles with a vehicle like the front-wheel-drive Chevrolet Equinox EV can reduce anxiety and, potentially, make the difference between needing a second stop or shortening your trip by half an hour to 45 minutes by avoiding it.

2024 Hyundai Ioniq 5 AWD Range Versus Rivals

Range Calculators Are An Underrated Feature

My Ioniq 5 predates the 2025 refresh. The car's performance is top-notch. However, the software to manage that performance is lacking. The Ioniq 5's range calculator determines the range with a heavy weight on previous driving. That's fine during everyday usage. That's not ideal for a road trip when you go from 100% city driving to less efficient highway cruising.

When I began my drive with a 100% battery charge, my car told me I had 344 miles of range. That estimate presumed I would continue city driving in warm weather and traveling more than four miles per kWh. I knew the car would not achieve that figure. But I figured 216 miles to the first charging stop would be a safe bet. We made it with 30 miles remaining after 220 miles.

My anxiety stemmed not so much from the range but from not being able to trust what the car was telling me. The delta between my remaining range and the charging stop held steady for about the first hour or so of the drive. Then it began plummeting, particularly when the remaining range fell below 200 miles. I departed our food stop with 121 miles of range and 67 miles to the charger. That delta dipped to just 30 miles by the time I parked at the charger.

The ability to plan ahead is only as good as your data. I would have loved a feature like the integrated Google Maps in GM EVs that can map you to your destination, factor in the charging stop, and provide a relatively accurate estimate of how much battery life would be left when you arrive.

Tesla Supercharger Access Wasn’t A Game Changer

One of the reasons I felt confident embarking on my first EV road trip was Tesla Supercharger access. Hyundai sent me a free NACS adapter for my Ioniq 5. Stations are well-dispersed and maintained. Stations have numerous chargers. It felt like that network would be a reliable security blanket, making road tripping easier. It wasn't.

Adding Tesla Supercharger access didn't add places for me to stop. Other fast-charging providers in Michigan are, for the most part, not filling the gaps. Companies like Electrify America are simply placing their chargers adjacent to Tesla Superchargers. In that scenario, there's no reason to use Tesla's charging. My Ioniq 5 can charge more than twice as fast on a 350 kW charger. And paying by tapping my credit card was easier.

The one time I needed Tesla Superchargers to come through it became a near nightmare. I pulled into Bay City, MI, with about 80 miles left to travel and about 95 miles to go. It was 96 degrees. I had not noticed on the PlugShare app before leaving that all Electrify America chargers there were out of service. Tesla's eight supercharging bays were open for use. The trouble is that traffic was heavy. Most EVs on the road are Teslas. And all the bays were full.

Ford's Blue Oval Network Was My Salvation

I waited in line for a few minutes before a bay opened up. I pulled in. The problem was that Tesla's cord was too short. It only reaches Tesla ports on the left rear of the vehicle. The Ioniq 5 has its charger on the right side. My options were to wait by the one bay I could angle my car into or wait for two consecutive spaces to open up and claim them both. I did find salvation, but it came at a Blue Oval Network charger at a Ford dealer a mile away.

Better Infrastructure Around The EV Charger Could Make A Huge Difference

Charging time is important. But it’s only part of the time you spend off the highway. The distance to the charger and poor infrastructure around it can increase the stop time. Most EV fast chargers in Michigan reside at large big-box retailers like Meijer (or ""Meijer’s"" if you’re a Michigander). That’s good in a sense: Meijer stores are already strategically located at hubs. But they are typically off the main drag, around a mile or two from the highway. Driving to and fro can add three to five minutes to the stop length on both ends.

Having the charger at Meijer is great for bathroom access and potential grocery shopping. But they are typically located away from the restaurants and fast food outlets just off the highway. So, you can’t just get lunch in the dead time while charging. A typical stop could look like this: drive a half-mile east, wait in a drive-thru line for 10-15 minutes, then drive 2.5 miles back across the highway in the opposite direction (five or so minutes) to reach the charger. Spend 15-20 minutes charging. Spend another 3-5 minutes driving back to the highway.

Real time spent can be upwards of 40 minutes. Food near the chargers or chargers at food outlets could significantly reduce that time. And the time savings may even be worth having to scarf down $13 Elon dogs.

When EV Infrastructure Worked, It Was Great

But for the aforementioned snafu in Bay City, my charging experiences were pleasant. My Ioniq 5 charged like a beast on Electrify America chargers, reaching a peak of 220 kW. Going from 13% to 80% took a little over 20 minutes.

I also found a bank of 160 kW fast chargers at City Hall in Cheboygan, MI. None of them were in use on a Saturday night. I left the car on the charger while we got the kids ice cream and stopped for an outdoor beer. It was 100 percent full when I returned an hour or so later. It also allows me to tap my card to pay, rather than using an app. The extra charging allowed us to take a detour to a lighthouse on the way home.",https://static0.carbuzzimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/ioniq-5-road-trip-lead.JPG,N,,2025-08-09 12:04:32.197064

""The great concern is about natural gas,"" said Bodman.
Several Louisiana-based natural gas processors still are not functioning, ""and the status of many of them is uncertain,'' Bodman said.
""It's also important to note that natural gas utilities purchase natural gas in the spring and summer that they store for later use during the colder months.
Meanwhile, another energy company on Tuesday revised its third quarter and full-year oil and natural gas production figures because of Katrina.","Two senior Bush administration officials warned Tuesday of possible natural gas shortages because of the slow recovery following Hurricane Katrina, and their statements were mirrored in the Minerals Management Service report, which showed shut-in gas volumes had barely inched down in 24 hours to 3.720 Bcf/d, or 37.20% of daily gas production offshore, compared with Monday's shut-in report of 3.784 Bcf/d. Leaping into the breach, the American Gas Association (AGA) quickly announced that it expected no supply disruptions this winter.

The cumulative shut-in gas production since Aug. 26 is 95.476 Bcf, equivalent to 2.616% of the yearly production of 3.65 Tcf of gas in the Gulf of Mexico (GOM).

Shut-in oil production as of midday Tuesday was 846,720 bbl/d, equivalent to 56.45% of the normal daily oil production in the GOM, which was 1.5 million bbl/d. The cumulative shut-in oil production since Aug. 26 is 19.690 million bbl, equivalent to 3.596 % of the yearly 547.5 million bbl of oil production offshore.

As of Tuesday, 10.62% of 819 manned platforms and 1.49% of 134 rigs currently operating in the Gulf remained evacuated.

Energy Secretary Samuel Bodman and Interior Secretary Gail Norton, touring the Gulf Coast region on Tuesday, told reporters that gas shortages are possible because of the slow recovery to damaged production and related facilities both on and offshore. The two flew to Baton Rouge, LA from Houston after meeting with several senior energy executives Monday night to discuss their recovery efforts following the hurricane.

""The great concern is about natural gas,"" said Bodman. Less is known about the damage to the gas supply system than the effect on crude oil production because of possible offshore pipeline damage still not discovered and flooded gas processing facilities onshore.

Several Louisiana-based natural gas processors still are not functioning, ""and the status of many of them is uncertain,'' Bodman said. With the United States headed into the winter heating season, gas inventories are at ""lower levels than we would like."" The U.S. has no emergency gas reserve similar to the strategic oil reserve, he noted.

About 90% of the Gulf oil platforms are expected to be capable of production by the end of September, said Norton. However, damage to onshore facilities may reduce oil output offshore, and in turn slow processing onshore, which may have to be rerouted.

Norton said, ""There is more concern about gas because we don't have an international market"" to use for additional gas supplies.

Offshore gas production's return to normal ""depends on things like Highway 23,"" she said. Highway 23 runs south from New Orleans along a narrow peninsula highway running parallel to several refineries, gas processors and pipelines, which is where Katrina came onshore.

Among the gas facilities located along Highway 23 is Dynegy Inc.'s Venice, LA plant in Plaquemines Parish, which was flooded, and has a capacity of 1.3 Bcf/d. Another Dynegy gas processing plant, the Yscloskey facility in flooded St. Bernard Parish along the highway, can process 1.85 Bcf/d. Another damaged gas processor, Enterprise Products Partners LP's plant in Toca, may be returned to service in a few weeks, said spokesman Randy Burkhalter. The plant has a 1.1 Bcf/d processing capacity.

The highway and the region remain under water in several places, and the area also is blocked by many obstacles, including wrecked boats, Norton said. She based her comments on aerial photographs taken of the damaged region.

The comments of the two administration leaders drew no reaction from the natural gas futures market, which already had factored in an extended downtime, but it did get a rise out of the AGA, which represents 195 utility companies who would rather not have the general public push the panic button.

In response to Norton's and Bodman's comments the AGA late Tuesday said, ""Katrina has created disruptions in the flow of natural gas from the eastern region of the Gulf of Mexico, further tightening the natural gas market and pushing both current and projected prices sharply higher. However, natural gas utilities have a supply portfolio that extends well beyond the Gulf of Mexico. Natural gas utilities rely on natural gas from a variety of sources to provide service to their customers, including the western Gulf of Mexico, Texas, Oklahoma, New Mexico, the mountain West, Appalachia and Canada. In addition, a small but growing amount of natural gas is imported from overseas in liquefied form. It is estimated that gas supply volumes today are roughly 94% of the pre-Katrina levels.

""It's also important to note that natural gas utilities purchase natural gas in the spring and summer that they store for later use during the colder months. According to the latest statistics from the federal Energy Information Agency, natural gas storage currently is ahead of the five-year average for this time of year. Assuming that the production, processing and delivery system for natural gas continues to improve, or at least does not deteriorate, AGA anticipates no unusual supply disruptions this winter.""

Meanwhile, another energy company on Tuesday revised its third quarter and full-year oil and natural gas production figures because of Katrina. PetroQuest Energy Inc. dropped its third quarter production guidance to 46-49 MMcfe/d from a previously issued guidance of 49-53 MMcfe/d, ""primarily due to production downtime during Hurricane Katrina, production that remains shut in as a result of the hurricane and a deferral of initial production at the company's Pebble Beach prospect due to the hurricane.""

PetroQuest production that remains shut-in is approximately 2.3 Mcfe/d, and ""is contingent on third-party pipelines and processing facilities."" PetroQuest still expects initial production from its Pebble Beach prospect in October. After full inspections were completed, the company found no reservoir damage and only minor superficial damage sustained to surface facilities.

Additionally, PetroQuest revised full-year 2005 production guidance to 47-50 MMcfe/d, down from previous guidance of 50-55 MMcfe/d because of hurricane-related issues, as well as a deferral of production from the company's Main Pass facilities. Main Pass production is contingent on third-party pipelines and processing facilities being put back into service. The company expects to complete its lateral line connection in October and production to resume at Main Pass in November.

Originally seen as a simple and affordable mobility option, LSEVs are now evolving into smart, connected vehicles playing a critical role in last-mile connectivity, green logistics, and even urban planning.

These vehicles are lightweight, inexpensive, and exempt from license and registration requirements. That makes them especially appealing to students, senior citizens, gig workers, and cost-conscious commuters. But what’s more significant is how these so-called “slow” scooters are driving a much faster transformation in the way India moves, plans, and powers its cities.

Accessible, Affordable, and Smart by Design

LSEVs offer one of the easiest entry points into the electric mobility space. With lower price tags compared to high-speed EVs and virtually no paperwork required in many states, they democratize access to clean transport. Riders save not just on upfront costs, but also operational ones with running costs estimated at just ₹0.20/km, a fraction of traditional petrol scooters.

These LSEVs can go up to 50- 100 kms on a single charge. Despite their simplicity, today’s LSEVs come with features once found only in premium vehicles. Many models include smart dashboards, regenerative braking, GPS tracking, and app-based controls for battery monitoring and geofencing (the use of GPS technology to create a virtual geographic boundary) helps a fleet trigger a response when a vehicle enters or leaves a defined area. That makes them not only economical, but intelligent.

Making Fleets Smarter and Greener

What truly sets connected LSEVs apart is their utility in fleet operations. With built-in IoT systems and real-time GPS connectivity, operators can monitor vehicle usage, manage cost, schedule maintenance, and optimize delivery routes.

This enables more efficient logistics, especially for last-mile connectivity. Also, shared mobility companies and delivery services are deploying thousands of such connected scooters across urban centers. The result is lower fuel costs, better route planning, and measurable sustainability outcomes

Charging Infrastructure Is Catching Up

One of the early limitations for EVs i.e. access to charging is rapidly being addressed. In Delhi, policies now mandate a charging or battery-swapping station every 5 km. Across India, new Swapping as well as charging infrastructure is being installed in residential areas, malls, metro stations, and parking lots. What’s more, battery-as-a-service (BaaS) models allow users to swap batteries in under Two minutes, an ideal solution for fleet operators or gig workers who can’t afford high upfront cost as well as long charging downtimes. This convenience is critical for scaling adoption.

Everyday Mobility Meets Urban Sustainability

From the everyday urban user perspective, LSEVs are a functional option for everything from daily tasks, commuting to work, dropping kids off at school, or just a quick jaunt around the neighborhood. Their size allows for quick parking and maneuverability, and their quiet and non-polluting operation is often more suitable to urban and high-density living.

For commercial delivery fleets, LSEVs are quickly becoming the vehicle of choice with operating ranges consistently above 100 Km per charge and low maintenance costs. With fuel prices increasing and urban congestion continuing, the case for electrification has never been better.

Building Smarter Cities, One Scooter at a Time

Beyond their everyday utility, connected LSEVs are playing a subtle but powerful role in the evolution of smart cities. These scooters generate anonymized data on movement patterns, traffic bottlenecks, and energy use insights that urban planners can use to improve transport infrastructure, reduce congestion, and plan EV-ready zones.

Their environmental benefits are also cumulative. The more such vehicles hit the road, the lower the emissions, noise pollution, and traffic burden in our cities. They are helping to shift India’s mobility model from reactive to responsive from just commuting to communicating.

The Road Ahead

India’s electric mobility future isn’t being built only by high-speed vehicles or premium cars. It’s being shaped day by day by low-speed, smart scooters that quietly do the heavy lifting of daily transport, delivery, and data collection. With battery technology improving, infrastructure expanding, and policies aligning, connected LSEVs are no longer the side story. They are the first step in building a new kind of city one that’s cleaner, quieter, and more connected.

(He’s thinking about running for Senate.)

He’s also on the lam. The state speaker of the house ordered arrest warrants for Talarico and dozens of Democrats who left the state last weekend to prevent a vote on a mid-decade redistricting plan that would likely give Republicans five more congressional seats. “Right before we got on the flight to leave Texas, we all gathered in an interfaith prayer, holding each other’s hands, because this is not just a political struggle, it’s also a spiritual struggle,” Talarico says. I spoke to the legislator via Zoom from an undisclosed location outside Chicago on Thursday, hours after Republican Sen. John Cornyn—a man he may end up running against next fall—announced that the Trump administration would assign FBI agents to help “hold these supposed lawmakers accountable.” This conversation has been edited for length and clarity.

Tim Murphy: Sen. John Cornyn says the FBI has agreed to help locate you. How does it feel to officially be wanted by the FBI?

James Talarico: Well, I mean, I think Senator Cornyn is trying to stay relevant in his primary battle with Ken Paxton. So I understand the gimmick, but I think it should trouble us that any politician is trying to use the resources of the state to arrest or remove duly elected legislators who are exercising their constitutional right to break quorum. The Texas State Constitution gives us this tool in our toolbox as the minority to check the abuses of the majority, and so we’re not doing anything wrong. And there’s about 200 years of history in this country of legislators breaking quorum, including Abraham Lincoln. You know, we’re here in Illinois, in the Land of Lincoln. And that’s appropriate because, because Abraham Lincoln broke quorum in 1840 as a state senator by jumping out of the window of the Illinois State Capitol. And thankfully, I didn’t have to jump out of any windows back in Texas. But this is not unusual. It is a tool the minority has. And so for Greg Abbott to threaten to remove us from office, for Ken Paxton and John Cornyn to be threatening our arrest, it is unacceptable in a democracy, and this is a page out of an authoritarian playbook we’ve seen in other countries, and it should be alarming to all of us, regardless of our political party.

TM: So what’s at stake here? Why are you here—wherever you are?

JT: Trump is asking Texas Republicans to redraw the maps that they just drew in 2021 to get him five more seats to protect his majority in Congress, because he’s worried about losing it in the next election, and it’s because his policies are unpopular, right? He’s starting wars and wrecking the economy. He’s protecting pedophiles. He’s kicking millions of people off their health care to fund tax breaks for billionaires, and those policies deserve to be evaluated by the American people and the only way we can hold the most powerful politician our country accountable is through free and fair elections, especially in the midterms, and that’s what’s at stake here. And it’s not just a Texas problem. It’s an American problem.

TM: What persuaded you to actually leave? Because it seems like there was a bit of debate among Democrats, and not all of your colleagues actually have left the state.

JT: When Donald Trump asked Georgia Republicans to find him 11,000 more votes after he lost the 2020 election, they said, No, sir. But when Trump asked Texas Republicans to find him five more congressional seats ahead of the 2026 elections, they said, How about Thursday? So the responsibility to defend and fix this representative democracy of ours fell to Texas Democrats, and 57 of us answered the call, and we’re proud to do so, regardless of what consequences we may face.

TM: Can you tell me a little bit about where you are, as much as you’re able to say?

JT: Well, we’re here in Illinois, and in a nondescript hotel room, as you can see, and that’s for security reasons. As you may have read, we had a bomb threat called into our hotel, and Ken Paxton has put out a tweet asking his followers to “hunt us down.” And so, you know, we’re trying to keep all of our members safe, all of our staff members safe, as we do this important work of fixing this democracy of ours so that it can work for every Texan and every American.

TM: What was that bomb threat like?

JT: It was early in the morning. I woke up to the bomb threat, and a lot of my colleagues did. And it was certainly scary, because we all had to evacuate, and law enforcement swarmed the premises, and we were outside for hours. But I think it’s a reminder that what we’re doing is very important. They wouldn’t be trying to bomb you if you’re not doing something consequential. And we feel that we are at the front lines of protecting and hopefully advancing the American experiment, because if people—Democrats, independents and Republicans alike—can’t hold their elected officials accountable in a midterm election, if they’re not able to change their government from the bottom up, if they’re not able to elect the representatives of their choice, then we no longer have representative democracy and and we’re not ready to accept that.

TM: Texas legislators make something like $7,200 a year. You’re not swimming in inherited wealth or anything like that. Are you putting everything on your card while you’re up here or is somebody else paying for the hotel room? How does this work financially?

JT: It depends. You know, we’re facing financial penalties, fines from the state legislature for breaking quorum. It’s about $500 a day. Those we’re going to pay ourselves, which certainly won’t be easy to do depending how long this lasts, but we will be paying those fines ourselves. Travel, food, lodging—that we’re able to pay out of our campaign accounts, out of the caucus’ account. And thankfully, you know, we have been flooded with grassroots donations from all across Texas, from all across America. You know, $5, $10, $15—regular people funding this operation of ours. And it’s appropriate because we’re fighting for the people, not just Democrats, but independents and Republicans too, and it’s appropriate that those people are the ones funding this effort.

TM: What did you expect from this episode, versus what you’ve gotten? Because it seems a bit more intense than what you went through in 2021.

JT: I think that’s right. I’ve been frankly shocked at how Texas Republicans have conducted themselves, you know, endangering the safety of their colleagues, threatening to remove those colleagues from their duly elected positions and then, you know, people like Donald Trump sending in the FBI to find us. So that kind of rhetoric, those kind of actions, should be deeply disturbing to every American, regardless of their political affiliation, because we’ve seen how this authoritarian playbook works out in other countries, and it doesn’t lead anywhere good.

TM: There’s been a lot of legal threats swirling around this, from Ken Paxton, John Cornyn, Donald Trump, Greg Abbott. How much of this is kind of jockeying for the primary, as you mentioned, and how much of this is like real legal threats that you’re concerned about?

JT: It’s hard to tell. And you know, we think they’re on pretty dubious legal ground but unfortunately, our courts have become highly politicized. They’ve been bought by big money, particularly in Texas, and so it may not matter what the law says. It may just matter what the politics requires, and so we’ll see how this plays out. But my colleagues and I are not going to be deterred. We are here to fight for our constituents and fight for all Texans. We’re here to fight for free and fair elections for every single person in this country and we’re participating in a long American tradition of standing up to bullies, of speaking truth to power, of civil disobedience, of good trouble.

TM: There’s a push to have Democrats respond in kind with redistricting elsewhere. It’s something that Illinois Governor JB Pritzker has called for. Do you think that that’s something that Democrats can actually level the playing field with or is that a losing battle against a party that controls a lot more states?

JT: Our ultimate goal is to get the politics out of redistricting everywhere. We should ban gerrymandering across this country, in every state, red states and blue states alike. It’s why I filed a bill in the Texas legislature to create an independent, citizen led redistricting commission so that voters can choose their politicians instead of politicians choosing their voters. That said, if one side is intent on cheating—which is exactly what Texas Republicans are doing and what Donald Trump is doing by redrawing the maps in the middle of the decade at the direct request of the most powerful man in the country—they are attempting to rig the next election. There’s no other way to describe it. And so if that’s the case, if one side’s going to cheat, all bets are off. And Democrats should not unilaterally disarm, but we should maintain our vision for how we can ultimately fix this democracy so it can work for regular people all over the country.

TM: Do you really think that you can stop this particular redistricting effort from advancing, if you come back and Greg Abbott just calls another session and another session after that?

JT: If every American who took a brave stand throughout our history did it because they knew they were going to win, we’d probably have a very different country right now. Sometimes you have to stand up, even if you’re not sure if you’ll be successful. But I can just tell you, over the last four days of this special session and of this quorum break, we have shined a national, an international spotlight on this power grab in Texas, and that, in and of itself, is a victory. People and the media are talking about this in a way they weren’t before. Sometimes the media needs conflict to be able to report on the news, and so we’re happy to provide that to make sure that all Americans are informed about what’s happening in their name and what’s happening in their government, and how the most powerful politician in the country is trying to rig the upcoming midterm elections. But if we can inspire blue states to respond in kind, if we can inspire acts of courage across the country to stand up to these would be tyrants, then we’re going to consider that a victory.

TM: What would you like to be working on in a special session if you were back in Austin, not not dealing with redistricting?

JT: I think the top of the list is relief for those flood victims and their families in the Texas Hill Country, an area of the state that means a lot to me personally, where I’ve spent a lot of time, where my family has lived, and so we need to get that relief to that community, and we’ve got to prevent a disaster like that from happening ever again in our state. We showed up two weeks ago at the beginning of this special session, and we begged our Republican colleagues to prioritize flood relief and disaster mitigation, and they refused to do so. They held 12 hearings on redistricting, and they held two hearings on flood relief. They didn’t even file a flood bill, and so instead, they put flood victims and their families at the end of the agenda and used them as leverage to try to rig the next election and pass these correct maps. It’s cynical politics at its worst. It’s deeply immoral, and it should outrage all of us, regardless of our party.

TM: You’ve been floated as a candidate for US Senator and governor. Have you narrowed that search at all, or the timeline for that?",https://www.motherjones.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/20250808-james-talarico2000px.jpg?w=1200&h=630&crop=1,N,,2025-08-09 12:04:56.671978

In contrast, resilience-driven innovators are leveraging technology and policy to create infrastructure that is not only climate-proof but economically robust.","The global economy is at a crossroads. Climate-driven disruptions—from wildfires to hurricanes—are no longer distant threats but recurring realities reshaping financial markets. For utility stocks, which form the backbone of energy and water infrastructure, the stakes are particularly high. While the sector has shown resilience in 2025, with the Morningstar US Utilities Index up 12% year-to-date, underlying vulnerabilities are growing. Meanwhile, a new wave of infrastructure innovators is emerging, leveraging technology and policy to build systems that not only withstand climate shocks but thrive in them. For investors, this duality presents a critical choice: mitigate risk by avoiding climate-vulnerable utilities or capitalize on the opportunities in resilience-driven innovation.

The Growing Financial Risk of Climate Vulnerability

Utility stocks, long prized for their defensive characteristics, are now facing a perfect storm of climate and regulatory pressures. Natural disasters are exacting a heavy toll. For instance, CenterPoint Energy's $1.8 billion in restoration costs from Hurricane Beryl in 2024 underscores the operational and financial fragility of climate-exposed utilities. Similarly, Southern California's 2025 wildfires, projected to be the most expensive in history, highlight the sector's exposure to regional climate risks. Utilities in high-risk areas—such as Florida and the Southwest—are particularly vulnerable, with restoration costs often exceeding revenue streams and requiring regulatory approval to pass expenses to customers.

Regulatory shifts further complicate the landscape. The One Big Beautiful Bill Act's accelerated timeline for Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) clean energy tax credits has forced utilities to rush projects online by 2027. While this drives short-term growth in renewables, it also creates bottlenecks in supply chains and regulatory approvals, delaying critical infrastructure upgrades. Meanwhile, interest rates remain a headwind. At 4.7%, the 10-year Treasury yield now outpaces utility dividend yields (3.3%), the largest discount since 2008. This inversion signals a loss of appeal for income-focused investors, compounding pressure on utilities to innovate or risk obsolescence.

The financial risks are not abstract. Avista Corp.'s Q2 2025 earnings decline of 41%—driven by devalued clean technology investments—illustrates the volatility of utilities struggling to balance climate adaptation with profitability. Even as core operations show resilience, the sector's long-term viability hinges on its ability to future-proof infrastructure against a rapidly changing climate.

The Investment Opportunity in Resilience-Driven Infrastructure Innovators

Amid these challenges, a new class of infrastructure innovators is redefining the rules of the game. These companies are not merely mitigating climate risks; they are transforming them into competitive advantages. Consider BETA Technologies, a leader in battery-powered aircraft. With a backlog of 600 orders from clients like Air New Zealand and the U.S. Air Force, BETA's zero-emission solutions are gaining traction in both commercial and defense sectors. Its financial performance—driven by contracts with high-profile partners—demonstrates the scalability of climate-resilient technologies.

In the energy space, Fervo Energy is pioneering geothermal power, with a project slated to deliver 400 megawatts of carbon-free electricity by 2028. Backed by the U.S. Air Force and private investors, Fervo's approach combines advanced drilling techniques with AI-driven resource mapping, reducing costs and accelerating deployment. Similarly, Heirloom, a carbon removal startup, has shipped the first carbon credits under the Frontier fund, attracting investments from Bill Gates' Breakthrough Energy and Stripe. Its direct air capture technology offers a scalable solution for corporate net-zero commitments, aligning with regulatory pressures and investor demand for measurable impact.

These innovators share a common trait: they address climate vulnerabilities through technological and operational agility. For example, HA Sustainable Infrastructure Capital (HASI) has grown managed assets to $14.6 billion by focusing on high-yield, ESG-aligned projects, including solar and storage. Its 25% year-over-year increase in Adjusted Recurring Net Investment Income (ARNII) to $85 million underscores the financial viability of resilience-driven strategies.

Strategic Implications for Investors

The contrast between climate-vulnerable utilities and resilience-driven innovators is stark. While the former face declining margins and regulatory uncertainty, the latter are capturing market share by solving the very problems that threaten traditional infrastructure. For investors, this divergence demands a recalibration of risk-return profiles.

Diversify Exposure to Resilience-Driven Sectors: Allocate capital to companies that integrate climate resilience into their core operations. This includes geothermal energy (e.g., Fervo), carbon removal (e.g., Heirloom), and advanced grid technologies. These firms are positioned to benefit from both regulatory tailwinds and growing demand for sustainable infrastructure.

Prioritize ESG Alignment: Utilities with strong environmental, social, and governance (ESG) credentials—like HASI—are better equipped to navigate climate risks. ESG metrics are increasingly predictive of long-term financial performance, particularly in sectors exposed to regulatory and physical climate shocks.

Monitor Policy and Interest Rate Dynamics: The IRA's tax credits and the One Big Beautiful Bill Act's deadlines will shape the energy transition. Investors should track how utilities and innovators adapt to these timelines, as well as how interest rate trends affect borrowing costs for infrastructure projects.

Conclusion: Building a Climate-Resilient Portfolio

The 2025 landscape is defined by a tension between risk and opportunity. Climate-vulnerable utilities, despite their defensive appeal, are increasingly exposed to volatility from natural disasters, regulatory shifts, and interest rate pressures. In contrast, resilience-driven innovators are leveraging technology and policy to create infrastructure that is not only climate-proof but economically robust.

For investors, the path forward is clear: shift capital toward companies that are redefining resilience in the face of climate-driven disruptions. By doing so, they can mitigate risk while capturing the upside of a sector poised for transformation. In an era of uncertainty, the most successful portfolios will be those that anticipate the future rather than react to it.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-08-10 02:08:16.382729

World-leading production and unmatched environmental progress define the Permian Basin. In one of the most prolific oil and natural gas basins in the world, Permian Basin operators have slashed methane emission intensity by more than half in just two years, reinforcing Texas as the global standard bearer in energy leadership. This groundbreaking achievement, detailed in a new report from S&P Global Commodity Insights, is far more than a statistical blip; it’s a testament to the hard work, proactive efforts, and constant innovation of Texas oil and natural gas operators.

This dramatic reduction in methane intensity is a direct result of our industry’s focus on deploying cutting-edge technologies, implementing best operating practices, and making substantial investments in infrastructure and innovation. From advanced leak detection and repair programs to strategic use of artificial intelligence and the modernization of equipment, our industry is leading the charge in minimizing emissions.

In fact, this remarkable progress has occurred even as volumes in the Permian Basin have continued to increase, demonstrating that environmental progress and robust production can and do go hand in hand. And the stakes have never been higher. Energy security is national security, and by producing energy cleanly and efficiently, our state is strengthening its position as a reliable energy provider both to our nation and our allies around the globe.

Industry-led partnerships like the Texas Methane & Flaring Coalition and the Environmental Partnership have been in essential in bringing scores of operators together in a collaborative manner with the shared goal of eliminating routine flaring by 2030 through identifying and advocating for best practices. By working together, we will continue to champion policies that foster innovation and allow our industry to lead by example.

Despite efforts by opponents to dismantle the Texas oil and natural gas industry, our industry is responding with an unwavering commitment to environmental stewardship—proving that no one produces, transports, refines, or exports energy to higher standards. This is the same industry that contributes $27 billion annually in state and local taxes and royalties, directly funding our schools, universities, road infrastructure, and countless other essential services, while supporting billions in payroll and millions of jobs.

The Texas oil and natural gas industry is busy benefiting every Texan, every day, whether you live in the oil patch or not. This new data is a powerful affirmation of our progress, and a clear signal that the Lone Star State is, and will remain, at the forefront of energy leadership for generations to come.

Counting the procession of acting IRS heads that followed Werfel’s departure (Werfel was forced out by President Donald Trump when Long was nominated), Long was the sixth person to run the IRS since the beginning of the year. He will be replaced by Scott Bessent, who will serve as Acting Commissioner at the same time he serves as the Secretary of the Treasury.

It’s not just those at the top who are exiting the agency. As I reported earlier, the IRS workforce dropped from 103,000 employees in January 2025 to approximately 77,000 in May 2025 (a 25% reduction).

The departures of leadership and the general workforce come just as the IRS is gearing up for next year's tax season–the start date has not been determined. Long raised eyebrows last month when he suggested that the filing season should start around Presidents Day (February 16). The IRS quickly walked that back, noting, “The IRS looks forward to another successful tax filing season next year, and we will announce the timing of its opening in the regular course.""

The IRS has also announced that, despite new tax breaks for tipped and overtime income that take effect, retroactively for all of 2025, there will be no changes to withholding tables for 2025 or changes to certain information returns, including Form W-2, Forms 1099, Form 941 and other payroll return forms for 2025. Employers and payroll providers should continue using current procedures for reporting and withholding.

According to the IRS, these moves are ""intended to avoid disruptions during the tax filing season and to give the IRS, business and tax professionals enough time to implement the changes effectively.” But not all tax professionals agree. Among other questions raised by the move, with no changes to Form W-2, it’s now unclear how that income will be reported for purposes of claiming the deduction for overtime (overtime is currently not separately stated on Form W-2).

Another issue related to the One Big Beautiful Bill Act that’s making news: recent headlines suggesting that certain tax issues could lead to the loss of U.S. citizenship. This fear is now being amplified on various platforms and stems from a case involving Vanessa Ben, a Houston woman facing denaturalization over her admission of tax fraud prior to naturalizing. Taxpayers should be cautious of overly alarmist narratives or unscrupulous tax professionals who may be seeking to profit from the overwhelming sense of panic. False tax returns, for example, may constitute tax fraud if the return was filed with intent to evade taxes. Distinguishing between honest errors and willful misconduct is key.

Tax evasion was also in the news this week following a guilty plea from Timothy McPhee, a Colorado man who promoted the use of an illegal tax shelter. A tax shelter is a financial strategy used to reduce taxable income. Not all tax shelters are illegal—Iegal tax shelters include tax-favored accounts like retirement account. But illegal tax shelters—those created to generate unintended tax “benefits”—are created for the purpose of evading tax.

McPhee promoted an abusive tax shelter made up of a private family foundation and three trusts: a business trust, a family trust, and a charitable trust. The trusts were successively layered, meaning that each trust named the next trust in the series as its beneficiary. McPhee taught clients who purchased the tax shelter how to use the trusts and foundation to evade paying federal income taxes on nearly all their income.

More than two hundred taxpayers nationwide purchased the abusive tax shelter. These clients collectively sheltered approximately $159 million in income, which resulted in the underpayment of about $45 million in federal income taxes.

While willful behaviors can land you in big tax trouble, you can also fall into tax trouble. As meme stocks have made something of a comeback this summer, investors risk running afoul of the too-often neglected “wash sale” rule.

Here’s how that can happen. When you’re buying and selling stocks quickly, you may trade winners and losers within days of each other. But when you sell a stock or other security at a loss and then buy the same security—or a similar one—within 30 days before or after the sale, it’s considered a wash sale. The loss is then disallowed, meaning you can't use it to offset any capital gains. That can result in an ugly tax bill.

Buying and selling within a short time frame may be done deliberately as part of a strategy that some taxpayers use to reduce their tax bill. Sometimes referred to as tax-loss harvesting, the goal is to sell stocks that are losing money and use the loss to offset the money-makers. That still works, so long as you don’t run afoul of the wash sale rules.

Importantly, the transaction doesn’t have to be intentional to trigger the wash sale rule. Dividend reinvestment and employee stock plan acquisitions may create a wash sale, as could buying and selling quickly. It’s important to keep good records and double-check at tax time to see whether your transactions might count as wash sales. Or better yet, avoid wash sales when you trade. The rules involving wash sales and a lot of other tax rules too, are complex, so even when you’re aware of them, it’s easy to fall into a tax trap. A financial or tax advisor may be able to help you avoid the pitfalls—and a hefty tax bill.

Speaking of double-checking, eagle-eye readers may have noticed that last week’s email edition of the newsletter had some duplicated paragraphs. When I put together the newsletter each week, it gets edited and then moved over into two different applications–one for the email newsletter and one for the online version. That usually happens on Friday evenings to make sure that you have the most up-to-date news possible. In my zeal to transfer the copy over, I apparently pasted it twice and didn’t catch it when I sent out my test versions. On an early Saturday morning read, you might have thought you just needed a second cup of coffee. Nope–that was just my mistake. My apologies for the error.

Questions

This week, a reader asks:

There are a lot of dates in the One Big Beautiful Act. With school starting soon, can you tell me when the new 529 provisions kick in? Is it next year?

A section 529 plan is a tax-advantaged savings plan designed to encourage saving for education expenses. As written, earnings in 529 plans grow tax-free, and withdrawals for qualified education expenses are also tax-free.

The new tax law allows up to $10,000 in tax-free distributions this year from section 529 plans to be used for additional educational expenses in connection with enrollment or attendance at an elementary or secondary school, including private schools and religious schools. Those expenses include tuition, curricular materials, books and other instructional materials, online materials, and tuition for tutoring. Expenses may also include educational therapies for students with disabilities provided by a licensed or accredited practitioner or provider, including occupational, behavioral, physical, and speech-language therapies.

Finally, it also includes test fees for achievement tests, Advanced Placement (AP) exams, and college admissions exams (such as the SAT) and fees for dual enrollment in an institution of higher education (college courses that count for both high school and college credit).

The law also allows tax-free distributions to be used for additional qualified higher education expenses, including “qualified postsecondary credentialing expenses”—this is similar to the criteria for the Lifetime Learning Credit.

Account owners can begin using 529 funds for the new expenses as of July 5, 2025. So, if you have expenses to pay, you can make your withdrawals now. A little extra good news? Beginning January 1, 2026, the expense limit will rise to $20,000 per year.

Do you have a tax question that you think we should cover in the next newsletter? We'd love to help if we can. Check out our guidelines and submit a question here.

Statistics, Charts, and Graphs

How did the IRS spend $79.5 billion in supplemental funding allocated by Congress as part of the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (IRA)? Here’s a hint: It didn’t.

While Congress IRS initially earmarked $79.4 billion in supplemental funding to be spent over ten years as part of the IRA, that didn’t last long. Congress subsequently clawed back more than half of that funding, leaving the agency just $37.6 billion, which is expected to last through September 30, 2031. Of the $41.8 billion rescinded by Congress, all of it was taken from money previously earmarked for enforcement.

As of March 31, 2025, the IRS has spent approximately $13.8 billion of that money.

The remaining funding has been earmarked to help improve taxpayer services, modernize technology, and increase compliance and enforcement actions. As you can see from the charts, which shows the split between funds that have been spent versus what remains, by percentages, funding skewed towards enforcement and taxpayer services.

As of March 31, 2025, the IRS has spent money on the following activities:

Operations Support - $6 billion of $25.3 billion

Business Systems Modernization - $2.7 billion of $4.8 billion

Enforcement - $2.7 billion of $3.8 billion

Taxpayer Services - $2.2 billion of $3.2 billion

Energy Security - $63.6 million of $500 million

The IRA funding was intended to supplement, not replace, the agency’s annual appropriation. Notably, the IRS has received the same annual appropriation each year since the IRA took effect, with no adjustments for inflation. As a result, approximately $2 billion in IRA funds has been used to supplement the IRS annual appropriations, since, according to the IRS, appropriations did not cover normal operating expenses.

A Deeper Dive

Would former President Ronald Reagan have embraced President Trump’s tariffs?

Tax historian Joseph Thorndike says no, writing, “Ronald Reagan was no fan of tariffs. In fact, he was an ardent (if inconstant) champion of free trade and open markets.”

Thorndike suggests that efforts to persuade taxpayers that the opposite is true is historical revisionism. In particular, he notes, it brushes aside Reagan’s many public statements extolling the virtues of free trade — and denouncing the politics of protection.

“A creative, competitive America is the answer to a changing world, not trade wars that would close doors, create greater barriers, and destroy millions of jobs,” Reagan declared in one typical statement. “We should always remember: Protectionism is destructionism.”

As Reagan began his presidency in 1981, the United States was facing a range of challenging economic pressures; rising unemployment and high interest rates were making things hard for many Americans. Some of these problems were linked — both in reality and in the public mind — to international trade, and the new president faced immediate pressure to aid industries struggling in the face of tough foreign competition.

That feels familiar.

“The intensification of foreign competition meant that the political pressures for import restrictions increased dramatically,” explained Douglas Irwin in Clashing Over Commerce, his indispensable history of U.S. trade policy. “The Reagan administration responded by limiting imports in many sectors, but also resisted congressional pressure to do more, particularly with respect to Japan.”

But Reagan's methods were different from those of the current president. Thorndike notes that Reagan pursued international agreements to reduce trade barriers and provide mechanisms for resolving trade disputes and embraced those institutions when attempting to resolve trade disputes over the course of his presidency. And, Thorndike says, Reagan was especially optimistic about the benefits of free trade on the North American continent.

That doesn’t mean that Reagan didn’t take a pro-American stance. He declared, “I believe that if trade is not fair for all, then trade is free in name only. I will not stand by and watch American businesses fail because of unfair trading practices abroad. I will not stand by and watch American workers lose their jobs because other nations do not play by the rules.”

Thorndike says this was tough talk — and good politics, too.

Positions And Guidance

The IRS has published Internal Revenue Bulletin 2025-33.

In a letter submitted to the Treasury and the IRS, the American Institute of CPAs (AICPA) submitted comments on the recently enacted section 174A, which addresses the treatment of domestic research and experimental (R&E) expenditures (domestic research costs). The AICPA is urging Treasury and the IRS to issue immediate guidance that would allow eligible small business taxpayers to immediately deduct domestic research costs on their originally filed 2024 federal income tax returns rather than being required to capitalize those amounts.

Noteworthy

A Pennsylvania proposal, which unanimously passed the House and has moved to the Senate, would update state law to explicitly exempt privately-owned campgrounds from local amusement and admission taxes.

Consumers are rushing out to buy electric vehicles (EV) before the $7,500 tax break for EVs expires. The One Big Beautiful Bill Act eliminates the tax credit after September 30, 2025. According to Cox Automotive data, consumers purchased nearly 130,100 new EVs in July, the second-highest monthly sales tally on record. The July figures represent a 26.4% increase from June and nearly 20% increase year-over-year.

Trivia Answer

The answer is (B).

Guy T. Helvering holds the record as the longest-serving IRS commissioner, with a tenure of ten years and four months, from June 6, 1933, to October 8, 1943. David Blair served eight years, Joseph S. Miller served six years, nine months, and Green B. Raum (yes, that’s a real name) served six years and nine months.

The IRS Restructuring and Reform Act of 1998 set a five-year term of office for IRS Commissioners. Charles Rossotti was the first IRS Commissioner impacted by the new law—he served the full five years, from November 1997 to November 2002.

If the proposal is approved, EPA will no longer have authority under the Clean Air Act to regulate greenhouse gas emissions.
Other potential rollbacks The vehicle emission regulations aren’t the only EPA standards on the chopping block.","When President Donald Trump came into office for a second term, he vowed to roll back environmental regulations he considered burdensome to commerce. Now, the Environmental Protection Agency is attempting to go a step further than just easing regulations. In July, the agency issued a rule proposal to rescind two key scientific conclusions underpinning the basis for many greenhouse gas emission rules under the Clean Water Act.

If approved, the changes would effectively rescind all greenhouse gas regulations for motor vehicles and engines. Some ag advocacy organizations see this development as beneficial to U.S. farmers. Jordan Dux, senior director of national affairs at the Nebraska Farm Bureau Federation, said mandatory Tier 4 diesel emission systems add “tens of thousands to equipment” price tags.

That cost burden doesn’t evaporate away from the dealer lot.

“A vast majority of repairs that new agriculture equipment undergo are emissions-related,” Dux said. “Those systems go down and shut the whole tractor down. Producers can’t work during crunch time. When it comes to planting and harvest, that crunch time is important.”

Greenhouse gas emission standards

Citing several recent advocacy trips to Washington, Dux expressed optimism that the regulations might relax in the coming months.

EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin announced a proposal July 29 to rescind two Obama-era scientific findings regarding greenhouse gases, the Endangerment Finding, and the Cause or Contribute Finding.

Codified in 2009, the first determined that “current and projected concentrations of six key well-mixed greenhouse gases” in the atmosphere threaten the public health and welfare of current and future generations:

The Cause or Contribute Finding concluded motor vehicle emissions contributed to greenhouse gas pollution, threatening public health and welfare. Collectively, those two findings serve as a prerequisite for implementing greenhouse gas emission standards for vehicles and engines.

“The Obama administration moved mountains when they did their endangerment finding. That was the genesis for EPA regulation of greenhouse gases as a pollutant. The Trump administration is working to overturn that, if you will,” Dux explains.

Argument against emission regulations

According to Zeldin, the two findings have been used to “justify over $1 trillion in regulations.” He also believes his rule change will ultimately lower the cost of living and give consumers more choices. He also questions the science underpinning the original laws.

“In our work so far, many stakeholders have told me that the Obama and Biden EPAs twisted the law, ignored precedent, and warped science to achieve their preferred ends and stick American families with hundreds of billions of dollars in hidden taxes every single year,” Zeldin said when he announced the change. “We heard loud and clear the concern that EPA’s GHG emission standards themselves, not carbon dioxide, which the Finding never assessed independently, was the real threat to Americans’ livelihoods.”

Dux said, besides inflating new machinery prices, the emission regulations have a downstream impact on used equipment. Machinery built before 2009, which does not require an emission system, is in higher demand and maintains a higher value. He said American farmers would broadly benefit from regulatory rollbacks.

“We live in very competitive global economy when it comes to agriculture. We want to make sure that U.S. farmers and ranchers have a fair playing field when it comes to producing product at a profitable level,” he said, noting several recent advocacy trips to Washington.

If the proposal is approved, EPA will no longer have authority under the Clean Air Act to regulate greenhouse gas emissions. The rule proposal was added to the Federal Register on Aug. 1 and is now subject to a 90-day public comment period.

Other potential rollbacks

The vehicle emission regulations aren’t the only EPA standards on the chopping block. In March, the Trump administration announced plans to pull back on the Biden-era Waters of the United States rule, which defines the scope of federal protection for the nation’s waterways under the Clean Water Act. As it stands now, Dux said the WOTUS regulation cedes too much control to federal agencies over farming practices.

“The federal government requires producers to apply for a permit to do pesticide applications or planting or anything that disturbs an area that maybe only runs with water during a heavy rain,” Dux said, noting regulatory agencies are “under no obligation to grant that permit. That’s the bigger issue. It really comes down to federal control over private property, and the ability of the federal EPA to say ‘no’ to a producer when he wants to do basic farming, planting, harvesting and crop protection product application.”

Additionally, Dux highlighted a recent “massive overhaul” of federal pesticide regulations, which he expects to greatly benefit farmers.",https://eu-images.contentstack.com/v3/assets/bltdd43779342bd9107/blt6445ceb789b304d5/66f1e2e93331ef1af83516fa/Getty_Images_Scott_Olson_combine_and_grain_cart_at_harvest_1800x1012.jpg?disable=upscale&width=1200&height=630&fit=crop,N,,2025-08-09 14:05:43.205069

The American Clean Power Association (ACP), the American Council on Renewable Energy (ACORE), and Advanced Energy United issued the following statement after jointly filing a rehearing request, urging the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) to reconsider its recently issued protocol aimed at assessing risks to grid reliability and security:

“As demand for energy surges, grid reliability must rely on sound modeling, reasonable forecasts, and unbiased analysis of all technologies. Instead, DOE’s protocol relies on inaccurate and inconsistent assumptions that undercut the credibility of certain technologies in favor of others. Americans deserve to have confidence that the government is taking advantage of ready-to-deploy and affordable resources to support communities across the country. Clean energy technologies are the fastest growing sources of American-made energy that are ready to keep prices down and meet demand.

Providing a roadmap that offers a clear-eyed view of risk is critical to meeting soaring demand across the country. The Department of Energy report missed the opportunity to present all the viable types of energy needed to address reliability and keep energy affordable. We urge DOE to reevaluate and enable those charged with securing and future-proofing our grid to meet the moment with every available resource.”

CHAGRIN FALLS, Ohio (AP) — A significant share of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions comes from heating, cooling and powering homes — about 15%, according to one estimate by the Environmental Protection Agency. So if you want to reduce your carbon footprint, the home is an effective place to start.

There are so many factors involved in a household’s energy consumption, including whether you have gas or electric heat and how you use your kitchen appliances, washer and dryer. It’s often overwhelming to figure out where to begin.

That’s why experts recommend a home energy assessment conducted by a professional. The room-by-room examinations help homeowners determine energy use, discover inefficiencies and create a plan to reduce both. In addition to helping the environment, improving efficiency saves money over the long term.

The assessments typically last several hours and cost anywhere from $100 to more than $1,000. Until the end of the year, the Inflation Reduction Act, a major U.S. climate law passed in 2022, helps cover the cost. Congress recently rescinded many of those benefits, which will be phased out.

I’m a climate reporter, so I’ve written about responsible energy use more than a few times. But in May, after years of apartment-dwelling, I moved into the first home I’ve ever owned.

So, I signed up for a home energy assessment.

My home, outside of Cleveland, is more than 100 years old. When I blast the air conditioning, it’s still hot and humid upstairs. I can hear birds chirping outside no matter how hard I shut the windows. And there’s a giant pipe in my basement held together by duct tape and prayers.

My assessment delivered pretty bad news. But with it came with lots of room for improvement. Here’s how the day unfolded:

The HVAC tests

Tim Portman, owner of the HVAC company Portman Mechanical in northeast Ohio, started with an hourlong interview about my goals of having a more comfortable and climate-friendly house. Then he headed into the basement to test my furnace, air conditioner and water heater.

The water heater pressure was normal, so Portman said there was no major risk of a water burst. However, the pressure in both the furnace and air conditioner was too high.

Which reveals my first problem: They are too big for the duct work. That’s inefficient, and it wears on the equipment. Making matters worse, Portman noticed a bunch of unnecessary turns in the ducts.

He equated it to having great water pressure in a kinked garden hose.

“If you don’t get the kink out of that garden hose, you’re never going to have a good experience,” he said.

The highlight of my basement woes was a giant pipe that feeds heating and cooling to the rest of the house. It just … wasn’t connected. It was jammed together like two straws without a junction. It bugged him enough that he paused to fix it.

And who am I to stop him?

The blower door

After the basement, Portman assembled a contraption called a blower door. He jammed a bunch of airtight plastic in my front doorway, shoved a big fan through the middle and turned it on so that it was blowing air out of my house.

“It literally sets up a vacuum in the house. So anywhere where there are leaks, you can see where those leaks are,” he said.

Seconds later, my home got hot and musty as the fan pulled outdoor air through all the leaky seams. Portman guessed the primary culprit immediately. I followed him upstairs into what felt like a sauna near the opening to the attic.

“You literally have hot, humid air — and your attic’s warmer than outside — just pouring into the second floor,” Portman said.

The blower door measures how many cubic feet of air flow through per minute. In a well-sealed house, the number should be less than or equal to the square footage. In my 1,500 square-foot (139-square-meter) house, the blower door number was 4,500. Three times as leaky as it should be.

Portman called it a worst-case scenario.

“It’s like driving your car around with the AC on and the windows rolled down,” he said.

The thermal camera

Next, Portman grabbed a thermal camera. The goal, since it was 80 degrees Fahrenheit (27 degrees Celsius) outside, was to see if leaks would show up as hot spots on the camera.

There were a lot. On the screen, yellow revealed a hot spot. The coolest spaces were dark blue. The leaky door frame around the attic lit up bright yellow.

“Do you think that’s a problem?” Portman joked.

“Oops,” I said.

“Yeah,” he said. “Oops is the right answer.”

There were a few unsurprising finds, including a leaky bathroom fan and gaps around the hundred-year-old windows. Downstairs we also found major gaps in the living room’s exposed beams.

Thermal images proved Portman’s theory that my walls were not insulated. That’s because my house still has some knob and tube wiring, a system of ceramic supports and porcelain-wrapped wires that’s a relic of the early 20th century. Because of how it heats up, only certain insulation can be used with it. It can also be very expensive to remove.

In the basement, the camera revealed major gaps next to pipes and some other just … random holes. They were maybe where wiring used to be, or just hollow spots in the old wooden framing. But the air seepage was strong enough to make the cobwebs flutter frantically, as if reflecting my dread discovering them.

The verdict

After his review, Portman’s first recommendation was to call an electrician about the old wiring.

“Getting knob and tube out of your house opens the door to have insulation in your walls,” he said.

Once that’s addressed, Portman said I need to upgrade my electrical panel to support an eventual switch to a heat pump and an electric water heater, though those appliances don’t fit my budget this year.

One electrician I spoke to by phone guessed it would cost $30,000 to remove the old wiring. But another said as long as he inspects the wiring and doesn’t find any dangerous modifications, I could leave it and replace the panel for roughly $3,000.

I went with the second guy.

Through the end of 2025, federal tax credits will help subsidize weatherization upgrades, including insulation, windows, doors and electrical panels.

In the meantime, my husband and I have a different homework assignment: use a caulk gun and spray foam to plug the holes that we found on the thermal camera.

Between July heat waves and January cold snaps, sealing a house in the Cleveland area isn’t just good for the planet. It’s a good investment.

That includes credits for upgrades like rooftop solar panels, upgraded windows, and electric heat pumps, which could save people thousands of dollars.

According to The New York Times, you can still claim some savings if you take action before the end of the year. The Energy Efficient Home Improvement Credit, which covers 30% of the cost of things like insulation and the previously mentioned upgrades, is still available. The max is $2,000 for heat pumps or water heaters, plus up to $1,200 more for other upgrades.

Installers say not to wait since permitting and inspections can take weeks.

""You might only have until October or November,"" Brett Bouchy, CEO of solar company Freedom Forever, said, per the Times.

More specifically, according to Canary Media, the Big Beautiful Bill puts more than 600 gigawatts' worth of solar at risk, including the wind and battery projects that could have come to fruition after 2027. The Times article explained specifically that credits for rooftop solar installations are now scheduled to expire 180 days after the bill's signing instead of sticking to continuing through 2032.

Twelve states have since had to pause their energy rebate programs. As early as March 2025, CPR News reported that Colorado paused a $140 million federally funded program that was meant to help low- and middle-income households upgrade. Although a federal court overturned the freeze and funds were restored, state officials have warned there is still no firm launch date for those home upgrade discounts.

For people who don't owe enough taxes to use those credits, two rebate programs from 2022 — the HEAR Program and the HOMES Program — that were funded with $9 billion can still be used. Together, these rebates can add up to as much as $14,000 per household according to the report.

One covers electric upgrades like heat pumps, induction stoves, and new wiring for households that are making less than 150% of their local median income. The other is for efficiency upgrades in homes under 80% of the local median income.

During a news conference at Embaras bar and grill in Villa Grove, owner Ryan Garett said his energy costs have skyrocketed in just one month.

“You get a $3,000 bill when you’re not really expecting it. It raises your costs $1,000 in a month, you can’t budget for that,” Garett said. “You can’t plan for that. And then, it has a trickle down effect. We’re at the point where we’ve had to cut back on hours for some of our employees and take up those hours ourselves because we can’t, you know, keep up with payroll to pay that stuff.”

State Rep. Brad Halbrook, R-Shelbyville, said while Gov. J.B. Pritzker blames the increased costs on grid operators and President Donald Trump, Democrats need reverse course.

“The very communities the governor and his allies claim to help have been abandoned under [the Clean and Equitable Jobs Act] and its predecessor to the Future Energy Jobs Act of 2016, Illinois has been shutting down affordable, reliable coal and natural gas plants, so sources that actually work and are critical to grid stability,” Halbrook said. “But why? To appease the climate alarmists who think we can power Illinois with windmills and wishful thinking.”

State Rep. Chris Miller, R-Oakland, said it’s time to ditch the “green energy scam.”

“We have over 200 billion tons of big, beautiful coal available. All we have to do is go get it,” Miller said. “It would be a tremendous driver for jobs and opportunity. This whole CEJA thing, this whole green energy scam needs to be thrown in the garbage where it belongs.”

The Illinois Clean Jobs Coalition put the blame on increased energy prices on the Trump administration’s roll backs of tax incentives for “clean energy” and “Big Tech’s energy-hungry data centers.”

“As new federal policies make our power dirtier and more expensive, it is crucial that Illinois lawmakers can step up to the plate this fall and pass the Clean and Reliable Grid Affordability (CRGA) Act to protect families from utility bill spikes, preserve and grow our clean energy workforce, and maintain our national leadership on climate action,” the coalition said in a news release.

The acquisition includes the Northvolt Ett, Ett Expansion, and Northvolt Labs facilities in Sweden, as well as Northvolt Drei in Germany.
“Lyten is actively progressing discussions with Northvolt North America, the Government of Canada, the Government of Québec and other key local stakeholders,” the company wrote on Aug. 7 in a statement.
In November of 2024, Lyten also acquired Northvolt’s Cuberg battery manufacturing facility in California.
“It underscores the promising foundations established through the Northvolt project and Quebec’s potential role in the growth of the North American battery ecosystem,” she said in a statement.","Lyten, an American company, has announced it hopes to purchase the Northvolt battery plant in Quebec.

This comes after the company shared on Aug. 7 that it entered into a deal to buy Northvolt’s assets in Sweden and Germany.

The acquisition includes the Northvolt Ett, Ett Expansion, and Northvolt Labs facilities in Sweden, as well as Northvolt Drei in Germany. Lyten will also acquire all of Northvolt’s remaining intellectual property. The value of the transaction has not been disclosed.

The San Jose, Calif.-based company now has its sights set on Quebec.

In its press release announcing the acquisition of the Swedish and German assets, it said it’s “committed to pursuing the acquisition” of the Northvolt Six project in the Montérégie region.

The $7-billion factory is expected to be built between Saint-Basile-le-Grand and McMasterville.

“Lyten is actively progressing discussions with Northvolt North America, the Government of Canada, the Government of Québec and other key local stakeholders,” the company wrote on Aug. 7 in a statement.

The U.S. company, founded in 2015, currently manufactures lithium-sulphur batteries in the Silicon Valley and markets them to the drone and defence markets.

The company’s takeover in Sweden and Germany follows its purchase of another Northvolt plant in Poland in early July, and the Swedish company’s product portfolio and intellectual property for battery energy storage systems weeks later.

In November of 2024, Lyten also acquired Northvolt’s Cuberg battery manufacturing facility in California.

In a post on X, Quebec Economy Minister Christine Fréchette said the Quebec government intends to meet with Lyten representatives to hear “what they have to offer.”

She added the province has “leverage to regulate or refuse” the purchase, adding “it’s our responsibility to rigorously assess this new situation.”

Karen Chang, interim CEO of Northvolt North America, said she’s “encouraged by strong interest expressed by Lyten” in the subsidiary.

“It underscores the promising foundations established through the Northvolt project and Quebec’s potential role in the growth of the North American battery ecosystem,” she said in a statement.

Northvolt filed for bankruptcy in Sweden on March 12. This came following an “exhaustive effort to explore all available means to secure a viable financial and operational future for the company,” the North American branch said then.

At that time, Fréchette had said she hoped the company would find another buyer willing to take over its activities in North America.

The Quebec government invested $270 million in Northvolt’s Swedish parent company before it filed for bankruptcy in Europe.

Impact on Renewable Energy Sectors Renewable energy companies, particularly those reliant on federal grants and regulatory frameworks, face significant headwinds.
Renewable energy sectors, especially cleantech manufacturing and infrastructure deployment, are labor-intensive and often depend on unionized workforces for skilled labor.
The EPA's union policy shifts could exacerbate labor shortages, as union-backed training programs and grievance mechanisms are weakened.
While the immediate effects on renewable energy and labor markets are disruptive, the long-term trajectory will depend on the resilience of state-level initiatives and the adaptability of private-sector players.","The termination of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) contracts with federal unions under the Trump administration represents a seismic shift in labor relations and regulatory priorities. This move, justified under a March 2025 executive order invoking national security, has effectively dismantled collective bargaining rights for over 8,000 EPA employees. While the administration frames this as a necessary step to streamline operations, the broader implications for renewable energy and labor market-linked equities are profound and multifaceted.

The Political and Economic Context

The EPA's decision to terminate contracts with unions such as the American Federation of Government Employees (AFGE) and the National Association of Government Employees (NAGE) is part of a broader anti-union agenda. By revoking collective bargaining agreements, the agency has shifted power dynamics in favor of management, allowing for greater flexibility in workforce restructuring. This includes the reclamation of office space used by union representatives and the prohibition of union activities during work hours. The move has been met with fierce legal resistance, with AFGE vowing to challenge the decision in court, arguing it violates the First Amendment and undermines the EPA's environmental mission.

The ripple effects extend beyond labor relations. The EPA's restructuring, including a 23% workforce reduction and the elimination of environmental justice (EJ) and diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs, signals a strategic realignment toward deregulation and cost-cutting. This aligns with the Trump administration's broader “Great American Comeback” initiative, which prioritizes fossil fuel expansion and reduced federal oversight.

Impact on Renewable Energy Sectors

Renewable energy companies, particularly those reliant on federal grants and regulatory frameworks, face significant headwinds. The cancellation of the Solar for All program—a $7 billion initiative under the Inflation Reduction Act—exemplifies this. Designed to support solar adoption in low- and middle-income households, the program was a critical driver of job creation and infrastructure development. Its termination not only disrupts existing projects but also erodes confidence in long-term federal support for clean energy.

The labor market implications are equally stark. Renewable energy sectors, especially cleantech manufacturing and infrastructure deployment, are labor-intensive and often depend on unionized workforces for skilled labor. The EPA's union policy shifts could exacerbate labor shortages, as union-backed training programs and grievance mechanisms are weakened. This may drive up costs for renewable energy projects, which already face challenges from supply chain bottlenecks and trade protections like 2024 solar and battery tariffs.

Investment Implications and Strategic Considerations

For investors, the key lies in navigating the dual forces of regulatory uncertainty and sector-specific resilience. Renewable energy equities tied to federal grants, such as First Solar or Sunrun, may face near-term volatility as legal challenges over Solar for All unfold. Conversely, companies with diversified revenue streams—such as NextEra Energy, which operates utility-scale renewables—may be better insulated from policy shifts.

The labor market dynamics also warrant attention. While the EPA's actions could reduce union influence in federal agencies, state-level initiatives in states like New York and California are likely to sustain demand for clean energy jobs. Investors should monitor state-level incentives and workforce development programs, which may offset federal retrenchment.

The Path Forward

The legal battles over the EPA's union terminations and Solar for All cancellation will be pivotal. A favorable ruling for unions could restore collective bargaining rights and stabilize labor markets, while a victory for the administration may accelerate the erosion of federal worker protections. Investors must weigh these outcomes against the broader trend of political polarization and its impact on regulatory consistency.

In the renewable energy sector, the focus should shift toward technologies and projects less reliant on federal grants. Energy storage, hydrogen production, and circular economy innovations are emerging as resilient areas, offering long-term growth potential. Additionally, companies that prioritize partnerships with educational institutions and apprenticeship programs may better navigate labor shortages and skill gaps.

Conclusion

The EPA's union policy shifts under Trump reflect a broader ideological clash over the role of government in labor and environmental regulation. While the immediate effects on renewable energy and labor markets are disruptive, the long-term trajectory will depend on the resilience of state-level initiatives and the adaptability of private-sector players. For investors, the key is to balance caution with strategic foresight, prioritizing sectors and companies that can thrive in an era of regulatory flux. The coming months will test not only the durability of clean energy transitions but also the adaptability of capital markets in the face of political uncertainty.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-08-09 14:04:48.505261

Dubbed the ""devastation bill"" by its detractors, the text recently adopted by lawmakers would have loosened environmental licensing laws for projects considered ""strategic"" by the state.

For some permits, all that would have been required is a simple declaration of the company's environmental commitment.

Lula instead reinstated the current strict licensing rules for strategic projects, such as a controversial oil mega-project at the mouth of the Amazon river, but set a one-year deadline for them to be approved or rejected.

His veto also ensures that several Indigenous territories and the Atlantic Forest, which stretches along the east coast, will continue to enjoy special protection, Environment Minister Marina Silva told reporters.

SOS Atlantic Forest, a non-governmental organization that had garnered over a million signatures calling for a veto of the law, hailed Lula's decision as ""a victory"" for environmental protection.

Greenpeace also praised the leftist president's action on the issue.

But the executive coordinator of APIB, Brazil's largest Indigenous rights group, told AFP he was disappointed that the president had not struck down the entire bill.

Lula's veto must now be ratified by Congress, which is dominated by conservatives.

Lula's environmental credentials are under close scrutiny in the run-up to the annual UN climate summit, which he will host in November in the Amazon city of Belem.

While seeking to take a leadership role on climate change on the global stage, Lula has faced criticism at home for backing drilling in the Equatorial Margin, along the country's northern coast.

He argues that the revenue from the oil field is necessary to finance Brazil's energy transition.

Silva said Lula's objective was to ensure that ""the economy does not compete with ecology, but rather they are part of the same equation.""

“We are appalled and outraged at the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) blatant and unlawful termination of $7 billion in federal funding for the 60 organizations that received awards through the Solar for All program. Solar for All funding has been approved by Congress and signed into law, and cancelling or rescinding these obligated funds is a violation of the law and the Constitution,” the Oregon delegation wrote to EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin and Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Director Russell Vought. “Solar for All is fundamental to the EPA’s core mission of safeguarding human health and the environment, and your actions to illegally rescind these funds will result in even higher energy costs and a less reliable energy grid for families and Tribal communities.”

The $86.6 million grant went to the Oregon Department of Energy (ODOE) to deploy a statewide Solar for All Program in partnership with Bonneville Environmental Foundation and the Energy Trust of Oregon. The funds—which were awarded under the historic Ley de Reducción de la Inflación and fully obligated—are intended to help create Oregon’s only statewide residential solar incentive program, but without them, working families across the state will struggle to harness the power of clean solar energy.

The lawmakers emphasized, “If fully funded and implemented, Oregon’s Solar for All program would serve over 8,000 low-income Oregon households, helping families install solar panels on their homes with little or no up-front costs. Until you terminated these funds, the state was on track to launch its Solar for All program and start offering incentives by the end of this year.

Como Ranking Member of the Senate Interior-Environment Appropriations Subcommittee and a senior member of the Senate Environment and Public Works (EPW) Committee, Merkley has led the charge to hold the EPA accountable for its disastrous funding freezes that have previously targeted the Solar for All program. He continues to use his position as the top Democrat on the subcommittee that oversees funding for the EPA to ensure the agency follows the law and has the necessary resources to carry out its mission of protecting human health and the environment.

“The EPA’s termination of the Solar for All program is a blatant failure of its duty to uphold enacted spending laws and ensure Americans have access to reliable and affordable electricity. Congress has yet to receive satisfactory responses and justifications for many of your unlawful and illogical actions.

Mr. Zeldin and Mr. Vought:

We are appalled and outraged at the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) blatant and unlawful termination of $7 billion in federal funding for the 60 organizations that received awards through the Solar for All program. Solar for All funding has been approved by Congress and signed into law, and cancelling or rescinding these obligated funds is a violation of the law and the Constitution. Solar for All funds help families across the nation access reliable energy at an affordable price. Solar energy is one of the cheapest and most reliable forms of energy, and solar deployment is critical to meeting the nation’s rapid growth in energy demand. Solar for All is fundamental to the EPA’s core mission of safeguarding human health and the environment, and your actions to illegally rescind these funds will result in even higher energy costs and a less reliable energy grid for families and Tribal communities.

In 2024, the State of Oregon received an $86.6 million award from the EPA to develop a statewide Solar for All program. These funds, awarded under the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, are fully obligated. Since January 2025, the Oregon Department of Energy (ODOE) has worked diligently in partnership with Bonneville Environmental Foundation and the Energy Trust of Oregon to design a cost-effective program with a focus on efficient procurement and project planning while also building strong partnerships with local community-based organizations across the state.

If fully funded and implemented, Oregon’s Solar for All program would serve over 8,000 low-income Oregon households, helping families install solar panels on their homes with little or no up-front costs. Until you terminated these funds, the state was on track to launch its Solar for All program and start offering incentives by the end of this year. Your recent actions have jeopardized these crucial services and stripped thousands of Oregonians of access to this cost-effective program.

If allowed to spend the federal funds it was legally awarded, the State of Oregon has plans to establish a program that would support solar panel installation on multi-family buildings and the development of community solar projects, while also investing in workforce development activities to ensure a robust and efficient solar industry in Oregon. This program would be the only statewide residential solar incentive program and without it, residential solar will not be a cost-effective option for low-income Oregonians. Now that the EPA has terminated federal Solar for All funds, thousands of low-income Oregonians will suffer from higher utility costs and less resilient energy sources.

The Solar for All program is crucial to meeting future energy needs in the Pacific Northwest while lowering household costs for working-class families. In Oregon, customers have suffered from exponentially increasing energy bills, with some utilities raising prices on residential households by 50% since 2020. Nationwide, the Solar for All program is on track to help more than 900,000 people install solar and reduce their electricity bills by at least 20 percent. The Solar for All program is designed to shield middle- and low-income families from these extreme price increases that place additional financial strain on households that are already struggling to pay their bills.

The EPA’s termination of the Solar for All program is a blatant failure of its duty to uphold enacted spending laws and ensure Americans have access to reliable and affordable electricity. Congress has yet to receive satisfactory responses and justifications for many of your unlawful and illogical actions. This is unacceptable and the agency must comply with the law and fulfill its responsibility to protect the livelihoods of all Americans and the environments where they live.

It predicted that, largely thanks to data centers, energy demand in the state would nearly double by 2030.
The most strenuous opposition to the Texas data center bill came from other Republicans.
While online services depend on data centers to keep operating, major tech companies can switch some workloads between locations.
The tech industry is exploring ways to reduce the burden that data centers place on electric grids.","The American electrical grid is creaking under growing demand from data centers that power websites, streaming platforms and Silicon Valley’s artificial intelligence boom. A new law in Texas introduced an unprecedented remedy: cut power to the energy-guzzling facilities in times of emergency.

Lawmakers who championed the law say giving the Texas grid operator that option will help avoid deadly blackouts like those that followed a 2021 winter storm in which more than 200 people died. State regulators are now hashing out how to implement data center shutoffs with industry leaders.

The willingness of Republicans in a red state that is a major hub for data centers to impose new regulations on the facilities underscores how even those enthusiastic about participating in the AI revolution can be hampered by the limits of the country’s aging infrastructure.

The narrow prospects for adding new energy sources to the grid may be cut further by President Donald Trump’s recently passed tax law, even as data centers contribute to rising electricity rates.

Texas, with its wide open spaces, cheap energy and pro-business policies, is a natural home for data centers, warehouse-like buildings stocked with powerful computers that can consume comparable power to a small city.

The Lone Star State hosts data centers built by Meta, Alphabet, and Microsoft. Abilene, in western Texas, is home to the first site of the Stargate AI data center project that, according to a January announcement hosted by Trump, aimed to “immediately” spend $100 billion.

Trump has made more data centers a national priority, recently seeking to accelerate their construction with a new national AI plan and an executive order that eases federal permitting.

But the fatal 2021 storm that left millions of Texas residents in the dark without heat while industrial operations stayed online provides a stark reminder of the dangers of overstretched energy infrastructure.

Last year, Texas power officials informed lawmakers that energy demand on the state’s grid could double in six years, threatening its reliability. The forecast set off a panic that led to the drafting of the law allowing data centers to be cut off in emergencies.

“We never want to risk another (Storm) Uri, where over 200 Texans died because they lost their electricity,” said Texas state Sen. Phil King, who co-wrote the bill, in a Feb. 27 hearing about the legislation, using an unofficial name for the storm. “That can never, ever happen again.”

An implementation process that began with a public meeting before the Texas Public Utility Commission late last month will determine when and how power can be cut to data centers under the new law, which was signed by Gov. Greg Abbott in June. The process will also specify new requirements for how the facilities pay for power and grid infrastructure upgrades.

Tyler Norris, a fellow at Duke University, said the process will be closely watched by lawmakers and energy leaders around the country as they grapple with electricity demand forecasts that are “physically impossible to meet.”

“It’s hard to overstate the significance in terms of the direction this is likely to push the data center industry,” Norris said. “When you have periods of system stress – demand exceeding supply – you get into load shedding … Unless a data center is providing a critical national security function, there’s going to be a push to curtail the data center first.”

‘The Wild West of data centers’

Days after Trump announced Stargate in an Oval Office live stream in January, OpenAI executives flew to Austin to discuss the project with state officials including Gov. Abbott. Stargate is a joint venture between the ChatGPT maker, business software giant Oracle and Japanese investor SoftBank. (The Washington Post has a content partnership with OpenAI.)

Texas leaders – like their counterparts in states including Ohio, Virginia and Arizona – have welcomed data center projects and the tax revenue they promise.

Two of the lobbyists OpenAI brought along to the Austin meeting, Daniel Hodge and Luis Saenz, had previously served as Abbott’s chief of staff. After the meeting, OpenAI’s global policy director Chris Lehane wrote a LinkedIn post thanking the governor for a “big Texas welcome.”

Behind the scenes, Republican state senators King and Charles Schwertner were preparing State Bill 6. It introduced measures aimed at ensuring tech companies pay their fair share for power transmission costs, and required any data center seeking a grid connection after Dec. 31 to build a switch that can be used to cut supply in an emergency.

The legislation was spurred by an ominous forecast in June 2024 testimony from the chief executive of the Electric Reliability Council of Texas, the nonprofit that manages the Texas electric grid. It predicted that, largely thanks to data centers, energy demand in the state would nearly double by 2030.

Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick called the forecast “shocking” in a social media post that month. “We want data centers,” he wrote, “but it can’t be the Wild Wild West of data centers.”

As the bill made its way through the Texas legislature, tech companies voiced concerns, including Crusoe and Lancium, partners of OpenAI and Oracle on the Stargate project in Abilene.

At a February hearing, Dan Diorio, vice president of state policy at the Data Center Coalition, an industry group, warned of the “significant consequences” of even a “momentary interruption” to data center customers, which he said include governments, law enforcement, hospitals and banks.

Microsoft, Amazon, Oracle, and Google are members of the Data Center Coalition.

The most strenuous opposition to the Texas data center bill came from other Republicans. In interviews and editorials this spring, Vance Ginn, a conservative and former Texas lobbyist who briefly worked for the White House Office of Management and Budget during Trump’s first term, argued that the regulation could make his state less attractive to tech industry dollars.

Ginn’s comments were followed by criticism from right-wing pundits and influencers who saw a potential threat to the Trump administration’s plans to see America dominate AI. At the time, Lt. Gov. Patrick’s office told Fox News he was aligned with Trump’s vision for AI in Texas.

“We have made clear we are in lockstep with President Trump on his goal to make America the premier destination for AI, data centers and cryptocurrency,” Patrick’s communications director Steven Aranyi told the Post.

Abbott signed the bill on June 20. His press secretary, Andrew Mahaleris, said the governor acted “to ensure that, as Texas grows, ERCOT can effectively manage energy to meet rising demand.”

“Thanks to this law and increased investments in energy infrastructure, innovators know Texas has the tools needed to lead,” he said in an emailed statement.

White House spokesperson Harrison Fields said in a statement that Trump’s goal is to create “a golden age for American technological dominance” and that “state legislators and utility regulators need to be more open to facilitating data center development in a manner that ensures a productive and symbiotic relationship between grid operators, developers, and hyperscalers that does not impose unreasonable and onerous restrictions on the American tech companies on the frontier of AI development.”

New data centers are still incubating in Texas, where former Gov. Rick Perry announced plans for a nuclear-powered facility near Amarillo to be called the Donald J. Trump Advanced Energy and Intelligence Campus. OpenAI has said it’s expanding Stargate in Abilene with a deal to add facilities that consume another 4.5 gigawatts of power.

Ginn, the former Trump staffer, said he remains concerned the new law creates “structural barriers to growth, innovation, and voluntary grid support at times we need it most.”

More flexible AI

The new regime for data centers in Texas could push tech companies to rethink how they operate the facilities.

In an extreme weather event, Texas must be able to “load shed as quickly as possible,” said Clif Lange of the South Texas Electric Cooperative. At the public meeting last month, he acknowledged that “bad things can potentially happen” when power to industrial customers is cut, but said some must find a way to be flexible.

While online services depend on data centers to keep operating, major tech companies can switch some workloads between locations. The facilities are also used for less time-sensitive work that can be paused or postponed.

The tech industry is exploring ways to reduce the burden that data centers place on electric grids.

Google on Monday announced deals with two utilities, the Tennessee Valley Authority and Indiana Michigan Power, that will see the internet company reduce its energy demand during periods of peak use by adjusting AI workloads running in its data centers. Chipmaker Nvidia has backed startup Emerald AI, which is developing software to help other data centers do the same thing.

Robin Hytowitz, a researcher with the nonprofit Electric Power Research Institute, which is studying how data center flexibility could help electrical infrastructure, said the new Texas law is “the first state bill that really gave clarity around some of that emergency use.” It probably won’t be the last.

New Jersey is considering a law that would offer financial incentives to data centers to be more adaptable.

California state Sen. Steve Padilla has proposed legislation aimed at insulating residential grid customers from rate hikes due to data center demand. “We’ve got to try to figure out what happens when one of these things plugs in and starts drawing off the grid, and suddenly we have scarcities created that drive up cost on a scale that we haven’t seen before,” he said.",https://thumb.spokesman.com/l2sMHX5ZvY-IivJJOF8GNS33NSY=/600x0/media.spokesman.com/graphics/2020/08/sr_placeholder.png,N,,2025-08-09 12:05:00.028418

Fast forward to 2025, it is now clean power that provides the economic opportunity of the century.
Chris Stark CBE, Head of Mission Control for Clean Power by 2030.","Britain must copy China and become a net zero “electrostate”, Ed Miliband’s top civil servant has said.

Chris Stark, the Energy Secretary’s “Head of Mission Control for Clean Power by 2030”, said the UK needed to match the speed of electrification seen in China in order to become a new global super-power as the world moves towards net zero.

Writing in The Telegraph, he said: “China, still the world’s largest consumer of coal, is now moving towards a cleaner future: laying vast networks of transmission lines, rolling out the world’s biggest fleet of electric vehicles, and deploying solar and wind at a scale that now dwarfs the rest of the world. We ignore these changes at our peril.”

Mr Stark argued that the world was moving from an era where petrostates, such as Saudi Arabia and Russia, exerted significant global power thanks to their control of fuel sources, to one where clean energy economies will be dominant.

He wrote: “This isn’t just about cutting emissions. It’s about cold, hard economics. India, Sweden and China and many other countries recognise the future is electric – the blueprint for a more efficient economy and the basis for economic dominance in the decades to come. Britain should be among these new electrostates.”

Mr Stark is one of the UK’s most influential experts on energy and climate, and was formerly chief executive of the Climate Change Committee, the Government’s advisory body.

He is now one of Mr Miliband’s closest allies, leading the “control centre” set up by the Energy Secretary immediately after Labour came to power intended to “turbocharge the Government’s mission to provide Britain with cheaper and clean power by 2030”.

His suggestion that Britain must copy China is likely to prove controversial.

China is already the world’s largest emitter of greenhouse gases and is still building coal-fired power stations. International Energy Agency data shows that its annual coal consumption rose from 1.3m tonnes in 2000 to 5bn tonnes now.

Claire Coutinho, the Conservative former energy secretary, now shadow energy spokeswoman, said: “China, unlike Labour, isn’t planning for a system that relies on wind and sun – they are still 60pc powered by coal and building more of it as well as every other type of energy. Living standards depend on having lots of cheap energy. That’s why we should back the North Sea and build a lot more nuclear.”

China has also been widely criticised for using “forced labour” to accelerate its renewable energy programme, with its Uyghurs minority forced into labour camps to make solar panels. Mr Miliband had ignored the issue till a backbench rebellion earlier this year forced him to legislate to ensure UK supply chains remained free of slavery.

Additionally, UK electricity costs four times more than gas, so such a shift could adversely impact bills. Ms Coutinho said: “If you want people to use electric cars and home heating, then it’s simple. You need to make electricity cheap.”

Mr Stark claimed that becoming an “electrostate” would eventually cut UK energy bills – currently among the world’s highest.

He said: “Our once-in-a-generation investment in our electricity grid across the country will allow renewables and nuclear to fulfil their promise of lowering bills for households and businesses, ensuring Britain is no longer hostage to volatile global gas markets.”

Britain must become an ‘electrostate’ like China

By Chris Stark

Two hundred years ago, Britain lit the fuse on the Industrial Revolution.

Coal, steam and steel transformed our economy, powered factories and propelled Britain’s global dominance. The countries who mastered these technologies have been the global leaders.

Today, the world is on the brink of another transformation – one that will be every bit as profound – this time powered by clean abundant electricity.

The global race is on to be among the first ‘electrostates’: nations whose economies run on abundant, affordable, low-carbon power, rapidly reducing their dependency on volatile, insecure oil and gas. And the stakes are clear: last year, $2 trillion poured into clean energy, double the investment in fossil fuels, according to the International Energy Agency.

Look at Norway, where almost every home is heated with electricity and nine in 10 new cars are electric. Sweden is producing fossil-free steel, aiming to dominate the industries of the 21st century.

But it is Asia where we see the biggest changes, as growing energy demand drives a rapid shift towards clean energy. China, still the world’s largest consumer of coal, is now moving towards a cleaner future: laying vast networks of transmission lines, rolling out the world’s biggest fleet of electric vehicles, and deploying solar and wind at a scale that now dwarfs the rest of the world. We ignore these changes at our peril.

This isn’t just about cutting emissions. It’s about cold, hard economics. India, Sweden and China and many other countries recognise the future is electric – it’s the blueprint for a more efficient economy and the basis for economic dominance in the decades to come. Britain should be among these new electrostates.

It makes economic sense but it is also an opportunity for better lives for people in Britain, whether that be warmer homes, cleaner air, new jobs and control over our energy.

That’s why over the past year I’ve been tasked with laying the foundations to lead this global race through our clean power by 2030 mission. We have approved clean energy projects that could power over two million homes, attracted over £50bn in private sector investment for clean energy industries, and backed nuclear power at scale – signing off a multi-billion-pound deal for Sizewell C that will deliver clean power for the equivalent of six million homes and support 10,000 jobs at peak construction.

This complements work to launch first-of-a-kind carbon capture projects in the UK and introduced plans to upgrade millions of homes with clean technologies to cut bills for homeowners and renters.

These are big and bold energy policy decisions that are required for Britain’s reindustrialisation. We’re going to be powered by electricity in the decades to come, so we need to start acting like it.

This past week our annual renewables auction opened for applications. The Contracts for Difference scheme has been a notable British success in securing clean energy, creating jobs, strengthening local economies and attracting investment.

Britain’s greatest asset is our abundant offshore wind. Take Hornsea Two. Supported through the scheme, it now powers over 1.4 million British homes and supports 600 jobs in places like Grimsby and Hull. The Sofia offshore wind farm in the North Sea is projected to contribute £760m to the UK economy – up to £181m of that in Yorkshire and the Humber alone.

These mega projects are drivers of growth. That’s why investment in clean energy is so important. Our mission is the start of a new era of clean energy abundance, where plentiful British wind and solar drives down energy costs, creates jobs, and gives our industries a global competitive edge.

Britain has a head start on the shift to clean power, but if we can’t match – and in some areas beat – the pace of other countries’ deployment, we risk the industries of tomorrow taking root elsewhere.

We have every advantage – world-class engineering, a strong track record in renewables and some of the best natural resources for abundant power anywhere in the world. With the clarity of our clean power mission, we aim to secure the commitment of our clean industries and build their confidence to invest in Britain.

This is the next chapter of Britain’s industrial story. The scale of investment will bring new economic opportunities to communities in Wales, Teesside, Norfolk and the Humber. It will support new energy jobs in Scotland as our oil and gas resources begin to dwindle. Our once-in-a-generation investment in our electricity grid across the country will allow renewables and nuclear to fulfil their promise of lowering bills for households and businesses, ensuring Britain is no longer hostage to volatile global gas markets.

Two centuries ago, Britain’s embrace of coal and steam shaped the modern world. An industrial boom, based on domestically sourced energy and astonishing technological innovations. Fast forward to 2025, it is now clean power that provides the economic opportunity of the century.

The more renewable and nuclear power we can connect to our grid, the quicker we will displace imported gas and decouple consumer prices from expensive imports. The faster we adopt electrical technologies, for our heating and cooling, for our transport and our industry, the easier it will be to maximise the use our domestic energy resources.

The electrostates have already committed to a future powered by the wind, the sun and nuclear. That is Britain’s path too. We must not watch from the sidelines as others claim the rewards.

Conclusion: The Future Is Electric, But Not Without Nuance The Tesla Model Y emerges as the clear winner in long-term cost efficiency, driven by energy savings and maintenance advantages.","The energy transition is reshaping the automotive landscape, and investors must now weigh not just upfront costs but the long-term financial implications of electric vehicles (EVs) versus traditional internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles. This analysis compares the Tesla Model Y and the Subaru Forester over a 10-year ownership horizon, focusing on total cost of ownership (TCO), energy transition trends, and strategic investment considerations.

1. Initial Cost and Incentives: A Tale of Two Markets

The Tesla Model Y starts at $44,990 for the Long Range RWD variant in 2025, while the Subaru Forester begins at $31,415 for the Base trim. However, incentives tilt the scales. The Model Y qualifies for a $7,500 federal EV tax credit (if sourced and assembled in North America), effectively reducing its net cost to $37,490. This credit expires on September 30, 2025, creating urgency for buyers.

The Forester, lacking an EV tax credit, relies on the car loan interest tax deduction under the 2025 ""One Big Beautiful Bill Act"" (OBBBA). While this deduction allows up to $10,000/year in interest write-offs, only 1% of buyers qualify due to strict income and loan terms. For most, the Forester's lower base price remains its primary advantage.

2. Maintenance and Fuel Costs: Where EVs Shine

Electric vehicles outperform ICE vehicles in maintenance efficiency. The Model Y's annual maintenance costs average $949, compared to the Forester's $1,279—a 31% savings. Over 10 years, this translates to $3,300 in cumulative savings, driven by fewer oil changes, spark plugs, and transmission services. Tesla's 8–10 year battery warranty (covering 100,000–150,000 miles) further reduces long-term repair risks.

Fuel/charging costs tell an even clearer story. At $0.12–$0.24/kWh, the Model Y costs $500–$800/year to charge for 15,000 miles. Over a decade, this totals $5,000–$8,000. The Forester, burning $3.70/gallon gas at 25 mpg, incurs $2,220/year in fuel costs, or $22,200 over 10 years—nearly three times the EV's energy cost.

3. Insurance and Resale Value: The Hidden Trade-Offs

Insurance for EVs is 15% more expensive on average, with the Model Y costing $2,000–$4,000/year versus the Forester's $1,900. Over 10 years, this adds $10,000–$20,000 in higher costs for Tesla, offsetting some of its operational savings.

Resale value, however, favors the Forester. The Model Y is projected to retain 21% of its original value after 10 years (resale: $10,791), while the Forester's historical performance suggests 30–35% retention (resale: $9,425–$10,995). This gap narrows as EV adoption grows, but ICE vehicles still hold an edge in used markets, particularly in regions with limited charging infrastructure.

4. Energy Transition: The Long Game

The 2035 energy transition policies are pivotal. Electrification is expected to reduce electricity costs and stabilize energy prices, while gas remains volatile. By 2035, EVs could be cheaper to own than gas vehicles in 90% of U.S. states, per the 2035 Report 2.0.

For investors, this means Tesla's market share in EVs (and its stock performance) will likely outpace traditional automakers. Meanwhile, Subaru's ICE-focused strategy may face headwinds as ZEV mandates tighten.

5. Strategic Investment Takeaways

For Short-Term Holders (0–3 Years): The Forester's lower upfront cost and higher resale value make it a safer bet.

For Long-Term Holders (5–10 Years): The Model Y's $14,200–$17,200 savings in fuel and maintenance outweigh higher insurance and depreciation, especially with tax credits.

Energy Transition Playbook: Invest in EV infrastructure (e.g., charging networks) and renewable energy stocks to capitalize on the shift. Avoid overexposure to ICE automakers, as regulatory tailwinds favor electrification.

Conclusion: The Future Is Electric, But Not Without Nuance

The Tesla Model Y emerges as the clear winner in long-term cost efficiency, driven by energy savings and maintenance advantages. However, its higher insurance costs and depreciation must be balanced against the broader energy transition narrative. The Subaru Forester remains a reliable, cost-effective ICE option for the near term but risks obsolescence as ZEV mandates accelerate.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-08-09 13:03:19.184645

With specific competitors facing operational and market challenges, First Solar is well-positioned to strengthen its leadership in the U.S. renewable energy sector. However, given the cyclical nature of the solar industry, FSLR may not be ideally suited for a long-term buy-and-hold strategy. Even so, the medium-term prospects remain highly attractive, and my outlook is confidently Bullish.

Strong Q2 Results Stabilize the Bull Case

In Q2, First Solar achieved earnings per share (EPS) of $3.18, which significantly beat the consensus estimate of $2.66. This is a modest decline from the $3.25 reported in Q2 2024. Revenue came in at $1.10 billion for the quarter, which means it meaningfully surpasses the consensus estimate of $1.05 billion. The revenue figure represents a moderate increase from the $1.01 billion reported in the same quarter last year.

The cornerstone of the bull case is management’s decision to raise full-year guidance to $4.9–$5.7 billion, up from the prior range of $4.5–$5.5 billion. Full-year EPS guidance was also tightened to $13.50–$16.50, compared to the earlier $12.50–$17.50 range.

This upward revision, along with strong quarterly results, was driven primarily by higher module sales volumes and improved average selling prices. Management emphasized that the Inflation Reduction Act’s Section 45X advanced manufacturing tax credits continue to provide a direct profitability boost for U.S.-produced modules—although phase-outs are now set to accelerate.

Unlike many competitors, First Solar has minimal exposure to China and operates a supply chain that is largely U.S.-based. This structure enables the company to comply easily with the “Foreign Entity of Concern” (FEOC) rules under the OBBBA, which are far more challenging for peers with less transparent supply chains. Firms that fail to meet FEOC requirements will soon have limited or no access to the 45X tax credits, giving First Solar a significant competitive advantage.

First Solar’s Valuation Remains Attractive

Based on my analysis, First Solar stock is currently fairly valued. That means the investment case is still active due to normalized EPS growth of 55% expected for Fiscal 2026, and 20% annually for Fiscal 2027 and 2028. However, it’s worth keeping in mind that as the solar industry has cyclical tendencies, it’s essential to monitor how long the current demand for solar power capacity expansion lasts. For the time being, FSLR’s latest revenue figures showed the best revenue print since 2020, according to TipRanks data.

The good news is that with so much AI demand and the advent of robotics at scale on the horizon, energy is going to be in short supply. With reshoring trends and the cost efficiencies of solar power, I think First Solar has a powerful long-term return horizon.

Sleeping on FSLR is ill-advised because history tells us demand for solar power products is highly dependent on interest rates and macroeconomic health. A real recession in the next four to five years would likely cause FSLR to plummet at the first sign of macroeconomic contraction approaching.

That said, this is no longer a value opportunity; it’s a growth-at-a-reasonable-price stock. So, we’re probably looking at 20% annual returns from here, given that’s what consensus EPS estimates also suggest.

Alternatively, if AI demand causes a long-term surge in solar power demand, annual returns could surge to 25-30% over the next three years. However, that optionality is heavily dependent on solar power being a preferred form of power generation over the likes of coal, natural gas, and nuclear energy, all of which are gaining attention, albeit at different rates depending on geography.

Is FSLR Stock a Good Buy?

On Wall Street, First Solar has a consensus Strong Buy rating based on 17 Buys, zero Holds, and one Sell. FSLR’s average stock price target is $223, which indicates ~20% upside over the next 12 months.

I view Wall Street’s estimates as conservative yet generally reasonable. Current sentiment toward First Solar is neutral-to-positive, with potential upside from rising macro energy demand tempered by near-term limitations in policy-related benefits—though these constraints are impacting competitors more than FSLR.

According to TipRanks’ stock comparison tool, FSLR is the leading contender in the solar energy space:

FSLR is Well-Positioned in Crowded Market

First Solar has been one of my top performers over the past six months, and I believe the upside story is far from over. The position currently represents 4.4% of my portfolio, and factors such as the OBBBA’s FEOC rules—likely to hinder competitors—reinforce my confidence in its medium-term return potential. Additionally, the prospect of rising energy demand driven by the expansion of AI and robotics provides meaningful upside optionality that could lead to performance exceeding current consensus expectations. I remain long and firmly Bullish.",https://blog.tipranks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/shutterstock_1289725855-750x406.jpg,N,,2025-08-09 20:10:18.854848

The bill also includes temporary deductions up to $10,000 on interest for auto loans, and a $6,000 deduction for taxpayers age 65 or older.
However, the decoupling of state tax law from federal law could limit the impact of these incentives within Connecticut.

Here in Connecticut, the economic impact of the One Big Beautiful Act is expected to deliver a mix of industry investment, direct stimulus, and policy changes that will disproportionately impact our state in the years ahead—for better and for worse.

CBIA’s Chris Davis, vice president of Public Policy, Whittlesey’s Brenden Healy, CPA, and CBIA Foundation director, Dustin Nord, dove into the bill’s details during an Aug. 5 webinar.

They highlighted clear benefits for the state’s economy and budget, individuals, and businesses.

They also addressed economic drags, such as higher state borrowing costs that could come from increased national debt, and areas where more clarity is needed from the federal government.

Key Tax Changes, Incentives

Also called the federal budget reconciliation bill, the OBBBA features sweeping changes to the federal tax code.

To help boost spending in Connecticut from 2025 to 2029, the state and local tax deduction cap will increase from $10,000 to $40,000.

This is significant for the state, Nord explained, because only about 10% of personal income tax filers who itemize currently take advantage of the deduction.

With both high state and local taxes and high incomes in Connecticut, the overlap of individuals most likely to take advantage of the SALT cap increase to $40,000 is definitely disproportionate compared to the rest of the nation.

Ultimately, that means more spending, especially in places like southwestern Connecticut.

The downside, Healy added, is that it’s a temporary measure and the benefit is capped at $500,000 for joint filers and $250,000 for single filers.

“One strategy to consider is to accelerate property tax payments or restructure income to maximize the deduction before the SALT cap phases out,” he explained.

Other Temporary Tax Reductions

Middle to lower income individuals can also benefit from no tax on tips or overtime from 2025 to 2028.

In industries that customarily include tips, like restaurants and hospitality venues, the deduction is up to $25,000.

The deduction for overtime pay is up to $12,500 for a single filer and $25,000 for joint filers, and it only applies to excess pay over the regular rate of pay.

With an income phase out, the size of this stimulus is somewhat unknown, Nord said.

The bill also includes temporary deductions up to $10,000 on interest for auto loans, and a $6,000 deduction for taxpayers age 65 or older.

Additional guidance is expected from the Internal Revenue Service, including which new American autos are eligible.

Business Tax Incentives

Connecticut is one of the nation’s largest investors per employee of private investment in industrial spaces.

The OBBBA introduces measures to support businesses, including expanded research and development expensing and the 100% bonus depreciation.

These provisions are especially beneficial for Connecticut’s industrial sector, particularly biotech and advanced manufacturing.

However, the decoupling of state tax law from federal law could limit the impact of these incentives within Connecticut.

Among the business incentives:

For eligible assets placed in service after Jan. 19, 2025, 100% bonus depreciation is now permanent. This gives businesses across multiple sectors more cash to reinvest in equipment, facilities and hiring.

The limit for Section 179 Expensing has increased to $4.5 million.

Thousands of small businesses are expected to take advantage of a permanent 20 Qualified Business Income deduction for owners of pass-through entities and sole proprietorships.

Immediate deductions for domestic research expenses, retroactive for small businesses to 2022.

A retroactive deduction option for small businesses for 2022-2024 expenses.

The qualified Business Income deduction has been expanded and made permanent.

Housing, Industrial Investment

The bill permanently expands the low-income housing tax credit for builders, increasing it 12% per state, creating more opportunities for community investment.

Significant investments are planned for defense manufacturing and maritime workforce development.

The bill includes $250 million for training in defense manufacturing and $450 million in maritime workforce development and supply chain development, which puts Connecticut at a definite advantage, Nord said.

However, guidance for allocating those funds has yet to be published.

State Budget Pressures

While the OBBBA represents significant opportunities for individuals and businesses, it also introduces considerable fiscal pressures and creates potential economic headwinds.

The expected increased federal budget deficit will likely lead to higher interest rates, with anticipated new pressures on Connecticut’s state budget.

The state’s $3 billion annual interest payments could increase, creating challenges for bond-funded capital programs and infrastructure projects.

Other challenges include potential reductions in Medicaid and Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program funding.

Cuts to Medicaid of an estimated $13 billion over 10 years could result in 100,000-200,000 fewer people covered by Medicaid, and cuts to SNAP could strain approximately 400,000 low- income participants.

A new excise tax on large endowments, set at 21%, affects institutions like Yale, which rely heavily on endowment funds for research and development.

The tax could also reduce job growth in the biotech sector and impact venture capital investment.

Energy Challenges

Among a number of changes to clean energy funding, the bill eliminates solar and wind incentives, and New England is heavily reliant on expanded renewables for new power generation.

In addition, the Energy Efficient Home Improvement Credit, originally due to expire after 2032, now expires Dec. 31, 2025.

Analysts warn of a steep drop in sales once the tax credit disappears.","Electric vehicle sales in the United States are experiencing a sharp spike as consumers rush to take advantage of tax credits worth up to $7,500 before they expire at the end of September.

The looming deadline, set under legislation backed by Republicans in Congress and signed by President Donald Trump in July, marks a dramatic policy shift that will effectively eliminate federal incentives for new, used, and leased EVs after September 30 — a full seven years earlier than originally planned under the Biden administration’s Inflation Reduction Act.

Under Biden’s plan, the credits would have remained in place until 2032, part of a broader strategy to cut greenhouse gas emissions from the transportation sector, which is the single largest contributor to U.S. emissions. The change now leaves a narrow window for buyers to lock in significant savings, pushing the EV market into a frenzy.

Auto analysts say the surge is unprecedented. Stephanie Valdez Streaty, senior analyst at Cox Automotive, predicts the third quarter could set an all-time record for EV sales.

“People are rushing out to buy because they know the incentives are going away,” she said.

In July alone, Americans purchased nearly 130,100 new EVs — the second-highest monthly sales total on record, just behind December’s 136,000. That’s a 26.4% jump from June and almost 20% higher than a year earlier. EVs made up 9.1% of all passenger vehicle sales for the month, the largest share ever recorded.

Used EVs are also seeing record demand, with nearly 36,700 sold in July, according to Cox data. Certain models have emerged as clear winners, including the Chevy Equinox EV, Honda Prologue, and Hyundai IONIQ 5. The Equinox EV alone sold 8,500 units in July — the highest single-month total for any non-Tesla EV in the U.S. Tesla, still the market leader, has seen its own sales slip for two straight quarters, down 12% year-over-year in Q2 and 9% in Q1.

The appeal of the tax credits is simple economics. A new EV costs an average of $55,689, compared to $48,078 for a new gasoline-powered car. With the federal credit, the price gap all but disappears, bringing an EV’s cost to around $48,189 — near parity with conventional vehicles. Without that subsidy, the affordability advantage vanishes overnight.

Tom Libby, analyst at S&P Global, warns that the end of the credits will “jeopardize” EV price competitiveness, even as state governments and utility companies continue to offer smaller, localized incentives.

Dealers are making the most of the ticking clock. Tesla’s homepage now blares “$7,500 Federal Tax Credit Ending” alongside “Limited Inventory — Take Delivery Now,” urging customers to finalize purchases before the cutoff. To sweeten the deal, automakers are stacking additional discounts on top of the federal credit. In July, new EV buyers received an average of $9,800 in extra incentives from dealers, worth 17.5% of the average transaction price, the highest level since before EVs began to gain mainstream traction in late 2017.

But the rush may be short-lived. Analysts warn of a steep drop in sales once the tax credit disappears.

“EV sales are likely to collapse in the fourth quarter of 2025,” Streaty said, predicting that the market will have to recalibrate to a new financial reality.

One possible bright spot could be the used EV market, which has already been growing without much help from incentives. Only about one-third of used EVs sold qualified for the $4,000 federal credit even before the policy change, suggesting demand won’t crater as dramatically. With more used EVs entering the market and fewer subsidies for new ones, analysts expect pre-owned models to attract more buyers in the months ahead.

However, the looming expiration of federal incentives has created a paradox of an artificial boom in sales today, shadowed by the threat of a sharp contraction tomorrow.",https://www.tekedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/EV-charger-charging.jpg,N,,2025-08-09 08:02:46.368049

The report found climate change information has also been altered or removed from federal websites, though less consistently than environmental justice and DEI sites.
But the EPA's primary climate change website remains intact, with links to scientific information and advice for what individuals can do about climate change.","The current Trump administration has made 70% more changes to government environmental websites during its first 100 days than the first Trump administration did, and those changes are bolder, according to a report published by the Environmental Data and Governance Initiative (EDGI).

EDGI is a nonprofit network of researchers who work with data, started after President Trump took office in 2017. It documents loss of access and usability of government environmental information and preserves that information for public use.

The group found that in the first 100 days of the first Trump administration, there were 371 important changes made to websites, while in the same period this year there were 632 changes. EDGI defined an important change as significantly altering the content, focus or links on a page.

The increase was observed even though EDGI started the second Trump term with fewer volunteers and was monitoring fewer pages — 4,429 this year versus more than 25,000 in 2017. In preparing the report, EDGI says members of its network monitored government web pages. Then they made publicly available the information they preserved and the criteria they used to monitor those federal web sites.

""I am surprised by the extent of the removal of information about environmental justice,"" says Gretchen Gehrke, co-founder of EDGI. ""That level of total erasure we didn't see with any topic under the first-term administration.""

The EDGI report shows the administration's biggest targets included diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) efforts and environmental justice — the idea that everyone, regardless of their background, has the right to a healthy environment and to participate in environmental decisions. Trump signed an executive order on January 20 eliminating programs, offices and positions related to both issues. That was after former President Biden made environmental justice a central goal for his administration.

""Under President Trump's leadership, agencies are refocusing on their core missions and shifting away from ideological activism,"" Taylor Rogers, White House assistant press secretary, wrote in an email to NPR.

The EDGI report says that the effort to take down websites began the day after Trump took office in January. The Council on Environmental Quality's Climate and Economic Justice Screening Tool was removed, along with nine similar screening tools at other agencies within the next month. Those tools identified disadvantaged communities in order to fulfill a Biden administration goal of ensuring that 40% of climate program benefits went to them.

The report found climate change information has also been altered or removed from federal websites, though less consistently than environmental justice and DEI sites. The federal climate change research website globalchange.gov was shut down. But the EPA's primary climate change website remains intact, with links to scientific information and advice for what individuals can do about climate change.

A widely used National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) site, climate.gov, stopped publishing new content this summer, after the staff of 10 people who contributed to it was terminated. The site published information about changing weather patterns, drought conditions and greenhouse gas emissions and had received nearly one million visitors every month.

Gehrke says there's little oversight governing how an administration manages government websites.

""We really need to protect our information better,"" they say. ""Websites are the primary means by which the government communicates with the public."" And Gehrke says good information is essential for the public to participate in a democracy.

Without that funding, Klein fears that some renewable energy projects in rural and Indigenous communities may never get off the ground.
Federal funding supports between 40 and 50 percent of the institute’s budget, and abrupt changes this spring meant interruptions to long-term climate research projects that require consistent data collection.
Any funding pauses could interrupt the institute’s ongoing monitoring of ocean conditions and the effects of climate change, according to Duffy-Anderson.
GMRI is part of a broader research ecosystem that is studying the impacts of climate change along Maine’s coast.","A University of Maine initiative exploring ways to bring renewable energy to Indigenous and rural communities was gaining momentum this spring when the Trump administration abruptly cancelled its $1 million federal grant.

The Environmental Protection Agency award is one of dozens of federal grants to Maine research institutions that have been cancelled or paused as the Trump administration cracks down on what it sees as wasteful spending. This includes cuts targeting environmental justice initiatives and climate change research.

The UMaine project, which was in its second year of a Science to Achieve Results award, had pulled together more than 100 people from the Wabanaki Nations and rural communities throughout Maine to discuss local renewable energy goals and pathways to reach them.

Over $900,000 of the award was unused at the time of the cancellation, according to project lead and University of Maine professor Sharon Klein.

“We’ve been really smart with our money,” Klein said. “It was definitely a big blow to get the termination because we felt like we were… kind of just hitting our stride.”

The grant was briefly reinstated on June 5 — only to be revoked again four days later.

“There was no explanation for anything,” Klein said. “You just get these emails. So they’re like, ‘It’s terminated,’ ‘Nope, it’s back,’ ‘Nope, it’s terminated again.’”

The EPA did not respond to a request for comment by publication.

Without that funding, Klein fears that some renewable energy projects in rural and Indigenous communities may never get off the ground. Local opposition to solar and wind projects is common, and the development process is burdensome. She’s still meeting with community members and advising them on grant applications, but she’s spread thin.

“We risk communities being unprepared for the disasters that are coming for them with climate change, because they haven’t had the capacity to… prepare,” Klein said.

While much of the initiative’s efforts have been curtailed by the grant cancellation, one of the positions it funded has been salvaged by a grant from the Maine state government: the coordinator for climate and energy resilience projects with the Wabanaki Nations.

The coordinator, Kelsey Flores, continues to support the first update to the Penobscot Nation’s strategic energy plan in 20 years, training of new technicians to install energy-efficient appliances, and recently secured $15,000 for emergency preparedness kits for households.

Though the swift rescission of the STAR grant caused the cancellation of emerging energy projects, Flores says there’s still hope to bring electric heat pumps, solar and other projects to Wabanaki communities.

The grant cancellation “is affecting almost every initiative that we have,” Flores said, “and we really are trying to restructure things so that we can still move forward.”

The University of Maine isn’t the only research institution that has seen cuts to federally funded climate change initiatives.

Down the coast in Portland, the nonprofit Gulf of Maine Research Institute has had $4 million in federal awards paused or terminated since February, according to the organization’s chief scientific officer Janet Duffy-Anderson.

Federal funding supports between 40 and 50 percent of the institute’s budget, and abrupt changes this spring meant interruptions to long-term climate research projects that require consistent data collection.

One of the early casualties involved the institute’s “energy solutions” program, said Dave Reidmiller, the nonprofit’s chief impact officer. That included an initiative to understand concerns lobster and groundfish fishermen might have with the development of offshore wind projects.

The program received two federal awards — one from the EPA, another from the Department of Energy. Both awards were frozen after Trump took office, halting GMRI’s engagement work with the fishing industry. The DOE grant was restored months later, but the EPA grant was terminated.

“They were really intended to elevate the interests and concerns of the fishing industry in the offshore wind development process,” said Reidmiller. “A core piece of that was making sure that the best available science and technical information was in their hands to weigh in in an informed manner with the federal decision makers.”

In addition to the stop-and-go pauses and termination of existing awards, research institutions across the country have been grappling with a longer review process that federal agencies are now instituting before releasing funds.

This includes funding from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, where awards over $100,000 have to be reviewed and approved by the head of the U.S. Commerce Department, Axios reported in April.

Any funding pauses could interrupt the institute’s ongoing monitoring of ocean conditions and the effects of climate change, according to Duffy-Anderson. Such interruptions cause mariners to lose access to buoy data that informs how they navigate the ocean, and could diminish the accuracy of GMRI’s long-term forecasts and projections.

“Not only are your weather forecasts going to be probably less skillful and less accurate, but the model forecast for the longer term (models) are going to be inhibited as well,” said Reidmiller. “So it’s a real disservice to anybody who cares about the weather.”

Researchers are concerned about what these changes and the Trump administration’s proposed budget cuts suggest for federal funding opportunities going forward, including at other nonprofit research outfits like the Downeast Institute.

“NOAA in general funds so many important programs across the nation and we hope that funding will continue to flow,” said Kyle Pepperman, associate director of the Downeast Institute. “We are worried but we are also very diversified so we should be able to weather this storm.”

Duffy-Anderson with GMRI was blunt about the impacts reduced funding opportunities would have on her institution and beyond. GMRI is part of a broader research ecosystem that is studying the impacts of climate change along Maine’s coast.

“If we don’t have opportunities for continued research,” Duffy-Anderson said, “it really slows that information exchange and is going to have a significant impact in the future.”",https://themainemonitor.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Gulf-of-Maine-Research-Center.jpeg,N,,2025-08-09 13:04:33.823090

In one of them, protecting bald eagles suddenly emerged as a Trump administration priority.","Bald eagles must be protected to the fullest extent of the law from dangerous wind turbines, President Trump’s interior secretary declared this week.

But four months ago, President Trump called for gutting the very law that applies, the Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act, calling it a burden on oil and gas producers.

Trump administration officials insisted there is no conflict between the two positions and said the president is consistently enforcing laws for all forms of energy development.

“President Trump has taken vast measures to unleash American energy by rolling back regulatory burdens while continuing to enforce the Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act to protect the Bald Eagle species — a historic symbol of American greatness,” Taylor Rogers, a White House spokeswoman, said in a statement.

Conservationists said the Trump administration’s embrace of America’s iconic bird is just a pretext for attacking the wind industry, which the president has publicly seethed about ever since he lost a legal battle to stop a wind farm from being built in view of one of his Scottish golf courses.

It also underscores the double standard the Trump administration has for months employed around energy policy. Mr. Trump has declared that the United States faces an energy “emergency” but has taken dozens of steps to throttle the development of wind and solar power. And in easing the way for coal, oil and gas development, the Trump administration has proposed several measures that would weaken protections for eagles and other migratory birds.

“All of the concern for eagles is concentrated solely on wind right now,” said Sarah Krakoff, a professor of environmental law at the University of Colorado, Boulder.

Wind energy is responsible for less than 0.01 percent of human-caused bird fatalities, according to the American Clean Power Association, a renewable energy lobbying group. Federal data shows wind turbines cause significantly fewer bird deaths than buildings, cats or oil pits. The Audubon Society says that climate change poses a bigger threat to birds than wind power.

When it comes to bald eagles, the leading cause of death varies by region, but power line collisions and lead poisoning are consistently cited as major threats. In Michigan, avian influenza has led to the deaths of at least 18 eagles this year, according to the state’s Department of Natural Resources.

The bald eagle, with its white head and yellow beak, appears on the Great Seal of the United States, flags, currency and military insignia but was only officially designated the national bird in 2024.

It is protected under the Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act of 1940. The law prohibits anyone from killing, wounding or “taking” eagles (including their feathers, nests or eggs) unless granted a permit by the interior secretary. Violations can result in fines, criminal penalties or even prison time.

The law, along with the Endangered Species Act of 1973 and the Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918, has been credited with bringing the bald eagle back from the brink of extinction in addition to the banning of the insecticide DDT in 1972.

President Trump has sought to weaken all three laws.

In March the administration announced it would no longer penalize companies for accidentally killing birds under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act, and blocked a regulation proposed during the Biden administration that would have enshrined additional protections for birds.

The move was viewed as a major victory for oil and gas companies, which argued the industry was unfairly prosecuted for accidental bird deaths.

The administration also proposed to weaken the Endangered Species Act by excluding the destruction of habitat from the definition of what it means to harm imperiled plants and animals. The oil industry said that would speed up permits and make it easier to drill in the United States.

And in April, Mr. Trump signed an executive order that directed agencies to sunset regulations that stem from the Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act, along with other federal laws. “By rescinding outdated regulations that serve as a drag on progress, we can stimulate innovation and deliver prosperity to everyday Americans,” the order said.

In recent weeks the administration has issued a barrage of rules aimed at blocking wind and solar production.

In one of them, protecting bald eagles suddenly emerged as a Trump administration priority.

Mr. Burgum directed the Fish and Wildlife Service to review of a regulation that currently allows wind energy companies to obtain a permit to incidentally “take” or harm a certain number of eagles during their operations, provided they take steps to minimize harm.

Mr. Burgum also called on the agency to review violations that have occurred under the law, and “where appropriate,” refer them to the Department of Justice, raising the possibility that wind operators could be criminally prosecuted for eagle deaths.

William Bowerman, a professor of wildlife ecology and toxicology at the University of Maryland, said wind turbines “can have a detrimental effect” on bald and golden eagles but not enough to threaten the overall population.

Some called the new bald eagle policy cynical.

“If they cared about eagles they would create regulatory protections for them,” said Tracy Stone-Manning, president of The Wilderness Society who led the Bureau of Land Management under the Biden administration.

Ms. Krakoff, the law professor, said she believes the Trump administration is likely to lose legal challenges in its effort to crack down on wind, given that many of the same rules have been loosened for oil and gas. “That will be hard to defend as anything other than arbitrary,” she said.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/08/08/multimedia/00cli-eagles-wind-wplq/00cli-eagles-wind-wplq-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-08-09 08:02:11.501657

US Energy Secretary Chris Wright is facing growing criticism from scientists who say their “worst fears” were realized when Wright revealed that the Trump administration would “update” the US’s premier climate crisis reports.

Wright, a former oil and gas executive, told CNN’s Kaitlin Collins earlier this week that the administration was reviewing national climate assessment reports published by past governments.

Produced by scientists and peer-reviewed, there have been five national climate assessment (NCA) reports since 2000 and they are considered the gold standard report of global heating and its impacts on human health, agriculture, water supplies and air pollution.

“We’re reviewing them, and we will come out with updated reports on those and with comments on those reports,” said Wright, who is one of the main supporters of the administration’s “drill, baby, drill” agenda to boost fossil fuels, which are the primary cause of the climate crisis.

Wright was speaking days after his agency, the Department of Energy, produced a report claiming concern over the climate crisis was overblown. That energy department report was slammed by scientists for being a “farce” full of misinformation.

Speaking to CNN about the national climate assessment reports, Wright claimed they “weren’t fair in broad-based assessments of climate change.” He added: “When you get into departments and look at stuff that’s there and you find stuff that’s objectionable, you want to fix it,” he said.

In recent weeks the Trump administration deleted the website that hosted the periodic, legally mandated, national climate assessments. (The most recent report can be read in full on the Guardian website.)

Asked about Wright’s comments on the national climate assessment reports, respected climate scientist Michael Mann said in an emailed comment to the Guardian: “This is exactly what Joseph Stalin did.”

In a statement on Thursday, Rachel Cleetus, policy director at the Union of Concerned Scientists, and one of the authors of the sixth NCA report due in 2028 that the administration dismissed earlier this year, said she was dismayed by Wright’s comments: “Secretary Wright just confirmed our worst fears—that this administration plans to not just bury the scientific evidence but replace it with outright lies to downplay the worsening climate crisis and evade responsibility for addressing it.”

“The process for developing the congressionally mandated National Climate Assessment reports is rigorous, ” she added, “with federal agencies and hundreds of scientists constructing this solid scientific foundation that decision makers, businesses and the public rely on to stay safe in a world made more perilous each day by climate change.”

“People across the country are already reeling from climate-fueled worsening heatwaves, floods, wildfires and storms. Lying about that reality doesn’t change it; it just leaves people in harm’s way. We urge Congress to intervene to safeguard the integrity of the NCA reports so they remain vital, lifesaving tools in the fight against climate change.”

The NCA reports are published by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and a Department of Energy spokesperson told CNN that Wright was “not suggesting he personally would be altering past reports.”

In May, the American Meteorological Society and the American Geophysical Union said they would join forces to produce peer-reviewed research on the climate crisis’ impact after the NCA contributors for the 2028 publication were dismissed.

The acquisition covers Northvolt Ett and Ett Expansion in Skellefteå, Northvolt Labs in Västerås, and Northvolt Drei in Heide, Germany. Lyten will also take over the company’s patents and proprietary technology. The transaction follows Lyten’s earlier purchases of other Northvolt assets, including its California Cuberg plant, the Dwa battery energy storage system (BESS) manufacturing site in Poland and Northvolt’s BESS product and IP portfolio.

Northvolt filed for bankruptcy in March 2025, ceasing production in June after failing to secure a buyer in time. The company had accumulated around US$8 billion in debt, with major unsecured creditors including Goldman Sachs and Volkswagen, whose brands Scania, Porsche and Audi had been Northvolt customers. Bankruptcy trustee Mikael Kubu said many creditors would face significant losses.

Matthias Arleth, Northvolt’s former Chief Operations Officer, told Reuters the company had been producing up to 30,000 high-quality battery cells per week at the Skellefteå plant before operations halted. “The quality of the cells was in the 90% yield range,” Arleth said, adding that this output had been a decisive factor in the sale.

“Lyten’s acquisition of the Northvolt assets brings the facilities and Swedish talent to accelerate this mission by years, just at the moment when demand for Lyten lithium-sulfur batteries is growing to meet energy independence, national security, and AI data center needs,” says Dan Cook, CEO, Lyten.

Lyten plans to restart operations in Skellefteå and Västerås immediately after the deal closes. The company is also working with the German government to advance plans for a 15 GWh battery manufacturing facility in Heide and is pursuing the acquisition of Northvolt Six in Quebec, Canada, which is constructing a 15 GWh facility in its first phase.

The office is reviewing the EPA notice and determining next steps in consultation with the Maine Office of Attorney General, the energy office said.
So far it has spent about $200,000 of the grant, according to energy office spokesperson Afton Vigue.
The funding was projected to help about 20,000 low income people in Maine lower electric bills through incentives for rooftop solar panels and cooperative solar arrays, according to the office.","The Trump administration has stripped Maine of a $62 million grant to help low income households access solar power.

In a Thursday letter to the state, the Environmental Protection Agency said the recent Republican tax law, called the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, revoked the $7 billion ""Solar for All"" national grant program.

""Thus, any attempt to continue the program’s administration, in the absence of any authorizing legislation or appropriated funds for that purpose, is no longer legally permissible,"" the agency said.

But supporters of the national program claim it is being shut down illegally and will hurt Americans struggling with high electric bills.

""Canceling the program deprives Maine of access to affordable solar, energy storage, and the skilled electricians, installers, and construction workers needed to meet our energy and economic needs now and in the future,"" said Dan Burgess, director of the Maine Governor's Energy Office.

""We remain committed to this program and will review all options to preserve it,"" Burgess added.

The office is reviewing the EPA notice and determining next steps in consultation with the Maine Office of Attorney General, the energy office said.

Maine received its Solar for All award last April. So far it has spent about $200,000 of the grant, according to energy office spokesperson Afton Vigue.

The EPA approved the office's Solar for All plan just last month. It intended to introduce the program in early 2026.

The funding was projected to help about 20,000 low income people in Maine lower electric bills through incentives for rooftop solar panels and cooperative solar arrays, according to the office.

It also included funding to train 700 Maine residents in electrical work, construction and other trades, Viggue said.

The Solar for All program was established in 2022 through the Inflation Reduction Act. The EPA made awards to 60 states and tribes through the program.

In a statement, Vermont's Independent Senator Bernie Sanders said he introduced Solar for All to help working families save money.

The groups estimate the losses since January have also cost 10,000 new clean energy jobs.

The tax credits, bolstered in the landmark climate bill passed under former President Joe Biden in 2022, are crucial for boosting renewable technologies key to the clean energy transition. E2 estimates that $132 billion in plans have been announced since the so-called Inflation Reduction Act passed, not counting the cancellations.

The House bill effectively renders moot many of the law’s incentives. Advocacy groups decried the potential impact that could have on the industry after the multitrillion-dollar tax breaks package passed.

“The House’s plan coupled with the administration’s focus on stomping out clean energy and returning us to a country powered by coal and gas guzzlers is causing businesses to cancel plans, delay their plans and take their money and jobs to other countries instead,” E2 executive director Bob Keefe said.

The Senate is now reviewing the bill with an informal July 4 deadline to get it to the president’s desk.

WHAT HAS BEEN CANCELED

Some of the most recent cancellations include the Kore Power battery factory in Arizona and BorgWarner’s closure of two EV manufacturing sites in Michigan. Bosch suspended a $200 million investment in a hydrogen fuel cell factory in South Carolina, citing changes within the market over the past year in a statement to The Associated Press.

Tariffs, inflationary pressures, nascent company struggles and low adoption rates for some technologies may also have been reasons for these companies’ plans changing. For instance, the battery storage and electric vehicle sectors have seen the most impact in 2025, with the latter especially having had had a difficult past few years. Several projects spurred by the IRA were also canceled prior to 2025.

Of the projects canceled this year, most — more than $12 billion worth — came in Republican-led states and congressional districts, the analysis said. Red districts have benefited more than blue ones from an influx of clean energy development and jobs, experts say.

Georgia and Tennessee are particularly at risk because they are highly invested in EV and battery production, said Marilyn Brown, an energy policy professor at the Georgia Institute of Technology who was not involved in the analysis.

“If all of a sudden these tax credits are removed, I’m not sure how these ongoing projects are going to continue,” said Fengqi You, an engineering professor at Cornell University who also was not involved.

A handful of Republican lawmakers have urged the continuation of energy tax credits, with some saying in an April letter to Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D. that a repeal could disrupt the American people and weaken the county’s position as a global energy leader.

THE U.S. AND THE GLOBAL STAGE

The Trump administration has sought to dismantle much of Biden’s environmental and climate-related policy — what he calls the Democrats’ “green new scam” — withdrawing again from the Paris climate agreement, rolling back countless landmark pollution regulations and environmental initiatives, reconsidering scientific findings supporting climate action, blocking renewable energy sources and more in an effort to bolster a fossil fuel-led “American energy dominance” agenda.

Meanwhile other countries are proceeding with green investments. The European Parliament is committing to the European Union Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism, a policy meant to prevent “carbon leakage,” or companies moving production to countries where climate policies are less strict. And the International Maritime Organization is moving toward a global carbon tax on shipping.

In a sign that not all hope is lost for the future of renewables in the U.S., April alone saw nearly $500 million in new development, with Japanese manufacturing company Hitachi’s energy arm building out transmission and electrification operations in Virginia and materials and technology company Corning investing in solar manufacturing in Michigan.

Still, $4.5 billion in development was canceled or delayed in May, according to E2’s tally.",http://www.milwaukeeindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/060425_CleanEnergyCanceled_01_Zstock.jpg,N,,2025-08-09 06:59:37.873956

In the U.S., a slower EV ramp means these businesses will retain a customer base for longer, delaying the urgency to adapt.
While this may be seen as a reprieve for some, it also risks leaving service networks less prepared for the eventual acceleration in EV adoption.
In Europe, phased bans on new ICE sales, combined with dense charging networks and purchase incentives, are compressing the adoption timeline.
Costs will continue to come down, technology will improve, and many states will keep pushing forward regardless of federal policy.","In July 2025, the Trump administration moved to slow the pace of electric vehicle adoption in the United States through a package of policy reversals and trade measures. Federal purchase incentives for new and used EVs will end on September 30, the national charging infrastructure program has been shut down, and California’s authority to enforce its zero-emission vehicle mandate has been rescinded. The administration has also imposed steep tariffs on imported EVs and auto parts, while opening investigations that could extend similar duties to critical battery minerals and key EV components. These steps land at a moment when U.S. EV sales are edging toward a tipping point, raising questions about whether policy headwinds can stall a market already shaped by global momentum and shifting consumer economics.

These actions have immediate and long-term implications. They raise prices, reduce consumer incentives, and send mixed signals to automakers that had been ramping up production in expectation of stricter emissions standards. The net effect is a slowdown in the S-curve of EV adoption, with the United States now facing a delay in reaching key tipping points in the transition away from internal combustion.

This piece is part of an intermittent series of articles on the coming tipping points in EV adoption indicated by the complementary systems change observations of diffusion of innovations, logistic growth or the s-curve, and complex adaptive systems, introduced in the first article. The second dealt with changes when 5%–15% penetrations of EVs were reached, something already present in some markets. The third dealt with the critical 15%–40% range, when change is accelerating and the internal combustion services industry starts feeling the impacts. The fourth dealt with the next big transition, the 40%–80% range, when internal combustion service firms start shuttering en masse, requiring significant governmental assistance transitioning work forces. The fifth article explored where Europe is and where it will be, with the conclusion being that it will be well into the deep transformation away from internal combustion vehicles by 2035. After this article on the United States, I’ll likely assess China and India before winding up the series.

Under the new policy environment in the United States, the path from 5% to 15% BEV share of new vehicle sales will likely extend into the late 2020s, a slower climb than the three to four years seen in markets with supportive policies. Automakers may prioritize profitable gasoline and diesel trucks and SUVs in the absence of aggressive fuel economy rules. Without federal purchase incentives, the affordability gap between EVs and comparable ICE models widens, especially with tariffs adding thousands of dollars to the sticker price of many imported EVs and components. This slows consumer adoption, particularly among buyers in middle and lower income brackets who are more price sensitive. Charging infrastructure growth will also be affected, as the freeze on federal funding removes a key support for expanding public charging in areas where private investment is not yet viable.

If this policy stance persists beyond 2028 under continued MAGA-aligned leadership, the result will be a drawn-out progression toward the 40% tipping point where EVs enter the majority of new sales. That milestone, which could have been reached in the early 2030s, would likely slip into the mid-2030s. The gap will be especially visible when comparing the U.S. to Europe and China, where aggressive mandates, incentives, and infrastructure buildouts are keeping adoption on a steeper curve. The U.S. would remain a large market, but increasingly out of sync with global EV trends.

If there is a political shift in 2028 and federal support is restored, the adoption curve could bend back toward the faster trajectory. Restoring tax credits, reimposing strong emissions standards, and resuming charging network funding could see the U.S. move from 15% to 40% EV sales share in four to six years, catching up with the global leaders by the early 2030s. Automakers would still have the product pipelines and supply chain improvements developed for other markets, making a rapid acceleration feasible once the policy environment turns favorable again. However, the years lost to slower growth cannot be recovered, and the market would still be behind where it could have been without the interruption.

An often-overlooked dimension of this slowdown is its impact on the secondary ICE service sector. In countries with faster EV adoption, businesses focused on ICE servicing — muffler shops, oil change franchises, and independent engine repair garages — have already begun to see demand fall, leading to closures or shifts toward EV-related work. Norway’s rapid transition forced many such businesses to retrain or exit. In much of Europe, urban areas are experiencing the same pattern.

In the U.S., a slower EV ramp means these businesses will retain a customer base for longer, delaying the urgency to adapt. While this may be seen as a reprieve for some, it also risks leaving service networks less prepared for the eventual acceleration in EV adoption. The skills, equipment, and investment needed to serve an EV-dominated fleet will still be necessary, and delaying the shift can make the eventual transition more disruptive.

With federal policy turning against electric vehicles and tariffs making imported EVs more expensive, U.S. automakers are likely to double down on selling profitable gasoline and diesel trucks and SUVs into the domestic market. This will keep their ICE production volumes high at home, but it will also mean falling further behind competitors in Europe, China, and other regions where EV adoption is accelerating and automakers are scaling electric platforms aggressively.

By focusing resources on defending domestic ICE sales rather than competing for global EV market share, U.S. manufacturers will further cede leadership in battery technology, supply chain integration, and high-volume electric production to foreign rivals. Over time, this will make it harder for them to sell competitively priced and technologically advanced EVs abroad, reducing export opportunities and narrowing their relevance in the international automotive industry. This in turn will have more domestic impacts.

Comparing the U.S. to other countries underscores how policy and market signals influence the pace of change in both vehicle sales and secondary services. In China, where national policy strongly supports EVs, automakers, suppliers, and service networks are aligning quickly with the electric future. In Europe, phased bans on new ICE sales, combined with dense charging networks and purchase incentives, are compressing the adoption timeline. The secondary service sector there is adapting faster, with growing numbers of EV-specialized repair facilities and declining numbers of ICE-focused shops. In the U.S., the current policy direction risks prolonging reliance on ICE vehicles and the services that support them, even as the rest of the world moves more quickly toward electric mobility.

The EV transition in the United States is still inevitable over the long term. Costs will continue to come down, technology will improve, and many states will keep pushing forward regardless of federal policy. But the timeline to reach critical tipping points is now more dependent on the political cycle. A supportive federal stance after 2028 could reignite momentum and close the gap with other major markets.

Continued resistance could leave the U.S. trailing for much of the next decade, with the impacts felt not only in new vehicle sales but across the entire automotive ecosystem, from manufacturing to fueling to repair and maintenance. The shape of the adoption curve is still being decided, and with it the country’s place in the global shift to electric transportation.",https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/ChatGPT-Image-Aug-8-2025-03_00_54-PM-800x533.png,N,,2025-08-09 07:00:12.390346

The funding will support the construction of 18 DC fast charger sites and 18 Level 2 charging stations, as announced by the organization.

The financial support originates from Volkswagen mitigation funds, according to Carl Lisek, executive director of Drive Clean Indiana. The DC fast chargers will be strategically placed along Indiana’s Alternative Fuel Corridors, providing round-the-clock access at locations such as travel centers, dining areas, and retail hubs along major highways. These corridors align with the federal National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure (NEVI) Formula Program’s efforts to bolster EV charging at key transit points.

“Indiana has already invested more than $13 billion into EV and battery manufacturing facilities, and these new charging sites will help support the next wave of Hoosier EV drivers,” said Ryan Lisek, program director at Drive Clean Indiana, during a briefing in Indianapolis.

The Level 2 chargers will be installed in both urban and rural settings, targeting areas where vehicles are parked for longer periods, such as community centers and commercial zones. These sites, chosen for their visibility, are backed by a mix of private and public investments, though contracts with awardees are still in progress.

Previously, the Indiana Department of Transportation identified 39 sites for NEVI-funded DC fast chargers, originally planned for completion this year. After federal NEVI funding was discontinued, several sites, including six from Pilot, were integrated into GOEVIN’s current initiative, with Pilot contributing two additional locations.

Earlier this year, GOEVIN launched its “Closing the Gap Tour,” visiting eight Indiana cities—Evansville, Clarksville, Indianapolis, Muncie, South Bend, Fort Wayne, Lafayette, and Hammond.

“We’ve seen this in lots of places.” Tumwater Communications Manager Jason Wettstein responded to a request for comment about Myers’ criticism.","(The Center Square) – Ten months after Tumwater, Wash., installed a solar-powered electric vehicle charger in a city park, new data obtained by the Washington Policy Center think tank indicates the EV charger has not lived up to promises made by city officials.

As reported by The Center Square last summer, city officials touted the off-grid nature of the pilot program’s charger, which relies on solar power and battery backup to avoid straining the grid. The charging station in Pioneer Park is ADA accessible and includes a 110-volt outlet for charging electric wheelchairs and bikes. It is also free to use by the public.

“This will be especially helpful in areas where we don’t have existing electrical capacity, or we don’t want to trench through things like athletic fields,” Alyssa Jones Wood, the city’s sustainability manager, said at the time. “This is a pilot, so it has the opportunity to scale up if successful.”

The Washington State Department of Commerce awarded Tumwater a $87,052 grant to install the charger and for maintenance. The city matched that grant with $12,742 from its General Fund allocation for Sustainability Initiatives.

“When the system was installed, it was claimed it could provide 300 miles per day,” Todd Myers, WPC’s vice president for research, wrote in a Thursday blog. “On average, the charger has delivered less than 8% of that amount, about 22 miles per day.”

In a Thursday interview with The Center Square, Myers elaborated on the data.

“After 10 months in service, the system has delivered 1,700 kilowatt-hours of electricity to EVs, the equivalent of 6,800 miles worth of charge for a Tesla Model 3, in all that time,” he said.

Myers noted he was extremely skeptical from the beginning that the project could generate anywhere near what the city projected.

“Tumwater, Wash., is not Phoenix, Ariz. It is literally the worst place in America for solar power … and that’s just because it’s cloudy most of the time,” he observed.

He noted the National Renewable Energy Laboratory has a solar radiation map for all parts of the country. Outside of Alaska, Western Washington fares the worst in terms of sunshine received.

“So, they say it is still reducing CO2 emissions. It has delivered 1.7 megawatt hours of electricity. That’s about 1,400 pounds of CO2. That is nothing,” Myers explained. “On current prices, that’s worth about $37. So, you spent $85,000 to save $37 in the first 10 months.”

He noted that even stretching out the benefit over time does not translate into a worthwhile investment.

“Let’s say this lasts for 20 years,” Myers said. “It won’t, but let’s say it lasts for 20 years. That’s less than $1,000 of value that you spent $85,000 extra today for. So, it’s incredibly wasteful.”

Project supporters in Tumwater indicated they would partner with a company to collect data on usage for the solar EV charger.

“When I reached out to Tumwater to ask them, ‘Can you send me the data?’ what they said was that the company that was providing more granular detail on the data went out of business last year,” Myers told The Center Square. “So, all they have are just sort of the raw data from the system that they can download. They don’t have type, and they don’t have who’s using it …. it’s just raw data.”

Myers argues that Washington’s EV charger grants encourage waste by distorting the costs and benefits.

“This is a common problem, which is that cities like to say, ‘Look, we’re on the cutting edge. We’re leaders in this.’ And then they go out and they buy technology and then the technology either fails, or the company goes out of business,” he said. “We’ve seen this in lots of places.”

Tumwater Communications Manager Jason Wettstein responded to a request for comment about Myers’ criticism.

“People across the country are working to find ways to reduce harmful air pollution that is warming our planet and contributing to natural disasters, and learning through pilot projects like this contributes to that important objective,” Wettstein emailed The Center Square.

“A goal of this pilot project was to increase the amount of publicly available EV charging, and this seemed like a cost-effective way to do that. One other aspect that is harder to monetize is the fact that Pioneer Park floods. The Beam unit, unlike other traditional chargers, is flood-proof up to 9.5 feet.”

Myers noted that city and state officials using taxpayer money for environmental projects that don’t pan out provides skeptics with more ammunition.

“This has sort of become a metaphor for Washington state’s climate policy, where we make all these big promises. We do press releases. We brag about what a leader we are. And then a year later, we find that none of those promises have been met, and a lot of money has been wasted for no environmental benefit,” Myers said. “We know how to do things for the environment where we can deliver on the promises and results. Politicians just choose not to, and they need to be held accountable for it.”",https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/thecentersquare.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/9/02/90246bf0-0d7d-41ca-9c34-377e2eec035e/67ddd1285ccc1.image.jpg,N,,2025-08-09 12:06:19.478258

Radiant in Deal to Deliver Its Microreactor to USAF

Radiant Nuclear, a startup based in California, announced this week that it signed an agreement to deliver the first-of-a-kind (FOAK) unit of its microreactor to a U.S. Air Force military based in 2028. The value of the contract and the location of the USAF base to receive the microreactor were not disclosed in press materials.

Radiant has received funding awards from the US Department of Defense to evaluate the integration of microreactors at the Hill Air Force Base. The military installation located just off I-25, is 30 miles north of Salt Lake City UT, and 182 miles south of Idaho Falls, ID.

The deal is a first for what is intended to be a “mass-manufactured” microreactor. The customer for the plant is the Defense Innovation Unit, Department of the Air Force. The DIU describes its role as the only DoD organization focused on accelerating the adoption of commercial and dual-use technology to solve operational challenges at speed and scale.

The contract comes soon after the Department of Energy selected Radiant’s Kaleidos reactor to be scheduled to test next year at Idaho National Laboratory’s Demonstration of Microreactor Experiments (DOME) facility. This will be the first new design of a U.S. reactor to be tested at DOME in almost 50 years.

“We’re proud to be the first agreement designed to deliver mass-manufactured nuclear microreactors for a U.S. military base,” said Radiant CEO and Founder Doug Bernauer.

“In 36 months, Kaleidos reactors will arrive via truck and within 48 hours plug in, power on, and provide resilient, cyber-secure power to our nation’s Air Force for years without refueling. The mandate of the USAF innovation office is to strengthen our national security by accelerating the adoption of dual-use technology for the military. “

Radiant’s nuclear progress has included hiring former US DOE Assistant Secretary for Nuclear Energy Rita Baranwal in June. Her distinguished technical career includes executive roles at the INL and Westinghouse prior to her government service.

About the Radiant Nuclear Reactor

Radiant’s Kaleidos design is a transportable micro-reactor designed to generate 3MWth and approximately 1MWe. The Kaleidos micro-reactor is a high-temperature gas-cooled reactor (HTGR) using TRISO fuel, helium gas coolant, and prismatic graphite blocks. Each micro-reactor will be fully contained in a single shipping container.

The reactor is being designed to weigh 70 tons (140,000 pounds) and to fit in an 11 x 11 x 35 container. Radiant says the reactor can set up to be producing power within 48 hours of delviery at a customer site. The reactor has a five-year fuel cycle and a 20-year service life. The refueling cycle is carried out at a remote maintenace facility with the reactor returned to service with fresh fuel.

Radiant Fuel Plans

Radiant plans to use HALEU for its Kaleidos SMR. In 2022, Radiant launched a Request for Proposals for fuel fabricators to produce TRISO fuel, and in 2023 the company entered into an agreement with Centrus Energy to work towards a future supply of HALEU for up to 20 Kaleidos microreactors. In 2023, Radiant also received funding from the US DOE to support activities related to qualification modelling for TRISO fuel.

One Size Does Not Fit All

A standard shipping container used globally in international commerce is 40 feet long, 8’6″ high, 8.0′ wide. A so-called ‘hifgh cube’ would be 9’6″ in height. It weighs about 8,600 pounds empty with a cargo capacity of 58,800 pounds. or about 30 tons. The Radiant reactor shipment dimensions are three feet higher and three feet wider and weighs 40 tons more than the capacity of a standard truck shipping container.

These numbers could present challenges for the location of the Radiant Nuclear factory and maintenance facilities near Casper, WY. Currently, local roads and bridges in Casper, WY, have a weight limit of 72,000 pounds for a five axle truck or half of the weight of a Radiant reactor shipment which is 70 tons (140,000 pounds).

For travel on I-25, which serves Casper, WY, with connections to Cheyenne, WY, and Denver, CO, the U.S. Department of Transportation federal highway weight limit is 80,000 pounds for a 5-axle truck which is 30 tons less than the weight of the Radiant microreactor.

Casper, WY, is served by the BSNF, a Class 1 railroad and is only one of seven railroad companies in the US with this level of service. The railroad might be a an option for transporting the radiant reactor to and from the Wyoming facility.

A BSNF flatbed railcar can carry up to 233,000 pounds or 116 tons which is 46 tons more than the weight of the Radiant shipment. However, the width limit for a shipment on a BNSF flatbed rail car, which has to fit through mountain tunnels and bridges, is 10’6″ which is an unforgiving 4 inches too short for the Radiant reactor. BSNF ships large packages all the time such as Boeing jet airliner fuelages. A dialog with the railroad might yield useful results.

Given the weight and size limits of available rail transportation infrastructure, Radiant’s potential design options may be to either change the configuration of a single load to fit within rail car limits or ship the reactor in rail car in compliant size pieces to be assembled on site or disassembled to be returned to the Wyoming site for refueling and maintenance.

Radiant Funding

Radiant raised $60 million in venture funding including $40 million in Series B fundraising in April 2023 and $100 million in Series C fundraising in November 2024, which it plans to use to test the Kaleidos microreactor at the DOME facility and to support siting for a factory that would eventually produce up to 50 microreactors per year.

Radiant also received two awards from the NRIC program: up to $1.5 million for front-end engineering and experiment design (FEEED) in 2023; and up to $5 million for detailed engineering and experiment planning (DEEP) in 2024.

Radiant Chosen for Testing at INL DOME Facility

The U.S. Department of Energy this week made conditional selections for Radiant and Westinghouse to perform the first tests in the Demonstration of Microreactor Experiments (DOME) facility at Idaho National Laboratory. The DOME experiments will be the first of their kind in the world and will fast-track the deployment of American microreactor technologies. The first fueled reactor experiment will start as early as spring 2026.

“Microreactors will play a big role in expanding the use of nuclear power in the United States,” said Mike Goff, the Acting Assistant Secretary for Nuclear Energy.

DOME will be the first microreactor test bed in the world and leverages existing infrastructure at Idaho National Laboratory to safely house and test fueled reactor experiments that produce up to 20 MW of thermal energy. Data collected from the experiments will be used to commercialize each reactor technology.

Radiant will test the Kaleidos Development Unit to advance the company’s commercial 1.2 MWe high-temperature gas reactor (HTGR) design as a potential replacement for diesel generators. Kaleidos is designed to operate for five years before refueling and could provide reliable backup power to large facilities like military bases and hospitals.

Westinghouse to Test eVinci Microreactor at DOME

DOE selected Westinghouse to test the eVinci Nuclear Test Reactor to inform the development of its commercial transportable microreactor that uses advanced heat pipe technology to passively cool the reactor. The eVinci reactor is designed to produce 5 MWe of electricity on sites as small as two acres of land and could be used to power various applications from remote communities to mining operations or data centers.

Scope of the DOME Test Work for Microreactors

The two reactor developers were competitively selected in 2023 to perform initial activities for potential testing in DOME. Both companies are currently working through the multi-phase DOE authorization process to support the design, fabrication, construction, and testing of each fueled reactor experiment.

The Department estimates each DOME reactor experiment will operate up to six months. The testing campaigns are self-funded by the applicants with the sequencing of experiments based on several criteria, including technology readiness, fuel availability, and a regulatory approval plan. Both companies are expected to meet certain milestones throughout the process to maintain their allotted time in DOME and to ensure efficient use of the test bed.

The DOME test bed is currently under construction and on track to receive its first experiment in early 2026. The facility is operated by DOE’s National Reactor Innovation Center, which enables access to the world-class capabilities across the Department’s national laboratories to accelerate the development of advanced reactor technologies.

DOE recently closed its first round of applications for scheduling experiments in DOME. The next call for applications is anticipated to be in the summer of 2026.

Radiant to Manufacture Its Microreactor in Wyoming

(Cowboy State Daily) Microreactor manufacturer Radiant has signed a deal to mass-produce portable microreactors to power U.S. Air Force bases and promote energy independence. The company wants to make them in the tiny town of Bar Nunn, WY, located 10 miles north of Casper. WY, in Natrona County, WY. (map)

Radiant hopes the military contract adds momentum to its efforts to establish a manufacturing presence in Wyoming.

Radiant executives told a town meeting earlier this year that Wyoming’s workforce, strong career and technical education programs and spot as the nation’s largest uranium producer were factors in choosing Bar Nunn. The plan, which supporters see as a “generational opportunity,” promises to bring high-paying jobs, help Wyoming’s economy rely less on fossil fuels and keep skilled young people from moving away. The project also fits with federal goals to speed up nuclear reactor development.

The proposed facility would span approximately 350,000 square feet and create an estimated 75 jobs initially, with the potential to grow to 250 jobs as production scales up.

Factory operations will include;

New reactors assembled, fueled, and tested, and shipped to customers.

Reactors shipped back to factory for maintenance and refueling. Five year cycle.

Spent fuel securely stored above ground in concrete casks pending a permanent federal government solution.

Conceptual Image of a Radiant Maintenance Facility

Radiant has proposed that when its microreactors need refueling, the units, with the spent fuel, will be shipped back to its manufacturing facility. That’s raised concerns in Natrona County, and it has an interim committee with the Wyoming Legislature considering legislation to allow the storage of nuclear waste. (Infographic Radiant presentation to the Wyoming Legislature )

The Legislature’s Joint Minerals, Business & Economic Development Committee plans to meet again to discuss proposed legislation. It tabled a draft bill during a hearing July 30th held in Casper, and the committee has not yet scheduled a follow up meeting.

The draft authorizes, “the siting of temporary high-level radioactive waste storage facilities and installations within this state.”

The Cowboy State Daily newspaper reports that the powerful Wyoming Freedom Caucus, now the majority in the state legislature, has publicly stated an anti-nuclear waste position. This opposition could make it more difficult for Radiant supporters in the legislature to change the law.

The Radiant site isn’t the only nuclear reactor planned to be built in Wyoming, TerraPower has broken ground for non-nuclear site preparation in Kemmerer, WY, a coal town located in the far southwestern corner of the state. There TerraPower plans to build a 345 MWe sodium cooled advanced reactor to replace a coal fired power plant.

It seems likely that with the TerraPower project underway and Radiant poised to launch its manufacturing center in Wyoming that the state legislature will have to come to grips with the facts about safety related to these reactors and dismiss knee-jerk politics by a faction more interested in political influence than in economic and energy related progress. The state has long been a center of uranium mining and is no newcomer to the world of nuclear fuel and it uses.

General Matter Gets DOE Lease at Paducah for Uranium Enrichment

The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) announced the signing of a lease with General Matter for the reuse of a 100-acre parcel of federal land at the former Paducah Gaseous Diffusion Plant for a new private-sector domestic uranium enrichment facility.

General Matter is one of four companies DOE selected in October 2024 to provide enrichment services for the establishment of a U.S. supply of high-assay low-enriched uranium. Building domestic supply chains is critical to the reshoring and domestic expansion of energy for advanced manufacturing and artificial intelligence data centers.

The lease provides General Matter with a minimum of 7,600 cylinders of existing uranium hexafluoride (UF6) to supply fuel for future re-enrichment operations. Reprocessing of uranium hexafluoride saves the American taxpayer about $800 million in avoided disposal costs.

The cylinders, some of which have been in storage for decades, have been a disposal headache for DOE. Given the demand for enriched uranium at HALEU levels, re-enriching the tails is a commercial way out of a dead end for the agency.

Testimony Before the Subcommittee on Energy and Power, Committee on Energy and Commerce, House of Representatives June 13, 2011 GAO-11-752T.

Statement of Gene Aloise, Director Natural Resources and Environment

General Matter will benefit from a consistent supply of U.S.-origin uranium hexafluoride feed suitable for re-enrichment. Re-enrichment of uranium tails can take place using one of two processes – gas centrifuge or laser based enrichment.

The gaseous diffusion process is consider to be too expensive due to its enormous use of electricity compared to other methods. During the Manhattan Project in the 1940s it took the resources of TVA to provide the plant with enough power to run its operations. The Paduicah plant ceased operations in 2013.

According to the World Nuclear Association, the gaseous diffusion process consumes about 2500 kWh (9000 MJ) per SWU, while modern gas centrifuge plants require only about 50 kWh (180 MJ) per SWU. Enrichment accounts for almost half of the cost of nuclear fuel and about 5% of the total cost of the electricity generated. At its end of life USEC reported the plant consumed a peak electrical demand of 3,040 megawatts of power.

The American Nuclear Society Newswire notes that from 1952 to 2013, the Paducah Gaseous Diffusion Plant enriched uranium was the last government-owned uranium enrichment facility operating in the United States. The plant produced LEU originally as feedstock for nuclear weapons materials and later for commercial nuclear power plants.

The DOE has been actively cleaning up the Paducah site since 1988 with the intention of making it available for reuse for industrial redevelopment. Subject to licensing by the NRC, General Matter’s construction is expected to begin in 2026 with uranium enrichment operations planned to begin by the end of the decade.

World Nuclear News reported General Matter was one of four companies selected in October 2024 by the US Department of Energy to provide enrichment services to help establish a US supply of high-assay low-enriched uranium (HALEU).

According to information available at the time, the company had been registered in California earlier in the year, with Scott Nolan named as its CEO. Nolan, a former SpaceX employee, is a partner at venture capital firm Founders Fund which was co-founded by billionaire investor Peter Thiel. While he has extensive experince with high tech firms, he has no experience in the nuclear energy nor the uranium enrichment industries.

The co-founder of the firm is Lee Robinson who worked for the Defense Innovation Unit for about five years. Robinson’s expertise is in banking and finance. In a separate unrelated action this month, that agency entered into an agreement with Radiant Nuclear to deliver its HTGR microreactor to a USAF base.

NRC Regulatory Engagement Plan Pending

Last December General Matter submitted a Letter of Intent (ML24365A102) to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) in anticipation of a “forthcoming application for the necessary licenses to support the production and handling of High-Assay, Low-Enriched Uranium (HALEU).”

The letter is signed by Ashby Bridges, VP of Facilities at General Matter. Prior work includes extensive experience in technical management of nuclear criticality operations at Los Alamos National Laboratory, URENCO, and Westinghouse, among others.

About six months ago, while still in so-called “stealth mode,” General Matter posted a recruitment notice on Linkedin for nuclear engineers with uranium criticality experience.

The General Matter plant has a reported estimated cost of $1.5 billion. The firm is reported to have raised $50 million. The funding round was led by venture capital firm Founders Fund, with partner Peter Thiel joining the board.

NRC Accepts GLE Application to License Its Laser Enrichment Plant

Global Laser Enrichment (GLE) announced that the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) has completed its acceptance review of GLE’s license application for the planned Paducah Laser Enrichment Facility (PLEF). The NRC’s acceptance confirms that the application is sufficiently complete to proceed to formal review marking a major step forward in GLE’s mission to deploy new U.S.-based depleted uranium tails re-enrichment and low enriched uranium production capacity. This plant is distinct from the one planned by General Matter which is expected when built to produce HALEU levels of enriched uranium (10-19% U235).

GLE said the PLEF is expected “to play a pivotal role in rebuilding and strengthening the domestic supply chain for uranium, conversion, and enrichment services. By re-enriching the U.S. Department of Energy’s (DOE) Paducah inventory of depleted uranium tails.”

Support cleanup activities from DOE legacy activities,

Reduce dependence on foreign fuel sources from state-owned entities, and

Lead efforts to re-establish Paducah’s historic role in the U.S. nuclear energy ecosystem.

GLE said in its press statement it remains on track to begin re-enriching the DOE’s Paducah inventory of depleted uranium tails no later than 2030.

Uranium can be enriched by separating isotopes of uranium with lasers. Molecules can be excited by laser light; this is called photoexcitation. Lasers can increase the energy in the electrons of a gaseous form of a specific isotope, changing its properties and allowing lighter U235 to be separated from the heavier U238.

Lightbridge Nuclear Fuel Ready for Irradiation Tests at INL

Lightbridge Corporation (Nasdaq: LTBR), a leader in advanced nuclear fuel technology, today announced the successful fabrication of coupon samples using enriched uranium-zirconium alloy, a critical step in the development of its next-generation Lightbridge Fuel product. The samples are representative of the fuel material alloy composition Lightbridge plans to use in the commercial fuel product designed to improve the performance and safety of nuclear reactors worldwide.

Key highlights of this achievement include:

Successful Extrusion of Enriched Uranium-Zirconium Alloy Samples: Lightbridge has successfully extruded enriched uranium-zirconium alloy samples that match the fuel material alloy composition intended for its future commercial Lightbridge Fuel product. (photos)

Utilization of Proven Fabrication Process: The extrusion process was performed using Lightbridge’s proprietary fabrication method, previously demonstrated at the Idaho National Laboratory (INL), to extrude and co-extrude depleted uranium samples with zirconium-alloy cladding. This proven technology is now applied to the enriched alloy for further development.

Collaboration with INL for Irradiation Testing: The enriched coupon samples will be placed into capsules and undergo irradiation testing at INL’s Advanced Test Reactor (ATR). This work is conducted as part of an existing Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA) between Lightbridge and the Idaho National Laboratory.

Irradiation Testing to Support Regulatory Efforts: The planned irradiation testing program, along with post-irradiation examination activities (the scope of which will be detailed in a future Project Task Statement), is aimed at generating critical irradiation performance data for Lightbridge’s advanced fuel. This data will play a key role in supporting the company’s regulatory licensing and commercialization efforts for deployment of Lightbridge Fuel.

Saudi Arabia Re-ignites Quest for US Support for its Commercial Nuclear Reactor Program

A trade newsletter on energy issues, “Tactical Report” has an unverified report that Saudi Arabia is once again playing the “China card” in its negotiations with the US over enrichment and nuclear energy issues. The full text is behind a very expensive firewall so all I have is a brief summary.

As far back as 2019 Saudi Arabia said if it could not get an acceptable deal, that includes uranium enrichment, it would turn to China for nuclear reactors.

The latest bulletin from Tactical Report (firewall) includes a few new data points.It indicates that Saudi Arabi’s ruler Mohammed bin Salman Al Saud (MBS) will seek reactors from South Korea.

This quest is problematic for South Korea given its relations with the US. Specifically, South Korea is prohibited via its 123 Agreement with the US from exporting its commercial light water reactors to any country that does not also have a 123 Agreement with the US.

Saudi Arabia does not have one and has consistently resisted progress towards a 123 agreement due to its demands for the right to enrichment. The US has maintained that Saudi Arabia can get the nuclear fuel its needs for commercial reactors without having an enrichment facility. Nonproliferation experts have pointed out the Saudi enrichment plant could lead to a nuclear weapons program.

Separately, an earlier report in April “Tactical Report” indicated that MBS was also interested in fusion energy, which does not require uranium enrichment. However, the timeline for commercialization of fusion is likely in the early 2040s according to the UK Atomic Energy Agency which is investing in fusion full tilt at Culham in the UK to shorten that timeline.

Why Raise the Issue Now?

The fact that Saudi impatience with US negotiations over support for its nuclear program has apparently re-surfaced may be related to the dire circumstances in Gaza foreclosing any rapprochement with Israel thus removing it from consideration in US / Saudi relations. By taking diplomatic relations with Israel off the table, Saudi Arabia can now pursue a bilateral nuclear deal with the US without any baggage from its prior proposals for a three-part deal.

However, given the short attention span of the Trump administration, embroiled in multiple controversies like the Epstein files, tariffs, and whatever other domestic distractions consume the White House, getting its concerted focus on Saudi Arabia’s nuclear demands may be a stretch.

Trump has promoted nuclear energy in the US with four executive orders intended to brighten the nuclear energy industry’s domestic prospects, and maybe add export opportunities.

However, the Trump administration recently stumbled badly in its efforts to control the Nuclear Regulatory Commission by firing its chairman, setting off a storm of controversy.

Taken together this is a case of singed fingers quickly removed from contact with hot surfaces.

As the NRC is part of the government involved in reviewing and approving 123 Agreements, it is difficult to see a fast path for the US to grant Saudi Arabia permission in a 123 Agreement to pursue enrichment. The outlook for now appears to be a continued stalemate on the issue.

Saudi Arabia’s claims to play the China card is a thin boast given the impact it would have on US relations, especially in terms of military arms deals and deterrence against Iran, and the degree of control it would give China over Saudi long term energy security.

Human-caused climate change was responsible for a six-to-46-day earlier start to fire season in California between 1992 and 2020, increasing the period in which large swaths of the state were susceptible to destructive burning.

California’s fire seasons likely will continue to get longer and potentially more destructive as climate warming trends continue.

Supported by the National Science Foundation and Department of Energy, future studies like this one are threatened by recent funding freezes and cuts.

The typical start of fire season in California has shifted earlier by an average of more than one day every year in most of the state since the early 1990s, and up to a total change of month and half earlier in some areas, a trend driven by human-caused climate change, according to a UCLA study published in the journal Science Advances.

This trend — even more pronounced in California's higher-elevation mountains and northern forests, where fire season has expanded by an average of two days every year in the same period — likely will continue as climate change continues to warm the planet, according to the study, which was made possible with support from the National Science Foundation and Department of Energy. In parts of California over the last 30 years, warming has pushed the wildfire season anywhere from a week to almost seven weeks earlier.

“These findings underscore the very real impact climate change has on people’s lives and livelihoods,” said Alex Hall, a co-author of the report and director of both the Sustainable LA Grand Challenge and Institute of the Environment and Sustainability, or IoES.

“The critical importance of climate research cannot be overstated. This year is on track to be the most destructive — and costly — in California history as a result of fire. It is essential that we have the resources we need to do this necessary work, producing rigorous, accurate and societally relevant knowledge that can help policymakers make informed choices as they plan for a changing future,” Hall said.

The study found that fuel aridity — the dryness of typical fire fuels like grasses and trees — had the strongest influence on year-to-year shifts in the timing of the onset of fire season, and fuel aridity is largely affected by climate conditions.

“Year to year, there will always be some natural fluctuations,” said Gavin Madakumbura, lead author of the study and a postdoctoral researcher at UCLA. “Some years are wet, others dry. Some years are hotter than others. In our study, we separated the natural climate variations from changes driven by human-caused climate warming.”

“Our results suggest that as climate warming trends continue, this pattern will likely persist, with earlier starts to fire seasons in the coming years. This means longer fire seasons, increasing the potential for more of the state to burn.”

The impact of this trend is most acute in California’s northern mountains, where snowpacks have historically kept the ground and vegetation wetter for longer stretches, but in warmer years, when the snowpack melts earlier, the fire potential rises earlier too.",https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms.ipressroom.com/173/files/20257/6896165e2cfac259967a0ede_Wildfire+2017+Robert+Giovannetti+BLM/Wildfire+2017+Robert+Giovannetti+BLM_mid.jpg,N,,2025-08-09 12:04:17.970669

This dislocation is where unsolicited bids emerge as a powerful indicator.
The Mechanics of Opportunity Distressed energy assets are not just cheap—they are mispriced.
Unsolicited bids for distressed assets are a symptom of this complexity, but also a tool to navigate it.","The energy sector is in a state of quiet rebellion. While the S&P 500 has rallied on the back of AI optimism and consumer discretionary stocks, the Energy Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLE) has lagged, declining 0.4% in May 2024 alone. This divergence is not a temporary blip—it is a signal. A signal that the market is undervaluing a critical asset class: distressed energy infrastructure. And for investors with the patience and vision to navigate the sector's turbulence, unsolicited bids for these assets are becoming a goldmine of opportunity.

The Case for Undervaluation

The energy sector's underperformance is rooted in a collision of forces. Regulatory tailwinds favoring renewables, the lingering shockwaves of the 2022 energy crisis, and the slow burn of industrial demand deceleration in developed economies have left many energy firms with balance sheets stretched to their limits. Consider the numbers: the VIX, a barometer of market fear, has fallen 273 basis points month-to-date in May 2024, reflecting a broader risk-on sentiment. Yet energy stocks remain shackled by their own sector-specific headwinds.

This dislocation is where unsolicited bids emerge as a powerful indicator. When a private equity firm or sovereign wealth fund makes a non-conforming offer for a distressed oil field or a stranded gas pipeline, it is not merely a transaction—it is a vote of confidence in the asset's intrinsic value. These bids often surface when traditional buyers are hesitant, signaling that the market's current pricing does not reflect the asset's long-term potential.

The Mechanics of Opportunity

Distressed energy assets are not just cheap—they are mispriced. Take, for example, a hypothetical scenario where a midstream operator with $5 billion in debt and underperforming shale assets receives an unsolicited bid from a European energy conglomerate. The bid, while below the asset's historical revenue multiples, may reflect the acquirer's strategic calculus: access to U.S. infrastructure, tax incentives for decarbonization, or a bet on a near-term rebound in natural gas prices. For the seller, this is a lifeline; for the buyer, it is a chance to acquire assets at a discount while repositioning them for the energy transition.

The Federal Reserve's anticipated rate cuts in late 2024 and 2025 will further amplify this dynamic. Lower borrowing costs will make restructuring debt-laden energy projects more feasible, while the broader liquidity infusion will encourage investors to take on risk. High-yield energy bonds, which have outperformed their peers despite weak fundamentals, are already a harbinger of this trend.

Strategic Considerations for Investors

For those looking to capitalize on this landscape, the key lies in discernment. Not all distressed assets are created equal. Investors must differentiate between temporary mispricing and permanent impairment. A coal-fired power plant in a state with aggressive renewable mandates is a different proposition than a Gulf Coast refinery with access to low-cost feedstock and export markets.

Moreover, regulatory risk remains a wildcard. The Inflation Reduction Act's tax credits for clean energy and the EPA's methane rules could render certain assets obsolete or costly to operate. Conversely, they could also create value if the acquirer can pivot the asset toward hydrogen production or carbon capture.

The Road Ahead

The energy transition is not a binary switch—it is a mosaic of opportunities and challenges. Unsolicited bids for distressed assets are a symptom of this complexity, but also a tool to navigate it. For investors willing to do the homework, these bids offer a chance to acquire assets at a discount, restructure them for sustainability, and ride the next phase of the energy cycle.

In the coming months, watch for two trends: a surge in cross-border deals as European and Asian firms seek U.S. infrastructure, and a rise in “green” repositioning of brownfield assets. The market may not yet see the value in these properties, but the next wave of energy leaders will.

In the end, the energy sector's current pain is a prelude to its next chapter. For the patient and the bold, the undervalued assets of today could be the cornerstones of tomorrow's energy portfolios.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-08-09 09:00:12.976788

FPL and multiple intervenors filed a joint motion today asking the Florida Public Service Commission (PSC) to suspend technical hearings on FPL's original rates petition so that a settlement agreement can be finalized and filed with the PSC. The parties plan to work to finalize and file the agreement by Aug. 20.

A word from FPL President and CEO Armando Pimentel: ""We are pleased to have reached an agreement in principle with key stakeholders. A settlement would provide a win for our customers and the state of Florida. We appreciate the constructive engagement of key intervenors. Any agreement that we reach should enable FPL to continue to make smart investments on behalf of our customers, ensuring that we can continue to provide reliable electricity to power our fast-growing state while keeping customer bills low.""

Participants: The agreement in principle is supported by the Florida Retail Federation, Florida Industrial Power Users Group, Florida Energy for Innovation Association, Walmart, the Southern Alliance for Clean Energy, EVgo Services, Fuel Retailers, Electrify America, the Federal Executive Agencies and Armstrong World Industries.

How we got here: With FPL's current four-year rate agreement set to conclude at the end of this year, FPL on Feb. 28 submitted a petition to the PSC to set new rates for 2026 through 2029. That kicked off an extensive public review process in which FPL submitted thousands of pages of witness testimony and documents in support of its proposal. FPL responded to more than 3,000 interrogatories and requests for documents from 13 intervening parties and FPL witnesses participated in more than 30 depositions. The PSC conducted 10 public hearings across the state in May and June in which hundreds of customers weighed in on FPL's proposal.

What's next: FPL and the supporting parties will appear before the PSC Monday to ask commissioners to suspend the technical hearing to allow the parties to finalize the agreement. If the PSC accepts the motion, a new hearing date will be set to review the finalized agreement. Any new PSC-approved rates would take effect Jan. 1, 2026.

If approved, the company expects both the mine and the nickel processing plant to be operational in 2029.","The United States has been so worried about trade imbalances for basic raw materials that it set aside tens of billions of dollars to support new domestic mines and metal refineries. The President even invoked the Defense Production Act to get the Pentagon involved.

That president was Joe Biden. President Trump is picking up where Biden left off, and making even more investments.

One which is getting support from the Bi-partisan Infrastructure Law is in the central North Dakota town of Beulah, population 3,000. Coal and farming have been the economic anchors here for decades. Now, a former coal mine is set to be transformed into the site of a new processing plant for nickel ore coming from Minnesota.

""Basically when you put all your eggs in one basket and something changes, it makes it difficult for your community to thrive and continue to grow"" said Beaver Brinkman, Beulah's Economic Development and Operations Director. ""Hopefully, this will take and diversify our economy.""'

In 2023, The US Department of Energy awarded a $114 million grant for the new nickel processing plant. Nickel is used in electric car batteries. Tesla signed a contract for 75,000 metric tons from the plant.

It's also used in computers and to strengthen steel. Retired four-star Marine General John Allen says that makes nickel a strategic asset.

""What the Pentagon's trying to do is to lock in and preserve these raw materials for the highly sophisticated technologically advanced warfare that the United States wields today,"" he said.

Talon Metals owns both the Minnesota mine and the proposed processing facility in Beulah. The Pentagon gave Talon a $20 million matching grant to look for more minerals in the US. New mines don't open very often here, and refineries to process what comes out of them are even more rare.

""The United States and Europe and other of the technologically advanced societies sort of backed themselves into an environment where we imported a lot of these materials, mostly from China,"" Allen said.

Allen is on the board of the US arm of a security-oriented think tank called GLOBESEC. They estimate China controls 75% of the world's critical metals and mining materials.

Talon vice president Jessica Johnson welcomes the federal backing.

""Across multiple administrations, I think it's clear that domestic raw materials for our supply chains, everything from clean energy technologies to our defense and national security platforms and technologies– it's a bipartisan issue,"" she said.

There's no organized opposition to the nickel plant in Beulah.

Over breakfast at the Country Kettle restaurant, retiree Garry Teske says it sounds like it could bring some good jobs. But he'd like to know more.

""I have nothing against it but it's pretty hush hush around here,"" Teske said. ""We don't hear much.""

Talon's Minnesota mine is facing some opposition from a neighboring tribe and environmental groups. If approved, the company expects both the mine and the nickel processing plant to be operational in 2029.

Nevada has had a 20-year Colorado River drought and a 150 foot drop in Lake Mead water levels over that same period.

A recent report by nonprofit Western Resource Advocates said that NV Energy demands between 2023 and 2035 are expected to grow as much as 54%.

“This demand is being driven primarily be unprecedented projected load growth in NV Energy’s northern service territory,” read the report. The report authors added that in the northern service territory, “almost all of the new requests – approximately 5,900 MW – are due to 12 high-load factor data centers.”

Data centers are undergoing a boom period across the U.S., largely thanks to the growth of the energy-intensive artificial intelligence models that have become widely used in recent years.

The data centers host the computer systems that run these massive models, and in order to do so require city-sized levels of power. The Department of Energy reported that data centers in 2023 used roughly 4.4% of total U.S. electricity – but are expected to account for 6.7% to 12% by as soon as 2028.

In Nevada, between the Las Vegas area and the Tahoe Reno Industrial Center (TRIC) outside Reno, there are currently 59 data centers, as per Data Center Map.

At TRIC, a new $3 billion facility by Vantage Data Centers is expected to open early 2026.

“Nevada provided us a strategic opportunity to accelerate time-to-market for our customers while supporting the local economy through the creation of long-term jobs and tax revenue,” Vantage Data Center’s regional president, Dana Adams, wrote in a statement,

The new facility is expected to employ over 1,200 people but place a further strain on the area’s energy and water needs.

Water usage by these data centers, which is commonly used to cool down the potential overheating of the computers, has led to further regulation in Southern Nevada. In 2024, a ban was placed on systems that allowed the water to evaporate after helping to cool down the systems with most of the used water now required to be sent back to Lake Mead.

“If somebody came in with an evaporative cooling system in their development today, they would not get development approval,” Southern Nevada Water Authority spokesman Bronson Mack told the Las Vegas Review Journal.

Lula’s environmental credentials are under close scrutiny in advance of the annual UN climate summit in November in the Amazon city of Belem.","Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva has signed into law a bill easing environmental licensing rules, but bowed to pressure from activist groups as he vetoed key provisions that would have made it easier for companies to secure environmental permits.

Lula approved on Friday what detractors have dubbed the “devastation bill”, but struck down or altered 63 of its nearly 400 articles, his office’s executive secretary, Miriam Belchior, told reporters.

The president had faced mounting pressure from environmental groups to intervene in the bill, which was backed by Brazil’s powerful agribusiness sector and focused on rolling back strict licensing rules that had kept the destruction of the Amazon rainforest in check.

A previous version of the bill adopted by lawmakers last month would have meant that for some permits, all that would have been required is a simple declaration of the company’s environmental commitment.

Lula’s revisions, however, reinstated the current strict licensing rules for strategic projects.

Belchior said the new proposal sought to preserve the integrity of the licensing process, ensure legal certainty, and protect the rights of Indigenous and Quilombola communities.

She added that Lula will introduce a “Special Environmental Licence” designed to fast-track strategic projects while filling the legal gaps created by the vetoes.

“We maintained what we consider to be significant advances in streamlining the environmental licensing process,” she said.

Nongovernmental organisation SOS Atlantic Forest, which garnered more than a million signatures calling for a veto of the law, hailed Lula’s move as “a victory” for environmental protection.

Lula’s environmental vetoes

Of the provisions struck down by Lula, 26 were vetoed outright, while another 37 will either be replaced with alternative text or modified in a new bill that will be sent to Congress for ratification under a constitutional urgency procedure.

Securing support for the amendments is far from guaranteed for the leftist leader. Brazil’s conservative-dominated Congress has repeatedly defeated key government proposals, including overturning previous presidential vetoes.

Lawmakers aligned with embattled ex-president Jair Bolsonaro are also blocking legislative activity amid an escalating political standoff, as they call for the former president’s charges around an alleged failed coup attempt in 2022 to be dropped.

Speaking at a Friday news conference in the capital, Brasilia, Environment Minister Marina Silva maintained a positive tone, telling reporters that Lula’s vetoes would ensure that “the economy does not compete with ecology, but rather they are part of the same equation”.

“We hope to be able to streamline licensing processes without compromising their quality, which is essential for environmental protection at a time of climate crisis, biodiversity loss and desertification,” said Silva.

Silva said a previous version of the bill, approved by Congress last month, threatened the country’s pledge to eliminate deforestation by 2030 and described it as a “death blow” to Brazil’s licensing framework.

But, she said, Lula’s revised version meant Brazil’s “targets to reach zero deforestation” and its goal to “cut CO2 emissions by between 59 percent and 67 percent remain fully on track”.

The grant program, known as Solar for All, was created by the Biden administration to bring cheap, affordable solar energy to low-income households.

Connecticut received $62.4 million from the program last year. The state was planning to use that money to help thousands of households transition to solar through an initiative called Project SunBridge.

The project was focused on multi-family affordable housing units with participants of the program estimated to save about 20% off their energy bill, according to the Department of Energy and Environmental Protection (DEEP).

But the Environmental Protection Agency cancelled the program on Aug. 7. EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin said the grant was eliminated under the tax-and-spending law passed by President Trump last month.

DEEP said it received notice from the EPA Thursday night that the grant had been immediately cancelled.

Gov. Ned Lamont, a Democrat, decried the cancellation in a statement Friday afternoon.

“At a time when households could benefit from transitioning to solar energy now more than ever, the Trump administration is attempting to terminate a program that would lower energy costs for families and businesses while also delivering clean energy,” Lamont said. “These funds belong to the taxpayers of Connecticut.”

Long a gas-weighted pure play, Jonah Energy is adding to its holdings and looking to grow its footprint across shale plays in the Lower 48.

The family office-backed company closed in July on its acquisition of High Plains Natural Resources with partner Burk Royalty Co. Ltd. The acquired assets include some 61,000 net acres and 250 operated wells across Yoakum County, Texas, and Lea County, New Mexico, in the Northwestern Shelf of the Permian Basin’s San Andres formation.

The wells are expected to produce an average of 15,000 boe/d during the third quarter with a product mix of 50% oil and 75% total liquids. The acreage position also includes substantial drilling inventory with development expected to commence in 2026.

The deal “enhances our cashflow and footprint in the Permian Basin following our successful acquisition of Tap Rock earlier this year,” said Jonah Energy CEO Brian Reger. “It aligns with our disciplined strategy of expanding in high-quality plays and strengthens our position as a leader focused on responsible, long-term value creation.”

In January, the company closed on its acquisition of Tap Rock Resources, an NGP-backed Delaware Basin producer in New Mexico. It was the first foray outside of the Rockies for Jonah, which has plans on growing well beyond the region.

Reger told Hart Energy that during the last two years, the firm has been building its foundation for growth, and that’s where the Tap Rock acquisition and more recent High Plains buy come in.

“Now we're executing on that plan, so the Tap Rock deal was the first of many,” Reger said.

Jonah is generally agnostic toward both basin and commodity, he said.

“We're looking to grow and gain cash flow and see where it takes us.”

While Jonah’s position in the Delaware is surrounded by larger players, the company isn’t interested in selling, Reger said.

“Our owner is a long-term investor. He wants to grow this business and hold this business for a long time,” he said. “There may be assets here and there where we look to do that, but generally we're looking to gain assets, not shed assets.”

The Delaware opportunity was a chance to obtain additional acreage and production from offset operators looking to get cash to invest in their own developments. It also realigns the firm’s resource blend.

Achieving balance

“We are much more balanced liquids to gas than we were a year ago, and the most recent acquisition is even more oily, so we are getting more liquids rich,” Reger said. “Having liquids and oil assets in our portfolio helps manage risk, so we're balanced in our approach.”

Jonah is interested in growth via M&A and is open to bolt-ons at any point.

“Our growth is coming in a couple of different phases, and the current phase of growth is more focused upon value add and scale for new basin entries,” Reger said. “Once we've established ourselves in a handful of basins, then I think we pivot our focus to bolt-ons and consolidating those positions. But it's a challenge to get acreage in the Delaware.

The Green River is already fairly well consolidated, so we're going to have to go to new basins, and figure out which ones those will be, where we can get good value, and then try and grow them from there.”

This summer, Jonah added a rig—its first in a couple of years—to the field in Wyoming.

The firm took the first six months of the year to evaluate whether to add a rig in the Jonah Field.

“Certainly the volatility in the market and the uncertainty there has made that decision challenging, looking at both commodity prices and well costs, particularly casing pipe. Every day the economics change pretty significantly, but we were comfortable enough to pull the trigger,” Reger said, adding that the firm expects to run the rig through the end of the year and perhaps during 2026.

Green River focus

The Tap Rock assets likely won’t be further developed near-term, but Jonah is looking at building its production in Wyoming.

“Right now, it’ll be focused on the Green River,” he said.

The Jonah Field development will consist of horizontals and verticals, he said. The plan is to drill seven wells initially through the end of the year. At that point, Jonah will evaluate whether to continue the drilling program.

Reger said the Tap Rock acquisition is well-developed, and most of the benches have been drilled, so there is less work to do in the Permian.

Both assets possess “great rock,” but the Green River asset grants access to West Coast markets for gas, “which really helps with the economics,” Reger said.

The verticals are needed to infill existing wells that are upward of 10 years old; the horizontal drilling is taking place on the edges of the field.

Jonah largely consolidated the Jonah Field itself in 2017 when the firm spent some $566 million to add Linn Energy assets to its footprint in the Green River Basin in Wyoming.

Today, the firm operates 100% of the wells in the Jonah Field, including the 500 wells Jonah has drilled, producing almost 2 Tcfe (trillion cubic feet equivalent). The company also holds a position in the Pinedale Anticline with authorization to develop another 3,500 wells in the 141,000 acres surrounding the Jonah Field.",https://www.hartenergy.com/sites/default/files/styles/max_650x650/public/image/2025/08/jonah-energy-closes-high-plains-buy-bid-become-big-player.jpg?itok=tONBRH8R,N,,2025-08-09 07:01:13.278317

During a news conference at Embaras bar and grill in Villa Grove, owner Ryan Garett said his energy costs have skyrocketed in just one month.

“You get a $3,000 bill when you're not really expecting it. It raises your costs $1,000 in a month, you can't budget for that,” Garett said. “You can't plan for that. And then, it has a trickle down effect. We're at the point where we've had to cut back on hours for some of our employees and take up those hours ourselves because we can't, you know, keep up with payroll to pay that stuff.”

State Rep. Brad Halbrook, R-Shelbyville, said while Gov. J.B. Pritzker blames the increased costs on grid operators and President Donald Trump, Democrats need reverse course.

“The very communities the governor and his allies claim to help have been abandoned under [the Clean and Equitable Jobs Act] and its predecessor to the Future Energy Jobs Act of 2016, Illinois has been shutting down affordable, reliable coal and natural gas plants, so sources that actually work and are critical to grid stability,” Halbrook said. “But why? To appease the climate alarmists who think we can power Illinois with windmills and wishful thinking.”

State Rep. Chris Miller, R-Oakland, said it’s time to ditch the “green energy scam.”

“We have over 200 billion tons of big, beautiful coal available. All we have to do is go get it,” Miller said. “It would be a tremendous driver for jobs and opportunity. This whole CEJA thing, this whole green energy scam needs to be thrown in the garbage where it belongs.”

The Illinois Clean Jobs Coalition put the blame on increased energy prices on the Trump administration's roll backs of tax incentives for “clean energy” and “Big Tech’s energy-hungry data centers.”

“As new federal policies make our power dirtier and more expensive, it is crucial that Illinois lawmakers can step up to the plate this fall and pass the Clean and Reliable Grid Affordability (CRGA) Act to protect families from utility bill spikes, preserve and grow our clean energy workforce, and maintain our national leadership on climate action,” the coalition said in a news release.

Latest tariffs raise concerns over economic activity

Trump threatens further sanctions on buyers of Russian oil

Putin and Trump to hold meeting in coming days, says Kremlin

(Reuters) – Oil prices edged higher on Friday but was poised for the steepest weekly losses since late June on a tariff-hit economic outlook and a potential meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin.

Brent crude futures were up 52 cents, or 0.78%, at $66.95 a barrel by 1104 GMT. U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude futures rose 43 cents, or 0.67%, to $64.31.

Brent was on track to be down 3.9% over the week while WTI was set to finish 4.5% lower than last Friday’s close.

Higher U.S. tariffs against a host of trade partners went into effect on Thursday, raising concern over economic activity and demand for crude oil, ANZ Bank analysts said in a note.

The latest tariffs arrive against a backdrop of an already weaker than expected U.S. labour market and Thursday’s announcement by the Kremlin that Putin and Trump would meet in the coming days as trade tensions rise between the U.S. and Russia’s oil customers.

Trump this week threatened to increase tariffs on India if it kept buying Russian oil, which the market viewed as putting further pressure on Russia to reach a deal with the U.S., said independent analyst Tina Teng.

Trump also said China, the largest buyer of Russian crude, could be hit with tariffs similar to those levied against Indian imports.

The potential meeting raises expectations of a diplomatic end to the war in Ukraine, which could lead to eased sanctions on Russia, with Russian stocks rallying after the news.

“There could be a meeting between Trump and Putin in the near future, which could indicate that Trump is adopting a wait-and-see approach with regard to further sanctions against Russia and its allies,” Commerzbank analysts said in a note.

However, some analysts remain cautious.

“The Russian leader is expected to insist on having his territorial demands granted, a hard sell for the invaded country, while his U.S. counterpart will push for a ceasefire,” said PVM analyst Tamas Varga.

“No breakthrough is anticipated, and the U.S. following through on its threat to impose secondary sanctions on those dealing in Russian energy – including China and India – remains a possibility.”

President Trump’s tax and spending megabill slashed incentives for wind and solar energy that were part of the Democrats’ 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, which is expected to significantly stifle the build-out of the growing industry.

And in recent weeks, his administration has taken further actions to hamper wind and solar power.

To catch you up:

Shortly after the bill passed, Trump directed the Treasury Department to take a strict approach in limiting which projects are eligible for the remaining tax credits.

The Interior Department also recently announced it would subject wind and solar projects to an elevated review process — a move that was expected to slow down their approvals.

Last week, Interior said it would try to block projects that take up a lot of room, which is expected to primarily hurt solar and wind projects.

The department said last week that it would weigh “whether to stop onshore wind development on some federal lands and halting future offshore wind lease sales.”

It also moved this week to try to cancel an already approved wind project in Idaho.

The Environmental Protection Agency separately announced Thursday it would move to claw back funds under a $7 billion rooftop solar program.

The Interior Department’s elevated review processes are expected to pertain not only to wind and solar farm approvals but also include a wide range of activities such as grants and assessments of endangered species impacts.

Ben Norris, vice president of regulatory affairs with the Solar Energy Industry Association, said he expects some of these reviews would not only delay projects on public lands but could have similar effects on projects on private lands.

“We are hearing about dozens, if not hundreds of projects in the aggregate that otherwise are totally sited on private lands, totally permitted by state and local authorities, but that the Interior Department seems to have found a way to put into limbo, at least for a time,” Norris told The Hill.",https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/12/Renewables_120923_Illustration_CourtneyJonesAdobeStock-copy.png?w=1280,N,,2025-08-09 08:02:51.653426

The global push and Tesla’s bind Chinese EV makers are now looking beyond domestic dominance.","In the global race for electric vehicle (EV) supremacy, China has emerged as the undisputed frontrunner. Once a follower in automotive innovation, it now poses the biggest challenge to Tesla, the industry’s original disrupter. Homegrown firms such as BYD, Xiaomi, and Li Auto have combined aggressive pricing, technological sophistication, and state support to outpace Tesla—especially in the Chinese market, the world’s largest for EVs. China’s dominance is no longer confined to the domestic sphere; it is steadily reshaping the global auto industry.

China’s EV transformation has been over two decades in the making. From early investments in research and manufacturing in the 2000s, the country has built scale and efficiency. By 2024, China accounted for nearly 40% of global EV sales, with 13 million electric and hybrid vehicles sold that year.

BYD, which began as a battery maker in 1995, has become a symbol of this shift. In the first half of 2025, it sold 2.1 million new energy vehicles (NEVs), including over a million battery electric vehicles (BEVs). In contrast, Tesla sold 720,803 BEVs during the same period. BYD’s vertical integration—from battery production to cargo shipping—enables it to keep costs low. Some of its models retail for under $10,000 in China, compared to $42,990 for Tesla’s base Model 3 in the U.S.

Similarly, Xiaomi’s SU7, launched in 2024, undercuts the Model 3 by roughly $2,500 in China, offering a larger battery and superior in-car features such as heads-up displays. These price differentials, coupled with rapid innovation, are winning over consumers.

EVs as consumer electronics

What sets Chinese EVs apart is their approach to vehicle design and user experience. While Tesla emphasises minimalist aesthetics and autonomous driving, Chinese firms treat EVs as extensions of the consumer electronics ecosystem. Features once considered luxury—augmented reality displays, in-car refrigerators, and roll-down projector screens—are becoming standard in models from Li Auto and Huawei-backed Aito.

This smartphone-like approach to car design resonates with Chinese consumers who prize entertainment and tech integration. Tesla’s functionalist design, by contrast, appears austere and culturally disconnected.

The battery edge

Battery technology—accounting for roughly 40% of an EV’s cost—is another area of Chinese strength. The Blade battery, developed by BYD, offers durability and cost-efficiency and has been adopted by Tesla and Toyota for some models. Chinese firms are also compressing vehicle development cycles to as little as 18 months, compared to the typical five years taken by foreign brands. This speed allows them to push out tech-forward models with regularity.

China’s ascendancy in EVs is the result of deliberate industrial strategy. Between 2016 and 2022, the Chinese government poured $57 billion into the sector through subsidies, tax breaks, and consumer incentives. The result has been a fiercely competitive market, with more than 100 EV models launched in 2024 alone.

Tesla’s entry into China with its Shanghai Gigafactory in 2020 was a catalyst for local players. The so-called “catfish effect”—where the presence of a strong competitor spurs incumbents to innovate—played out as Chinese firms responded with speed and agility. Now, that effect has turned on Tesla. In January 2025, Xiaomi delivered 22,000 SU7 units compared to Tesla’s 8,000 Model 3s in China. Tesla’s share of China’s NEV market has slipped from nearly 9% in 2024 to 6.5% in the first seven months of 2025.

Lessons for India

China’s EV story holds important lessons for India. Beijing’s consistent policy support—through subsidies, infrastructure investment, and targeted industrial policy—has enabled local firms to build robust supply chains and achieve scale. This policy-driven cost advantage is one that Tesla cannot easily replicate.

India, too, must adopt a long-term, strategic approach to EVs, not just as a climate solution but as an opportunity for industrial and technological leadership. The development of battery manufacturing, charging infrastructure, and local component ecosystems should be central to this strategy.

The global push and Tesla’s bind

Chinese EV makers are now looking beyond domestic dominance. BYD, Chery, and Great Wall Motor are expanding aggressively in Southeast Asia, Latin America, and Europe. BYD alone exports to over 80 countries and is investing in R&D centres, warehouses, and service hubs across continents. In Europe, Chinese EVs captured 8% of market share in 2023, up from less than 1% in 2019—despite rising tariff barriers.

Tesla, meanwhile, faces a narrowing window. With limited product diversity and higher price points, it is ill-suited for price-sensitive markets such as India and China. Its cultural fit and innovation cycle appear sluggish next to Chinese competitors. While tariffs in the US and Europe may offer temporary protection from Chinese imports, this buffer may not last.

The shift underway in the EV sector marks a deeper reordering of the global automotive value chain. China is no longer just a manufacturer of cheap goods—it is now a laboratory for next-generation mobility. The future of the EV industry is being designed and built in Shenzhen, not Silicon Valley.

For Tesla and other Western automakers, the challenge is to adapt or fall behind. For countries like India, the challenge is to learn from China’s playbook before the opportunity to build domestic champions vanishes. The EV revolution may have started in the West, but its next chapter is being authored in the East.",https://www.policycircle.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/EV10.jpg,N,,2025-08-09 08:59:41.853446

Miles O’Brien: The challenge is to find ways to divert Mississippi mud into the marshland without affecting navigation on the river.
Miles O’Brien: So why would a diversion project be controversial at all?","Geoff Bennett:

The iconic Mississippi River Delta is of enormous importance to the country, especially near the Gulf Coast. More than two million people live near that part of the Delta. It's an economic engine home to tourism, fisheries, and a shipping gateway to North America.

And it's also a key wildlife habitat. Nearly 40 percent of the coastal wetlands in the contiguous U.S. is found in the Delta in Louisiana. But it's shrinking considerably due to a number of factors, including engineering done some decades ago.

Our science correspondent, Miles O'Brien, looks at those problems and efforts to prevent further loss.

Miles O’Brien:

She and her team are studying the mud in the place they call the Bird's Foot, so named because of the way the Mississippi River spreads out into three canals at its mouth.

By the time the river wends its way here to its marshy mouth, where soil, river and sea mix in a swampy gumbo, the Mississippi is depleted of much of its famous mud.

Miles O’Brien:

The oil and gas industry is also to blame locally and globally. Sea level is rising more than three-quarters-of-an-inch a year here due to the climate crisis, and all the fossil fuel extraction that occurs in the region leads to the dredging of deep channels and the construction of pipelines.

It all hastens the sinking of the Mississippi River Delta, so-called subsidence. On average, the Delta loses about a football field of wetlands every 100 minutes.

Miles O’Brien:

The challenge is to find ways to divert Mississippi mud into the marshland without affecting navigation on the river.

Jeff Corbino, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers: The idea that the Mississippi River could be unleashed and magically nourish all these areas, it sounds very romantic. It just doesn't work that way in practice.

Miles O’Brien:

Right now, the Corps is dealing with orders to save as much of the dredge sediment as it can to nourish and sustain healthier wetlands.

Scientists on Sam Bentley's team are also hoping their data will inform efforts to design and build diversions to reroute and spread Mississippi sediment throughout the dying wetlands.

Miles O’Brien:

So why would a diversion project be controversial at all? Let's take a look at one of them to try to understand why. This is New Orleans here. Here's the Bird's Foot, and the river, which runs between the two of them.

In 2023, construction began on the $2.9 billion Mid-Barataria Sediment Diversion. The idea, when the Mississippi had enough water to spare, water would be diverted into Barataria Bay right about here to make these wetlands more healthy.

But the problem is down here is a big oyster area, and the salinity of the water for oysters is very critical. This would have a great impact on those businesses. The oyster industry led the charge of opposition. Governor Jeff Landry withdrew state support, and the project is now dead.",https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/static/2025/08/DisappearingDelta-1024x576.jpg,N,,2025-08-09 08:03:15.168716

The report found climate change information has also been altered or removed from federal websites, though less consistently than environmental justice and DEI sites.
But the EPA's primary climate change website remains intact, with links to scientific information and advice for what individuals can do about climate change.","The current Trump administration has made 70% more changes to government environmental websites during its first 100 days than the first Trump administration did, and those changes are bolder, according to a report published by the Environmental Data and Governance Initiative (EDGI).

EDGI is a nonprofit network of researchers who work with data, started after President Donald Trump took office in 2017. It documents loss of access and usability of government environmental information and preserves that information for public use.

The group found that in the first 100 days of the first Trump administration, there were 371 important changes made to websites, while in the same period this year there were 632 changes. EDGI defined an important change as significantly altering the content, focus or links on a page.

The increase was observed even though EDGI started the second Trump term with fewer volunteers and was monitoring fewer pages — 4,429 this year versus more than 25,000 in 2017. In preparing the report, EDGI says members of its network monitored government web pages. Then they made publicly available the information they preserved and the criteria they used to monitor those federal web sites.

""I am surprised by the extent of the removal of information about environmental justice,"" says Gretchen Gehrke, co-founder of EDGI. ""That level of total erasure we didn't see with any topic under the first-term administration.""

The EDGI report shows the administration's biggest targets included diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) efforts and environmental justice — the idea that everyone, regardless of their background, has the right to a healthy environment and to participate in environmental decisions. Trump signed an executive order on January 20 eliminating programs, offices and positions related to both issues. That was after former President Biden made environmental justice a central goal for his administration.

""Under President Trump's leadership, agencies are refocusing on their core missions and shifting away from ideological activism,"" Taylor Rogers, White House assistant press secretary, wrote in an email to NPR.

The EDGI report says that the effort to take down websites began the day after Trump took office in January. The Council on Environmental Quality's Climate and Economic Justice Screening Tool was removed, along with nine similar screening tools at other agencies within the next month. Those tools identified disadvantaged communities in order to fulfill a Biden administration goal of ensuring that 40% of climate program benefits went to them.

The report found climate change information has also been altered or removed from federal websites, though less consistently than environmental justice and DEI sites. The federal climate change research website globalchange.gov was shut down. But the EPA's primary climate change website remains intact, with links to scientific information and advice for what individuals can do about climate change.

A widely used National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) site, climate.gov, stopped publishing new content this summer, after the staff of 10 people who contributed to it was terminated. The site published information about changing weather patterns, drought conditions and greenhouse gas emissions and had received nearly one million visitors every month.

Gehrke says there's little oversight governing how an administration manages government websites.

""We really need to protect our information better,"" they say. ""Websites are the primary means by which the government communicates with the public."" And Gehrke says good information is essential for the public to participate in a democracy.

Over a dozen states are taking steps to address the issue, such as studying the impact on electricity bills or pushing data center owners to pay more for transmission costs.

States are under mounting pressure to shield household and business ratepayers from escalating electric bills, fueled by the energy-intensive operations of Big Tech data centers. Over a dozen states are taking proactive measures to address the issue, such as analyzing the impact on electricity costs and advocating for data center owners to shoulder more of the transmission cost burden.

PJM Interconnection, the largest U.S. electric grid operator, has seen a significant surge in energy auction prices, which are projected to increase residential retail rates by 30% to 60% by 2030 [1]. The rising costs are primarily driven by the growing demand from data centers, which now account for over 90% of new power demand in the region [2].

In response, several states are exploring solutions. For instance, Indiana Michigan Power (I&M) has partnered with Google to implement a demand response program, allowing Google to shift electricity demand during peak times [3]. This initiative aims to reduce peak load and support sustainability and affordability of electric service.

Meanwhile, Microsoft is expanding its Mount Pleasant data center campus, investing $3.3 billion in the project [4]. The first phase is expected to be operational by early 2026, further adding to the demand on the power grid.

Some officials argue that the rising costs are due to the need to replace aging equipment and harden it against extreme weather conditions. However, consumer advocates contend that residential customers are subsidizing the AI ambitions of wealthy corporations, with utilities like AEP and Dominion increasing their capital expenditure plans to meet new data center demand [1].

The challenge is clear: balancing the need for economic growth with the sustainability of energy consumption. As data centers continue to expand, states must navigate a delicate balance between supporting technological innovation and protecting ratepayers from escalating costs.

Here Comes the Sun: A Last Chance for the Climate and a Fresh Chance for Civilization

Sometime in the early part of the 2020s we crossed an invisible line where the cost of producing energy from the sun dropped below the cost of fossil fuel. That’s not yet common knowledge—­we still think of photovoltaic panels and wind turbines as “alternative energy,” as if they were the Whole Foods of power, nice but pricey. In fact—­and more so with each passing month—­they are the Costco of energy, inexpensive and available in bulk. We live on an earth where the cheapest way to produce power is to point a sheet of glass at the sun; the second-­cheapest is to let the breeze created by the sun’s heating turn the blade of a wind turbine. Beginning about the middle of 2023, we entered the really steep part of this growth curve that could redefine our future, crossing another invisible line, this one marking the installation of a gigawatt’s worth of solar panels on this planet every day. (A gigawatt is about the output of a typical coal-­fired power plant or nuclear reactor.) By the fall of 2024 that gigawatt was going up every 18 hours. We’re still in the early days of this transformation—­right now only about 15 percent of the planet’s electricity comes from sun and wind, and only about a quarter of the energy we use comes from electricity. But exponential growth changes numbers like that very fast—­in 2024, 92.5 percent of all new electricity bought online around the world came from renewables; in the US the figure was 96 percent. By April 2025, fossil fuel was producing less than half of American electricity, for the first time ever. There’s no longer a technical or financial obstacle in the way; we already have the factory capacity, mostly in China, to produce as many solar panels as the climate scientists say we need. In May 2025 came the news that China had used 5 percent less coal in the first quarter of the year to produce electricity than it had in 2024—­despite a surging economy, Chinese emissions were actually dropping.

The suddenness of this moment is startling. The solar cell was invented in 1954, and it took from then until 2022 to install the first terawatt worth of solar power on this planet. It took two years to get the second; the third will be quicker still. It’s all brand new.

But there are a few places that are running far ahead, showing what’s possible. China is well on its way to being the earth’s first “electro-­state”; something like half of all clean energy has been installed within its borders. And 2024 was a breakout year in California: there were finally enough solar panels that for parts of most days the state could produce from renewable sources more than 100 percent of the electricity it used; at night great batteries that had spent the afternoon soaking up sunshine often became the biggest source of supply to the electric grid of the world’s fifth-­largest economy. As a result, in 2024 California used 25 percent less natural gas to produce its power than it had in 2023, which is a big number. Through mid-­April of 2025, as more panels and batteries came online, the numbers got even better: California was using 44 percent less natural gas to make electricity than it had just two years earlier. On the other side of the world, in Pakistan, a flood of cheap solar panels from China let homeowners and storekeepers and factory managers build the equivalent of a third of the country’s electric grid inside of a year. Peasant farmers, often just laying the panels on the ground, started pumping their irrigation water with electricity instead of generators powered with fossil fuels; diesel sales dropped 30 percent in the course of a year.

Those kind of shifts, replicated quickly in many more places, could take a real bite out of the grim predictions of climate scientists; the sun burns so we don’t need to. We are in a desperate race; those scientists have told us that to stay on anything like a survivable path we must cut greenhouse gas emissions in half before the decade is out. That target is on the bleeding edge of the technically possible, and this book is an effort to shove us toward that deadline.

Can The Rise In Solar Power Balance Out Clean Energy Cuts?

But I hope that this book is timeless as well—­that it’s anticipating a shift that will play out over many lifetimes, and in ways that diverge dramatically from our recent history. That’s because energy from the sun is not just cheap. It’s also diffuse, available everywhere instead of concentrated in a few places. And that prefigures a different world with a more localized and more humane geopolitics; indeed, the sun works more reliably toward the equator, which could allow the redress of some of earth’s great inequities. In February 2025 the energy analysts at the Rocky Mountain Institute reported that renewable energy was growing twice as fast in the developing world of the Global South as in the developed world of the Global North. Relying on energy sources that are abundant instead of scarce—­the sun and the wind each day produce thousands of times as much energy as we could ever use—­could even reconfigure our ideas of competition and conquest. Unlike oil and gas, sun and wind can’t be hoarded. If fascism scares you the way it does me, figuring out how to break the centralized power of the fossil fuel industry is a key form of resistance.

And for a species that has become almost fatally disconnected from the natural world, the sun offers a way back into a relationship with reality. We were all sun worshippers once; it’s not perhaps too much to imagine that we might someday soon gaze up a little more often, maybe even breaking a little of the enchantment woven by the glowing lights in our palms. This is not, I think, a “technofix,” but something far more fundamental. We have the chance to join in a great global project, providing affordable energy to every human community even as we stave off our greatest threat. It could prove a unifying mission for a divided world. The last remotely comparable project was the moon shot of the 1960s, but that involved one nation putting two men on an orbiting rock. This quest involves bringing our star down to earth to make that earth work—­what could be more quintessentially human?

All this hope risks sounding giddy; let my dark realism reassert itself for a moment and offer up some caveats and cautions. I’m not overly concerned about the things people usually point to. As I’ll make clear, we’re not going to run short of minerals to build batteries or land to put panels on. Instead, my worries stem from hard realities both physical and political.

First, this definitely comes too late to “stop global warming.” We’ve already done fundamental damage to the planet’s physical systems, to the point of altering the jet stream and weakening the Gulf Stream; we’ve already raced past the 1.5 degree Celsius rise in global temperature that we pledged in Paris to avoid. (In April 2025, the Trump administration fired most of the American scientists who monitor this increase, perhaps reasoning that what we don’t know can’t hurt us.)

Our best hope now is simply to stop the heating of the earth short of the point where it cuts civilization off at the knees, and even that will be a very close call. I will return to the question of pace over and over in these pages, because it’s what matters most. I have little doubt we will run the world on sun and wind 40 years from now, but if it takes us anything like 40 years to get there then it will be a broken planet; our energy sources will hardly matter. The march of history won’t get us where we need to go fast enough; we need to force that march.

Second, there’s no guarantee that the momentum of the last few years will continue. The fossil fuel industry has read the numbers too, and so they’ve girded for the fight. As the chairman of one big oil company said in the fall of 2024, the industry thinks we should keep burning gas and oil until “every last molecule” had been sucked from the earth. If you think that capitalism guarantees we’ll pick the lowest-­priced option, think again: In certain ways, solar and wind power are almost too cheap for our economy. Investors who have gotten rich controlling the hoarded “reserves” of fossil fuel are scared of the fact that the sun delivers energy for free each time it rises above the horizon, and in their fear they’re massively gaming our political system. The worldwide elections of 2024 saw setback after setback, with oil-­soaked populists winning control in too many places. Just as they played the game of climate denial with real success for three decades, they now engage in a kind of solutions denial, claiming we’re not ready for clean energy, or offering up substitutes closer to the status quo. Some of these substitutes (geothermal power and nuclear energy, if the cost ever comes down) may offer useful side dishes to the main course of sun, wind, and batteries; others (carbon capture from power plants, biofuels) are just expensive efforts to extend the business model of this industry a little longer. All of the substitutes are effective at distracting us, especially in the distorted infosphere of greenwash and spin we inhabit.

Nowhere, of course, is that distortion more powerful than the United States, where Trump rode back into office vowing to “drill, baby, drill” and to crash the electric vehicle (EV) industry. He’d been in office four hours when he signed an order ending all federal support for wind power. (As for solar energy, the week before the election he said, “It’s all steel and glass and wires. It looks like hell. And you see rabbits get caught in it.”) By April, just three months into his second term, Trump was announcing plans to revive the coal industry, and his bizarre tariffs were making life harder for renewable energy developers; he cut off funding to Princeton’s climate modelers on the grounds that their findings were causing “climate anxiety.” All of which is to offer a third caution: Just because the world goes in one direction, that doesn’t mean every nation will follow. Yes, there’s enormous momentum behind this transformation; on the last day of February 2025 the federal Energy Information Administration predicted that 93 percent of American electric generation built in Trump’s first year would be carbon-­free, mostly from solar. In the first month of 2025, as Trump was taking office, sun and wind combined made up 98 percent of new generating capacity in the States. But clearly the Trump/Musk team will try to break that momentum; already-­high tariffs on Chinese solar panels are being increased again even as I finish this manuscript, and the administration is embarked on a sprawling effort to achieve “energy dominance” based on oil and gas. It’s an effort to stuff the solar genie back in the barrel, and we don’t know yet to what degree it will succeed. The Biden administration, with the Inflation Reduction Act, set in motion transformative spending on clean energy technology, and spread the money carefully around the red states; Texas, home base of the hydrocarbon industry, is now outpacing even California in clean energy (though the state legislature, as of spring 2025, was engaged in an all-out effort to sabotage that growth). Power from the sun can appeal to conservatives (“my home is my well-­wired castle”) as powerfully as it does to liberals. But the addiction to fossil fuels and all its accomplices (the giant SUV, say) runs deeper here than anyplace else; it will be a fight to turn the American page.

I’m ready for that fight. Even as I write these pages, I’m helping organize what we’re calling Sun Day, set for the autumnal equinox in September 2025. Indeed, some of the proceeds from this book are supporting that organizing process, because its goal is the same: to help people understand the possibility of our moment. As we shall see, much of the progress that engineers have made has come on the back of inspired activism, something we need more of. In this fight, the solar panel and the wind turbine are both the crucial machines and also the symbols of potential liberation.

And in true Hollywood fashion, our liberation and our destruction are arriving at precisely the same time, offering us a remarkable choice. Everything is going wrong, except this one big thing. Our species, at what feels like a very dark moment, can take a giant leap into the light.

“The US Clean Air Act allows California, based on public health criteria, to go beyond what the US EPA [Environmental Protection Agency] may require.
“The governor can ask for a declaration from the president in an emergency,” DeSaulnier added.
The courts have always upheld it, so when California goes beyond the federal standards [for air quality] other states can join California.
California has never failed to be able to defend that” because the state carefully monitors emissions and air quality.","I recently spoke with U.S. Representative Mark DeSaulnier (D–CA), a former Republican turned Democrat representing California’s 10th congressional district just east of San Francisco Bay, about the climate emergency and the need to push beyond partisan acrimony to restore healthy oceans with innovative solutions.

DeSaulnier began by summarizing his background in working on climate. “In 1994 I was a Republican and was appointed by Pete Wilson, a Republican governor of California, to the California Air Resources Board — CARB,” he explained. “I spent a decade on CARB [serving] three governors, Wilson, Gray Davis (D), and Arnold ScImahwarzenegger (R). So, when I got elected to the legislature, I had a reputation [for] being knowledgeable about air quality.”

DeSaulnier went on to serve as chairman of CARB at the request of governors Davis and Schwarzenegger, and met with the current chair and executive director last spring. “We talked about how we can protect the California waiver from the Trump administration and…continue to do all the wonderful things we’re doing,” he said. “The US Clean Air Act allows California, based on public health criteria, to go beyond what the US EPA [Environmental Protection Agency] may require. And that’s the California waiver.”

The area DeSaulnier represents — San Francisco’s East Bay — houses five of the 13 refineries still active in the state of California, producing roughly 25% of the CARB-certified fuel and 50% of the diesel fuel in the state. In addition to the Bay Area, Long Beach, Los Angeles, and Puget Sound have the highest concentration of refineries. “The crude comes from the North Slope of Alaska and from the Pacific Rim, and… goes out to the rest of the country,” DeSaulnier explains. “So what I was actually talking to the CARB staff about was their modeling. At CARB we always said we’re agnostic about how we get to the totals –- we just need the emissions reduction. So we need to measure the emissions and model them accurately. Carbon being more ubiquitous is harder than traditional pollutants, but what we were talking about… was how [to] create a model between the workforce and the targets we have to meet, and then be agnostic.”

Congressman Mark DeSaulnier

When asked for his thoughts on ocean restoration strategies that hold great potential for both removing excess carbon from the atmosphere and boosting fisheries, DeSaulnier said, “if we discover that carbon capture naturally works, then [we should] do the analysis and, as you say, get the capture.”

Turning Around the Titanic

“We’ve got generations of work to do to transition our energy sources on this planet away from fossil fuel and greenhouse gas-emitting to more efficient renewables,” DeSaulnier pointed out. He also underscored the magnitude of figuring out how to transition an economy the size of California’s, which is the largest in the US and the fifth largest in the world, to solely rely on renewables.

The congressman agreed that “if you just shut [down] all these refineries and the fossil fuel industry today, yes, you would still have these other challenges,” including the lethal one trillion tons of extra CO2 humans have put into the atmosphere, which are estimated to take a thousand years to go away without any intervention. But he raised the question of how to model the risks and benefits to ensure that California is “protecting the environment long-term and not creating other [harmful] consequences” in the process.

I pointed out that the best model I have seen is the extremely safe 100 Villages action plan, which envisions one hundred fishing villages (or cities) around the world sending boats out to their ocean ecosystems and replacing the tiny amounts of missing nutrients that plankton need in order to flourish. Restoring plankton — the ocean’s equivalent to Amazon rain forests — is key to removing CO2 from the atmosphere and reducing ocean acidification, and has the potential to bring California’s fisheries back from disaster to a position of world leadership. The cost is low and could possibly be funded by blue carbon credits.

A Bipartisan Opportunity

I asked DeSaulnier whether he thought it would be possible to find common ground in Congress around legislation similar to the bill (HR 7797) sponsored by Representative Buddy Carter (R–GA) the last session, which proposed establishing a pilot program on ocean restoration research and development.

Carter complained that he was unable to find a Democratic cosponsor, saying that there were at least five who really liked the idea and were quite ready to back it, but were told by leadership not to for partisan reasons.

“I’m surprised to hear about Democratic members not wanting to partner because I haven’t experienced that,” DeSaulnier said. “I’m thinking of a very good friend of mine I’ve known for a long time, Jared Huffman. He’s a ranking Democrat on the Resource Committee [who] represents [the state] from the Golden Gate Bridge to the Oregon border, the California coastline. And he’s a former NRDC [Natural Resources Defense Council] attorney who specialized in oceans and water, so he would have the seniority, jurisdiction, and the background, right? The natural person.” DeSaulnier promised to talk to him about Carter’s bill, saying he “would be very surprised” if his friend isn’t interested in signing on, adding that the way “you get bipartisanship is just [by building] relationships and working with people.”

Declare an Ocean and Fisheries Emergency

As I reminded the congressman that the flag of LA County has a tuna on it because California was the tuna capital of the world as recently as 1950, I mentioned a new tactic to try to get bipartisan progress that is championed by the president of OPR ALASKA, Russ George: Declare an ocean and fisheries emergency based on the collapse of California’s fisheries. By focusing on the fact that the acidification of the oceans due to rising levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide is a leading cause of the demise of fish, Congress could generate the resources needed to fund an action plan for ocean restoration to bring fish back while removing significant amounts of ruinous CO2.

“I’d have to look into it,” DeSaulnier said. “I am the ranking Democrat on the ethics committee, and we have rules about how we handle state and local policy. It’s not like we can’t do this, but we have to comply with the political side as well as the taxpayer-funded part of it. And my recollection of FEMA [the Federal Emergency Management Agency] laws is the governor [needs to ask] the president to declare [an emergency]. And I’m not sure [if] Congress would go around that, other than legislatively confirming it budgetarily.

“The governor can ask for a declaration from the president in an emergency,” DeSaulnier added. “But this president is unhinged when it comes to fossil fuels, climate change, and science.”

I noted that in this case there is a great advantage to focusing on the economic reality for the fishing industry instead of mentioning climate so that the president and other climate deniers might consider it.

“That is possible,” DeSaulnier replied. “What I always try to do on the climate change issue is refer to an existing model and say something like, ‘the Chinese are approving this as a better economic model.’ And in your case of letting nature heal itself, of allowing that to happen, this is the most efficient from a business model standpoint, not to mention all the other benefits.”

DeSaulnier also mused about a potential legal path. “[Another option] is the California waiver I mentioned earlier, which has never been denied since Richard Nixon signed the [Clean Air Act in 1970]. This allows many good actions but this president wants to ignore it. The courts have always upheld it, so when California goes beyond the federal standards [for air quality] other states can join California. In the Clean Air Act, there is an allowance for public rights of action, which are lawsuits. So, if you have standing, California can sue. California can say, well, you didn’t provide the needed requirement under the US Clean Air Act. California has never failed to be able to defend that” because the state carefully monitors emissions and air quality.

“If you were to use the current statute, California and the California Air Resources Board and the State Water Quality Board, in this case, would have to have their staff develop findings saying if you do this, the planet and the ocean will produce these levels of emission reductions over this period of time. So that’s why other states are allowed under the Clean Air Act to do what California does beyond what the US EPA does, and they’re not preempted, they’re actually defended under federal law.”

Since our interview, Republicans in Congress managed to use a controversial tactic to revoke California’s waiver, which Governor Gavin Newsom (D) has challenged in court. DeSaulnier has denounced the revocation as “blatantly illegal.”

The aggressive move highlights the critical need to transcend the partisan divide, for example by tackling the crisis in our oceans and fisheries by declaring an Ocean Emergency.

DeSaulnier wrapped up our interview with a sincere expression of wanting to absorb more information about ocean restoration. It was an inspiration to interview an elected leader who can think on his feet, adapt to updated scientific findings, and contribute such positive guidance on bridging the political divides on the most existential issue of our time.",https://www.exposedbycmd.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/DeSaulnier-Climate-Action.jpeg,N,,2025-08-09 07:01:00.670545

Last month, both chambers of the U.S. Congress passed the so-called 'Big and Beautiful' bill, which was strongly promoted by President Trump. The bill stipulates that the U.S. government will no longer provide tax credits for electric vehicles starting September 30 of this year.

According to data from Cox Automotive, U.S. consumers purchased nearly 130,100 new EVs in July, the second-highest on record, just behind the approximately 136,000 units sold in December last year.

In today’s feature report, we will listen to Part 3 with WFHB Environmental Correspondent Max Jancich as he speaks with Greg Olsen, Field Projects Director at the Sand County Foundation. Olsen discussed prairie strips, a conservation practice that integrates prairie ecosystems into 10-20 percent of farmland to improve water quality and soil health.

And now for your environmental reports:

The Corporation for Public Broadcasting announced last Friday that it will begin shutting down, weeks after Congress canceled previously approved funding for the nation’s steward of public media access.

The cost of hurricanes, floods, and fires is increasing every year. In year 2000, FEMA spent $3.6 billion; adjusting for inflation, that’s $7 billion in today’s money. This year, FEMA budgeted $36 billion. Thus, the vast difference reflects a much greater cost of disasters nowadays. There’s no mystery as to why this has occurred – we are increasing our fossil fuel consumption. The President is also gutting pollution regulations and agencies protecting the environment. He’s firing expert scientists and replacing them with youngsters with little or no science background.

The E.P.A. said this week it would revoke its own ability to fight climate change. It’s the latest move in an extraordinary pivot away from science-based protections.

Earth’s Wetlands are disappearing and global efforts to save them are unraveling. More than 170 countries have gathered to save critical ecosystems. But the U.S. was a no-show for most of the summit and Russia said it will withdraw from the wetlands treaty.

Sweden, an early climate leader, is retreating from its environmental commitments, part of an EU trend. As the U.S. abandons international climate agreements, the EU is hesitating to lead. A once-admired Nordic nation’s backtracking on its climate goals offers clues as to why.

The Bureau of Land Management calls new Oil and Gas Rules ‘noncontroversial,’ exempts them from public comment. Environmentalists say the lack of public comment shows the administration’s disregard for maintaining public lands.

The potato is eaten throughout the globe, but the plant’s origins have remained obsure. Now scientists can, and the answer is: tomatoes. According to a study published last week, potatoes may have arisen nine million years ago through the combining of genetic material from Etuberosum, a group of potato-like plants from South America, and wild tomato plants. According to the study, this hybridization event led to the origin of the potato plant’s distinctive feature, the tuber, an underground structure that stores nutrients and, as humans eventually discovered, is edible.

Candidate Trump Promised Oil Executives a Windfall. Now, They’re Getting It. New tallies of the administration’s tax breaks and other incentives add up to tens of billions of dollars of benefits to the fossil fuel industry.

Joining Growth Energy in celebration of the August 8th birthday are leaders from across the heartland, who have helped to make the RFS America's single most successful policy for increasing U.S. energy security, holding down fuel costs, reducing emissions, and strengthening the farm economy.

Since the RFS became law in August 2005, American biorefineries have produced more than 250 billion gallons of ethanol. In that same time period, American ethanol plants have purchased 92.7 billion bushels of corn, driving more than $425 billion of revenue to American farmers. As a result of these benefits, the program is supported by a broad, bipartisan spectrum of stakeholders.

Growth Energy

""The RFS is the foundation of America's bioeconomy,"" said Growth Energy CEO Emily Skor. ""It supports hundreds of thousands of rural jobs and has shielded an entire generation of drivers from volatility in global oil markets. More than 10 percent of U.S. fuel supplies now come from renewable sources like ethanol, representing billions of gallons in savings. And it's still fueling growth. As part of a drive toward U.S. energy dominance, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency recently proposed to set biofuel blending at the highest volume in the history of the program. Those numbers aren't yet final, and the EPA still needs to address petitions from refiners seeking to skirt the RFS, but if we remain on a growth trajectory, the benefits to American motorists and farmers are overwhelming.""

Farmers

""The RFS is more than a law. It's a vital outlet for surplus grains that provides stability and prosperity to American farmers facing higher input costs and uncertain export markets,"" said Bill Couser, a farmer from Iowa who grows commercial corn that he sells to local plants to be processed into fuel ethanol. ""I don't know that our family's farm would be as strong as it is today if it weren't for the RFS and the American biofuels industry.""

""Since the RFS was enacted, America's net farm income has more than doubled. In Iowa alone, biofuel plants purchase more than half the state's corn crop — transforming it into homegrown fuels, high-quality animal feed, food-grade CO2, and a host of other co-products,"" said Kelly Nieuwenhuis, a third-generation corn and soybean farmer based in northwest Iowa. ""It's an integral part of the agricultural supply chain.""

Lawmakers

""For two decades, the Renewable Fuel Standard program has helped us produce fuel that reduces our emissions and fosters energy independence—and I'm proud to help continue leading the push in the Senate to increase the use and supply of American-grown, American-made biofuels across the country,"" said Sen. Tammy Duckworth (D-Ill.). ""We're pushing hard for our bipartisan bill to enable the year-round sale of E15 nationwide, and as founding co-chair of the Sustainable Aviation Caucus in the Senate, I'm working to bolster and help expand our nation's sustainable aviation fuel industry. Investing in American biofuels doesn't just help us reduce our nation's carbon footprint—it helps lower gas prices for middle-class families and support our farmers. It's a win-win-win that would not be possible without the RFS.""

""Over the last 20 years, the Renewable Fuel Standard has been essential to empowering heartland communities, adding value to crops grown by our hardworking farmers, securing American energy independence, and giving consumers a cleaner, cheaper choice at the pump,"" said Sen. Joni Ernst (R-Iowa). ""Iowa farmers already feed our nation, and by guaranteeing homegrown Iowa biofuels are blended into our nation's fuel supply, the RFS secures their role in fueling our nation's future. I look forward to continuing my work with the Trump Administration to ensure the RFS stays strong, so we can keep delivering for Iowa's famers, biofuel producers, and rural communities.""

""Nebraska is the nation's second-largest producer of ethanol, and much of that is made possible by the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS), established 20 years ago,"" said Sen. Deb Fischer (R-Neb.). ""The RFS has played a critical role in supporting Nebraska's ag economy, driving both the use and production of renewable fuels across the state. I look forward to continuing to work with the EPA to ensure a strong RFS that will further advance Nebraska's biofuels industry.""

""The Renewable Fuel Standard is one of the federal government's most successful clean fuels policies,"" said Senator Pete Ricketts (R-Neb.). ""For two decades, renewable fuels like ethanol and biodiesel have saved consumers money, supported Nebraska agriculture, cleaned our environment, and unleashed American energy.""

""For 20 years, the Renewable Fuel Standard has created incredible new opportunities for our farmers. I've seen firsthand the important markets it creates for our corn and soybean growers, and the cost savings it brings for folks at the pump,"" said Rep. Nikki Budzinski (D-Ill.). ""As we celebrate this important anniversary, I remain committed to championing renewable fuels every single day and pushing for policies like nationwide, year-round E15.""

""A strong Renewable Fuel Standard is vital to a vibrant agricultural economy and the success of Iowa biofuels,"" said Rep. Randy Feenstra (R-Iowa). ""For twenty years, this American energy initiative has supported Iowa farmers, biofuels producers, and our rural communities by ensuring that Iowa ethanol, biodiesel, and other advanced biofuels are blended into our nation's fuel supply. The RFS also helps reduce our dependence on foreign oil, lowers gas prices for families, and incentivizes rural energy production. Representing hardworking farmers and biofuels producers, I will always advocate for a strong Renewable Fuel Standard that invests in rural Iowa, supports the production of homegrown Iowa biofuels, and stands with our farmers and agricultural communities.""

""For two decades, the Renewable Fuel Standard has provided long-term market certainty and predictability for American biofuels producers, fuel retailers, farmers, and other market participants,"" said Rep. Ashley Hinson (R-Iowa). ""It's incredible to see how far we've come in blending more homegrown biofuels into our nation's fuel supply—and how the RFS supports Iowa farmers and rural communities. Biofuels play a crucial role in our energy strategy to bolster energy independence and lower costs for consumers. I look forward to continuing my work with the Trump Administration and my colleagues in Congress to expand the use of biofuels as part of an all-of-the-above and all-of-the-below energy strategy.""

""I'm proud to support access to new markets for our nation's farmers that strengthens our domestic energy resources,"" said Rep. Max Miller (R-Ohio). ""Investing in American biofuels strengthens our energy supply, creates good-paying jobs, and drives economic growth in communities that feed and fuel our nation. By advancing biofuel innovation we're building a more secure, independent, and prosperous future for the American people. As we mark 20 years of the Renewable Fuel Standard, we recognize one of the most impactful commitments our nation has made to energy security and rural prosperity.""

""For 20 years, the Renewable Fuel Standard has been a cornerstone of our nation's energy policy—strengthening rural economies, reducing our dependence on foreign oil, and creating new markets for our family farmers,"" said Rep. Eric Sorensen (D-Ill.). ""In Illinois and across the Midwest, biofuels mean good-paying jobs, cleaner air, and opportunity. As we look ahead, we must ensure the RFS translates to affordable low-carbon options for consumers while supporting industry growth domestically. I'll continue fighting to make sure biofuels remain a key part of America's energy future.""

New Jersey residents are struggling to afford their energy bills.
In other words, those companies could sell customers gas power, as they purchase credits from wind, solar and nuclear plants outside of New Jersey.","The stakes are high.

The losses have been mounting.

And the odds of success are as long as they’ve ever been.

Still, according to a Politico report this past week, the Murphy administration and some Democratic lawmakers are doubling down on the governor’s goal of having New Jersey generate all its electric power from zero-carbon sources by 2035.

That push would come in the form of an updated bill during the year-end, lame duck legislative session.

By codifying the main thrust of Murphy administration’s Energy Master Plan into law, New Jersey ratepayers – who are already looking at 20% energy hikes this summer – can expect higher energy bills and less energy reliability going forward, said NJBIA Deputy Chief Government Affairs Officer Ray Cantor.

“The Legislature needs to understand that this is only going to worsen our affordability and reliability issues,” Cantor said.

“As we said when the Energy Master Plan was introduced six years ago, you cannot put ideology ahead of practicality as part of an energy transition. The rate increases and sticker shock in our electric bills resulting from New Jersey going from a net exporter of energy to a net importer of energy is something we and others predicted six years ago.

“We continue to stress: New Jersey still very much needs an all-of-the-above approach if its energy transition is to work. And, yes, that includes clean natural gas, which currently accounts for nearly half of our total electricity generation and 72% of our home heating fuel.”

“Put simply, it's imperative to bridge that disconnect between aspiration and reality,” Cantor said.

UNSPOKEN CHILL FROM THE BILL

While an updated bill to 2023 legislation codifying the state gets its power from only zero-carbon sources has not been posted, Cantor said it’s possible that it will have language suggesting affordability protections.

Cantor, however, said he’s concerned that language will only be used to assuage the many New Jersey residents who are struggling to afford their energy bills.

“We don’t need window dressing, and we don’t need optics,” Cantor said. “What we need is more energy, not less.

“If this bill becomes law, we will have less energy. We will continue to see that supply and demand imbalance that we all forecasted long ago and is now happening. New Jersey residents are struggling to afford their energy bills. That will get worse by eliminating natural gas as a source of power prematurely.”

The 2023 bill did allow gas-powered energy companies to match renewable energy credits with each unit of electricity they sell. In other words, those companies could sell customers gas power, as they purchase credits from wind, solar and nuclear plants outside of New Jersey.

But Cantor said, beyond the concern of relying on other states for energy credits, such a provision only adds uncertainty and less investment from energy companies.

“You could have a power generator who may want to come here or expand here, but they need regulatory certainty in order to do that,” Cantor said. “This legislation, in any form, will disincentivize such investment at a time when we still very much need natural gas power.”

BLAME GAME

In a gubernatorial election year where high energy costs have become a prime issue, PJM Connection, the grid operator for New Jersey and 13 other states and the District of Columbia, has come under criticism by Gov. Phil Murphy and other Democrats for the way basic generation service costs are structured, as well as auction rules that exclude generation capacity from being sold.

Republicans, conversely, have placed the blame squarely on the “failed energy policies” of the Murphy administration, which saw a great emphasis on offshore wind that never materialized.

Cantor said the easiest way to observe where the true reason for blame resides in warnings issued by nonpartisan groups like NJBIA when the Energy Master Plan was announced in 2019.

“Those criticisms of PJM are not without some merit,” Cantor said. “You can also look at the speed of which interconnection approvals are made by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commissions as a contributing factor.

“But they are not the major thrust beyond the bill increases we are seeing this summer. New Jersey right now is a state that doesn’t produce enough energy to keep our own lights on, and we have advanced policies to eliminate sources that provide much of our electricity.”

“As we’ve said before, that’s not a winning combination when it comes to the balance of supply and demand. If the EMP is codified into law at the end of the year, we have grave concerns it will only get worse because there are no realistic plans in place to increase our in-state generation, while we all know our demand will continue to increase.”",https://njbia.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/doubledownWebsite.jpg,N,,2025-08-09 03:58:03.880818

I worked in Washington, D.C. for the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and an environmental law firm representing clients on environmental matters. In North Carolina I worked with Nortel and the State of North Carolina’s Department of Environmental Quality.

Initially, I wanted the neighborhood to be off the grid but I came to learn that in North Carolina, a single house can be, but neighborhoods cannot. So, the next best thing was having (all the homes in) the neighborhood be net-zero.

PB: How far along is the development?

JB: The infrastructure is complete and all of the lots are sold. Three of the twelve houses are complete and occupied. Five more houses will be done by early next year, and a sixth one later in 2026. The rest of the lots will have homes in the next few years.

PB: What does it mean to be truly net-zero, and what steps can builders take to achieve this goal?

JB: All of the houses in Array will be built to or exceed the standards set out in the covenants for the neighborhood. The houses will, at a minimum, produce as much energy as they need to operate. This is what it means to be net-zero. I am incredibly proud of the results of the first three homes.

It is not difficult to be, at a minimum, net-zero ready. In Array, the additional costs to meet the standards without an on-site renewable energy source that get you to a home energy rating score (HERS) in the 50s (on a 0-100 scale] is just 2% of the overall building cost. Developers and builders can and should be building net-zero ready houses with a HERS score at least in the 50s.

To get to net-zero, add solar to produce all the energy the home needs to operate. The more energy-efficient the house, the smaller the solar array needs to be.

PB: For those who can’t achieve net-zero, what are some simple steps housing pros can take to reduce their impact?

JB: The simplest thing to do if you are building a home is orient it for passive heating and cooling. Then, use at least R-19 insulation in the walls and insulate so there are no air leakages, install energy-efficient doors and windows, Energy Star-certified appliances and, at a minimum, an 18-SEER, high-efficiency heat pump.

Things vary by climate zone, so it is important to pay attention to what’s best for your location. For example, in North Carolina, because the climate is moderate, triple-pane (window) glass is not necessary, but in colder climates it is something worth considering.

If you are retrofitting a home, the very best thing is to conduct a blower door test to find all of the air leakages in the house and tighten them up. Add insulation in the attic. Seal the crawl space and provoide conditioned air. And when it’s time to replace appliances, purchase Energy Star-certified products, high-efficiency heat pumps, and a high-efficiency heat pump water heater.

PB: What’s the current demand for energy efficient housing?

JB: There is a significant demand for energy efficient houses including net-zero ready and net-zero. The more that are built, the more people will come. Over the years, I have had hundreds of people come to Array, but no development or location is right for everyone. Many people ask me if I’m doing another development like Array in another part of town.

For some reason, builders resist building this way. The more energy-efficient houses in our market have HERS in the 60s. That’s much better than a code-built home at HERS 100, but they can do better.

PB: What’s been the biggest hurdle to getting this project off the ground?

JB: The biggest hurdle was the funding. I am a Realtor, not a developer. I thought the original land owner would be the developer and I would be the project manager. Once my client purchased the land, he told me he didn’t want to be the developer, but would let me develop it and pay him back later. I searched high and low for partners to develop the land with, but I turned up absolutely no one.

So, I had to make the decision to go this alone and decide how I was going to structure it. Once I wrote the first payment to the civil engineer, I had made the step to be a developer. After five years of hard work and absolute grit, I pulled it off with zero debt.

PB: Do you have future plans for similar developments?

JB: I do not. If someone comes to me and wants to partner or ask me to manage the project, I will absolutely consider it. My heart is in this. I feel very fortunate I was able to create Array and have it be such an incredible success.

PB: What would you like people to take away from this project?

JB: I want people to know that they can live sustainably and that the choices we make should take our carbon footprint into consideration. The real estate sector can and should contribute to reducing our carbon footprint.","https://img.probuilder.com/files/base/ebm/probuilder/image/2025/08/68952d959dcac5bb0c03f127-pbheroarray.png?auto=format,compress&fit=fill&fill=blur&w=1200&h=630",N,,2025-08-09 08:02:57.289112

It's not clear that any state has a solution and the actual effect of data centers on electricity bills is difficult to pin down. Some critics question whether states have the spine to take a hard line against tech behemoths like Microsoft, Google, Amazon and Meta.

But more than a dozen states have begun taking steps as data centers drive a rapid build-out of power plants and transmission lines.

That has meant pressuring the nation's biggest power grid operator to clamp down on price increases, studying the effect of data centers on electricity bills or pushing data center owners to pay a larger share of local transmission costs.

Rising power bills are “something legislators have been hearing a lot about. It’s something we’ve been hearing a lot about. More people are speaking out at the public utility commission in the past year than I’ve ever seen before,” said Charlotte Shuff of the Oregon Citizens’ Utility Board, a consumer advocacy group. “There’s a massive outcry.”

Not the typical electric customer

Some data centers could require more electricity than cities the size of Pittsburgh, Cleveland or New Orleans, and make huge factories look tiny by comparison. That's pushing policymakers to rethink a system that, historically, has spread transmission costs among classes of consumers that are proportional to electricity use.

“A lot of this infrastructure, billions of dollars of it, is being built just for a few customers and a few facilities and these happen to be the wealthiest companies in the world,” said Ari Peskoe, who directs the Electricity Law Initiative at Harvard University. “I think some of the fundamental assumptions behind all this just kind of breaks down.”

A fix, Peskoe said, is a “can of worms"" that pits ratepayer classes against one another.

Some officials downplay the role of data centers in pushing up electric bills.

Tricia Pridemore, who sits on Georgia’s Public Service Commission and is president of the National Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners, pointed to an already tightened electricity supply and increasing costs for power lines, utility poles, transformers and generators as utilities replace aging equipment or harden it against extreme weather.

The data centers needed to accommodate the artificial intelligence boom are still in the regulatory planning stages, Pridemore said, and the Data Center Coalition, which represents Big Tech firms and data center developers, has said its members are committed to paying their fair share.

But growing evidence suggests that the electricity bills of some Americans are rising to subsidize the massive energy needs of Big Tech as the U.S. competes in a race against China for artificial intelligence superiority.

Data and analytics firm Wood Mackenzie published a report in recent weeks that suggested 20 proposed or effective specialized rates for data centers in 16 states it studied aren’t nearly enough to cover the cost of a new natural gas power plant.

In other words, unless utilities negotiate higher specialized rates, other ratepayer classes — residential, commercial and industrial — are likely paying for data center power needs.

Meanwhile, Monitoring Analytics, the independent market watchdog for the mid-Atlantic grid, produced research in June showing that 70% — or $9.3 billion — of last year's increased electricity cost was the result of data center demand.

States are responding

Last year, five governors led by Pennsylvania's Josh Shapiro began pushing back against power prices set by the mid-Atlantic grid operator, PJM Interconnection, after that amount spiked nearly sevenfold. They warned of customers “paying billions more than is necessary.”

PJM has yet to propose ways to guarantee that data centers pay their freight, but Monitoring Analytics is floating the idea that data centers should be required to procure their own power.

In a filing last month, it said that would avoid a ""massive wealth transfer” from average people to tech companies.

At least a dozen states are eyeing ways to make data centers pay higher local transmission costs.

In Oregon, a data center hot spot, lawmakers passed legislation in June ordering state utility regulators to develop new — presumably higher — power rates for data centers.

The Oregon Citizens’ Utility Board says there is clear evidence that costs to serve data centers are being spread across all customers — at a time when some electric bills there are up 50% over the past four years and utilities are disconnecting more people than ever.

New Jersey’s governor signed legislation last month commissioning state utility regulators to study whether ratepayers are being hit with “unreasonable rate increases” to connect data centers and to develop a specialized rate to charge data centers.

In some other states, like Texas and Utah, governors and lawmakers are trying to avoid a supply-and-demand crisis that leaves ratepayers on the hook — or in the dark.

Doubts about states protecting ratepayers

In Indiana, state utility regulators approved a settlement between Indiana Michigan Power Co., Amazon, Google, Microsoft and consumer advocates that set parameters for data center payments for service.

Kerwin Olsen, of the Citizens Action Council of Indiana, a consumer advocacy group, signed the settlement and called it a “pretty good deal” that contained more consumer protections than what state lawmakers passed.

But, he said, state law doesn't force large power users like data centers to publicly reveal their electric usage, so pinning down whether they're paying their fair share of transmission costs ""will be a challenge.”

In a March report, the Environmental and Energy Law Program at Harvard University questioned the motivation of utilities and regulators to shield ratepayers from footing the cost of electricity for data centers.

Both utilities and states have incentives to attract big customers like data centers, it said.

To do it, utilities — which must get their rates approved by regulators — can offer “special deals to favored customers” like a data center and effectively shift the costs of those discounts to regular ratepayers, the authors wrote. Many state laws can shield disclosure of those rates, they said.

In Pennsylvania, an emerging data center hot spot, the state utility commission is drafting a model rate structure for utilities to consider adopting. An overarching goal is to get data center developers to put their money where their mouth is.

“We’re talking about real transmission upgrades, potentially hundreds of millions of dollars,” commission chairman Stephen DeFrank said. “And that’s what you don’t want the ratepayer to get stuck paying for.""
