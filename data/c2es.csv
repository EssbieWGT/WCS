And although Democrats and independents have weakened their support for some green energy initiatives, there has not been an increase in support for Trump's energy policies.
About 6 in 10 Democrats, 58%, favor tax credits for purchasing an electric vehicle, down from about 7 in 10 in 2022.
The decline in favoring solar panel tax credits was across the board rather than being concentrated among Democrats.
The poll found three-quarters of Democrats support providing consumer rebates for efficient home appliances, compared with 6 in 10 Republicans.","Americans’ support for green energy tax credits and renewable energies like wind and solar power has decreased in recent years, according to a new poll, driven by a softening in support from Democrats and independents.

The poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research finds that U.S. adults' support for tax credits for electric vehicles and solar panels has weakened, as well as their enthusiasm for offshore wind farm expansion. While Democrats remain the strongest supporters of these initiatives, the poll reveals signs of growing cynicism within their ranks.

The poll results coincide with sweeping changes President Donald Trump's Republican administration is making to regulations related to energy and climate change, including slashing the federal workforce in these departments. And although Democrats and independents have weakened their support for some green energy initiatives, there has not been an increase in support for Trump's energy policies.

The poll found only about 4 in 10 U.S. adults — including only 1 in 10 Democrats and about 2 in 10 independents, along with three-quarters of Republicans — approve of the way Trump is handling climate change, which largely tracks with his overall approval rating.

About 6 in 10 Democrats, 58%, favor tax credits for purchasing an electric vehicle, down from about 7 in 10 in 2022. Among independents, support declined from 49% in 2022 to 28%. Only one-quarter of Republicans supported this policy in 2022, and that hasn’t changed measurably.

“As far as the pollution goes ... the vehicles nowadays put out very little emissions to the air,” said JD Johnson, a 62-year-old Democrat from Meadowview, Virginia, who somewhat opposes tax credits to purchase an electric vehicle. That's partly because he sees the electric vehicle manufacturing process as energy intensive and believes gasoline-powered vehicles have made improvements with the pollutants they emit.

The decline in favoring solar panel tax credits was across the board rather than being concentrated among Democrats.

“For solar panels, in all honesty, I don’t think they’re that efficient yet,” said Glenn Savage, 78, a left-leaning independent from Rock Hill, South Carolina. “I’d rather see them pour money into research and try to get the solar panels more efficient before they start giving tax breaks to the public. I may be wrong on that, but that’s just my thought.”

Scientists say transitioning to renewable energies and ditching fossil fuels that release planet-warming emissions are essential to protect the planet. Billions of dollars in project grants for clean technologies awarded during President Joe Biden's Democratic administration have been canceled by the Trump administration, and the offshore wind sector has been stunted by Trump's executive order that paused approvals, permits and loans for wind energy projects.

Fewer than half of U.S. adults, 44%, now say that offshore wind farms should be expanded in the U.S., down from 59% in 2022. About half favor expanding solar panel farms, while about two-thirds were in support in 2022.

When people are concerned about the economy and their personal finances, environmental issues are sometimes prioritized less, said Talbot Andrews, an assistant professor in the department of government at Cornell University who was not involved in the poll.

""I think it makes people anxious to think about increased taxes or increased spending on environmental issues when the cost of eggs are going through the roof,"" Andrews said.

Trump has championed the expansion of offshore oil drilling, as well as domestic coal production.

Despite a decline in support for expanded renewable energies, the new poll shows that only about one-third of U.S. adults think offshore drilling for oil and natural gas should be expanded in the U.S., and only about one-quarter say this about coal mining.

In both cases, Republicans are much more likely than Democrats to support expanding these energy sources.

Trump has sought to open up national monuments for oil drilling, but more U.S. adults oppose than support auctioning off more public space for oil drilling. Only about one-quarter of U.S. adults favor this, while 4 in 10 are opposed. Republicans are much more likely than independents or Democrats to be in support.

The Energy Star program that certifies appliances, such as dishwashers and refrigerators, as energy efficient recently appeared in headlines when the EPA made plans to scrap the program. The blue and white logo is well recognized, and experts say the program has long had bipartisan support until recently.

The poll found three-quarters of Democrats support providing consumer rebates for efficient home appliances, compared with 6 in 10 Republicans.

Patrick Buck, 54, from Chicago, describes himself as a liberal Republican and is a fan of the consumer rebates for energy-efficient appliances. ""It seems to work in terms of transforming what people have in their houses, because a lot of people have a lot of old appliances and just can't afford new ones,"" he said.

The poll found only about 2 in 10 U.S. adults are “extremely” or “very” confident in the federal government’s ability to ensure the safety of their drinking water, the air they breathe and the meat, poultry, fruits and vegetables they buy in grocery stores.

About 4 in 10 U.S. adults are “somewhat” confident in the federal government’s ability to ensure the safety of each of these, and about 4 in 10 are “not very” or “not at all” confident.

The Trump administration has announced plans to roll back rules and policies related to limiting pollution and greenhouse gas emissions, such as rules that limit pollution from power plants and blocking California's efforts to phase out cars that run on gas. The federal government has also cut staff at the Food and Drug Administration, the federal agency tasked with protecting public health and ensuring food supply safety.

Council unanimously approved a solar farm project led by the Central Midlands Council of Governments to be located at the Metro Wastewater Treatment Plant. The farm will be 15 acres in size and generate two megawatts of electricity for the plant, according to a presentation given by Jocelyn Falkenstein, CPRG implementation grant manager for CMCOG.

The solar farm is planned to generate energy for up to 30 years and decrease regional air pollution while providing economic benefits for the city, Falkenstein said. It will also provide predictable income to support grant programs that assist low-income families with their utility bills.

“It’s a great way to generate energy savings,” Mayor Pro-Tem Tim James commented before the vote.

CMCOG plans to begin construction in 2026 and complete it in 2028, although no cost estimate has been made for the project. Council’s approval does not come with any financial commitments at this stage.

The City of Columbia and Richland County have already approved the proposal, and $8.7 million in grants have been secured for the project.

Cayce opened a bid process in 2025 for a civil engineering firm to develop a master plan for the city’s 285-mile sewage system. Council unanimously approved a $325,000 contract with Adurra Group for the project, after a presentation by Adurra Group’s Jeremy Brashear. The company has worked on similar projects in South Carolina.

Council also unanimously approved emergency repairs to a failed sewer main near American Avenue. The repairs involve replacing 275 feet of pipe and repairing the nearby roadway. The total cost of the repairs is estimated at $48,375, and will be carried out by G.H. Smith Construction, a local construction firm.

On June 23, the city announced that Michael Conley will be the next city manager.

This push toward state primacy is an important development for the rapidly growing carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) industry, for which Class VI permits are the critical construction and operating permit. Currently, there are 62 CCS projects - including many with multiple wells - with permit applications pending with EPA. Project proponents anticipate that permitting will be faster if administered by the state instead of EPA. The latest developments last month include: (1) EPA’s proposal to grant primacy to Arizona; (2) EPA’s proposal to grant primacy to Texas; (3) a federal court decision rejecting a challenge to EPA’s earlier grant of primacy to Louisiana; and (4) an ongoing challenge to West Virginia’s recently granted primacy.

Arizona

On May 19, 2025, the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) published a federal notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) to grant primacy to Arizona for all well classes under the federal UIC program, including Class VI. 90 Fed. Reg. 21264 (May 19, 2025). Unlike other states that have sought Class VI primacy thus far, Arizona is unique in not currently having primacy over any UIC well classes. If finalized, EPA’s proposal would give Arizona Department of Environmental Quality (ADEQ) authority to regulate all underground injection of carbon dioxide for long-term geological sequestration within Arizona’s jurisdiction, excluding Indian lands. There has never been a Class VI permit issued in Arizona, and there are no pending Class VI permit applications in the state at this time. EPA will hold one virtual public hearing on June 25, 2025, on the proposed grant of primacy to Arizona during the comment period, which ends on July 3, 2025. Based on recent precedent from West Virginia’s Class VI primacy, we expect the final grant of primacy to be issued within a few months.

Texas

As we previously reported, on June 9, 2025, EPA issued a proposal to give Texas primacy over the Class VI program. EPA is taking public comment on the proposal through July 31, 2025, and will hold a public hearing on July 24, 2025. A final rule granting Class VI primacy for Texas is expected in Fall 2025.

When EPA issues final rules, Arizona and Texas would become the fifth and sixth states with primacy over Class VI wells, joining North Dakota (granted primacy in 2018), Wyoming (2020), Louisiana (2023), and West Virginia (2025). Meanwhile, other states’ Class VI primacy grants are facing lawsuits, including Louisiana and West Virginia.

Louisiana

On May 21, 2025, the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit rejected the petition for review of the final rule granting Louisiana Class VI authorization by three environmental organizations, who asserted that EPA’s approval of Louisiana’s primacy did not follow proper procedure and that the transfer liability could potentially lead to environmental harm. Deep South Center for Environmental Justice v. EPA, No. 24-60084, 2025 WL 1452098 (5th Cir. 2025). The Fifth Circuit found that the ENGOs did not have standing to challenge the final rule granting primacy for Louisiana. This decision may signal that it will be challenging for opponents to successfully challenge EPA’s decision to grant Class VI primacy.

West Virginia

EPA is also currently facing a challenge to its Class VI primacy grant to West Virginia in the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals. Petition for Review, West Virginia Surface Owners’ Rights Organization v. Zeldin, No. 25-1384 (4th Cir. filed Apr. 11, 2025). The challenge is based on concerns that there may not be sufficient resources or expertise available to properly regulate the wells. Briefing on the case is scheduled to begin next month.

Ultimately, EPA’s Class VI primacy grants to both Louisiana and West Virginia are likely to be upheld. This marks a continuation of the administration’s cooperative federalism approach to accelerating grants of primacy. As more states take primacy in issuing Class VI permits, project proponents anticipate that the Class VI permitting process will move more quickly, allowing more projects to move forward.

The New Mexico Environment Department and New Mexico Department of Justice today filed a new lawsuit ordering the U.S. Department of the Air Force to clean up its toxic PFAS contamination at Cannon Air Force Base near Clovis.

Earlier this year, the New Mexico Legislature delivered House Bill 140 to Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham, who promptly signed it into law. The new lawsuit relies on existing and expanded authority under the new law.

“After years of contesting responsibility, today’s lawsuit puts every one of the Air Force’s excuses to rest,” said Environment Department Secretary James Kenney. “The Air Force has spent years contesting the Environment Department’s authority as opposed to any meaningful cleanup of the toxic PFAS contamination in local drinking water sources that serve both residents and dairy farmers.”

“PFAS contamination poses a serious and long-term threat to our environment and our communities,” said Attorney General Raúl Torrez. “We are committed to using every legal tool available to hold the federal government accountable for the damage done on the base and the surrounding community and to prevent further harm from these dangerous ‘forever chemicals.’ New Mexicans deserve clean water, safe soil, and a future free from toxic exposure—and we won’t stop fighting until they get it.”

While New Mexico has contended PFAS was subject to regulation under the Hazardous Waste Act since 2019, the USAF disagreed and filed a lawsuit against the NMED. During the last legislative session, HB 140 was introduced, explicitly designating discarded firefighting foams containing PFAS chemicals as hazardous waste, clarifying state-level regulation even when these substances aren’t federally listed by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency as such.

For decades, the USAF released PFAS into the environment near Clovis, resulting in a groundwater plume extending approximately four miles southeast of Cannon AFB. This toxic plume continues to threaten the community and resulted in the euthanizing of 3,500 dairy cows poisoned from drinking contaminated groundwater — devastating local agriculture.

In addition to cleaning up the decades of ongoing PFAS releases and paying civil penalties, the lawsuit seeks to order the USAF to:

End all use of PFAS-containing firefighting foam at Cannon for anything other than emergency purposes

Provide water treatment systems to residents whose water has been affected by PFAS contamination

Install drinking water lines for any willing residents currently serviced by private wells in the spill area

Hold regular public meetings with the community

Install stormwater controls and retention basins to prevent offsite migration of PFAS from contaminated media

Valuate nearby private property affected by PFAS contamination

Compensate the owners of said property for losses resulting from PFAS contamination

MEMO: Higher Energy Bills, Fewer Jobs, and Polluter Payouts… The Full Big Ugly Bill is Here

Over the past few weeks, we’ve watched Senate Republicans hastily roll out each committee’s portion of their Big Ugly budget reconciliation bill. And what we’ve seen is as alarming as it is consistent. Across every relevant committee and every section, the Big Ugly Bill attacks working families’ clean energy jobs and cost savings, slashes critical public health and climate protections, and showers fossil fuel executives and corporate polluters with massive tax breaks and special favors.

It all culminated last week, when Senate Finance Chair Mike Crapo (R-Idaho) released the final, much-anticipated piece of the bill. We were holding onto lingering hope that Republicans would listen to their constituents, industry leaders, and even Elon Musk, by finally abandoning their attacks on clean energy tax credits. Surely, they’d recognize that these credits are so popular and effective that even four GOP Senators and 13 Representatives have pleaded to keep them in place. Surely, they wouldn’t want to hike families’ energy costs and eliminate good-paying jobs. Surely, they wouldn’t want to cede our global leadership on clean energy manufacturing to foreign adversaries at such a critical juncture.

But in the end, Senate Republicans stayed true to form, choosing polluters over people, again.

Senate Finance Committee Attacks Clean Energy

As we wrote about last week, the Finance Committee’s section of the Big Ugly Bill doubles down on the GOP’s efforts to ban affordable clean energy. Their portion echoes the House’s sweeping, coordinated rollback of the very tools that are helping families save money, reshore manufacturing jobs, and make clean energy the most affordable and rapidly growing source of energy out there. Specifically, the bill:

Rapidly and effectively eliminates the clean energy and manufacturing tax credits that have spurred hundreds of billions in private investment, supported hundreds of thousands of jobs, and have helped grow the U.S.’ global leadership in energy innovation, with different words than but similar effects to the House bill.

Throws out consumer and residential credits for home solar, energy storage, electric vehicles (EVs), and home efficiency upgrades, cutting off families who are trying to reduce energy costs and make their homes more self-sufficient.

All told, these cuts will increase energy bills for working families by more than $110 next year and over $400 per year by the end of the decade. They’ll also tank domestic manufacturing, leaving communities across the country behind, especially those in rural areas. They’re so bad that four Republican Senators and 13 Republican Representatives have urged them not to do exactly what they are doing.

The Big Ugly Picture: Top 5 Polluter Giveaways in Senate Republicans’ Reconciliation

With full text of the Big Ugly Bill in hand, we’re taking stock of just how sweeping and destructive this package really is, and it’s clear that this is the most anti-environmental bill in history. Across 77 anti-environmental provisions, the bill:

Permanently sells off millions of acres of our public lands to anyone willing to buy, including foreign adversaries, while also forcing lease sales that will open up our public lands and waters to drilling, mining, and destructive development.

Increases families’ energy costs by eliminating clean energy tax credits and consumer rebates, making impotent fuel efficiency standards, and blocking affordable clean energy development.

Puts polluting billionaires above the law through corrupt new pay-to-play permitting schemes and other sweetheart deals that allow Big Oil CEOs to jam through massive polluting projects while sidestepping environmental review, community input, and judicial oversight.

Threatens public health and increases medical costs by killing pollution cleanup programs for schools and dirty diesel trucks and buses, all while cutting funding for communities to even be able to track harmful air pollution.

Wipes out clean energy manufacturing and hundreds of thousands jobs at just the wrong time, ceding our global competitive edge.

This isn’t a budget. It’s not a plan for the future. It’s a fossil fuel wish list dressed up as legislation that will make life harder and more expensive for the rest of us. But don’t just take our word for it; you can see all 77 anti-environmental provisions here:",https://www.lcv.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/LCV-Social-Share.png,N,,2025-06-24 00:04:36.072568

“It’s going to be hard to decide.” Among those likely in the running is the Nine Mile Point nuclear plant in Oswego.
There are 54 operating nuclear power plants in the country, according to the U.S. Department of Energy.
The last nuclear power plant built in the state was Unit 2 at Nine Mile Point in 1989.
The New York Power Authority previously operated two nuclear plants, including the Indian Point Power Plant, which shut down in 2021.","NEW YORK — (AP) — New York’s governor on Monday proposed the construction of the state’s first new nuclear power plant in decades.

Gov. Kathy Hochul directed the state’s power authority to develop an advanced, “zero-emission” facility in upstate New York that she hopes will help create a clean, reliable and affordable electric grid for the state.

She said the state power authority will seek to develop “at least” one new nuclear energy facility with a combined capacity of no less than one gigawatt of electricity. That would increase the state’s total nuclear capacity to about 4.3 gigawatts.

The Democrat, speaking at the Niagara County Power Project in Lewiston, said the state needs to secure its “energy independence” if it wants to continue to attract large manufacturers that create good-paying jobs as it deactivates aging fossil fuel power plants.

Acknowledging concerns with nuclear power, she pledged the new facility or facilities would be safer than their predecessors.

“This is not your grandparents’ nuclear reactor,” Hochul said. “The new plan will be a model of 21st century nuclear design with safety at the forefront, automatic safety systems to enhance the containment and rigorous environmental standards.”

But Alfred Meyer, treasurer of Physicians for Social Responsibility’s New York chapter, was unconvinced.

He said nuclear power is a “very slow, expensive and dangerous” way to generate electricity that takes away resources from faster, cheaper renewable options while leaving behind highly toxic, radioactive waste.

“Nuclear power is not clean or green energy,” he said. “It is damaging to public health and the environment.”

Hochul said the state hasn’t decided on a potential location, but that upstate communities appear receptive, given the potential for creating 1,600 construction jobs and 1,200 permanent jobs once the facility is operational.

“Everybody is raising their hand right now,” Hochul said. “It’s going to be hard to decide.”

Among those likely in the running is the Nine Mile Point nuclear plant in Oswego. Hochul’s administration has been supportive of Maryland power company Constellation’s bid to build a new nuclear reactor at the two-reactor facility.

There are 54 operating nuclear power plants in the country, according to the U.S. Department of Energy.

But American utilities have been broadly reluctant to launch new nuclear plants due to high cost overruns and delays on recent high-profile projects.

Georgia Power Company completed the first two new nuclear reactors in the country in a generation last year. Units 3 and 4 at Plant Vogtle in Waynesboro, Georgia, cost nearly $35 billion and were powered up some seven years later than initially hoped.

Last month, the Tennessee Valley Authority, the nation's largest public power company, applied to the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission to develop what it bills as a next-generation nuclear power plant at its Clinch River site in Oak Ridge.

New York currently has three active nuclear plants, all located upstate along Lake Ontario and owned by Constellation. The Nine Mile Point, Robert Emmett Ginna and James A. FitzPatrick plants provide about 3.3 gigawatts of power, or roughly 20% of the state’s electricity, according to Hochul’s office.

The last nuclear power plant built in the state was Unit 2 at Nine Mile Point in 1989. At its peak, nuclear power provided about 5.4 gigawatts, or roughly one-third of the state’s electrical supply, according to the advocacy group Nuclear New York.

The New York Power Authority previously operated two nuclear plants, including the Indian Point Power Plant, which shut down in 2021. That facility was located along the Hudson River some 25 miles (40 kilometers) north of New York City in Buchanan.

The other facility, once operated by the state, was the FitzPatrick plant, which the power authority sold in 2000 and is now run by Constellation.

Gov. Kathy Hochul directed the state’s power authority to develop an advanced, “zero-emission” facility in upstate New York that she hopes will help create a clean, reliable and affordable electric grid for the state.

She said the state power authority will seek to develop “at least” one new nuclear energy facility with a combined capacity of no less than one gigawatt of electricity. That would increase the state’s total nuclear capacity to about 4.3 gigawatts.

The Democrat, speaking at the Niagara County Power Project in Lewiston, said the state needs to secure its “energy independence” if it wants to continue to attract large manufacturers that create good-paying jobs as it deactivates aging fossil fuel power plants.

Acknowledging critics of nuclear power, she pledged the new facility or facilities would be safer than their predecessors.

“This is not your grandparents’ nuclear reactor,” Hochul said. “The new plan will be a model of 21st century nuclear design with safety at the forefront, automatic safety systems to enhance the containment, and rigorous environmental standards.”

The governor said the state hasn’t decided on a potential location, but that upstate communities appear receptive, given the potential for creating 1,600 construction jobs and 1,200 permanent jobs once the facility is operational.

“Everybody is raising their hand right now,” Hochul said. “It’s going to be hard to decide.”

Among those likely in the running is the Nine Mile Point nuclear plant in Oswego. Hochul’s administration has been supportive of Maryland power company Constellation’s bid to build a new nuclear reactor at the two-reactor facility.

There are 54 operating nuclear power plants in the country, according to the U.S. Department of Energy’s Energy Information Administration.

But American utilities have been broadly reluctant to launch new nuclear plants due to high cost overruns and delays on recent high-profile projects.

Diamond Alternative Energy, LLC v. Environmental Protection Agency, No. 24-7: This case addresses fuel producers’ Article III standing to challenge the Environmental Protection Agency’s (“EPA”) approval of California regulations requiring automakers to manufacture more electric vehicles and fewer gasoline-powered vehicles. Fuel producers sued the EPA in the D.C. Circuit, arguing the EPA lacked authority to approve the regulations. California and other states adopting the regulations intervened to defend the EPA’s approval, arguing the fuel producers lacked standing. The D.C. Circuit held the fuel producers lacked standing because they failed to establish that automakers would likely respond to invalidation of the regulations by producing fewer electric vehicles and more gasoline-powered vehicles. In a 7-2 opinion authored by Justice Kavanaugh, the Court reversed the D.C. Circuit and held that the fuel producers have standing. Article III standing requires plaintiffs to show three elements: injury in fact, causation, and redressability. The fuel producers’ injury in fact and causation are “straightforward and undisputed,” as decreased purchases of gasoline and other liquid fuels constitute monetary injury caused by the California regulations. The fuel producers also satisfy redressability, as even minimal additional revenue would satisfy this requirement and invalidating the regulations would likely result in more revenue from fuel sales. Justices Sotomayor and Jackson filed dissenting opinions.

Esteras v. United States, No. 23-7483: This case clarifies the factors that courts may look to when considering whether to revoke a term of supervised release. Under federal sentencing statutes, a court must consider ten factors when imposing a criminal sentence. 18 U.S.C. § 3553. Eight of those ten factors must be considered if a court imposes or revokes supervised release. 18 U.S.C. § 3583(c), (e). In this case, petitioner Edgardo Esteras was arrested and charged with domestic violence and other crimes while on supervised release. The district court revoked supervised release and imposed a 24-month reimprisonment sentence based on the court’s determination that the revocation sentence would “promote respect for the law.” This factor is included in § 3553(a)(2)(A), but is not among the eight factors in § 3583(c) or (e). In a decision authored by Justice Barrett (joined in full by Chief Justice Roberts and Justices Thomas, Kagan, and Kavanaugh, and in part by Justices Sotomayor and Jackson), the Supreme Court held that courts may only consider the eight factors enumerated in § 3583(e) when deciding whether to revoke a sentence of supervised release, interpreting the exclusion of the “promote respect for the law” factor from Sections 3583(c) and (e) as evidencing Congress’s intent that courts should not consider that factor’s focus on retribution vis-à-vis the defendant’s underlying criminal offense in the supervised release context. Justice Sotomayor (joined by Justice Jackson) and Justice Jackson each filed opinions concurring in part and concurring in the judgment. Justice Alito (joined by Justice Gorsuch) dissented.

Food and Drug Administration v. R.J. Reynolds Vapor Co., No. 23-1187: This case considers the proper judicial forum to challenge the Food and Drug Administration’s (“FDA”) denial of an application to market a new tobacco product under the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act (“TCA”). The TCA allows “any person adversely affected” by an FDA denial order to seek judicial review either in the D.C. Circuit or “the circuit in which such person resides or has their principal place of business.” 21 U.S.C. § 387l(a)(1). After R.J. Reynolds Vapor Co.’s application for an e-cigarette product was denied, it did not seek review in the D.C. Circuit or in the Fourth Circuit, the North Carolina-based company’s home forum. Instead, it joined with a Texas-based retailer and Mississippi-based trade association to sue in the Fifth Circuit. The FDA sought to dismiss or transfer the lawsuit, arguing that only the manufacturer applicant itself—R.J. Reynolds Vapor—qualified as the party “adversely affected.” The Fifth Circuit denied the motion and retained jurisdiction. In a 7-2 decision authored by Justice Barrett, the Supreme Court affirmed the Fifth Circuit and held that retailers who would sell the product qualify as “adversely affected” parties for purposes of TCA judicial review. The Court’s reasoning relied on Administrative Procedure Act precedents and the TCA’s text to adopt the broad definition of “adversely affected.” Justice Jackson (joined by Justice Sotomayor) dissented, arguing the TCA’s text and purpose limited the “adversely affected” language to manufacturers.

Fuld v. Palestine Liberation Organization, No. 24-20: This case addresses whether the exercise of personal jurisdiction over the Palestine Liberation Organization (“PLO”) and Palestine Authority (“PA”) under the Promoting Security and Justice for Victims of Terrorism Act (“PSJVTA”) violates the Fifth Amendment’s Due Process Clause. Two lawsuits were filed against the PLO and PA in federal district courts under the Anti-Terrorism Act of 1990 (“ATA”), which creates a federal civil damages action for U.S. nationals injured or killed “by reason of an act of international terrorism.” The PSJVTA names the PA and PLO specifically and provides that they shall be deemed to have consented to personal jurisdiction in ATA cases involving two factual predicates: the PA’s and PLO’s (1) practice of paying salaries to terrorists in Israeli prisons and to families of deceased terrorists, and (2) activities on U.S. soil. The district courts found evidence that the PA and PLO had engaged in conduct sufficient to satisfy at least the payments prong, but held that an exercise of jurisdiction under either factual predicate was unconstitutional. The Second Circuit consolidated the cases and affirmed, holding that the PSJVTA could not, consistent with due process, establish personal jurisdiction over the PLO or PA. In a 9-0 decision authored by Chief Justice Roberts, the Court reversed the Second Circuit, finding that the PSJVTA’s personal jurisdiction provision does not violate the Fifth Amendment’s Due Process Clause because it reasonably ties the assertion of jurisdiction over the PLO and PA to conduct involving the United States and implicating sensitive foreign policy matters within the prerogative of the political branches. Justice Thomas filed an opinion concurring in the judgment, joined in part by Justice Gorsuch.

McLaughlin Chiropractic Associates v. McKesson Corp., No. 23-1226: This case addresses whether federal courts are required to follow a federal agency’s legal interpretation under the Hobbs Administrative Orders Review Act (“Hobbs Act”). In this case, McLaughlin Chiropractic Associates filed a class action lawsuit against McKesson Corporation, claiming McKesson’s unsolicited online fax advertisements violated the Telephone Consumer Protection Act (“TCPA”). After a class was certified, the Federal Communications Commission (“FCC”) issued a separate agency order that held that online faxes are not governed by the TCPA in the same manner as physical faxes are. Under Ninth Circuit precedent that required agency orders to be challenged exclusively in the courts of appeals in pre-enforcement suits under the Hobbs Act’s procedures, the district court in the class action determined the FCC’s order to be a binding interpretation of the TCPA, and granted summary judgment and decertified the class as to the online fax recipients. The Ninth Circuit affirmed. In a 6-3 decision authored by Justice Kavanaugh, the Supreme Court reversed, and held that the Hobbs Act’s pre-enforcement review procedures did not preclude parties in subsequent proceedings from challenging an agency’s legal interpretations. Instead, for agency determinations governed by the Hobbs Act, district courts must independently determine a law’s meaning, “under ordinary principles of statutory interpretation, affording appropriate respect to the agency's interpretation.” Justice Kagan (joined by Justices Sotomayor and Jackson) dissented, arguing that the majority’s holding “prevents the Hobbs Act from functioning as Congress wanted—by allowing regulated parties to end-run the Act’s pre-enforcement judicial review scheme, and thereby undermine the stability and efficacy of administrative programs.”

Stanley v. City of Sanford, Florida, No. 23-997: This case evaluates whether Title I of the Americans with Disabilities Act (“ADA”) reaches discrimination against retirees. Title I prohibits discrimination against “qualified individual[s].” 42 U.S.C. § 12112(a). A qualified individual is someone “who, with or without reasonable accommodation, can perform the essential functions of the employment position that [she] holds or desires.” Petitioner began working as a firefighter for the City of Sanford at a time when the City offered health insurance until age 65 for two categories of retirees: those who retired with 25 years of service, and those who retired earlier because of a disability. The City later changed its policy to continue to pay for health insurance up to age 65 for retirees with 25 years of service but to pay just 24 months of insurance for those who retired earlier due to disability. Petitioner developed a disability that forced her to retire before 25 years of service and claimed the City violated the ADA by providing different health-insurance benefits to those who retire earlier due to disability. The district court dismissed the ADA claim, finding the alleged discrimination occurred after she was retired and was no longer a “qualified individual.” The Eleventh Circuit affirmed the district court, and the Supreme Court affirmed the Eleventh Circuit. The Supreme Court held that to prevail under § 12112(a), a plaintiff must plead and prove that she held or desired a job and could perform its essential functions with or without reasonable accommodation at the time of the employer’s alleged act of disability-based discrimination. The definition of “reasonable accommodation” makes sense for current employees or applicants but not retirees, and § 12112(b)’s examples of discrimination aim to protect job holders and seekers, not retirees. Justice Gorsuch delivered the opinion with respect to Parts I and II, joined by Chief Justice Roberts and Justices Thomas, Alito, Kagan, Kavanaugh, and Barrett; and with respect to Part III, joined by Justices Alito, Sotomayor, and Kagan. Justice Thomas filed a concurrence, joined by Justice Barrett. Justice Sotomayor filed a concurrence in part and dissent in part. Justice Jackson filed a dissent, joined in part by Justice Sotomayor.

Landor v. Louisiana Department of Corrections and Public Safety, No. 23-1197: This case involves Damon Landor, a devout Rastafarian inmate who had his dreadlocks forcibly shaved by prison officials while incarcerated in a Louisiana prison. After Landor was released, he sued the prison officials, seeking compensatory and punitive damages for alleged violations of the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act of 2000 (“RLUIPA”). The Fifth Circuit affirmed the dismissal of Landor’s lawsuit, holding that only the State itself, not individual defendants can be liable for RLUIPA violations. The question presented is: Whether an individual may sue a government official in his individual capacity for damages for violations of the RLUIPA.",,N,,2025-06-24 01:04:20.996674

Most laws in Georgia passed by the General Assembly take effect the summer after they're signed by the governor following Sine Die (the final day of the legislature, which usually occurs at the end of March).

The state website notes that unless a bill specifically states otherwise, new laws take effect for the most part on July 1. Here's an overview of the key players:

New Georgia laws taking effect July 1

Agriculture

HB 358: Defines what counts as a ""military installation."" This definition relates to the ban on ""certain foreign persons and entities"" from buying or using farmland or land within a 10-mile radius of a military base, military installation or military airport.

SB 144: Manufacturers of pesticides can't be held liable for not warning consumers of health risks beyond those required by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). An exception to this rule is if the EPA finds that a manufacturer knowingly withheld, misrepresented or destroyed health risk information.

Animals

HB 331: You can't transfer a dog, cat or domestic rabbit at any roadside, public right of way, parkway, median, public or commercial parking lot or sidewalk, park, recreation area, fair, flea market or similar outdoor location. Those who violate this law will be fined. The intent of the law is to curb sales linked to puppy mills.

HB 614: Allows local governments to ban the use of fireworks in proximity to facilities housing horses. May include special event permits to allow the use of fireworks.

SB 105: Allows the practice of veterinary telemedicine, tele-triage, and tele-advice. Provides the requirements for licensed veterinarians to issue this telemedicine.

Crime/Appealing/Judicial System

HB 176: If a judge makes a decision in a criminal case but doesn't decide on every charge, it can still be appealed if the rest of the charges are put on hold (aka ""dead docketed""). The law allows a person to ask the court to give them more time to file for a new trial or appeal in certain circumstances. You can withdraw a guilty plea that resulted in a criminal conviction within 30 days of the conviction or within the term of court when the plea was taken.

HB 582: The ""Georgia Survivor Justice Act"" allows abuse to be considered in the sentencing of domestic violence survivors who committed crimes while under the coercion of their partners. Allow survivors to present police reports, medical records and testimony about their abuse, which could lead to significant reductions in sentencing for those whose actions were a direct result of their trauma. For those already in prison, HB 582 would allow for resentencing if they can prove that domestic violence played a role in their crime.

HB 199: Requires state and local governments to restrict certain personally identifiable information from public disclosure. Creates a procedure for state and federal judges and their spouses to request the restriction of any other personally identifiable information from the public.

HB 85: Establishes the ""Superior Court Judicial Compensation Reform Act."" Adjusts the salary structure for superior court and statewide judges, who previously were paid both a state salary and optional county subsidies. This law caps local supplements paid to superior court judges and authorizes the General Assembly to set annual salaries. No judge's salary will be cut by the measure.

SB 110: Defines ""blatant disregard"" and ""independent activity"" and re-defines ""neglect"" in the juvenile code. Creates an exception for certain reckless conduct crimes for legal custodians allowing children to participate in some independent activities.

SB 79: Enacts the ""Fentanyl Eradication and Removal Act"" which adjusts the amounts of fentanyl necessary to be considered illegal trafficking. Adjusts the mandatory minimum sentencing for trafficking of controlled substances.

SB 132: Addresses the long wait times for pretrial mental health evaluations. Requires a hearing before a court orders an evaluation of the mental competency of an accused person to stand trial. Provides for the release of reports of mental competency evaluations and a shorter timeframe in which a mental competency evaluation must happen when the accused is only charged with one or more nonviolent misdemeanor offenses.

SB 244: Provides for the award of reasonable attorney's fees to defendants in criminal cases when the prosecuting attorney is disqualified for misconduct and the case is dismissed. Enacts the ""Wrongful Conviction and Incarceration Compensation Act"" to establish procedures for those people to claim and receive compensation from the state.

HB 161: Expands cyber-enabled offense investigations for which Georgia Bureau of Investigation officials can issue subpoenas for the production of electronic communication records. Defines ""assassination"" and establishes the crime of domestic terrorism.

Aviation

HB 58: Bans the operation of unmanned aircrafts within 400 feet of or above ticketed entertainment events. Exceptions include if a person with legal authority over the event gives permission.

Money

HB 136: Parents of children age five and under could claim a $250 state income tax credit, which also expands the state income tax credit for child care expenses.

HB 111: An already-planned state income tax cut will be accelerated, reducing the 5.39% tax rate to a flat 5.19%.

SB 55: Creates the ""Dignity and Pay Act"" which bans employers from paying individuals with disabilities less than the federal minimum wage.

HB 136: Provides a tax credit for qualified child care and dependent care expenses of up to 50% of the amount of credit provided for by the IRS. Also provides a $250 tax credit for each qualifying child of the taxpayer.

The EPA has also proposed reversing changes made to the regulation of mercury and other airborne toxins from power plants, potentially affecting coal-fired plants in Illinois.
The agency said the original rule already reduced mercury pollution but advocates argued the earlier rule does not apply to all power plants.
Lynk pointed out the EPA is looking to prove power plants do not significantly contribute to harmful air pollution.
""It's very important for people who are concerned to make their submissions to the EPA, to attend the virtual hearing,"" Lynk underscored.","As federal lawmakers move forward with proposed environmental protection rollbacks, advocates are sounding the alarm and requesting additional time for public feedback.

One proposal would repeal a Biden-era rule regulating greenhouse gas emissions from power plants. The Environmental Protection Agency previously found the rule would save thousands of lives and provide $20 billion per year in public health and environmental benefits.

Brian Lynk, senior attorney for the Environmental Law and Policy Center, emphasized regulation provides benefits on multiple levels.

""There are just so many things that flow from taking steps to reduce pollution and improve the air that in fact, benefit us economically as well,"" Lynk explained. ""We stand the risk of losing that.""

The EPA has also proposed reversing changes made to the regulation of mercury and other airborne toxins from power plants, potentially affecting coal-fired plants in Illinois. The agency said the original rule already reduced mercury pollution but advocates argued the earlier rule does not apply to all power plants.

Lynk pointed out the EPA is looking to prove power plants do not significantly contribute to harmful air pollution. He stressed it contradicts previous findings showing carbon emissions from power plants are equivalent to adding over 300 million new gas-powered cars to the road each year. Lynk added power plants account for about one quarter of all carbon emissions in the U.S.

""When we say 'not significant,' that's the magnitude of pollution that we're talking about,"" Lynk observed. ""It's pretty obvious that it is in fact very significant, and the proposal to simply leave that uncontrolled, bury our head in the sand and do nothing about it is a big problem.""

Lynk contended the EPA's proposals also set a dangerous precedent for not regulating pollution in other industries. The public has 45 days to provide comments on the proposed rules after they are published in the Federal Register. A virtual hearing is also scheduled for July 8. Lynk emphasized the public comment process is a critical component the agency must respond to or potentially face legal challenges.

""It's very important for people who are concerned to make their submissions to the EPA, to attend the virtual hearing,"" Lynk underscored. ""There will even be opportunities to speak at the hearing for those who registered to do so in advance. And I would encourage anyone with a stake in this to take advantage of that process.""

The deadline for the public to submit comments on the proposals to the EPA is Aug. 7 but at least 10 environmental groups, including Lynk's organization, have requested the deadline be extended to Aug. 29. The deadline to register to speak at the virtual hearing is June 29.",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/b3aa776/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5175x2717+0+23/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fd6%2Ff9%2Ffcaf47254add9abaecd9530fe0f9%2Fepa-rollbacks.jpg,N,,2025-06-23 23:03:51.548321

When complete, it is expected to employ at least 1,700 workers and produce enough battery capacity to power roughly a quarter of a million electric vehicles annually.
For Ford, the project represents more than just a factory.
Critics in Congress, particularly from the Republican Party, have zeroed in on Ford’s technology licensing agreement with CATL, a Chinese battery manufacturer.
Ford ultimately chose Marshall, a town of fewer than 7,000 people, where the project has drawn both excitement and protest.","On a vast stretch of farmland halfway between Detroit and Kalamazoo, steel girders are rising for what Ford Motor Company hopes will be a defining piece of its electric future: a $3.5 billion, two-million-square-foot factory dedicated to building lithium iron phosphate batteries, or LFPs, for a new generation of more affordable electric vehicles.

The facility — known as BlueOval Battery Park Michigan — is scheduled to open in 2026. When complete, it is expected to employ at least 1,700 workers and produce enough battery capacity to power roughly a quarter of a million electric vehicles annually. For Ford, the project represents more than just a factory. It’s a strategic commitment to American manufacturing, a hedge against volatile international supply chains, and a wager on technologies developed decades ago in U.S. labs but only recently revived for commercial use.

“It’s a full-circle moment,” said Lisa Drake, vice president of Ford’s EV industrialization efforts. “We’re building lithium iron phosphate batteries here at home, using American workers, for American-assembled vehicles.”

Yet the project has become entangled in a growing thicket of political and economic headwinds. Critics in Congress, particularly from the Republican Party, have zeroed in on Ford’s technology licensing agreement with CATL, a Chinese battery manufacturer. Although Ford will wholly own and operate the plant — and says no Chinese workers will be on-site — opponents argue that the arrangement provides an indirect opening for Chinese influence in American industry.

Those objections have already had an impact. Virginia, once considered a leading contender for the plant, withdrew from consideration under pressure from Governor Glenn Youngkin, who cited national security concerns. Ford ultimately chose Marshall, a town of fewer than 7,000 people, where the project has drawn both excitement and protest.

At the same time, new tariffs on imported battery materials and metals have complicated the factory’s financial outlook. Steel and aluminum costs have surged, and House Republicans have introduced legislation that would revoke key tax credits established under the Inflation Reduction Act — including incentives that underpin Ford’s investment. Company chair Bill Ford warned last month that such a move would “imperil” the project.

“We’re trying to plan on 10- and 15-year horizons,” he said at a recent conference in Michigan. “But the politics shift every two years.”

Still, the company appears undeterred. Construction is advancing, with clean-room environments and precision manufacturing lines already being assembled off-site. Ford has begun training workers to meet stringent requirements for battery-cell production, and local officials say the company has donated hundreds of thousands of dollars to schools, parks, and community organizations to help ease the transition.

Lithium iron phosphate chemistry offers a key advantage: lower cost. Unlike nickel- and cobalt-based batteries, LFP cells rely on more abundant materials, making them less vulnerable to price spikes and better suited to lower-priced vehicles. They also tend to be more stable, posing a lower fire risk — a critical selling point as battery safety comes under increasing scrutiny.

In Ford’s case, the batteries are expected to power a new line of mass-market electric vehicles aimed at customers who have balked at the $40,000-plus price tags that dominate the EV market. The company is also expected to use them in commercial vehicles and fleet products, where durability and cost take precedence over range.

Environmental groups have largely praised the initiative, pointing to the reduced reliance on overseas suppliers and the preservation of more than 240 acres of land near the plant for conservation. Still, some local residents have raised concerns about water use, air quality, and the pace of industrialization in what was once farmland.

For Ford, the stakes are high — and the timing delicate. The company is navigating a bumpy EV rollout marked by softening demand, rising costs, and fierce competition from both traditional rivals and new entrants. At the same time, it must balance investor pressure for profitability with the political imperatives of reshoring industrial capacity.

“This is a bet on American leadership,” Ms. Drake said. “We’re not waiting for someone else to solve the EV equation. We’re building the solution here, ourselves.”

Whether the factory ultimately delivers on that vision — or is derailed by global tensions and domestic partisanship — could help shape not only the future of Ford, but the trajectory of American manufacturing in the electric age.",https://cdn.autoconnectedcar.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/staronly.png,N,,2025-06-23 23:04:28.705793

Employment in Texas’s clean energy and manufacturing sectors could shrink by about 120,000 jobs by 2035, the study said.
Experts warn the rollback could also undermine U.S. competitiveness in the global clean energy market and impact rural Texas communities that have benefited from renewable energy investments.

The Inflation Reduction Act tax credits have been a key driver of investment in clean energy nationwide since their enactment in 2022.","A recent study warns that repealing federal clean energy tax credits under the Inflation Reduction Act could cost Texas’s economy billions of dollars and threaten tens of thousands of jobs.

The analysis by Energy Innovation projects that Texas could lose more than $87 billion in gross domestic product by 2034 if the tax credits are rolled back. The state’s GDP is expected to drop by $17.17 billion in 2030 and by $20.32 billion in 2035 alone.

Employment in Texas’s clean energy and manufacturing sectors could shrink by about 120,000 jobs by 2035, the study said.

The potential repeal would also raise energy costs for Texas households, with electricity bills expected to increase by roughly $780 annually and vehicle fuel costs by about $420 per year by 2035.

Since the proposal to repeal the tax credits surfaced, more than $14 billion in clean energy projects and approximately 10,000 associated jobs have been canceled nationwide, with Texas among the hardest hit, according to industry reports.

Texas’s clean energy manufacturing sector, which currently contributes $18 billion annually to the U.S. economy and supports 122,000 jobs, faces uncertain prospects if the tax incentives disappear.

Experts warn the rollback could also undermine U.S. competitiveness in the global clean energy market and impact rural Texas communities that have benefited from renewable energy investments.

“This legislation threatens to stall progress on clean energy development in Texas, putting economic growth and jobs at risk,” the report states.

And although Democrats and independents have weakened their support for some green energy initiatives, there has not been an increase in support for Trump’s energy policies.
About 6 in 10 Democrats, 58%, favor tax credits for purchasing an electric vehicle, down from about 7 in 10 in 2022.
The decline in favoring solar panel tax credits was across the board rather than being concentrated among Democrats.
The poll found three-quarters of Democrats support providing consumer rebates for efficient home appliances, compared with 6 in 10 Republicans.","Americans’ support for green energy tax credits and renewable energies like wind and solar power has decreased in recent years, according to a new poll, driven by a softening in support from Democrats and independents.

The poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research finds that U.S. adults’ support for tax credits for electric vehicles and solar panels has weakened, as well as their enthusiasm for offshore wind farm expansion. While Democrats remain the strongest supporters of these initiatives, the poll reveals signs of growing cynicism within their ranks.

The poll results coincide with sweeping changes President Trump’s Republican administration is making to regulations related to energy and climate change, including slashing the federal workforce in these departments. And although Democrats and independents have weakened their support for some green energy initiatives, there has not been an increase in support for Trump’s energy policies.

The poll found only about 4 in 10 U.S. adults — including only 1 in 10 Democrats and about 2 in 10 independents, along with three-quarters of Republicans — approve of the way Trump is handling climate change, which largely tracks with his overall approval rating.

About 6 in 10 Democrats, 58%, favor tax credits for purchasing an electric vehicle, down from about 7 in 10 in 2022. Among independents, support declined from 49% in 2022 to 28%. Only one-quarter of Republicans supported this policy in 2022, and that hasn’t changed measurably.

“As far as the pollution goes … the vehicles nowadays put out very little emissions to the air,” said JD Johnson, a 62-year-old Democrat from Meadowview, Virginia, who somewhat opposes tax credits to purchase an electric vehicle. That’s partly because he sees the electric vehicle manufacturing process as energy intensive and believes gasoline-powered vehicles have made improvements with the pollutants they emit.

The decline in favoring solar panel tax credits was across the board rather than being concentrated among Democrats.

“For solar panels, in all honesty, I don’t think they’re that efficient yet,” said Glenn Savage, 78, a left-leaning independent from Rock Hill, South Carolina. “I’d rather see them pour money into research and try to get the solar panels more efficient before they start giving tax breaks to the public. I may be wrong on that, but that’s just my thought.”

Scientists say transitioning to renewable energies and ditching fossil fuels that release planet-warming emissions are essential to protect the planet. Billions of dollars in project grants for clean technologies awarded during President Joe Biden’s Democratic administration have been canceled by the Trump administration, and the offshore wind sector has been stunted by Trump’s executive order that paused approvals, permits and loans for wind energy projects.

Fewer than half of U.S. adults, 44%, now say that offshore wind farms should be expanded in the U.S., down from 59% in 2022. About half favor expanding solar panel farms, while about two-thirds were in support in 2022.

When people are concerned about the economy and their personal finances, environmental issues are sometimes prioritized less, said Talbot Andrews, an assistant professor in the department of government at Cornell University who was not involved in the poll.

“I think it makes people anxious to think about increased taxes or increased spending on environmental issues when the cost of eggs are going through the roof,” Andrews said.

Trump has championed the expansion of offshore oil drilling, as well as domestic coal production.

Despite a decline in support for expanded renewable energies, the new poll shows that only about one-third of U.S. adults think offshore drilling for oil and natural gas should be expanded in the U.S., and only about one-quarter say this about coal mining.

In both cases, Republicans are much more likely than Democrats to support expanding these energy sources.

Trump has sought to open up national monuments for oil drilling, but more U.S. adults oppose than support auctioning off more public space for oil drilling. Only about one-quarter of U.S. adults favor this, while 4 in 10 are opposed. Republicans are much more likely than independents or Democrats to be in support.

The Energy Star program that certifies appliances, such as dishwashers and refrigerators, as energy efficient recently appeared in headlines when the EPA made plans to scrap the program. The blue and white logo is well recognized, and experts say the program has long had bipartisan support until recently.

The poll found three-quarters of Democrats support providing consumer rebates for efficient home appliances, compared with 6 in 10 Republicans.

Patrick Buck, 54, from Chicago, describes himself as a liberal Republican and is a fan of the consumer rebates for energy-efficient appliances. “It seems to work in terms of transforming what people have in their houses, because a lot of people have a lot of old appliances and just can’t afford new ones,” he said.

The poll found only about 2 in 10 U.S. adults are “extremely” or “very” confident in the federal government’s ability to ensure the safety of their drinking water, the air they breathe and the meat, poultry, fruits and vegetables they buy in grocery stores.

About 4 in 10 U.S. adults are “somewhat” confident in the federal government’s ability to ensure the safety of each of these, and about 4 in 10 are “not very” or “not at all” confident.

The Trump administration has announced plans to roll back rules and policies related to limiting pollution and greenhouse gas emissions, such as rules that limit pollution from power plants and blocking California’s efforts to phase out cars that run on gas. The federal government has also cut staff at the Food and Drug Administration, the federal agency tasked with protecting public health and ensuring food supply safety.

It’s the latest signal that nuclear energy could see a comeback in the US thanks to wide-ranging support from some strange bedfellows: the Trump administration purporting to seek “energy dominance”; tech companies in need of more electricity for AI data centers; and climate hawks on board with nuclear energy as a carbon pollution-free alternative to fossil fuels.

Nuclear energy could see a comeback in the US thanks to wide-ranging support from some strange bedfellows

“The use of advanced nuclear technology can provide the State with a greater diversity of its energy resources that will support New York’s goal of a growing economy with a reliable, zero-emission electricity system,” New York State Energy Research and Development Authority president and CEO Doreen Harris said in a press release.

Hochul is directing the New York Power Authority to construct at least one new site for nuclear energy upstate with the capacity to generate at least 1 gigawatt of electricity (about half the capacity of Hoover Dam power plant).

The state is interested in advanced reactors that are still under development, in the hopes of overcoming some of the obstacles the nuclear energy industry has faced over the years. After a boom in nuclear reactors built in the 1970s and ‘80s, the technology struggled to compete as gas-fired power plants and solar and wind farms became cheaper sources of electricity. Fears about nuclear accidents like the partial meltdown at Three Mile Island and conflicts over where to store radioactive waste have also bogged down the industry.

Next-generation designs for small modular reactors are supposed to cut down costs and make it easier to develop new sites for nuclear energy. President Donald Trump signed several executive orders last month to overhaul the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, speed up licensing for new reactors, and truncate environmental reviews. Trump’s pick to lead the Department of Energy, Chris Wright, previously sat on the board of a nuclear energy startup with OpenAI CEO Sam Altman.

The Vogtle power plant in Georgia has become an example of the kinds of problems that have plagued nuclear power projects; it’s the site of the first all-new reactors built in the US in more than three decades. After construction started in 2009, Vogtle units 3 and 4 finally came online in 2023 and 2024, roughly $17 billion over budget.

Now, the average age of a nuclear reactor in the US is 42 years old, with many retiring recently or scheduled to soon shutter. That trend is starting to reverse, with help from Big Tech and government incentives. Google and Amazon have both inked agreements to support the development of next-generation nuclear reactors. Meta signed a deal this month to help keep a reactor built in the 1980s alive for another 20 years. And Microsoft announced a power purchase agreement last year that’s supposed to lead to the restart of one reactor at Three Mile Island.",https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/06/gettyimages-1232609994.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&crop=0%2C10.727373918039%2C100%2C78.545252163922&w=1200,N,,2025-06-23 21:02:44.421392

The poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research finds that U.S. adults’ support for tax credits for electric vehicles and solar panels has weakened, as well as their enthusiasm for offshore wind farm expansion. While Democrats remain the strongest supporters of these initiatives, the poll reveals signs of growing cynicism within their ranks.

The poll results coincide with sweeping changes President Donald Trump's Republican administration is making to regulations related to energy and climate change, including slashing the federal workforce in these departments. And although Democrats and independents have weakened their support for some green energy initiatives, there has not been an increase in support for Trump's energy policies.

The poll found only about 4 in 10 U.S. adults — including only 1 in 10 Democrats and about 2 in 10 independents, along with three-quarters of Republicans — approve of the way Trump is handling climate change, which largely tracks with his overall approval rating.

Democrats and independents drive decline in support for renewable energy credits

About 6 in 10 Democrats, 58%, favor tax credits for purchasing an electric vehicle, down from about 7 in 10 in 2022. Among independents, support declined from 49% in 2022 to 28%. Only one-quarter of Republicans supported this policy in 2022, and that hasn’t changed measurably.

“As far as the pollution goes ... the vehicles nowadays put out very little emissions to the air,” said JD Johnson, a 62-year-old Democrat from Meadowview, Virginia, who somewhat opposes tax credits to purchase an electric vehicle. That's partly because he sees the electric vehicle manufacturing process as energy intensive and believes gasoline-powered vehicles have made improvements with the pollutants they emit.

The decline in favoring solar panel tax credits was across the board rather than being concentrated among Democrats.

“For solar panels, in all honesty, I don’t think they’re that efficient yet,” said Glenn Savage, 78, a left-leaning independent from Rock Hill, South Carolina. “I’d rather see them pour money into research and try to get the solar panels more efficient before they start giving tax breaks to the public. I may be wrong on that, but that’s just my thought.”

Scientists say transitioning to renewable energies and ditching fossil fuels that release planet-warming emissions are essential to protect the planet. Billions of dollars in project grants for clean technologies awarded during President Joe Biden's Democratic administration have been canceled by the Trump administration, and the offshore wind sector has been stunted by Trump’s executive order that paused approvals, permits and loans for wind energy projects.

Fewer than half of U.S. adults, 44%, now say that offshore wind farms should be expanded in the U.S., down from 59% in 2022. About half favor expanding solar panel farms, while about two-thirds were in support in 2022.

When people are concerned about the economy and their personal finances, environmental issues are sometimes prioritized less, said Talbot Andrews, an assistant professor in the department of government at Cornell University who was not involved in the poll.

“I think it makes people anxious to think about increased taxes or increased spending on environmental issues when the cost of eggs are going through the roof,” Andrews said.

Low support for Trump's efforts to expand offshore drilling and coal mining

Trump has championed the expansion of offshore oil drilling, as well as domestic coal production.

Despite a decline in support for expanded renewable energies, the new poll shows that only about one-third of U.S. adults think offshore drilling for oil and natural gas should be expanded in the U.S., and only about one-quarter say this about coal mining.

In both cases, Republicans are much more likely than Democrats to support expanding these energy sources.

Trump has sought to open up national monuments for oil drilling, but more U.S. adults oppose than support auctioning off more public space for oil drilling. Only about one-quarter of U.S. adults favor this, while 4 in 10 are opposed. Republicans are much more likely than independents or Democrats to be in support.

Bipartisan support for consumer

rebates and home appliance ratings

The Energy Star program that certifies appliances, such as dishwashers and refrigerators, as energy efficient recently appeared in headlines when the EPA made plans to scrap the program. The blue and white logo is well recognized, and experts say the program has long had bipartisan support until recently.

The poll found three-quarters of Democrats support providing consumer rebates for efficient home appliances, compared with 6 in 10 Republicans.

Patrick Buck, 54, from Chicago, describes himself as a liberal Republican and is a fan of the consumer rebates for energy-efficient appliances. “It seems to work in terms of transforming what people have in their houses, because a lot of people have a lot of old appliances and just can’t afford new ones,” he said.

Safe air, water, meat and produce

The poll found only about 2 in 10 U.S. adults are “extremely” or “very” confident in the federal government’s ability to ensure the safety of their drinking water, the air they breathe and the meat, poultry, fruits and vegetables they buy in grocery stores.

About 4 in 10 U.S. adults are “somewhat” confident in the federal government’s ability to ensure the safety of each of these, and about 4 in 10 are “not very” or “not at all” confident.

The Trump administration has announced plans to roll back rules and policies related to limiting pollution and greenhouse gas emissions, such as rules that limit pollution from power plants and blocking California’s efforts to phase out cars that run on gas. The federal government has also cut staff at the Food and Drug Administration, the federal agency tasked with protecting public health and ensuring food supply safety.

The AP-NORC poll of 1,158 adults was conducted June 5-9, using a sample drawn from NORC’s probability-based AmeriSpeak Panel, which is designed to be representative of the U.S. population.

Built around customer feedback, OctopusFlex is designed for total transparency. Customers can see exactly how and when they’re using electricity, what it’s costing them, and no connected devices are required. All they have to do is remember that electricity is cheaper from 10 pm to 6am.

“We’re thrilled to launch OctopusFlex, a plan our customers asked for and helped name,” said Katie Rosario, marketing manager. “With OctopusFlex, customers can shift energy use on their terms to save money.”

And in the summer, when solar power is strong and demand shifts, OctopusFlex customers could see low rates not just overnight, but all day long. (This program is designed for folks who don’t have solar and battery storage.)

“Time-of-use is one of the easiest ways to cut energy bills and reward flexibility,” said Daniel Kirwin, product manager. “We couldn’t be more excited to bring this to Texas.”

By nudging demand to off-peak hours, OctopusFlex helps reduce the strain on Texas’ grid during scorching summer afternoons, cuts the risk of blackouts, and makes room for more renewable energy.

“There is a tremendous amount of gas wells in the Permian to also drill—some deeper wells [and] some other areas more on the fringe,” Diamondback Energy’s Michael Sollee told Independent Petroleum Association of America (IPAA) members at their annual meeting recently.

But before the Permian’s operators can go after the basin’s gas-rich formations, the area’s producers need at least enough takeaway capacity to get the current volume of associated gas to market.

“In the Permian, we're seeing only about half of the price of natural gas at Henry Hub. … In certain months, it's negative. We're literally giving it away,” Sollee said.

Meanwhile, Permian drilling is driven by oil and its price alone. The associated gas is currently some 25 Bcf/d, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA).

“We estimate we could unlock 5 to 10 Bcf/d of gas out of the Permian if we had more pipe in the ground,” Sollee said.

Midland, Texas-based Diamondback produced some 500,000 bbl/d of oil and 1.1 Bcf/d of associated gas in the first quarter, all of it from the Permian Basin.

“There’s a huge opportunity for natural gas to be the next big investment,” Sollee said. “We have a ton of great rock in the United States. There's a lot in the Permian; there's a lot in the Haynesville; there's a lot in the Marcellus.

“As prices go up and demand goes up, it's going to be a boom for the industry.”

Atlantic Coast Pipeline ‘tragedy’

Sollee’s remarks were part of a panel discussion on U.S. electricity capacity, particularly to supply reliable power to data centers.

As for getting more Marcellus gas out of the Appalachian Basin to demand centers, Brett Vassey, president and CEO of the Virginia Manufacturers Association, said the eventual cancellation of the Atlantic Coast Pipeline project is “probably one of the greatest national fails.”

Dominion Energy and Duke Energy dropped the 600-mile, 1.5 Bcf/d joint project in 2020 after spending seven years trying to clear anti-hydrocarbon organizations’ challenges. Cost estimates grew to $8 billion.

Energy infrastructure has become “entirely politicized,” Vassey said.

Opponents “are outspending us by 20 to one in every state and nationally … and Virginia is a great example: A billion dollars in the ground for Atlantic Coast Pipeline and it's just rusting away.

“I mean that is a national tragedy.”

Nathan Ough, president and CEO of power management and generation operator VoltaGrid, noted former Google chief Eric Schmidt’s remarks concerning electric power and climate change in a recent media interview.

“He said, ‘Look, unleash the American energy machine and then let AI go solve the climate problem.’ He said it will do a better job than the version we're all doing today.”

Ryan Ullman, IPAA vice president, government relations and political affairs, said, “We don't need ‘drill, baby, drill’ so much as we need ‘build, baby, build.’”

The grid

Diamondback has been using some of its associated gas to power field operations.

“If we can get power to our developments, we get the lowest LOE [lease operating expense],” Sollee said.

West Texas is electron-short. “We spent a bunch of money on power generation because we can't be served by the [Texas] grid,” Sollee said. “As Permian Basin development just really exploded, the grid is not able to keep up.”

The Texas Legislature recently passed the Permian Basin Reliability Plan.

“It's supposed to get transmission assets and power into the basin so that we can continue to grow and to be served.

The approval marks another stage in what officials and industry believe will be a lucrative industry extracting the mineral from South Arkansas’ subterranean brine, thousands of feet below the surface. Lithium is an essential element in batteries that power electric vehicles, equipment and cell phones.

Saltwerx, a subsidiary of ExxonMobil, applied for the royalty last month, just days after the Arkansas Oil and Gas Commission approved an identical royalty for Standard Lithium and Equinor’s joint venture.

Arkansas Oil and Gas Commission approves first lithium royalty rate

Exxon’s newly-approved royalty rate — 2.5% — and the broader royalty payment structure are identical to Standard Lithium’s. Much of the language in the application itself was also identical.

The royalty applies only to the Pine Unit, a geographical area encompassing parts of Lafayette and Miller Counties.

“We’re pleased that Arkansas has taken an important first step to help kickstart the domestic lithium industry,” an ExxonMobil spokesperson said in an emailed statement. “While this is just the beginning and the road ahead is complex, this can open the door to new economic opportunities, including jobs, investment, and long-term growth for the region.”

This was its second royalty application.

Both Standard Lithium and ExxonMobil were two of the parties to the so-called “Big 5” royalty application that the commission unanimously shot down in November. The only difference between the November application, and the two applications the AOGC has now approved is the royalty rate. In the November application, it was 1.82%. In the two that have been approved this year, it is 2.5%.

The companies vying for the rights to the brines have said they plan to use a process called direct lithium extraction (DLE). The process would allow the companies to separate the lithium from the brine, which would eventually be turned into a variety of lithium products such as lithium carbonate or lithium hydroxide.

But before that extraction can begin, a royalty has to be paid to the owners of the mineral rights underlying the brine units. Se brine law says a royalty must be “fair and equitable,” and that a substance must be “profitably extracted” in order for a royalty to be paid. The commission determines if a company’s proposed royalty meets that bar.

As in last month’s Standard Lithium-Equinor royalty hearing, few people objected during Monday’s hearing to Exxon’s proposed royalty. A number of entities submitted letters of support — primarily business groups and local governments that stand to benefit from lithium extraction in the area.

A group of property owners and mineral rights holders, the South Arkansas Minerals Association, objected to Exxon’s royalty application, as it has for the three previous royalty applications that have gone before the commission.

Alan Perkins, attorney for the association, questioned the lack of financial information put forth by the company.

“It’s difficult to understand, for me, how we went from a hearing where we had a full feasibility study available and yet that wasn’t enough for the commission to make a decision, to where we are today, where we have a table with three or four lines and some very simple math,” Perkins said.

Arkansas Oil and Gas Commission receives ExxonMobil lithium royalty application

Exxon received a determination that it had the potential to profitably extract in April, when the regulator approved the formation of its Pine Unit — another requirement before a royalty can be determined. In November, commissioners said they had not received enough information to justify the 1.82% royalty rate, with one saying that the information they wanted would have to be provided during a unitization hearing anyway.

Six written objections, including the minerals association’s, were submitted to the commission prior to the hearing, according to the AOGC’s website.

Latwon Whitby of Forrest City, the only person to speak at the hearing other than Perkins, told commissioners it was “essential that our interests are protected.”

He told the Advocate his family has owned mineral rights in the Pine Unit’s area for generations. He expressed frustration that Exxon insisted their royalty was “fair and equitable,” despite not, in his view, providing any evidence to back it up.

“It seemed to me that they were just wanting to get a project up and running so that they won’t go to another state,” Whitby said after the commission voted to approve the royalty.

Prospective lithium extractors have raised the specter of taking their business to Texas or Louisiana on multiple occasions since last year, with Standard Lithium saying after the November hearing that Arkansas would lose its “first-mover advantage” if their royalty proposals weren’t given the green light.

“This decision reinforces the Commission’s commitment to fairness and consistency in Arkansas’s emerging lithium industry,” said Commission Chairman Jerry Langley in an emailed statement distributed by the Arkansas Department of Energy and Environment. “By aligning with the structure approved last month for production in new areas of the state, we’re creating a reliable and competitive foundation for growth in this vital sector.”",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/s3/files/styles/social_large/s3/articles/feeds-state-47649/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/img_3601-2-1024x7681750719646.jpg?h=ddb1ad0c&itok=NGFLFE6R,N,,2025-06-24 01:04:48.358135

A major clean energy and infrastructure project planned for California’s Central Valley could reduce electricity costs, create thousands of jobs, and breathe new life into fallowed agricultural land.

The Valley Clean Infrastructure Plan (VCIP), developed by Golden State Clean Energy, a Newport Beach-based renewable energy and infrastructure developer, in collaboration with the Westlands Water District, is a master-planned transmission and renewable energy project located in Fresno County.

The project aims to repurpose up to 130,000 acres of drainage-impaired and subsidence-prone agricultural lands for solar generation, energy storage, and high-voltage transmission infrastructure in western Fresno County—one of the most productive but water-challenged farming regions in the U.S.

According to the developer, the VCIP would generate 20 gigawatts of clean energy across the state, supported by new 500-kilovolt transmission lines and substations.

Once completed, the project could supply one-sixth of California’s electricity needs by 2025 and up to one-tenth by 2050.

The first phase is expected to be operational by 2030.

A recent independent study by 1898 & Co., a global business and technology consulting firm, estimated the VCIP could save California ratepayers $9 billion by 2050 —including $850 million annually in electricity savings — while delivering sustained economic benefits.

Energizing the economy and the land

Patrick Mealoy, partner and chief operating officer of Golden State Clean Energy, said building renewable generation and energy storage facilities in the heart of the state could help lower electricity costs statewide.

“We do believe this will provide a real economic benefit to all of Pacific Gas & Electric ratepayers,” he said.

The study also found that the project would ease transmission bottlenecks in Central California, enabling more efficient delivery of renewable energy.

The plan is expected to create roughly 6,000 construction jobs over 10 years and 1,200 permanent operations and maintenance jobs — about 80% of which are projected to be filled locally.

Mealoy said full buildout could take a decade, with the first projects potentially coming online in the late 2020s and construction continuing into the mid-2030s.

The developer is currently conducting a programmatic environmental impact review for permitting on 136,000 acres entirely within Westlands Water District.

Golden State Clean Energy began discussions with Westlands nearly four years ago about developing the project on district-owned, fallowed land. A memorandum of understanding was signed in late 2023, followed by a definitive agreement in early 2024.

Ag land transitions

Mealoy emphasized that much of the land being considered is no longer viable for traditional agriculture.

About half of the land permitted for the project is within Westlands Water District, primarily on drainage-impaired or subsidence-prone areas. The remaining land is owned by private landowners who have opted into the program through long-term lease agreements.

“A lot of the growers are looking at leasing, based upon the restrictions in surface water as well as the implementation of the Sustainable Groundwater Management Act, in order to make long-term investments for farming operations,” Mealoy said.

He added that in Westlands’ 615,000-acre footprint, discussions are ongoing about fallowing up to one-third or more of the land due to water constraints.

Private property owners who enter into 35-year surface easement agreements with the project will retain their water rights. Golden State Clean Energy has committed to bonding for the eventual removal of solar panels at the end of their useful life, allowing the land to potentially return to agricultural use in the future.

“Hopefully the area will find itself in a different water situation than today after the interim and can be used for producing food and fiber again,” Mealoy said.

Political and regulatory uncertainty

Despite the project’s long-term outlook, uncertainty looms over federal energy policy. While the Trump administration has made its opposition to offshore wind clear by halting leasing and permitting processes, its stance on solar energy remains murky.

Mealoy pointed to proposed federal legislation, nicknamed the “Big Beautiful Bill,” which could accelerate the repeal of renewable energy tax credits and impose new restrictions.

“That will be a burden on both the industry as well as ratepayers and customers,” he said. “Electricity demand is growing rapidly in California, in the West, across the entire country, and worldwide. We need to, as a state and as a nation, add as much electricity as we can.”

Historically, Southern California and Southern California Edison customers have paid lower energy prices than those in the northern part of the state, he noted.

He said building projects like the VCIP and improving transmission systems in Fresno County would enhance grid reliability and help balance electricity prices throughout the state.",https://thebusinessjournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/westlands-fund-1.jpg,N,,2025-06-23 20:05:46.269537

Over 20,000 clean energy workers have already been laid off, with an estimated 40,000 more at risk.
Clean energy projects—especially in wind, solar, and storage—are critical to meeting this demand affordably and sustainably.","The Trump Administration’s cuts to clean energy projects is already having significant economic consequences for American families, workers and the future of American high tech industries.

Donald Trump has long criticized clean energy subsidies as “expensive, unnecessary, and harmful to business,” but critics of this policy reversal claim the motivation is politics. Trump made a campaign promise to reverse Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act and he has been outspoken against the “Green New Deal.” Trump has also loudly claimed that the climate change is a hoax.

Trump and his followers have complained that supporting clean energy is government overreach. Meanwhile the administration has become a champion of the fossil fuel industry and is promising to bring back coal as a popular energy source.

However, by reversing key programs that supported energy efficiency and renewable power, the administration is setting the stage for higher electricity bills this summer, mass layoffs in a fast-growing job sector, and a weakened position for the U.S. in the global energy economy.

The Department of Energy (DOE) Secretary Chris Wright emphasized these cancellations reflect a “thorough and individualized financial review,” with funding now refocused toward initiatives of greater perceived value. The DOE has stated that many of the cancelled grants ""failed to advance the energy needs of the American people"" and were ""not economically viable.""

But Trump’s hostility toward clean energy could end the United States' position as a world leader in tech innovation. As the U.S. backs away from clean tech, other countries are surging ahead. China and India, in particular, are expanding their dominance in solar panel manufacturing and battery storage. With fewer incentives to produce green technology domestically, American manufacturing is losing ground just as global demand explodes.

Meanwhile Europe is pulling ahead with its own Green New Deal. Europe is widely recognized as a global leader in clean energy and its progress stems from a combination of aggressive policy targets, major public investment, technological innovation, and a broad political and public consensus on addressing climate change.

There are immediate impacts for American consumers as a result of the loss of federal incentives that help lower home energy costs. Programs like the Home Energy Rebate Program and subsidies for efficient appliances and solar panels were cut or suspended. These initiatives were expected to save families hundreds of dollars annually on electric bills and help them manage rising summer air conditioning costs. Without them, homeowners face higher utility bills just as extreme heat and energy demand surge.

The job losses are also steep. Over 20,000 clean energy workers have already been laid off, with an estimated 40,000 more at risk. Major wind, solar, hydrogen, and battery projects across the country have been paused or canceled—representing over $70 billion in lost investment. These were among the fastest-growing sectors in the U.S. economy and a critical path for middle-class job creation.

This shift also threatens the stability of the U.S. power grid. The rapid rise of artificial intelligence, data centers, and electric vehicles is placing unprecedented stress on electricity infrastructure. Clean energy projects—especially in wind, solar, and storage—are critical to meeting this demand affordably and sustainably. Without them, utilities may rely more on expensive fossil fuels, passing higher costs on to consumers.

Facts about roadless areas in the South:","ASHEVILLE, N.C. — Today, United States Secretary of Agriculture Brooke Rollins announced plans to roll back the Roadless Area Conservation Rule. The “Roadless Rule,” adopted in 2001, culminated a decades-long process to better protect the least-developed portions of our national forests from harmful roadbuilding and development. These areas are vitally important for wildlife, clean water, recreation, and old-growth forests, but this announcement puts them on the chopping block.

“Today’s announcement from USDA Secretary Rollins shows that this administration is completely out of touch with what Americans value in our public lands,” Sam Evans, who leads the Southern Environmental Law Center’s National Forests and Parks Program, said. “People in the Southeast and across the country want a place to get away from the noise and commotion of roads and development. The Roadless Rule promises that our least-developed public lands can be enjoyed by all of us for generations to come without the threat of reckless roadbuilding and other destructive projects. Getting rid of it will degrade popular recreation areas, imperil already-rare wildlife, and do long-lasting harm to our national forests as well as the communities and local economies that depend on them.”

The announcement criticizes the Roadless Rule as an “impediment” to protecting these areas from wildfire. However, the Roadless Rule already contains an exception for removing dangerous fuels—an exception that the Forest Service has been using extensively for years. Rescinding the Rule, however, would open these areas to mining, oil and gas development, and timber production.

Roadless protections are especially important in the southeastern United States, where much of our public land has already been fragmented by roadbuilding to extractive industry. The Roadless Rule ensures that backpackers, mountain bikers, climbers, and kayakers have a place to get away from roads, machinery, and noise. Repealing these key protections will lead to irreversible damage to these incredible landscapes.

However, the Senate provisions are mostly permanent while the House provisions are largely temporary; they have a similar cost on a permanent basis.
Other tax cuts in the Senate bill – including tax cuts for tipped income, overtime, auto loan interest, and factory investment – would add nearly $700 billion to the debt.
By comparison, the House tax policies would cost $5.2 trillion if made permanent, compared with $3.7 trillion as written.
Though the Joint Committee on Taxation's (JCT) score of the Senate Finance Committee’s section is revealing, it is not a complete picture of the Senate bill.","Last week, the Senate Finance Committee released its proposals for the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA) reconciliation package. The Committee claims its tax proposals would add $441 billion to the deficit through 2034. However, this estimate is reached by relying on an egregious budget gimmick they describe as “current policy”, whereby lawmakers tell the scorekeeper to assume existing tax policies are already extended (but that new policies will not be extended). On a current law basis, we estimate the Senate-proposed tax cuts would increase deficits by $4.2 trillion – nearly $500 billion above the House’s equivalent proposals. That figure would rise to $4.8 trillion if temporary tax cuts in the bill were ultimately made permanent.

The core of the Senate bill is an extension and expansion of the individual portions of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA), most of which expire at the end of this year. Although the Senate Finance Committee claims these changes would reduce revenue by $308 billion through 2034, they would actually increase deficits by $3.6 trillion – and that figure could go up after negotiations over SALT relief. The Senate’s extension of TCJA’s individual provisions is somewhat less expensive than the House’s $3.9 trillion – and there is an even bigger difference on a permanent basis ($3.6 versus $4.1 trillion), since the Senate includes permanent expansions of the Child Tax Credit and standard deduction and the House includes only temporary expansions.

Reviving business tax parameters in effect in 2021 – including 100 percent bonus depreciation for equipment and expensing for research – would reduce revenue by nearly $800 billion. This is roughly twice as much as claimed, and three times as much as in the House. However, the Senate provisions are mostly permanent while the House provisions are largely temporary; they have a similar cost on a permanent basis.

Other tax cuts in the Senate bill – including tax cuts for tipped income, overtime, auto loan interest, and factory investment – would add nearly $700 billion to the debt. That’s only marginally higher than the Senate claims or than the House proposals. Compared to the House, the Senate generally has more limitations on most of these tax breaks, though it increases the senior standard deduction by $6,000 per person instead of by $4,000.

On the revenue generating side, repealing and reforming credits from the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) would result in $537 billion of revenue, compared to the House’s $571 billion. Affordable Care Act (ACA) changes in the Senate bill would save $187 billion compared with $245 billion in the House bill. Restrictions to the charitable deduction are tougher in the Senate bill than the House bill, raising $81 billion (compared to $17 billion) by applying a floor to individual itemizers as well as businesses. But other major revenue raisers, including the excise tax on remittance payments, the increase in the tax on college endowments, and the foreign corporate retaliation tax all raise less in the Senate bill than in the House bill ($57 billion compared to $165 billion). The remaining revenue increasing provisions would raise $52 billion, compared to $109 billion in the House bill.

While the Senate enacts more of its policies on a permanent basis than the House, it still relies on a number of arbitrary expirations to reduce its official cost. If made permanent, the Senate’s tax section would cost over $4.8 trillion instead of $4.2 trillion as written. By comparison, the House tax policies would cost $5.2 trillion if made permanent, compared with $3.7 trillion as written.

Though the Joint Committee on Taxation's (JCT) score of the Senate Finance Committee’s section is revealing, it is not a complete picture of the Senate bill. JCT did not estimate the budget effect of Medicaid savings under the Finance title, for example, nor does it include spending cuts and increases from other Senate committees. Knowing how those provisions affect the deficit impact of the bill will be critical to understanding the overall deficit impact, as will full Congressional Budget Office (CBO) scores for other committee sections.

The Senate proposal would also mandate more frequent oil and gas lease sales and would repeal tax credits for buying electric vehicles.","As the Senate works this week to pass major legislation that would slash taxes, climate programs and government spending, Republicans are poised to include billions of dollars in benefits for the oil and gas industry.

The new oil-targeted tax changes would cost the federal government about $18 billion in lost revenue over a decade, according to an analysis released Saturday by Congress’ Joint Committee on Taxation. For comparison, a plan to end a tax credit for energy-efficient home improvements was projected to save about $21 billion over the same period.

Environmental groups said the proposal, included in draft language released last week by the Senate Finance Committee, subsidizes fossil fuel companies at the expense of the American people.

“This is a reckless expansion of Big Oil handouts paid for with cuts to the social safety net,” said Lukas Shankar-Ross, deputy director for climate and energy justice at Friends of the Earth Action, part of a coalition of advocacy groups called United to End Polluter Handouts. “It’s pretty straightforwardly monstrous.”

On Monday, the coalition announced a six-figure advertising campaign to pressure senators to oppose the tax incentives.

The office of Senate Finance Committee Chairman Mike Crapo (R-Idaho) did not immediately respond to a request for comment. But Crapo said in a statement last week that the committee’s draft would provide tax relief to middle-class families, extend “pro-growth provisions” and introduce “new incentives for domestic investment.” He added that the legislation “also achieves significant savings by slashing Green New Deal spending” and, he claimed, cutting waste.

Congressional Republicans are working to pass a sprawling bill to extend and expand tax cuts enacted in 2017 under reconciliation rules that would allow them to pass the Senate with a simple majority. The House of Representatives passed its version of the bill in May, including the near-complete repeal of the most consequential climate and renewable energy provisions of the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022. The House bill would also significantly cut spending for Medicaid and other social programs.

The initial Senate drafts kept most of those changes from the House and included additional benefits that oil companies have sought for years. The most significant would affect a tax incentive for carbon capture and storage.

Existing law provides a tax credit of $85 per ton for companies that remove carbon dioxide from smokestacks and pump it underground for permanent storage so it won’t warm the climate. Oil companies can also use that captured carbon dioxide to squeeze more crude out of depleted oil fields, and current law provides a tax credit of up to $60 per ton of carbon dioxide for this practice.

The Finance Committee’s proposal increases the value for this so-called “enhanced oil recovery” to match the higher $85 per ton figure.

Energy companies can currently reap an even higher credit, of up to $180 per ton of carbon dioxide, if the climate pollutant is pulled straight from the air. The legislation would similarly allow companies to qualify for the highest amount even if they used the captured greenhouse gas to pump more oil.

The Joint Committee estimated these changes would cost $14.2 billion over a decade.

The American Petroleum Institute did not reply to a request for comment, but its chief executive, Mike Sommers, praised the Senate draft in a statement last week: “This proposal strengthens key investment provisions and encourages oil and natural gas development to meet growing demand for affordable, reliable energy.”

The Senate’s move was a shift from the House version of the bill, which would have restricted companies’ ability to qualify for the carbon capture tax credit.

Some oil companies and trade groups pushed for years to equalize the value of the tax credit irrespective of whether it is used for oil production. One of the biggest beneficiaries could be Occidental Petroleum, which has extensive investments in enhanced oil recovery—depleted fields that can only produce when carbon dioxide is pumped into them. Occidental is building a project in West Texas that would remove carbon dioxide from the air and either store the gas underground or use it to produce oil.

ExxonMobil, which has positioned itself as a leader in carbon capture technology and which acquired a major enhanced oil recovery company in 2023, would also stand to benefit.

Neither Occidental nor Exxon immediately responded to requests for comment.

Another change would allow oil companies to deduct certain drilling expenses against the corporate alternative minimum tax, a provision of the Inflation Reduction Act that was meant to prevent companies reporting large profits from avoiding paying income tax. The change would lower the tax burden for oil companies that are subject to the minimum tax, primarily large, publicly traded independent oil companies, according to an analysis by United to End Polluter Handouts. The Joint Committee determined this change would cost $427 million over a decade.

A third measure would expand an existing tax break that benefits many pipeline companies. Legislation passed by the House has similar language to expand this benefit to include companies transporting hydrogen and carbon dioxide. The Senate language would expand it further to include companies involved in nuclear or geothermal energy, according to an analysis by the Bipartisan Policy Center. The cost for the change would total $3.2 billion over a decade, according to the Joint Committee.

The most recent Senate drafts also include other measures sought by the oil industry that were already in the House reconciliation bill, among them reductions in the royalty rates that drillers pay for oil and gas produced on public lands and in public waters. The Senate proposal would also mandate more frequent oil and gas lease sales and would repeal tax credits for buying electric vehicles.

The bill could still change as senators work to finalize it this week. Republicans face some significant disagreements, and it’s unclear whether House Republicans would support keeping the added tax breaks for oil and gas companies and the higher price tag they would bring.",https://insideclimatenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/GettyImages-2219152041-1024x683.jpg,N,,2025-06-23 19:06:40.032097

Budderfly maps building’s energy use and covers upgrade costs, like new HVAC systems or solar panel installations, to spur businesses to reduce their carbon footprints. Then its software monitors all of a building’s energy systems on one dashboard.

“It’s the difference between fragments and outcomes,” said Subbloie.

Budderfly’s core customers include restaurant chains, retail franchises and assisted living facilities. The company says it has helped customers avoid more than 220,000 million tons of CO2 emissions.

Funding milestone

Budderfly’s debt raises add to $500 million in equity, bringing its total funding to date to more than $1 billion. Given the challenging fundraising environment, Subbloie said, “it’s clear validation of the importance of energy efficiency in the built environment.”",http://impactalpha.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Budderfly.jpg,N,,2025-06-24 01:04:14.078181

Early Expiration Dates/Phase-Outs. As expected by many within the industry, tax credits relating to clean vehicles and energy efficient homes and commercial buildings would expire at the end of 2025, with limited exceptions. More surprising, the clean hydrogen production credit (IRC § 45V) also would expire for construction of facilities that begin after 2025. With respect to the clean electricity tax credits which took effect this year (IRC §§ 48E and 45Y), projects would need to start construction within 60 days of enactment of the Bill, and would have to be placed in service by December 31, 2028, in order to qualify for the tax credits. An exception is provided for qualified advanced nuclear facilities and, for purposes of IRC § 45Y, expansions of existing nuclear facilities, which would have until the end of 2028 to commence construction. In contrast, the clean fuel production credit (IRC § 45Z) would receive an extension from December 31, 2027, to December 31, 2031, but with a new requirement that feedstocks must be sourced from the United States, Canada or Mexico.

Cash Transfer Elections. The IRA enacted IRC § 6418, which allows taxpayers to sell certain renewable energy tax credits solely for cash consideration, subject to compliance with registration and record-keeping requirements. The new provision enabled flexibility for the monetization of tax credits that potentially could not be fully utilized by the developers of renewable energy projects, generating capital to support the financing of such projects. The House Bill, however, puts an end to transferability for various renewable energy tax credits, generally after 2027.

FEOC Restrictions. Under the House Bill, prohibitions are imposed that effectively deny the ability to claim renewable energy tax credits if a taxpayer is a “specified foreign entity” (SPE) or “foreign influenced entity” (“FIE” and, together with an SPE, a “prohibited foreign entity”) or, in some cases, receives material assistance from prohibited foreign entities. Very generally, a SPE includes a FEOC or other entity or person with ties to Russia, China, Iran and North Korea. A FIE generally includes (i) an entity in which SPEs hold significant ownership interests or possess the ability to appoint directors or key executives or (ii) an entity that made certain sizable payments to SPEs during the previous taxable year. For purposes of these FEOC restrictions, “material assistance” would include the extraction, recycling, processing, manufacturing or assembly of a component, subcomponent or critical mineral in one of the designated foreign countries, or reliance on intellectual property, know-how or trade secrets originating from such countries.

A table summarizing these changes as relates to the key renewable energy tax credits is set forth below (click here to view the full table).

SUMMARY OF SFC BILL

The SFC version of the BBB departs from the House Bill with respect to the expiration dates and phase-outs for certain tax credits, restores the ability to transfer tax credits for cash consideration and provides additional guidance with respect to the FEOC restriction on material assistance from prohibited foreign entities.

Early Expiration Dates/Phase-Outs. The SFC Bill similarly puts an early end to tax credits relating to clean vehicles and energy efficient homes and commercial buildings, but with expiration occurring a number of days or months following enactment of the Bill. The SFC Bill also retains the early expiration of the clean hydrogen production credit (IRC § 45V). The clean electricity tax credits (IRC §§ 48E and 45Y), however, would receive a reprieve under the SFC Bill, except that wind and solar projects would be subject to significant phase-outs for construction that starts in 2026 and later years. The advanced manufacturing production credit under IRC section 45X for applicable critical minerals, which currently does not expire, would begin to phase out after 2030.

Cash Transfer Elections. The SFC Bill generally follows current law with respect to the ability to sell renewable energy tax credits for cash consideration. A limitation is imposed, however, under which credits cannot be transferred to SPEs.

FEOC Restrictions. The SFC Bill retains FEOC restrictions that largely are consistent with the House Bill, but with additional guidance with respect to the material assistance limitation and other matters. In particular, whether or not a taxpayer has received material assistance from a prohibited foreign entity would be determined by calculating the “material assistance cost ratio” for the credit eligible property, with the tax credit being denied if the ratio falls below a threshold percentage that increases over time. In this regard, the material assistance cost ratio generally would be calculated as (i) the total costs for the credit eligible property reduced by costs attributable to the mining, production or manufacturing by a prohibited foreign entity, (ii) divided by the total costs for the credit eligible property. Treasury, in consultation with the Department of Energy (DOE), is directed to issue safe harbor tables for purposes of the material assistance determination not later than December 31, 2026. Additionally, an extended six-year statute of limitations is provided for deficiencies related to the material assistance determination.

Other. Notably, the SFC Bill also includes a provision that would deny five-year Modified Accelerated Cost Recovery System (MACRS) depreciation for facilities and energy storage technologies claiming the clean electricity tax credits under IRC §§ 48E or 45Y. MACRS has previously allowed taxpayers to condense depreciation of capital expenditures for certain projects from 15 years down to just five years. This elimination will impact any large-scale-capital-intensive project. For example, the DOE had previously calculated that MACRS for a new AP1000 resulted in a 6 percent reduction to the levelized cost of electricity for the project.",https://www.pillsburylaw.com/a/web/bJnY325YfaLVReU2jou3gN/atk81g/bJnY325YfaLVReU2jou3gN.jpg,N,,2025-06-23 19:07:45.844297

They don't run on dreams,” Hochul said at the Robert Moses Niagara Power Plant in Lewiston, Niagara County.
The Indian Point nuclear power plant in Westchester County was closed in 2021 out of concern that it was contaminating the Hudson River.
Indian Point is one of three nuclear power reactors that have been shut down in New York, while four continue operating at upstate sites in Oswego and Wayne Counties.
State Sen. Liz Krueger, who heads the State Senate Finance Committee, said she has more questions than answers about the safety and feasibility of building a new nuclear power plant.","New York plans to build a nuclear power plant in the upstate region, becoming the first state to pursue a major new facility in more than 15 years.

Gov. Kathy Hochul made the announcement Monday — one month to the day after President Donald Trump signed a series of executive orders intent on reviving the country’s nuclear-energy capabilities.

“The country is talking about semiconductor manufacturing. Well, you know what? They don't run on dreams,” Hochul said at the Robert Moses Niagara Power Plant in Lewiston, Niagara County. “They need to be powered. They need a lot of electricity.”

Hochul said she was working with the White House to accelerate a development that would add at least 1 gigawatt of nuclear-powered energy — enough to support about 1 million homes. She said the added capacity also is needed to sustain semiconductor and artificial intelligence facilities that are setting up shop in New York.

“We must embrace an energy policy of abundance that centers on energy independence and supply chain security to ensure New York controls its energy future,” Hochul said, also casting the project as a means to address affordability.

“Ratepayers must know there is reliability,” Hochul said. “They must be able to see in the future and know what their bills will be.”

Hochul directed the New York Power Authority — which was established by then-Gov. Franklin D. Roosevelt almost a century ago — to find a site in upstate New York and propose a design for the plant. The state later clarified that the goal is “to develop at least one new nuclear energy facility ... either alone or in partnership with private entities.”

For decades, the nuclear industry in the U.S. has been near-dormant beyond the currently 94 commercial nuclear reactors that powers of tens of millions of homes, according to the Nuclear Energy Institute. Nuclear plants produce about 20% of the country’s electricity. Recent years have seen a number of plants shut down out of safety concerns, exorbitant maintenance costs and prohibitive renovation expenses.

But expanding the country’s nuclear energy capabilities – first in New York – is one place where Trump and Hochul have seem to have found common ground. Trump signed executive orders in May with the intention to quadruple domestic production of nuclear power — adding 300 gigawatts of new capacity by 2050. “It’s time for nuclear, and we’re going to do it very big,” Trump said at the Oval Office signing of the orders.

Much of their conversation, Hochul said, has been about expanding energy resources in the country. She and the president negotiated to lift his stop-work order on an offshore wind project, and discussed resuming two natural gas pipeline projects that the state had previously shelved.

“I’ve had some very frank, interesting conversations with the President, all kinds of topics,” she said. “But every single one of them, I’ve brought it back to nuclear. … So I said to the President, ‘If you want energy dominance, I want energy dominance. This is how we do it.’”

The governor’s announcement already is getting pushback. Expanding nuclear energy in New York would be an “extremely expensive” pursuit that also poses “real, serious environmental (and) health risks,” said Anne Rabe, a coordinator for Don’t Waste New York and former senior advisor for the New York Public Interest Research Group.

“It’s a horrifically irresponsible pursuit of a technology that creates long-lived deadly radioactive waste,” said Rabe, who organized to stop then-Gov. Mario Cuomo from opening the West Valley Demonstration Project a nuclear fuel processing facility in the late 1980s.

New York ratepayers are paying about $500 million annually to cover costs for maintenance of the nuclear reactors in the state, Rabe said.

The Indian Point nuclear power plant in Westchester County was closed in 2021 out of concern that it was contaminating the Hudson River. Indian Point is one of three nuclear power reactors that have been shut down in New York, while four continue operating at upstate sites in Oswego and Wayne Counties.

State Sen. Liz Krueger, who heads the State Senate Finance Committee, said she has more questions than answers about the safety and feasibility of building a new nuclear power plant.

“This is a question of: Is it safe? Is it cost efficient? Can it be built in our lifetime and are we going to make sure the communities have full disclosure and full rights to say, ‘Not here’?” said Krueger, an influential state politician from Manhattan.

Krueger said the recent closing of Indian Point makes her doubtful that the state has proper locations to store radioactive waste.

“That said, I keep an open mind to the future, where maybe someday there will be a way to build safe nuclear plants that are completely different than the ones we have,” she said. “But so far, there are no real-world examples of this new nuclear development that can answer all the questions we, New Yorkers, should have before we move forward.”

State Republicans, including Assembly Minority Leader Will Barclay, called the announcement from Hochul a “positive step forward.”

“As a longtime advocate for nuclear energy — especially with existing plants in Oswego County — I know the critical role it has played for decades as a clean, reliable source of power for New Yorkers,” he wrote in a statement. “Too often overlooked in the debate over the environment, nuclear energy remains one of the most efficient and low-emission energy sources available to meet the state’s electricity demands.”

Several Republicans have begun vying to have the plant be located in their districts.

Barclay, who represents Fulton, Oswego and surrounding areas, said Oswego — located on the shores of Lake Ontario — would be the “ideal” site for a new facility. State Sen. Jake Ashby, R-Rensselaer County, near Albany, said the plant is suited to be in his district, where universities such as the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute are “producing workers with precisely the technical skills required to take full advantage of this generational opportunity.”

State Sen. George Borrello, a Republican who represents Dunkirk, another Lake Ontario shoreline community, said the state could convert the NRG power plant in the town into a new nuclear power plant.",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/04bb2f9/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6000x3150+0+425/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F1d%2Fe6%2Fb7204c6b486f97c4bbcbe5c8052e%2F54608133277-2ea168bc74-o.jpg,N,,2025-06-23 19:06:44.385805

If oil tankers begin avoiding the Strait, which 20% of the world’s oil and natural gas travels through, prices could rise, benefiting Texas producers.
Oil prices drop after Iran launches missiles Oil prices dropped Monday afternoon, after Iran launched missiles at a U.S. military base in Qatar.
Ed Hirs, an energy fellow and economics lecturer at the University of Houston, said the market has shown the conflict is a “non-event” for Texas’ energy industry.
Dorraj said the U.S.’s recent actions show some in the Trump administration are not seeking to de-escalate the conflict.","The impacts an emerging Middle East conflict could have on the domestic energy market are increasingly uncertain, as the United States becomes further enmeshed in the clash, experts said Monday.

The U.S. bombed Iran’s nuclear sites on Saturday. The move came days after Israel attacked Iran while the country was exploring a possible nuclear deal with the U.S. Iran is now considering closing the Strait of Hormuz, a key artery for energy transportation between the Persian Gulf and Gulf of Oman.

Experts say the crisis may have a muted effect on Texas oil producers, though that could change if it becomes a protracted conflict.

F. Gregory Gause, professor emeritus of international affairs at Texas A&M University’s Bush School of Government and Public Service, doesn’t believe Iran has the naval capability to close the Strait of Hormuz. If oil tankers begin avoiding the Strait, which 20% of the world’s oil and natural gas travels through, prices could rise, benefiting Texas producers.

Gause said consumers won’t see a change in prices at the pump, but that could change if the conflict continues.

“I think that the bottom line for an American consumer is that this war in the Middle East, including the American involvement in it, has a chance to really disrupt oil production in the Middle East,” Gause said.

Oil prices drop after Iran launches missiles

Oil prices dropped Monday afternoon, after Iran launched missiles at a U.S. military base in Qatar. Oil was trading at about $67 a barrel at 4 p.m. on Monday, down from about $74 per barrel on Friday.

Ed Hirs, an energy fellow and economics lecturer at the University of Houston, said the market has shown the conflict is a “non-event” for Texas’ energy industry. So far, the conflict hasn’t generated a price increase that would justify investing the capital to drill new wells. Hirs said the current fundamentals of the energy market argue for a crude oil price between $50 and $55 per barrel.

Oil prices have dropped from roughly $78 per barrel to $67 since President Donald Trump’s inauguration in January. Respondents to the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas’ most recent energy survey said they anticipate West Texas Intermediate oil prices to be about $68 a barrel by the end of this year.

Prices as low as $57 a barrel were seen in April, sparking concerns about the domestic energy industry’s ability to grow. Oil prices need to hover around $65 a barrel for energy producers to profitably drill new wells, according to another Dallas Fed survey. Texas produces 42% of the country’s crude oil.

Todd Staples, president of the Texas Oil and Gas Association, said Monday’s decline in prices proves energy security and national security are linked (a sentiment long echoed by the defense and energy industries). He said the energy industry is hoping the conflict resolves and trade relations return to normal.

“Certainty is paramount,” Staples said.

The U.S. isn’t immune to shifts in the global energy market, Staples said, but as one of the world’s top oil producers, the country is somewhat insulated.

“I think with the position that Texas is in we are able to continue to deliver,” Staples said. “I think you’ll need to have some longer trends in terms of this Israel and Iran war today to determine if that will have a long-term impact on production, but we have the capability from both the resources and we have the capabilities from the pipeline system and refining to expand if the market conditions indicate that it should for long-term purposes.”

Manocherh Dorraj, a professor of political science at TCU, said Texas energy producers could benefit in the short term if prices rise, but an increased cost of production in the long term could have negative impacts. Oil may be used as a political tool, Dorraj said.

Dorraj said if Iran decides to close the Strait of Hormuz, there would be a major inflationary impact on the global energy market and prices could soar as high as $130 a barrel.

“It has always been one of the last trump cards in the Iranian arsenal, they have never done it before,” Dorraj said.

Dorraj said the U.S.’s recent actions show some in the Trump administration are not seeking to de-escalate the conflict. The Trump administration was aware of Israel’s plans to attack Iran, and the U.S. bombed Iran’s nuclear sites on Saturday.

“Trump started the war of choice with Iran, he didn’t have to do what he did,” Dorraj said.",https://www.star-telegram.com/latest-news/awpxtd/picture273757995/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1140/BIZ%20USECONOMY-OIL%20SD.JPG,N,,2025-06-23 20:06:04.799198

Protecting clean energy tax credits would build Virginia’s economy and help us compete with China.
We don’t have any Republican senators in Virginia, so we can’t ask their help in moving Republican Senate leadership on clean energy tax credits.","The U.S. House recently passed a budget bill that includes the near total repeal of all support for clean energy. For Virginia, this approach would increase energy costs, increase air pollution, accelerate climate change and decrease economic investments.

Federal tax credits — designed to boost clean energy manufacturing in the U.S. — have been getting good results in parts of Virginia. Since the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) in 2022, Rep. Jen Kiggans’ district in the Hampton Roads region has seen an estimated 3,000 new jobs, mostly related to offshore wind. Rep. John McGuire’s district in western Virginia has seen more than 5,000 jobs from solar, energy storage and clean tech manufacturing.

The tax credits were passed by Democrats, making them a tempting target for Republican repeal. But the legislation has overwhelmingly benefited Republican-held districts, including the two districts listed above.

If the cuts become law, energy prices will rise. Rolling back these tax credits means Virginia ratepayers will face electricity prices that are 9% higher in the coming years. Virginia’s unique status as the state with the highest expected expansion of AI data centers is also likely to raise electricity rates far beyond what neighboring states will see in coming years, due to increases in demand. The clean energy tax credits would be a stabilizing factor in those prices.

The data center explosion in Virginia will require a massive supply of additional electricity. If the demand can’t be met from a weakened clean energy sector, then a new generation of fossil fuel infrastructure will be constructed, beginning with the Dutch Gap methane plant a few miles from my home in Chesterfield County. This methane infrastructure will cost billions to build, and more billions to fuel over the coming decades. It will release many millions of tons of carbon dioxide greenhouse gas, along with other chemicals that are much more damaging to human lungs.

Quickly eliminating the tax credits that support clean energy manufacturing will jeopardize long-term projects such as the planned nuclear fusion electricity plant in Chesterfield County, as well as expected additional Virginia offshore wind projects under future presidents. (President Donald Trump has promised to sign no offshore wind permits while in office.) Manufacturers may rethink the energy storage projects they are considering to extend the benefits of cheap solar power into the nighttime. Business craves predictability above all. Abandoning incentives for clean energy manufacturing would destroy this predictability, potentially leading to stranded costs for businesses.

Protecting clean energy tax credits would build Virginia’s economy and help us compete with China. Analysis by American Clean Power and ICF estimates that continuing clean energy incentives will add $15 billion in income and support 24,000 new full-time jobs in Virginia per year through 2035. The hope behind the federal tariffs is that they would produce U.S. jobs 10 years from now. Well, the clean energy tax credits are producing new jobs today.

Kiggans and a group of more than 20 Republican colleagues argued for allowing the budget to extend the clean energy tax credits, but were outvoted. Four Republican senators sent a letter to leadership in April saying repeal would “lead to significant disruptions for the American people and weaken our position as a global energy leader.”

Killing the clean energy tax credits is supposedly to reduce the deficit, yet the House budget expands federal deficits. We must admit that growing federal deficits and carbon emissions both inflict unbearable burdens on our grandchildren. If we don’t like any of the solutions to these two real problems, then suggest something. Silence won’t fix either one.

We don’t have any Republican senators in Virginia, so we can’t ask their help in moving Republican Senate leadership on clean energy tax credits. Sens. Mark Warner and Tim Kaine, please work with your colleagues on both sides of the aisle to get us a better budget than the one that the House sent you.

Kathy Hochul said on Monday.

Ms. Hochul said the plant, which would produce half as much power as the Indian Point complex north of New York City that was shut down four years ago, would help avert the “rolling blackouts” that have plagued some other states. She did not say how much the project would cost or how long it would take to complete but said that New York would seek investment from the private sector.

The governor said that safety would be “at the forefront” of the state’s planning and that the new plant would meet rigorous environmental standards.

“This is not your grandparents’ nuclear reactor. You’re not going to see this in a movie starring Jane Fonda,” she said, referring to “China Syndrome,” the 1979 movie about a nuclear meltdown.

Nuclear power has enjoyed a resurgence of interest from states and companies in recent years, in part because the plants don’t produce the greenhouse gases that are rapidly heating the planet, and they can run at all hours, unlike wind and solar power.

Tech giants like Amazon, Google and Microsoft have begun investing in nuclear power to help meet soaring electricity demand from their A.I. data centers. States like Illinois, Montana and Wisconsin have lifted longstanding bans on the construction of new nuclear plants. Texas this month approved a $350 million fund to build new reactors.

That’s a sharp turnaround from a decade ago, when New York, Michigan, Pennsylvania and California were beginning to retire their older reactors, a move that many lawmakers now say was a mistake.

In 2021, Indian Point, a two-gigawatt nuclear plant in Westchester County, shut down under pressure from then-Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, who said that having the plant close to a large population center defied “basic sanity.” The plant’s shutdown meant that New York had to burn more fossil fuels like natural gas for electricity, and the state’s grid operator has postponed plans to close some of its older gas-burning plants in order to avoid blackouts.

While efforts are currently underway to restart previously closed plants in Michigan and Pennsylvania, experts say that Indian Point is very likely to be too far along in the process of being dismantled to reopen.

Ms. Hochul, who was lieutenant governor at the time Indian Point shut down, has since criticized Mr. Cuomo for not having a sustainable “Plan B” for replacing the plant’s output, which amounted to as much as 25 percent of the electricity consumed by New York City.

She said that in recent meetings with President Trump, she had pressed him to make the federal Nuclear Regulatory Commission more efficient so that permits for a new plant could be obtained in less than 10 years.

Last month, Mr. Trump signed a series of executive orders aimed at speeding up the development of new nuclear power plants by ordering the commission, the nation’s independent nuclear safety regulator, to ease the process for approving new plants.

New York still derives about one-fifth of its electricity from three nuclear plants operated by Constellation Energy on the south shore of Lake Ontario. In January, Constellation and the New York State Research and Development Authority sought federal funding for their effort to obtain permits for one or more advanced reactors at the Nine Mile Point Clean Energy Center in Oswego.

The New York Power Authority, the state-owned utility, will manage the project that the governor announced Monday. Ms. Hochul said that the state had already begun identifying potential “host communities” for the new plant, but did not provide any names. “Everybody’s raising their hand right now,” she said. “It’s going to be hard to decide.”

Only three new reactors have come online in the United States in the last 30 years, and many utilities have been deterred by the high price tag. The two most recent reactors built in Georgia cost $35 billion, double the initial estimates. While some companies hope that a new generation of smaller reactors could prove cheaper to build, they remain unproven.

Randy Wolken, chief executive of the Manufacturers Association of Central New York, said Ms. Hochul’s announcement would be “a pivot point for the future” of manufacturing in the state. He cited Micron Technology’s plan to build computer-chip factories near Syracuse as one of several developments that will require significant amounts of emissions-free energy.

The effort to build new nuclear power plants is likely to face opposition from some environmental groups, who would prefer that the state focus on building wind and solar power and who dismiss nuclear power as too costly.

The power authority “should be laser focused on rapidly scaling up their build-out of affordable solar and wind which is the only way to meet the state’s science-based climate goals and lower energy bills,” said the Public Power NY coalition, which is made up of advocacy groups that have pushed the state to build publicly owned renewable energy.

State Senator Liz Krueger, a Democrat, raised a number of concerns about Governor Hochul’s plan in a statement. “Is it the most cost-effective use of our clean energy dollars,” she asked. “Can the radioactive material be disposed of in a satisfactory way?”

“I have yet to see any real-world examples of new nuclear development for which all of these questions can be answered in the affirmative, and I am skeptical that I ever will,” Ms. Krueger wrote.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/06/23/nyregion/23met-power-plant/23met-power-plant-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-06-23 19:07:00.869330

VERNON, Texas (KETK) – Oil giant Halliburton has been awarded a contract to plan and design a geothermally-powered lithium mining project in Mt.

Halliburton, a company with more than 100 years of expertise in drilling wells, will work with GeoFrame Energy during the drilling, construction, design and operation phases of their first demonstration wells before the companies expand to “full field development.”

According to GeoFrame, they plan to drill 83,500 metric tons of battery-grade lithium carbonate per year by early 2029. GeoFrame said they control about 7,400 acres of East Texas land, which contains some of the highest concentrations of lithium in deep oil-field brines in the world.

Mayor of Mt. Vernon, Brad Hyman, said the city is proud to be a part of this new development.

“GeoFrame Energy’s commitment to Mt.

North Attleborough has been informed that the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency will conduct an approximately $4 million cleanup of surface debris from last year’s demolition of the vacant Webster Mill.

The mill property, located on Broadway, is a former silversmith factory that operated from the 1890s through the 1970s. The mill was demolished last March following a roof collapse.

“This is all really good; we’ve been talking about this for six months now, but when the EPA came to me last week and said ‘this is a go, it finally got funded,’ that was a really big deal for us,” said Assistant Town Manager Antonio Morabito on having an outside agency not only fund the cleanup, but also execute it.

According to an approved action memorandum sent to town officials, the total project cost will be $4,098,258. The EPA deemed that a “time-critical removal action be performed” due to the high levels of asbestos found at the property through a 2015 hazardous materials survey completed by Loureiro Engineering Associates, Inc.

“Hazardous substances, specifically asbestos-containing waste building debris present at the site, if not addressed. . . will continue to pose a threat to human health and the environment,” reads the emailed statement.

The Webster Mill cleanup is a four-phase project, something Morabito equated to a 4-D game of chess. Demolition was the first step, which happened back in March 2024 when a previously collapsed roof put pressure onto a wall, causing the building to bow inward and pose a risk of collapsing into the street. After the owners, Webster Mill LLC cited an inability to pay for the repairs, the town was able to execute an emergency demolition order and take down the portion of the building deemed an imminent threat to residents.

A tax lien complaint was filed by the town against Webster Mill, LLC on March 3 in Bristol County Land Court, asking the court to foreclose on the defendants’ rights to redeem the property and thus grant ownership to North Attleborough. A Nov. 7, 2023, instrument of taking filed by Town Treasurer and Collector Christopher Sweet shows unpaid taxes in the amount of $1,812.62.

According to the Assessors Office’s online database Vision Government Solutions, the building and 1.64 acres of land it sits on is assessed and appraised at $363,900. Webster Mill LLC is listed as the owner, with Anthony Joseph of 417 Central Ave., Johnston, Rhode Island, as the co-owner. John Jacobi, an attorney at Coogan Smith LLP, representing the Webster Mill LLC did not want to comment at this time.

The surface cleanup will also include the demolition of the last two remaining standing structures on the property: the chimney at the back right portion of the property, and a one-story cinderblock building that sits next to the paved parking area.

To Morabito, one of the most important parts of this partnership with the EPA is that it is running the surface cleanup in its entirety.

“They’re running the project, not us,” said Morabito. “It’s not like they’re just giving us the money. They’re the ones doing it.”

Decontamination of the soil, which is phase three of the project, is not included in the $4 million surface cleanup. However, according to Morabito, the town has a revolving loan fund from the EPA that it can use to lend to itself, and there’s also the possibility that the EPA will continue funding the remainder of the project.

Verdantas, a qualified engineer professional, has been hired to test the soil to figure out precisely what chemicals have been left behind by the former silver manufacturer, and come back with an estimate to remove it.

Site history

According to North Attleborough’s Historic Commission, G.K. Webster & Co. was founded by George K. Webster in 1869 and produced sterling silver, which included products such as flatware, napkin rings, candlesticks and thimbles.

The company’s sterling silver can still be found today and is identified by the Webster hallmark: the letter W with a feathered arrow flying through its center.

Jo Anne Kittrell, the press officer for EPA Region One of New England, told the North Star Reporter on Monday afternoon that cleanup is expected to begin later this summer. Kittrell also noted that the EPA always works to first see if there is a responsible party at cleanup sites, and work is funded by the agency while that research is conducted.

The final phase of the project is development, something Morabito voiced excitement about. To Morabito, the proximity to nearby schools, High Street athletic fields and the downtown area makes the possibilities endless for what this area could be turned into, and what further revitalization efforts it could spark in this area of North Attleborough.

“This is a great piece of property—wouldn’t it be great if this could be re-developed into something?” said Morabito. “This is a great part of the town.”

Cole Hastings, the on-scene coordinator for the EPA’s Region One emergency response and removal team, will be the lead on the project and is meeting with the town on Tuesday, June 24, to do a walkthrough of the site and plan next steps. A public forum will be scheduled in the future as well, where residents can ask questions and the safety measures in place will be explained.",https://northstarreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/phoNAmillrats_040424.jpg,N,,2025-06-23 19:07:12.342501

This appropriation includes $100 million for oil and gas well plugging to be used by the RRC’s renowned State Managed Plugging Program (SMP) to address critical plugging projects. This is the largest one-time infusion of funds from the Legislature to support the SMP, which has plugged more than 46,000 wells since its inception in 1984, a news release said.

The $100 million approved by lawmakers will help address the high number of emergency well pluggings across the state where immediate action is required. These emergency wells are often more expensive and technically challenging than other plugging projects. In addition to emergency pluggings, a portion of the funding will be earmarked to plug non-emergency high priority wells, such as those in Hydrogen Sulfide fields, as well as offshore wells. Plugging these wells as a preventative measure helps mitigate any potential risks before they escalate into an emergency.

The Legislature also addressed other funding needs at the RRC, signing off on support to multiple modernization initiatives to improve the efficiency of the RRC. This includes investments of more than $16.7 million into data reporting systems to track produced water, authorized pits registrations and oversight and safety regulatory filing and permitting. More than $2 million was also allocated for upgrades to the agency’s GIS Cloud systems.

The RRC will also receive $1.3 million to establish an Underground Injection Well Investigation Team to help ensure injected fluids remain confined to the disposal formations and safeguard ground and surface fresh water. This team will supplement the RRC’s ongoing measures to mitigate seismicity and protect residents in areas including West Texas.

“The significant investment made by the Texas Legislature over the next biennium provides the Commission with the necessary resources to ensure that Texas energy is produced safely and efficiently,” RRC Chairman Jim Wright said in the release. “The development of our natural resources plays a vital role in our state’s economy, and I thank the Legislature for their continued commitment to the Railroad Commission to carry out our important mission.”

“This funding is critical toward the Railroad Commission’s goals to reduce the number of orphan wells across the state, improve and modernize agency technology and promote transparency and efficiency within the industry,” said RRC Commissioner Christi Craddick. “I deeply appreciate the Legislature’s support of our important mission to regulate responsibly while continuing to keep Texas’ energy industry and economy thriving.”

“The Railroad Commission of Texas is one of the world’s most respected regulatory agencies for oil and gas production, and this funding serves to further that mission,” said RRC Commissioner Wayne Christian. “The industry generates so much in tax revenues for Texas, that for every $1 appropriated by the Legislature to the Commission the industry returns $47 – talk about a return for the taxpayer! I want to congratulate Commissioner Craddick and the Commission staff for all their hard work this session on the agency’s budget and thank all the legislators and staff for efforts to make Texas the nation’s powerhouse for oil and gas.”

Their message to lawmakers was clear: This bill is critical to the future of our economy — and the time to act is now.

AFP activists from more than a dozen states participated in 135 meetings in just one day, speaking with key lawmakers like Sen. John Barrasso of Wyoming, the Senate majority whip, and House Speaker Mike Johnson.

“This is the most consequential policy battle of this Congress,” said Tyler Lindholm, AFP-Wyoming state director, pictured above with Sen. Barrasso (center) and AFP Senior Government Affairs Liaison Will Burger (right). “And we’re making sure lawmakers know their constituents are behind this effort.”

What lawmakers are hearing from AFP

In meetings across Capitol Hill, AFP’s team focused on several key messages:

The tax cuts must be made permanent to fuel long-term growth.

This bill is about more than taxes — it also addresses affordable American energy, revitalizing our health care system, and addressing border security.

Delaying action could cost Congress support before the 2026 midterms — handing progressives the narrative they need to retake Congress.

Making sure Congress knows what’s at stake for families, businesses, and the economy.

Our team spoke with key senators, including Senate Majority Leader John Thune and Sen. Lisa Murkowski, to explain how the bill fits into national priorities. Pictured below are our state activists with Sens. Thune and Murkowski.

Why making the 2017 tax cuts permanent matters

Here’s what’s at stake if Congress fails to act:

Higher taxes and smaller paychecks for families and small businesses

Slower job growth as businesses deal with higher rates

Less capital for local investments and innovation

Greater economic uncertainty in an already volatile climate

More centralized power in Washington

What makes AFP’s strategy unique?

Unlike other D.C.-based groups, AFP mobilizes real constituents with real stories from across the country to make policy more personal. Their message carries weight because it comes from the bottom up.

By Jim Hagedorn and Steve Caldeira

Kudos to President Trump and Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin. The EPA announced last month that it will reassign more than 130 agency scientists to clear the backlog of new chemicals and pesticides that need review before they can be sold. It’s a giant step to protect the environment and human health—and there’s more to do.

Even as the White House pushes to reduce the size of government, some agencies need additional workers to get vital jobs done. That’s certainly true at the EPA, which does more than try to keep air and water clean. It also evaluates chemicals in commercial and household products that prevent contamination in kitchens, infections in hospitals, public-health threats in pests and invasive species in nature.

This review process is the world’s gold standard. But the longer evaluations take, the longer useful products are kept off the shelves. A shortage of scientists has created a backlog of more than 500 new chemical cases and over 1,200 pesticide products, according to the EPA. That means lengthy delays and missed deadlines. Today, 56% of Pesticide Registration Improvement Act cases for “conventional chemicals” are late, as are 72% of cases reviewing products intended for “antimicrobial uses.” That’s unacceptable.

Mr. Zeldin’s move to assign more experts to these reviews—and his larger reorganization of the EPA—will get new products to market more quickly while maintaining rigorous standards. The reorganization also gives the agency new tools to advance a testing strategy for chemicals that pose unique challenges for regulators. Experts need new computational and bioinformatic tools—and eventually artificial intelligence—to streamline and improve review of new chemicals and pesticides.

Robust scientific assessments and timely stamps of approval are good for business, American manufacturing and American competitiveness in a world where other countries are racing to lead innovation. But as welcome as the internal transfer of experts is, it’s only a first step. Legislation is necessary to give the EPA the additional money it needs in the next several years to conduct thorough and timely reviews.

If Congress provides adequate and carefully directed resources, the EPA can improve throughput and timelines, using real-world data and the latest industrial practices that assess risk. The additional resources would also ensure the agency is consistently applying the law’s scientific standards when making safety determinations.

The benefits of this comprehensive ramp-up are manifold. Consumers would no longer be deprived of products that will improve their daily lives. Businesses would be encouraged to invest in innovations right here in America, because the U.S. government is finally giving them the green light.

The administration’s actions are a huge help. But now Congress must pass a law to provide the long-term funding and authority so the EPA can fulfill its mission of protecting the environment and human health.

In the evening of April 8, more than 11% of Texas electricity was coming from batteries, a record.
Meanwhile, NERC expects batteries to juice roughly one-quarter of California’s peak power demand in coming months.
Rosenow, at Oxford’s Environmental Change Institute, says big batteries are surging and affordable enough that their adoption will steepen quickly.
Trump’s spending plan also threatens to throttle big batteries and green-energy projects.","In any other year, May 14 may well have been an energy disaster in Texas.

Temperatures climbed to seasonal levels not seen in over a century: 92 in Dallas, 95 in Houston and 104 in Laredo. Air conditioners hummed en masse and power demand surged. Meanwhile, scores of natural-gas powered generators were offline, getting tuned up for summer.

But Texas skies were pretty sunny and windy and startups had spent the preceding months building big banks of batteries to store electricity. When power demand peaked around 4:30 in the afternoon, almost half of the electricity on the grid was coming from renewables, according to the energy analytics platform GridStatus.io. As the sun set, battery banks that had been soaking up electrons in the heat of the day stepped up to cover 8% of demand, keeping power flowing.

“Batteries are very good at handling these types of events,” said Andrew Gilligan, director of commercial strategy at Fluence Energy, a battery developer with three storage sites in Texas. “Things have gotten a lot better than a couple years ago.”

This summer will be an energy doozy in the U.S. as climate change exacerbates heat waves and a rash of new data centers and crypto mines comes online. But these new power vacuums arrive in concert with a stack of big batteries. America, particularly its Sun Belt, has been a gusher of renewable energy for years; now, utilities will be able to bottle up much of that sun and wind and discharge it around the clock.

In the 12 months through April — the most recent data available — energy storage in the U.S. surged from roughly 18 gigawatts to 25 gigawatts, a 41% increase, according to a Bloomberg Green analysis of federal data. In Arizona, battery bandwidth nearly tripled; in Texas, it has almost doubled. In the evening of April 8, more than 11% of Texas electricity was coming from batteries, a record.

If the U.S. is able to reach the Biden administration’s goal of emissions-free electricity by 2035 — or even get close — batteries will be a big reason why. Renewable electricity is setting records every few days and accounted for almost one-third of all U.S. power generation in March. Batteries can make sure those electrons hit at the most opportune time — or at least that they don’t go to waste. Along the way, they’ll drag electricity prices down, speed the retirement of fossil fuel plants and preclude plans for new ones, according to Jan Rosenow, head of the energy program at the University of Oxford’s Environmental Change Institute.

“Twenty years ago, the main problem with renewables was that they were so expensive,” Rosenow explained. “Now, renewables are cheap, but we need to be able to match that supply to demand. For that, battery storage is clearly one of the best tools in the box.”

104 million face outages

Summer is always a fraught time for grids and utilities. Cooling takes more electricity than heating and with a fast-changing climate, Americans are doing it more and more. Annual cooling degree days, an indicator of AC use, have increased 17% compared with the 1990-99 average, according to BloombergNEF. Last summer was the fourth hottest on record in North America and meteorologists are forecasting a similarly sweaty sequel.

“An increase in heat extremes is the most obvious symptom of climate change,” said Karen McKinnon, a professor who studies the statistics behind climate change at the University of California, Los Angeles. “Even seemingly small changes in temperatures of a few degrees can make summers feel substantially more extreme.”

As a result, three of the continent’s six major power grids are at risk of power outages this summer, according to the North American Electric Reliability Corp., a Washington, D.C.-based nonprofit. All told, 104 million Americans — roughly 1 in 3 people — live in areas where extreme heat and rising demand could shut out the lights, though NERC says the risk would be far higher without the new banks of batteries.

In Texas, for example, NERC’s odds of an energy emergency this summer have dropped from roughly 15% a few months ago to 3.6% thanks to battery capacity. Meanwhile, NERC expects batteries to juice roughly one-quarter of California’s peak power demand in coming months.

“Reliability is the ability to react to sudden changes in the grid,” explained Chris McKissack, chief executive officer of Fullmark Energy, which is building two storage sites in Texas. “And when it comes to reacting, nothing moves faster than battery storage.”

Homeowners have realized as much, adding their own small battery systems to keep the lights on and avoid time-of-use electric price peaks. Last year, residential storage surged by 64%, systems that also help lower summer demand peaks and stabilize the grid.

Last summer, there were no major power outages in the U.S., a success the Department of Energy primarily attributed to new solar generation and storage.

Officials who run the Texas grid say batteries have also been critical in lowering prices, particularly in the summer. They expect storage in the state to triple over the next five years.

Where solar was 10 years ago

To be sure, it’s still very early days for storage. In 2024, it represented just 2% of U.S. power capacity, but that’s ramping quickly. BloombergNEF expects utility-scale battery storage to nearly double again this year regardless of how much the Trump administration manages to dial down green incentives, with some 18 gigawatts of new capacity.

Utilities and developers are building battery stacks because they are often the most affordable way to add capacity, essentially by stretching power generation that’s already built. The average price for stationary storage systems in 2024 was $125 per kWh, 19% lower than in 2023, according to BNEF.

Storage systems are also getting more resilient. A decade ago, industrial batteries generally discharged all of their electrons in 30 minutes or less. Today, the average system can put out energy for four hours straight, and some are tuned for cycles as high as eight hours. This means they can kick in more frequently and stay on for longer, not just during brief windows in the morning and evening.

Rosenow, at Oxford’s Environmental Change Institute, says big batteries are surging and affordable enough that their adoption will steepen quickly.

“Storage is now where solar was maybe 10 years ago,” Rosenow explained. “That’s kind of how it feels to me. It’s really mind-blowing.”

As the battery blitz evolves, Rosenow says, people will pay less for electricity, outages will abate and the largest energy hogs, including AI data centers, will spool up with minimal added emissions. But there are diminishing returns.

Storage systems thrive on being able to sock in electrons when they are cheap and sell them when power prices surge. As storage capacity ramps up, those arbitrage opportunities narrow. McKissack, at Fullmark, says battery executives are becoming much more strategic about what they build and where.

“The race for quantity is over,” he explained. “At this point, very few of us want to bolster up the number of dots on a map.”

What’s more, recent federal tariffs will likely raise the cost of big battery projects from 12% to 50%, depending on how high the levies go and how long they stay elevated, according to consulting firm Woods Mackenzie. And while American battery factories are booting up, it will be a long time before domestic supply meets even more than a small fraction of U.S. demand, the company says.

Trump’s spending plan also threatens to throttle big batteries and green-energy projects. Sabah Bayatli, CEO of solar and battery developer OCI Energy, traveled to Washington, D.C., to encourage senators to maintain Inflation Reduction Act incentives or, at the very least, step them down gradually.

“If (the ‘big, beautiful bill’) passes as is, it’s an overnight kill for the solar industry,” he said.

Bayatli may more easily make his case after a summer of heat-wave drama and power outages, but the solar and storage that’s already been built could preclude all that.

McKissack concedes that most people and businesses won’t realize how big of a part renewables and batteries will play in keeping the grid healthy in coming months. Charts of disaster averted because of them aren’t all that powerful, he explained.

“It’s almost easier to talk about when there’s a blackout, but then people’s lives are at risk,” he said.",https://images.seattletimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/06202025_tzr_tzr_092824.jpg?d=1200x630,N,,2025-06-23 18:11:42.985684

Despite the empty pledges the promises kept coming. Last year in January, Musk said, “Next year for sure, we’ll have over a million robotaxis.”

Would you settle for 10 or 12?

Musk appears to be on the verge of making his robotaxi vision a reality with a test run of a small squad of self-driving cabs in Austin, Texas, that began Sunday. Reaching a million may take a year or more, however, although the billionaire should be able to expand the service this year if the Austin demo is a success.

The stakes couldn't be higher, nor the challenges.

While Musk was making those “next year” promises, rival Waymo was busy deploying driverless taxis in Los Angeles, San Diego, Austin and other cities by using a different technology that allowed it to get to market faster. It just completed its 10 millionth paid ride.

Boycotts related to Musk's politics have tanked Tesla's sales. Rival electric vehicle makers with newly competitive models have stolen market share. And investors are on edge after a $150 billion stock wipeout when Musk picked a social media fight with a U.S. president overseeing federal car regulators who could make the robotaxi rollout much more difficult. The stock has recovered somewhat after Musk said he regretted some of his remarks.

Tesla shareholders have stood by Musk over the years because he’s defied the odds by building a successful standalone electric vehicle company – self-driving car promises aside – and making them a lot of money in the process. A decade ago, Tesla shares traded for around $18. The shares closed Friday at $322.

Musk seemed jubilant Sunday morning, posting on X, “The @Tesla_AI robotaxi launch begins in Austin this afternoon with customers paying a $4.20 flat fee!”

The test is beginning modestly enough. Tesla is remotely monitoring the vehicles and putting a person in the passenger seat in case of trouble. The number of Teslas deployed will also be small – just 10 or 12 vehicles – and will only pick up passengers in a limited, geofenced area.

Musk has vowed that the service will quickly spread to other cities, eventually reaching hundreds of thousands if not a million vehicles next year.

Some Musk watchers on Wall Street are skeptical.

“How quickly can he expand the fleet?” asks Garrett Nelson, an analyst at CFRA. “We're talking maybe a dozen vehicles initially. It's very small.""

Morningstar's Seth Goldstein says Musk is being classic Musk: Promising too much, too quickly.

“When anyone in Austin can download the app and use a robotaxi, that will be a success, but I don't think that will happen until 2028,"" he says. “Testing is going to take a while.”

Musk's tendency to push up the stock high with a bit of hyperbole is well known among investors.

In 2018, he told Tesla stockholders he had “funding secured” to buy all their shares at a massive premium and take the company private. But he not only lacked a written commitment from financiers, according to federal stock regulators who fined him, he hadn't discussed the loan amount or other details with them.

More recently, Musk told CNBC in May that Tesla was experiencing a “major rebound” in demand. A week later an auto trade group in Europe announced sales had plunged by half.

Musk has come under fire for allegedly exaggerating the ability of the system used for its cars to drive themselves, starting with the name. Full Self-Driving is a misnomer. The system still requires drivers to keep their eyes on the road because they may need to intervene and take control at any moment.

Federal highway safety regulators opened an investigation into FSD last year after several accidents, and the Department of Justice has conducted its own probe, though the status of that is not known. Tesla has also faced lawsuits over the feature, some resulting in settlements, other dismissed. In one case, a judge ruled against the plaintiffs but only because they hadn't proved Musk “knowingly” made false statements.

Musk says the robotaxis will be running on an improved version of Full Self-Driving and the cabs will be safe.

He also says the service will be able to expand rapidly around the country. His secret weapon: Millions of Tesla owners now on the roads. He says an over-the-air software update will soon allow them to turn their cars into driverless cabs and start a side business while stuck at the office for eight hours or on vacation for a week.

“Instead of having your car sit in the parking lot, your car could be earning money,” Musk said earlier this year, calling it an Airbnb model for cars. “You will be able to add or subtract your car to the fleet.”

Musk says Tesla also can move fast to deploy taxis now because of his decision to rely only on cameras for the cars to navigate, unlike Waymo, which has gone a more expensive route by supplementing its cameras with lasers and radar.

“Tesla will have, I don’t know,” Musk mused in an conference call with investors, ”99% market share or something ridiculous.” Given Waymo's head start and potential competition from Amazon and others, dominating the driverless market to that extent could be a reach.

But Dan Ives, a Wedbush Securities analyst and big Musk fan, says this time Musk may actually pull it off because of Tesla's ability to scale up quickly.

Ives said he took multiple rides in a Tesla robotaxi Sunday and was impressed.

“There was a moment where we drove up a narrow road going up a hill with cars parked on both sides with oncoming traffic and people opening their car doors into the road and the Robotaxi masterfully maneuvered with patience and safety among this chaos,” Ives wrote.

And even skeptics like Morningstar's Goldstein acknowledge that Musk occasionally does gets things right, and spectacularly so.

He upended the car industry by getting people to buy expensive electric vehicles, brought his Starlink satellite internet service to rural areas and, more recently, performed a gee-whiz trick of landing an unmanned SpaceX rocket on a platform back on earth.

“Maybe his timelines aren’t realistic,"" Goldstein says, “but he can develop futuristic technology products.”","https://www.detroitnews.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/06/23/PDTN/84318102007-ap-25174086856930.jpg?crop=6959,3914,x723,y813&width=3200&height=1800&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-06-23 19:07:32.109930

The company said it will plan and design the first demonstration phase wells in the Smackover Formation in East Texas. GeoFrame Energy has said it is set to become the first company to deliver battery-grade lithium carbonate from this US reservoir to the market.

GeoFrame said the project is expected to produce approximately 83,500 metric tons of battery-grade lithium carbonate annually—enough to meet 100% of domestic demand – which would mark a turning point in ending US dependence on Chinese lithium imports.

“GeoFrame Energy is in an excellent position to capitalize on the current demand for lithium through brine extraction,” Halliburton’s vice president of low carbon solutions Duane Sherritt said in a news release. “Halliburton’s 100-year legacy of well expertise and execution, combined with innovation to support new energy projects and decades of experience in the Smackover Formation, makes us the best candidate to help support GeoFrame Energy’s vision.”

“Halliburton, as a critical member of our team, will support the drilling phase of our project through the construction, design, and operation of the demonstration wells and the expansion into full field development,” GeoFrame Energy CEO Bruce Cutright said.

Cutright said the company plans to use geothermal brine to generate renewable electricity through zero-emission binary cycle generators.

Except for the leased temporary generation units, CenterPoint does not generate any electricity in the state and does not purchase electricity on behalf of its customers in Texas.","We’re just a few days removed from the official start of summer, and it’s already shaping up to be a scorcher in many parts of the United States. While the eastern half of the country sweats out a stretch of dangerous heat and humidity, a major Texas utility is preparing for what’s to come.

Anticipating a generation shortfall near San Antonio, Texas, this summer, CenterPoint Energy has dispatched the first five of 15 large temporary emergency generation units from the Greater Houston area to the San Antonio region to help meet short-term power needs. The remaining units, which range in capacity from 27 to 32 megawatts (MW), will be deployed in three successive waves over the next two months. Each can power roughly 30,000 homes.

The temporary emergency generation units will be in the field for up to two years as part of a solution devised in collaboration with the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT), elected leaders, regulators, and industry partners over the past six months. CenterPoint purchased the generators after Winter Storm Uri, which claimed the lives of at least 246 Texans in 2021, initially sticking ratepayers with part of the tab until settling a rate case in February that let them off the hook as of May 1, 2025. The Public Utilities Commission had permitted CenterPoint to charge its customers to help cover the cost of the $800 million generators and generate a profit. CenterPoint estimates the average subscriber will see their bill dip by about $2 by 2027.

“This creative, collaborative solution is moving forward to help meet our great state’s significant energy needs and improve reliability across Texas. This unprecedented contribution of value from CenterPoint to the state will help reduce the risk of energy shortfalls in San Antonio and will immediately lower monthly bills for our Houston-area customers,” said Jason Ryan, CenterPoint Energy’s executive vice president of regulatory services and government affairs. The investor-owned utility estimates the contribution to the state to be around $200 million.

During its response to Hurricane Beryl last summer, CenterPoint was knocked for not utilizing the massive generators, which were designed precisely to prevent prolonged outages. In the February rate case settlement, the utility proposed moving the emergency generators to the San Antonio area for two years to help ERCOT manage generation shortfalls. CenterPoint will receive no revenue or profit from the 15 large units deployed to San Antonio, based on an agreement with ERCOT.

CenterPoint is an electric transmission and distribution company in the 12-county Greater Houston area of Texas, meaning the company does not own any power plants in the state. Except for the leased temporary generation units, CenterPoint does not generate any electricity in the state and does not purchase electricity on behalf of its customers in Texas.

The changes are pretty notable as there’s two new powertrains as well as a newly standard NACS port, which allows for easy access at Tesla Supercharger stations.

Starting with the entry-level Optiq, it features an 85 kWh battery pack as well as a rear-mounted motor producing an estimated 315 hp (235 kW / 319 PS) and 332 lb-ft (450 Nm) of torque. That’s pretty impressive as it’s more powerful than the current all-wheel drive model.

Speaking of which, the 2026 Optiq offers a new “rear-wheel drive based all-wheel drive system.” It produces an estimated 440 hp (328 kW / 446 PS) and 498 lb-ft (674 Nm) of torque, which is a huge improvement over the previous rating of 300 hp (224 kW / 304 PS) and 354 lb-ft (479 Nm).

Cadillac didn’t release full performance details, but said the 2026 Optiq has an estimated range of 300 miles (483 km). When the battery is low, it can get up to 79 miles (127 km) of range in as little as ten minutes.

Besides the powertrain updates, the 2026 Optiq has “Vision Enhanced Parking.” The company didn’t say much about it, but it sounds like an upgraded version of Enhanced Automatic Parking Assist and Cadillac says it uses cameras as well as radar sensors.

Last but not least, the crossover comes with the latest version of Super Cruise. It features a number of improvements including Google Maps integration and automatic lane changes to stay on your route. There’s also a new hands-on capability that keeps the vehicle centered in its lane and following a safe distance from the car ahead. This allows for smoother transitions to and from Super Cruise-enabled roads.

There’s also an upgraded adaptive cruise control system, which can automatically adjust to keep pace with changing speed limits. Like in the Vistiq, the system should let you speed, if you want to. As an example, if you’re doing 75 mph in a 70 mph zone and the speed limit drops to 55 mph, the car would do 60 mph.

“The grid looks as reliable as it ever has been,” said Pablo Vegas, president and CEO of Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT).
Since last summer, ERCOT has added more than 10,000 megawatts of new generation to the Texas grid — keeping up with the state's growing population.
“Over 1,200 people a day moving to Texas,” Vegas said.
Although those industries require large loads of energy, Vegas says those companies are investing in the state's long-term infrastructure needs.","TEXAS — The Lone Star State is often considered the energy capital of the world. As we transition into the heat of summer, the state’s power grid operator says it’s ready to carry the Texas energy load.

“To serve our growing community, every megawatt counts,” said CPS Energy CEO Rudy Garza.

The question of reliability always arises in Texas during the summer due to increased energy needs.

“The grid looks as reliable as it ever has been,” said Pablo Vegas, president and CEO of Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT). “Our expectations are we’re going to have a very reliable summer.”

Utility plants across the state have been inspected to ensure they’re ready to go. San Antonio’s power provider, CPS Energy, says a diverse energy mix — gas, wind, solar and battery storage — fuels reliability.

“Right now, we’ve got roughly 9,500 megawatts of generation capacity to power through the summer season,” said Garza. “That’s going to take care of both CPS Energy customers, and it’s going to help ERCOT ensure reliability across the system.”

The Metro SA Chamber recently hosted a ""State of Energy"" conversation with Vegas and Garza, giving an update on the state’s energy performance and projects in the works.

“Right now, we’ve got 77 segments of transmission we have to build over some period of time,” said Garza.

Since last summer, ERCOT has added more than 10,000 megawatts of new generation to the Texas grid — keeping up with the state's growing population.

“Over 1,200 people a day moving to Texas,” Vegas said. “And that does create a significant requirement for new infrastructure.”

New industries are also moving into Texas — big manufactures and data centers. Although those industries require large loads of energy, Vegas says those companies are investing in the state's long-term infrastructure needs.

“The data center community, they’re going to be building infrastructure and assets both on the data center side as well as they are going to come in and invest into the infrastructure on the supply side,” Vegas said. “That’s going to help make sure our grid stays reliable as we see this incredible growth.”

Both leaders agree the biggest industry challenge is moving power from where it is to where it’s needed. Recently, the Public Utility Commission of Texas approved plans to build the state's first extra high voltage transmission lines over the next five to 10 years.

“765 is an extra high voltage system that we’ve never used in Texas before,” Vegas said. “It’s much more reliable than other transmission systems, and it provides resiliency.”

ERCOT will need to double its energy supply by 2030. Those 756 kilovolt lines will have four times the capacity of the standard transmission lines ERCOT currently uses.

“It’s going to provide a very efficient and cost-effective way to move power around the state so we can continue to support the growth in the western part of Texas and in the Dallas portions of Texas,” Vegas said.",https://s7d2.scene7.com/is/image/TWCNews/energy_crop,N,,2025-06-23 18:11:35.301607

Second, EPA proposed to repeal amendments to the Mercury and Air Toxics Standards (MATS) finalized in 2024 (90 Fed. Reg. 25,535).

These proposed rules on power plant emissions of GHGs and hazardous air pollutants (HAPs) are the most significant public step EPA has taken in its sweeping deregulatory agenda. The proposed rules offer valuable insight into the administration's broader strategy and approach as it begins to grapple with notice-and-comment rulemaking requirements.

Proposed Regulation of Carbon Dioxide (CO2) Emissions Under Section 111

The regulation of power plant GHG emissions under CAA Section 111 has been contentious and subject to dramatic swings since their introduction. EPA's 2015 Clean Power Plan (CPP) under the Obama Administration took a broad approach, seeking Chevron deference for an interpretation of the ""best system of emission reduction"" (BSER) that could include generation-shifting measures that took advantage of the uniquely interconnected nature of the electric grid and power sector. The U.S. Supreme Court later stayed the CPP, and the rule never went into effect.

EPA's 2019 Affordable Clean Energy (ACE) rule under the Trump Administration limited the BSER to measures that could be applied directly ""at and to the source"" and concluded that only heat-rate improvements sufficed as the BSER. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit vacated the ACE rule and repeal of the CPP as a ""fundamental misconstruction"" of CAA Section 111(d), but the Supreme Court reversed. In West Virginia v. EPA, 597 U.S. 697 (2022), the Court invoked the major questions doctrine to reject the CPP's generation-shifting approach as a ""transformative"" measure requiring clearer congressional authorization.

Following this decision, EPA under the Biden Administration issued new power plant GHG rules in 2024 with BSERs that varied depending on the type of plant. Most significantly, the Biden EPA rule relied on carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) technology for certain existing coal plants and new gas-fired power plants and on natural gas co-firing for other existing coal plants. Although the Supreme Court declined to stay the Biden rules, following the change in administration, the D.C. Circuit agreed to hold the case in abeyance while the Trump Administration evaluated a change of course. EPA now proposes a new approach.

EPA's Primary Proposal for CO2 Emissions

The Trump Administration's proposal would eliminate all GHG limits for coal- and gas-fired power plants based on the premise that these sources do not ""contribute significantly"" to the endangerment of public health. CAA Section 111(b)(1)(A), 42 U.S.C. 7411(b)(1)(A), states that the EPA administrator must list a source category for regulation under Section 111 ""if in his judgment it causes, or contributes significantly to"" dangerous air pollution. EPA concludes that this language confers discretion on the administrator to determine when emissions reach the threshold of significant contribution; specifically, the agency states that GHG emissions from fossil fuel-fired power plants do not contribute significantly because they represent only 3 percent of global emissions and no cost-effective control measures are reasonably available.

In the proposal, EPA further concludes that the term ""contributes significantly to,"" in conjunction with an explicit reference to the administrator's ""judgment,"" confers discretion to consider policy issues central to other parts of Section 111. Those policy issues include the effectiveness of emissions reduction controls, cost reasonableness of those controls, impacts on industry and impacts on public health and welfare. This approach would be a significant shift from previous approaches to Section 111 rules, which more clearly separated the threshold inquiry of which source categories are subject to regulation under Section 111 versus the actual emission reduction requirements.

EPA's Fallback Proposal for CO2 Emissions

Alternatively, EPA's proposal offers a narrower approach focusing on the Biden EPA's use of CCS and natural gas co-firing as the BSER for certain coal-fired power plants. The core aspects include:

for long-term coal-fired power plants and for plants undertaking major modifications, a repeal of the Biden EPA's 90 percent CCS as the BSER because the technology is not ""adequately demonstrated"" and is unreasonably costly

for medium-term coal-fired power plants, a repeal of the Biden EPA's 40 percent natural gas co-firing as the BSER because co-firing is ""an inefficient use of natural gas""

a repeal of the requirements for existing natural gas and oil-fired power plants because – having proposed to repeal the requirements for coal-fired power plants – it would be ""an inefficient use of State resources"" to require state governments to develop and submit plans for natural gas and oil-fired plants given how few GHGs they emit in comparison

This alternative is more technical than the primary proposal and would likely take longer to finalize due to the distinct issues arising for each of the various standards and the need to build an adequate technical record to support any final rule.

Proposed Repeal of 2024 Revisions to MATS Rule

In a separate action, EPA proposed to repeal amendments to the MATS for coal- and oil-fired power plants promulgated by EPA under the Biden Administration in May 2024.

The MATS rule has also been the focus of intense scrutiny since its 2012 promulgation. EPA under the Obama Administration promulgated the original MATS rule for coal- and oil-fired power plants under CAA Section 112, including a key predicate determination that regulation under Section 112 was ""appropriate and necessary."" In Michigan v. EPA, 576 U.S. 743 (2015), the Supreme Court held that EPA had improperly ignored cost in its ""appropriate and necessary"" determination, but the regulation nevertheless remained in effect through the Obama Administration and first Trump Administration. EPA under the Biden Administration strengthened the standards in May 2024.

EPA now proposes to repeal three key provisions of the EPA amendments under the Biden Administration:

Filterable particulate matter (fPM) emission standards tightened from 0.030 to 0.010 pounds per million British thermal units (lb/MMBtu) for coal-fired electric-generating units. EPA proposes that the costs to achieve the standard are too high – flagging that cost effectiveness was worse than similar standards rejected for other sectors – and also that the standard is not ""necessary"" under CAA Section 112(d)(6).

Requirement to use particulate matter (PM) continuous emission monitoring systems (CEMS) for compliance demonstrations, because the transparency and pollution abatement advantages of CEMS do not sufficiently outweigh the costs to industry compared to other compliance options from the original 2012 MATS rule.

Tightened mercury emission standards for lignite-fired power plants, which had been lowered from 4 to 1.2 pounds per trillion British thermal units (lb/TBtu). EPA now proposes that this tighter standard was ""based on insufficient available data,"" including inappropriate extrapolations between units at different lignite-fired plants.

Administrative Law Backdrop

These proposals represent the first major EPA regulations of the second Trump Administration and first power plant GHG rules developed entirely after the Supreme Court eliminated Chevron deference in Loper Bright Enterprises v. Raimondo, 603 U.S. 369 (2024).1 Particularly for the power plant CO2 rules, EPA spends many pages of the proposal elaborating on statutory interpretations that have not been tested in court. Without the benefit of Chevron deference, courts will assess whether these untested interpretations are the ""single best"" readings of the statute rather than merely one of several ""reasonable"" interpretations. If successful, this position would seemingly foreclose any stationary source GHG regulation under CAA Section 111, given that power plants are by far the greatest emitters; if power plants do not ""contribute significantly"" to climate change under CAA Section 111, it is not clear that any other source category would meet the test, either.

The ""significant contribution"" argument for GHGs could also potentially be applied to other source categories and pollutants, establishing a higher threshold for when EPA can regulate emissions under various CAA provisions.

Another major issue will be the economic analysis of the proposals. The MATS repeal is premised in large part on cost considerations. The current proposal puts a heightened emphasis on the cost-focused approach to the technology review provisions of Section 112(d)(6), potentially establishing precedent for how costs are evaluated in other CAA contexts.

The CO2 proposal has a more complicated cost framework. EPA proposes that the cost of controls can be relevant to whether a source category's GHG emissions should be regulated at all under Section 111. However, the agency's proposed economic analysis shows costs (lost health benefits) that vastly outweigh the avoided compliance costs. Depending on the discount rate, the EPA estimates compliance cost savings between $9.6 billion and $19 billion, as compared to lost health benefits between $76 billion and $130 billion due to increased fine particulate matter and ozone emissions. The proposal did not monetize any benefits associated with CO2 emissions, stating that was an explicit choice to ignore those emissions due to direction in Executive Order 14154: Unleashing American Energy.

Conclusion

These proposals are the first in EPA's deregulatory agenda and the first in a legal landscape that has fundamentally shifted post-Loper Bright. As these proposals move through the CAA's unique rulemaking process, EPA's decisions are likely to test not only the substantive boundaries of CAA authority, but also the procedural constraints on administrative agencies in the post-Chevron era.

Both proposals will undergo 45-day public comment periods following Federal Register publication. EPA has indicated that it intends to move quickly to finalize rules. Stakeholders should prepare detailed technical and legal comments if they are affected.

🔊 A Message from IBEW Leadership

On May 14, 2025, IBEW International President Kenneth W. Cooper released a powerful statement condemning the Republican-led tax proposal now advancing through Congress. His message was clear: this bill is a direct attack on IBEW jobs, energy independence, and the American middle class.

“This legislation takes a sledgehammer to the progress the country has made in clean-energy technology and manufacturing.”

— IBEW International President Kenneth W. Cooper

🛑 What’s at Stake?

The GOP’s new tax bill, currently moving to the House floor, includes provisions to eliminate the clean-energy tax credits established under the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA)—credits that have:

Supercharged the growth of wind, solar, nuclear, and geothermal energy across the U.S.

Created tens of thousands of jobs, many for union electricians and tradespeople

Fueled local economies, especially in GOP-held districts, where the IRA has spurred the most investment

Repealing these credits doesn’t just slow development—it kills jobs and jeopardizes the U.S.’s energy leadership in an increasingly global race for clean power.

💼 The Real Cost: Jobs

According to Cooper, repealing these tax incentives will destroy tens of thousands of energy jobs—many of which currently support IBEW members in nearly every state.

That includes:

Utility-scale solar and wind technicians

Nuclear retrofit crews

High-voltage electrical infrastructure teams

Emerging geothermal and battery storage roles

And more, all at risk

These are family-sustaining union jobs, often located in rural or economically hard-hit regions where such work has been transformational.

⚡ Energy Demand Is Rising—Why Cut Now?

The surge in AI development and data center construction across the U.S. is driving skyrocketing demand for reliable domestic energy. Repealing the IRA tax credits now sends a dangerous signal: that the U.S. is backing away from its energy future.

Instead of:

Building up domestic capacity

Becoming a global leader in clean-tech manufacturing

Fortifying the grid with high-skilled labor

…the GOP plan cuts funding and gives tax breaks to billionaires like Elon Musk—at the direct expense of American workers.

🔄 Twisting the Narrative

Some Republicans are claiming that keeping IRA labor protections intact is a “win” for workers. But Cooper makes it clear:

“If there are no jobs left to protect, working people still lose.”

Labor standards only matter if projects exist. No jobs = no protections. It’s that simple.

🧭 What IBEW Stands For

The IBEW fights every day for:

✅ Good jobs

✅ Energy security

✅ Fair wages and labor protections

✅ A future built by American hands

This tax proposal threatens all of it—for nothing more than a billionaire windfall.

🗣️ Our Call to Action

IBEW Local 212 stands with President Cooper and the 860,000 active and retired IBEW members across the country in calling on Congress to reject this anti-worker, anti-energy legislation.

The Senate Finance Committee released last week proposed tax legislation intended for potential inclusion as the tax subtitle of budget reconciliation legislation, commonly known as the “One Big Beautiful Bill” (read TaxNewsFlash). The House passed its version of the legislation (H.R. 1) last month (read TaxNewsFlash). Finance also released a subtitle addressing healthcare, including Medicaid, and another raising the debt ceiling. Other Senate committees are preparing the other elements of the bill.

The KPMG detailed analysis of both the House and Senate versions of the tax legislation is found here: KPMG reports: Tax title for “One Big Beautiful Bill.”

Senate Republican leadership has as its goal passage of its reconciliation bill before adjourning at the end of the week for its Independence Day recess. Issues remain under negotiation, however, and review by the Senate Parliamentarian on consistency with budget reconciliation rules is ongoing. The state and local tax (SALT) cap, phase-outs of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) energy credits, the international provisions and the retaliatory tax on residents of countries that impose discriminatory or extraterritorial taxes on U.S. taxpayers are still apparently being discussed, among other things. Further changes are possible before or during a Senate vote.

The effect of the legislation on deficits and the national debt is also a concern. So, too, are the proposed offsets. Cuts to Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program remain controversial; the latter have been affected by rulings of the Parliamentarian. The tax cuts and the spending cuts are related in that both affect the net effect of the legislation on deficits.

The tax subtitle would, like the House bill, make permanent most of the expiring individual tax provisions of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA). It also includes temporary campaign tax benefits promised by the president for tip income, overtime pay, and auto loan interest. The Senate bill does make several modifications to the House bill, however, as described below.

Among the important business provisions of the Finance tax subtitle are provisions that would:

Reinstate and make permanent expensing of R&D costs, the higher EBITDA cap on the deduction for interest, and 100% bonus depreciation (the House bill would only extend these provisions for five years)

Make permanent the section 199A deduction for passthrough business income but at the current 20% rate instead of the higher 23% rate of the House bill

Renew and reform the Opportunity Zone program

Add a 100% first-year depreciation deduction for real property used in a production activity (the House bill included a similar proposal)

The Finance tax subtitle also includes provisions that would increase revenues, in some cases modifying provisions of the House bill, and would:

Repeal or phase out energy tax credits created by the IRA, though in some cases extending the credits further than the House bill

Make extensive reforms to the U.S. international tax regime, including to foreign-derived intangible income (FDII), global intangible low-taxed income (GILTI) (renamed “net CFC tested income”), and the base erosion minimum tax (BEAT)

Impose a retaliatory tax on certain non-U.S. corporations and individuals if their home jurisdiction has adopted taxes on U.S. taxpayers deemed to be discriminatory or extraterritorial, albeit with a delayed one-year effective date relative to the House bill and a reduced maximum rate of additional tax

Permanently extend the CFC look-through rule of 954(c)(6)

Continue the existing $10,000 cap on the SALT deduction, while extending and increasing the SALT cap for certain passthrough entity taxes

Impose a 3.5% tax on remittances to a recipient outside the United States

Increase taxes on college endowments but at lesser rates than those of the House bill (but omitting a provision on private foundations)

Bar the IRS from making payment on employee retention credit claims filed after January 31, 2024

Differences with the House may present obstacles to final passage. Several House members have said they will not vote for the bill if it includes a SALT cap of less than $40,000. Others have expressed concern about the effect of any version of the bill on deficits and the national debt, and that concern will only increase with the apparent additional revenue cost of the Finance tax subtitle.

The bill lacks the support of Democrats, and the Republican majorities in the House and Senate are very narrow: eight in the House, six in the Senate. With only three votes to spare, resolution of conflicting concerns may prove difficult and take time. The original Independence Day goal for final passage of the bill seems now out of reach. The next natural deadline is adjournment for the August recess, the end of July.

Other legislative activity. The House recently passed 216-214 a recissions bill, after a last-minute switch of a vote. The bill, in addition to rescinding current funding for public broadcasting and international aid programs, also eliminated remaining 2024 and 2025 funding for international organizations. These recissions would eliminate U.S. contributions to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. The effect this might have on negotiations over Pillar 2 and other matters, should the Senate agree, is uncertain.

The Senate has confirmed the nomination of former representative Billy Long to be IRS Commissioner. The Majority Leader has begun the process leading to a vote on the nomination of Kenneth Kies as Assistant Secretary for Tax Policy. And the President has nominated Don Korb for IRS Chief Counsel, a position he held during the Bush Administration.",https://kpmg.com/kpmg-us/content/dam/kpmg/basic-hero/2025/tax-legislative-alerts-980x550-h-1.jpg,N,,2025-06-23 19:07:50.585085

We shouldn't have anything that we're just funding forever and giving tax credits to forever,” Backes said.","The One Big Beautiful Bill Act is raising concerns from leaders in the data center industry that a proposed phase-out of clean energy tax credits could exacerbate the sector’s power shortage.

House Speaker Mike Johnson and President Donald Trump walking through the Capitol in May.

Tech giants like Microsoft, Google, Amazon and Meta are the world’s largest buyers of renewable energy. The data center sector has driven a wave of low-carbon energy projects like solar and wind farms across the U.S. as the skyrocketing energy requirements of the artificial intelligence building boom have collided with Big Tech’s carbon reduction goals.

But measures within the massive GOP tax bill moving through Congress would eliminate tax credits that have been integral to the development of these clean energy projects.

The loss of these clean energy tax credits would create headwinds for an industry already struggling to meet its ballooning energy needs, developers and industry groups tell Bisnow. Beyond simply impeding Big Tech’s progress toward its sustainability goals, phasing out green energy incentives is expected to worsen power constraints and increase costs in key data center markets.

In response to this threat, the tech industry has reportedly been lobbying Congress in recent weeks to save the clean energy subsidies.

With the Senate aiming to vote on the legislation by early July, the fate of these subsidies in the bill’s final draft remains uncertain. But the sentiment across the data center ecosystem is that the bill is likely to make building new solar and wind projects significantly harder at a time when data centers, and the country, need all the power they can get. Abandoning renewables, industry leaders say, undermines the Trump administration’s stated goal of leveraging energy production to stay ahead of China in the AI arms race.

“People want to talk about AI dominance and energy abundance and energy dominance, and not ceding everything to China — well, the surefire way to cede everything to China is to think that gas and coal plants are going to solve the problem, because they're not,” said Ali Fenn, president of energy-focused AI data center developer Lancium.

“This needs an all-of-the-above strategy. It's too important to curtail or slow down the resources that are most cost-effective and readily available for deployment.”

The world’s largest data center users have been integral to the buildout of renewable energy infrastructure in the U.S. in recent years. Data center users led corporate clean energy procurement efforts in 2024, securing 17 gigawatts primarily through direct third-party power purchase agreements, according to S&P Global. Microsoft, Google and Meta were the top buyers, bringing the industry’s total green energy procurement close to 100 gigawatts.

Already this year, Meta has signed a 1.1-gigawatt nuclear energy deal in Illinois, inked a pair of solar PPAs totaling 650 MW in Texas and Kansas, and secured a 150 MW geothermal PPA in New Mexico.

Big Tech’s investment in renewable energy exploded following the 2022 passage of the Inflation Reduction Act, a climate bill championed by the Biden administration. While there were previous tax credits in place for the development of renewables like wind and solar, the IRA made them significantly more lucrative, sparking more than $841B in clean energy investment — more than half of it solar — since the bill’s passage.

The GOP’s Big Beautiful Bill aims to eliminate or roll back these incentives.

Just how sudden and dramatic those measures will be remains to be seen, but even with revisions to the bill likely, many renewables projects in development have already been paused with the future of their funding uncertain, the Wall Street Journal reported last week.

The House version of the bill aimed to cut clean energy tax credits almost immediately. To receive credits, renewables projects would have to start construction within two months of the bill’s passage and be complete by 2028, a nearly impossible task thanks to new restrictions on components acquired overseas. The Senate draft of the bill relaxes these timelines somewhat, giving solar and wind firms six months to start projects and receive the full tax break and a tiered phase-out that allows firms to receive at least 20% of the credit through 2027.

The Senate bill only mandates the rapid removal of credits for solar and wind, so-called intermittent renewables that produce varying amounts of power based on weather and environmental conditions. Unlike the House bill, the latest draft retains credits for renewables that provide constant “baseload” power through 2033, sources like nuclear, geothermal and hydroelectric, as well as battery storage.

The changes between the House and Senate bills followed vocal bipartisan pushback from lawmakers and aggressive lobbying efforts from tech and data center trade groups like the Data Center Coalition and the Clean Energy Buyers Association.

But while industry advocates say the longer timelines and retained firm power subsidies are steps in the right direction, many expressed disappointment that subsidies for wind and solar remain on the chopping block.

New energy infrastructure like solar farms are on the radar of real estate investors

There’s no reason for the bill to pick winners and losers when it comes to which kinds of green energy to subsidize, said Clean Energy Buyers Association CEO Rich Powell, particularly when wind and solar are by far the most readily available to be deployed today.

“It was a real breakthrough that we had a technology-neutral tax credit that allowed the market to select which technologies it was going to deploy rather than individual incentives for different things. It’s a shame that we're walking away from that,” Powell said.

Losing federal tax credits could increase the price tag of some renewables projects by as much as 40%, according to Powell, a spike in cost he says will lead to a smaller pipeline of new generation and cause some planned projects to drop out of interconnection queues.

Even if the final version of the bill retains credits for low-carbon baseload generation, technologies like small modular nuclear reactors or geothermal are years away from commercial viability. Until then, Powell said there is a significant risk that the power constraints already crippling key data center markets will worsen, with fossil fuel solutions like natural gas often carrying longer lead times than solar and other renewables.

Power constraints created by the loss of renewables projects in certain markets could reshape the development landscape, with significant consequences for developers that made real estate decisions based on a pathway to power that no longer exists as clean power projects are canceled.

“We're really concerned about simple access to electricity in a lot of these regions if the incentives that folks had built business models around go away,” Powell said. “And even if the projects still get built, we’re significantly concerned about the costs in all this.”

A CEBA-commissioned study published last week suggests that the loss of clean energy tax credits would drive higher electricity costs in key data center markets.

In Virginia, commercial and industrial electricity prices could jump 9.2% by next year and 12.7% by 2029. Arizona could see a 20% price increase by 2029, while North Carolina could see a 21.7% rate hike as soon as next year.

Still, some industry leaders say that even if clean energy tax credits disappear, there is a chance that hyperscale end users will be willing to stomach significantly higher development costs and power prices to sign deals that drive the buildout of new renewables projects. Studies indicate hyperscalers are willing to pay significantly more than market rate — and significantly more than they pay today — to access low-carbon power in critical markets as they balance their need for electricity with carbon reduction targets.

This willingness to pay a premium for free power was on display earlier this month when Meta signed a deal for 1.1 gigawatts from an aging Illinois nuclear power plant with Constellation Energy. The power station was originally set to close in 2017 due to financial losses but received a lifeline that year in the form of a state clean energy subsidy. With that subsidy set to expire in 2027, Meta is effectively replacing it by paying a higher-than-market rate to keep the plant online.

“It's the trillion-dollar question: How much does that price increase deter people from saying they need this new generation?” Lancium’s Fenn said. “Prices rise, but people still have to keep their foot on the gas.”

Provident Data Centers Principal Strategist Jack Backes said that while he believes credits for solar and wind are being phased out too quickly in the Senate bill, in the long term the industry’s sustained growth will require carbon-free baseload power like nuclear and geothermal becoming viable at scale.

Intermittent renewables like wind and solar are widely regarded as a poor match for data centers, which consume a relatively constant amount of power at all times. Matching data center demand growth with intermittent renewables can be a recipe for grid instability — a problem grid operators in markets like Texas have been navigating.

But widely deployable carbon-free firm power generation like small modular nuclear reactors and battery storage isn't yet ready for prime time, and it may be years before it can be deployed at scale. Backes is hopeful that focusing subsidies on these technologies can help derisk adoption and get them over the hump faster.

“For solar and wind, that risk is already taken out of the equation. We shouldn't have anything that we're just funding forever and giving tax credits to forever,” Backes said. “If we're shifting that over to nuclear, hydropower, geothermal and battery storage by 2028 then that's great, because those are better, less fragile power sources, and that's good for data centers, good for our grid stability and good for everybody.”",https://cdn.bisnow.net/fit?height=1200&type=jpeg&url=https%3A%2F%2Fs3.amazonaws.com%2Fcdn.bisnow.net%2Fcontent%2Fimages%2F2025%2F06%2F68598f97c372e-president_donald_trump_and_speaker_of_the_house_mike_johnson_speak_to_members_of_the_media_at_the_u-s-_capitol_p20250520mr-0346_-54536150498-.jpeg&width=1200&sign=VfFz-sHizu4N1iwhcgWTOinVP0VsU8XReFbvMbKezic,N,,2025-06-23 19:07:54.366877

It’s Summer, America’s Heating Up, and We’re Even More Unprepared

06.23.25 | 11 min read | Text by Grace Wickerson & Hannah Safford

Summer officially kicked off this past weekend with the onset of a sweltering heat wave. As we hit publish on this piece, tens of millions of Americans across the central and eastern United States are experiencing sweltering temperatures that make it dangerous to work, play, or just hang out outdoors.

The good news is that even when the mercury climbs, heat illness, injury, and death are preventable. The bad news is that over the past five months, the Trump administration has dismantled essential preventative capabilities.

At the beginning of this year, more than 70 organizations rallied around a common-sense Heat Policy Agenda to tackle this growing whole-of-nation crisis. Since then, we’ve seen some encouraging progress. The new Congressional Extreme Heat Caucus presents an avenue for bipartisan progress on securing resources and legislative wins. Recommendations from the Heat Policy Agenda have already been echoed in multiple introduced bills. Four states, California, Arizona, New Jersey, and New York, now have whole-of-government heat action plans, and there are several States with plans in development. More locally, mayors are banding together to identify heat preparedness, management, and resilience solutions. FAS highlighted examples of how leaders and communities across the country are beating the heat in a Congressional briefing just last week.

But these steps in the right direction are being forestalled by the Trump Administration’s leap backwards on heat. The Heat Policy Agenda emphasized the importance of a clear, sustained federal governance structure for heat, named authorities and dedicated resourcing for federal agencies responsible for extreme heat management, and funding and technical assistance to subnational governments to build their heat readiness. The Trump Administration has not only failed to advance these goals – it has taken actions that clearly work against them.

The result? It’s summer, America’s heating up, and we’re deeply unprepared.

The heat wave making headlines today is just the latest example of how extreme heat is a growing problem for all 50 states. In just the past month, the Pacific Northwest smashed early-summer temperature records, there were days when parts of Texas were the hottest places on Earth, and Alaska – yes, Alaska – issued its first-ever heat advisory. Extreme heat is deadlier than hurricanes, floods, and tornadoes combined, and is exacerbating a mental-health crisis as well. By FAS’ estimates, extreme heat costs the nation more than $162 billion annually, costs that have made extreme heat a growing concern to private markets.

To build a common understanding of the state of federal heat infrastructure, we analyzed the status of heat-critical programs and agencies through public media, government reports, and conversations with stakeholders. All known impacts are confirmed via publicly available sources. We highlight five areas where federal capacity has been impacted:

Leadership and governance infrastructure

Key personnel and their expertise

Data, forecasts, and information availability

Funding sources and programs for preparedness, risk mitigation and resilience

Progress towards heat policy goals

This work provides answers to many of the questions our team has been asked over the last few months about what heat work continues at the federal level. With this grounding, we close with some options and opportunities for subnational governments to consider heading into Summer 2025.

What is the Current State of Federal Capacity on Extreme Heat?

Loss of leadership and governance infrastructure

At the time of publication, all but one of the co-chairs for the National Integrated Heat Health Information System’s (NIHHIS) Interagency Working Group (IWG) have either taken an early retirement offer or have been impacted by reductions in force. The co-chairs represented NIHHIS, the National Weather Service (NWS), Health and Human Services (HHS), and the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). The National Heat Strategy, a whole-of-government vision for heat governance crafted by 28 agencies through the NIHHIS IWG, was also taken offline. A set of agency-by-agency tasks for Strategy implementation (to build short-term readiness for upcoming heat seasons, as well as to strengthen long-term preparedness) was in development as of early 2025, but this work has stalled. There was also a goal to formalize NIHHIS via legislation, given that its existence is not mandated by law – relevant legislation has been introduced but its path forward is unclear. Staff remain at NIHHIS and are continuing the work to manage the heat.gov website, craft heat resources and information, and disseminate public communications like Heat Beat Newsletter and Heat Safety Week. Their positions could be eliminated if proposed budget cuts to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) are approved by Congress.

Staffing reductions and actualized or proposed changes to FEMA and HHS, the federal disaster management agencies implicated in addressing extreme heat, are likely to be consequential in relation to extreme heat this summer. Internal reports have found that FEMA is not ready for responding to even well-recognized disasters like hurricanes, increasing the risk for a mismanaged response to an unprecedented heat disaster. The loss of key leaders at FEMA has also put a pause to efforts to integrate extreme heat within agency functions, such as efforts to make extreme heat an eligible disaster. FEMA is also proposing changes that will make it more difficult to receive federal disaster assistance. The Administration for Strategic Preparedness and Response (ASPR), HHS’ response arm, has been folded into the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), which has been refocused to focus solely on infectious diseases. There is still little public information for what this merger means for HHS’ implementation of the Public Health Service Act, which requires an all-hazards approach to public health emergency management. Prior to January 2025, HHS was determining how it could use the Public Health Emergency authority to respond to extreme heat.

Loss of key personnel and their expertise

Many key agencies involved in NIHHIS, and extreme heat management more broadly, have been impacted by reductions in force and early retirements, including NOAA, FEMA, HHS, the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the U.S. Forest Service (USFS), and the Department of Energy (DOE). Some key agencies, like FEMA, have lost or will lose almost 2,000 staff. As more statutory responsibilities are put on fewer workers, efforts to advance “beyond scope” activities, like taking action on extreme heat, will likely be on the back burner.

Downsizing at HHS has been acutely devastating to extreme heat work. In January, the Office of Climate Change and Health Equity (OCCHE) was eliminated, putting a pause on HHS-wide coordination on extreme heat and the new Extreme Heat Working Group. In April, the entire staff of the Climate and Health program at CDC, the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP), and all of the staff at the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) working on extreme heat, received reduction in force notices. While it appears that staff are returning to the CDC’s National Center for Environmental Health, they have lost months of time that could have been spent on preparedness, tool development, and technical assistance to local and state public health departments. Sustained funding for extreme heat programs at HHS is under threat, the FY2026 budget for HHS formally eliminates the CDC’s Climate and Health Program, all NIOSH efforts on extreme heat, and LIHEAP.

Risks to data, forecasts, and information availability, though some key tools remain online

Staff reductions at NWS have compromised local forecasts and warnings, and some offices can no longer staff around-the-clock surveillance. Staff reductions have also compromised weather balloon launches, which collect key temperature data for making heat forecasts. Remaining staff at the NWS are handling an increased workload at one of the busiest times of the year for weather forecasting. Reductions in force, while now reversed, have impacted real-time heat-health surveillance at the CDC, where daily heat-related illness counts have been on pause since May 21, 2025 and the site is not currently being maintained as of the date of this publication.

Some tools remain online and available to use this summer, including NWS/CDC’s HeatRisk (a 7-day forecast of health-informed heat risks) and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration’s Heat-Related EMS Activation Surveillance Dashboard (which shows the number of heat-related EMS activations, time to patient, percent transported to medical facilities, and deaths). Most of the staff that built HeatRisk have been impacted by reductions in force. The return of staff to the CDC’s Climate and Health program is a bright spot, and could bode well for the tool’s ongoing operations and maintenance for Summer 2025.

Proposed cuts in the FY26 budget will continue to compromise heat forecasting and data. The budget proposes cutting budgets for upkeep of NOAA satellites crucial to tracking extreme weather events like extreme heat; cutting budgets for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration’s LandSat program, which is used widely by researchers and private sector companies to analyze surface temperatures and understand heat’s risks; and fully defunding the National Environmental Public Health Tracking Network, which funds local and state public health departments to collect heat-health illness and death data and federal staff to analyze it.

Rollbacks in key funding sources and programs for preparedness, risk mitigation and resilience

As of May 2025, both NIHHIS Centers of Excellence – the Center for Heat Resilient Communities and the Center for Collaborative Heat Monitoring – received stop work orders and total pauses in federal funding. These Centers were set to work with 26 communities across the country to either collect vital data on local heat patterns and potential risks or shape local governance to comprehensively address the threat of extreme heat. These communities represented a cross-cut of the United States, from urban to coastal to rural to agricultural to tribal. Both Center’s leadership plans to continue the work with the selected communities in a reduced capacity, and continue to work towards aspirational goals like a universal heat action plan. Future research, coordination, and technical assistance at NOAA on extreme heat is under fire with the proposed total elimination of NOAA Research in the FY26 budget.

At FEMA, a key source of funding for local heat resilience projects, the Building Resilience Infrastructure and Communities (BRIC) program, has been cancelled. BRIC was the only FEMA Resilience grant that explicitly called out extreme heat in its Notice of Funding Opportunity, and funded $13 million in projects to mitigate the impacts of extreme heat. Many states have also faced difficulties in getting paid by FEMA for grants that support their emergency management divisions, and the FY26 budget proposes cuts to these grant programs. The cancellation of Americorps further reduces capacity for disaster response. FEMA is also dropping its support for improving building codes that mitigate disaster risk as well as removing requirements for subnational governments to plan for climate change.

At HHS, a lack of staff at CDC has stalled payments from key programs to prepare communities for extreme heat, the Building Resilience Against Climate Effects (BRACE) grant program and the Public Health Preparedness and Response program. BRACE is critical federal funding for state and local climate and health offices. In states like North Carolina, the BRACE program funds live-saving efforts like heat-health alerts. Both of these programs are proposed to be totally eliminated in the FY26 budget. The Hospital Preparedness Program (HPP) is also slated for elimination, despite being the sole source of federal funding for health care system readiness. HPP funds coalitions of health systems and public health departments, which have quickly responded to heat disasters like the 2021 Pacific Northwest Heat Domes and established comprehensive plans for future emergencies. The National Institutes of Health’s Climate and Health Initiative was eliminated and multiple grants paused in March 2025. Research on extreme weather and health may proceed, according to new agency guidelines, yet overall cuts to the NIH will impact capacity to fund new studies and new research avenues. The National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, which funds research on environmental health, faces a 36% reduction in its budget, from $994 million to $646 million.

Access to cool spaces is key to preventing heat-illness and death. Yet cuts, regulatory rollbacks, and program eliminations across the federal government are preventing progress towards ensuring every American can afford their energy bills. At DOE, rollbacks in energy efficiency standards for cooling equipment and the ending of the EnergyStar program will impact the costs of cooling for consumers. Thankfully, DOE’s Home Energy Rebates survived the initial funding freezes and the funding has been deployed to states to support home upgrades like heat pumps, insulation, air sealing, and mechanical ventilation. At HUD, the Green and Resilient Retrofits Program has been paused as of March 2025, which was set to fund important upgrades to affordable housing units that would have decreased the costs of cooling for vulnerable residents. At EPA, widespread pauses and cancellations in Inflation Reduction Act programs have put projects to provide more affordable cooling solutions on pause. At the U.S. Department of Agriculture, all grantees for the Rural Energy for America Program, which funds projects that provide reliable and affordable energy in rural communities, have been asked to resubmit their grants to receive allocated funding. These delays put rural community members at risk of extreme heat this summer, where they face particular risks due to their unique health and sociodemographic vulnerabilities. Finally, while the remaining $400 million in LIHEAP funding was released for this year, it faces elimination in FY26 appropriations. If this money is lost, people will very likely die and utilities will not be able to cover the costs of unpaid bills and delay improvements to the grid infrastructure to increase reliability.

Uncertain progress towards heat policy goals

Momentum towards establishing a federal heat stress rule as quickly as possible has stalled. The regulatory process for the Heat Injury and Illness Prevention in Outdoor and Indoor Work Settings is proceeding, with hearings that began June 16 and are scheduled to continue until July 3. It remains to be seen how the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) will proceed with the existing rule as written. OSHA’s National Emphasis Program (NEP) for Heat will continue until April 6, 2026. This program focuses on identifying and addressing heat-related injuries and illnesses in workplaces, and educating employers on how they can reduce these impacts on the job. To date, NEP has conducted nearly 7,000 inspections connected to heat risks, which lead to 60 heat citations and nearly 1,400 “hazard alert” letters being sent to employers.

How Can Subnational Governments Ready for this Upcoming Heat Season?

Downscaled federal capacity comes at a time when many states are facing budget shortfalls compounded by federal funding cuts and rescissions. The American Rescue Plan Act, the COVID-19 stimulus package, has been a crucial source of revenue for many local and state governments that enabled expansion in services, like extreme heat response. That funding must be spent by December 2026, and many subnational governments are facing funding cliffs of millions of dollars that could result in the elimination of these programs. While there is a growing attention to heat, it is still often deprioritized in favor of work on hazards that damage property.

Even in this environment, local and state governments can still make progress on addressing extreme heat’s impacts and saving lives. Subnational governments can:

Conduct a data audit to ensure they are tracking the impacts of extreme heat, like emergency medical services activations, emergency room visits, hospitalizations, and deaths, and tracking expenditures dedicated to any heat-related activity.

Develop a heat preparedness and response plan, to better understand how to leverage existing resources, capacities, and partnerships to address extreme heat. This includes understanding emergency authorities available at the local and state level that could be leveraged in a crisis.

Use their platforms to educate the public about extreme heat and share common-sense strategies that reduce the risk of heat-illness, and public health departments can target communications to the most vulnerable.

Ensure existing capital planning and planned infrastructure build-outs prioritize resilience to extreme heat and set up cooling standards for new and existing housing and for renters. Subnational governments can also leverage strategies that reduce their fiscal risk, such as implementing heat safety practices for their own workforces and encouraging or requiring employers to deploy these practices as a way to reduce workers compensation claims.

This “is the first year where we have reduced both our near-term and long-term passenger EV adoption outlook,” BNEF said in its 2025 Electric Vehicles Outlook.
“Despite these positive tailwinds, we see slower EV adoption in the short and long-term due in large part to the changing landscape in the U.S.,” McKerracher said in a statement.
“It results in cumulative EV sales between now and 2030 being 14 million units lower,” according to the report.
In China, average utilization of battery plants is now below 50%,” BNEF said in a statement.","Sales are still growing, but policy changes in the United States are significantly slowing the country’s adoption of electric vehicles, BloombergNEF said Wednesday in its annual global outlook for the sector.

This “is the first year where we have reduced both our near-term and long-term passenger EV adoption outlook,” BNEF said in its 2025 Electric Vehicles Outlook. “Policy changes in the U.S. are the biggest factor, with national fuel-economy targets being rolled back, supportive elements of the Inflation Reduction Act either being removed or under threat, and the potential removal of California’s ability to set its own air quality standards.”

Electric vehicles set global sales records last year, and adoption rapidly increased in emerging markets across Asia and Latin America, according to Colin McKerracher, lead author of the report and BNEF’s head of clean transport and energy storage.

“Despite these positive tailwinds, we see slower EV adoption in the short and long-term due in large part to the changing landscape in the U.S.,” McKerracher said in a statement. “This shift in global adoption will also have major impacts on the battery industry, leading to overcapacity in manufacturing.”

BNEF now expects passenger EV sales in the United States to rise from 1.6 million this year to 4.1 million in 2030, to make up 27% of total passenger car sales by the end of the decade. In last year’s report, the firm had anticipated EVs would make up 48% of sales by that time.

“It results in cumulative EV sales between now and 2030 being 14 million units lower,” according to the report.

The impact on battery supply is significant, according to BNEF.

The firm’s global battery demand outlook between 2025 and 2035 “fell 8% compared to last year’s, equating to 3.4 terawatt-hours fewer batteries” — a majority of which (2.8 TWh) can be attributed to decreasing passenger EV sales in the U.S., “where demand is 42% less than in last year’s outlook,” the report said.

This dynamic is leading to continued overcapacity, “driving battery costs lower and intensifying market competition. In China, average utilization of battery plants is now below 50%,” BNEF said in a statement. “Despite a near-term slowdown, the long-term growth for battery metals remains strong as EVs are adopted more quickly across all segments.”",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/2CKHkIRZOFsddEFk56sfBmKYl905vJ7Pofo50OCBiuc/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9SaXZpYW5fTm9ybWFsX0lsbGlub2lzXzNfNS4yMC4yNS5qcGc=.webp,N,,2025-06-23 18:11:51.782365

New industrial strategy integrates digital tech, life sciences, and services, positioning the UK as a global clean energy and innovation leader.

The UK government has unveiled a sweeping 10-year industrial strategy aimed at slashing corporate electricity bills and cementing the country’s leadership in clean energy, advanced manufacturing, and frontier technologies.

The strategy, announced on Monday, pledges up to £2.8 billion in R&D investment for advanced manufacturing over the next five years to fuel automation, digitisation, and commercialisation. It is part of a broader push to scale up clean energy industries and future-proof the UK’s economy.

“This government is doubling down on Britain’s clean power strengths as we build this new era of clean energy abundance, helping deliver good jobs, energy security and lower household bills,” said Energy Secretary Ed Miliband.

Clean Energy Revolution

The centrepiece of the plan is the Clean Energy Industries Sector Plan, which targets more than £30 billion in annual investment by 2035—more than double current levels. Since July, the UK has already attracted £40 billion in private clean energy investment.

As part of this momentum, Great British Energy will receive an additional £700 million—on top of a previously announced £300 million—to develop domestic manufacturing for floating offshore platforms, electric cables, and hydrogen infrastructure. This injection, combined with industry and Crown Estate co-investment, brings total supply chain funding to £1.7 billion.

“Great British Energy will help the UK win the global race for clean energy jobs and growth,” said CEO Dan McGrail. “We are working closely with businesses to invest in strategic needs and get funding out fast.”

The strategy also includes plans to expand the Clean Industry Bonus—an incentive scheme to localise clean energy manufacturing—across sectors like hydrogen and onshore wind, directing investment into coastal and industrial communities.

Broader Sectoral Ambitions

Alongside clean energy and manufacturing, the strategy also focuses on:

Life Sciences: Up to £600 million for a Health Data Research Service to build an AI-ready, secure health platform.

Creative Industries: Launch of a £150 million growth fund for screen, music, and gaming sectors.

Professional and Business Services: Introduction of AI tools, mutual recognition of qualifications to boost exports, and creation of five new industry hubs.

Digital & Technology: A push to place the UK among the top three global tech innovation ecosystems, with focus on AI, quantum, semiconductors, cyber, and engineering biology.

“The UK’s pitch is clear – build it in Britain. Power the world,” said Miliband.

Finding consensus on a funding strategy to fix and slightly upgrade the state’s transportation infrastructure wasn’t easy. Nearly every lawmaker on the legislative transportation committee expressed concerns about aspects of the bill or the rushed, convoluted process leading up to the vote. House Bill 2025 passed out of committee on a 7-5 vote along party lines, with only Democrats in support, and now heads to the full House.

With less than 10 days left in this year’s legislative session, it’s unclear if Democrats have enough votes to pass the package in the House and the Senate — particularly after one of their members, who was removed from the committee before Friday’s vote, said he opposed the bill and will continue to do so.

The latest version of the bill would raise Oregon’s gas tax from 40 cents to 55 cents per gallon; increase most DMV fees; implement a new transfer tax on car sales; raise taxes on truck drivers; triple the state’s 0.1% payroll tax for transit; and enact a charge that electric vehicle users would pay per mile driven, among other increases.

Most of that new revenue would go to the State Highway Fund , half of which goes to the Oregon Department of Transportation for road maintenance and operations. Counties also receive about 30% of the fund for transportation-related services, and cities receive about one-fifth of the money.

Democrats on the committee all voted in favor of the bill — but only after Democratic leaders replaced one of their members on the committee, Sen. Mark Meek of Gladstone , who said he did not support the package and its many tax hikes.

“I have to admit, just fully state, that this package is fundamentally flawed for many reasons,” said Meek, who attended the committee meeting as a non-voting member. “One of the reasons is that it’s not affordable to Oregonians.”

Public transit districts statewide would benefit from the largest source of new revenue in the bill. Incrementally increasing the state’s payroll tax from 0.1 percent to 0.3 percent would raise about $450 million per year by 2031, according to a legislative revenue analysis, nearly all of which would go to transit providers.

But most of the new revenue in the bill would be directed to the State Highway Fund for road maintenance and operations. For instance, a new 1 percent transfer tax on the sale of used vehicles and a 2 percent tax on the sale of new cars would eventually raise more than $270 million a year by 2028, according to the state’s analysis.

A third major new revenue source, a 15 cent hike to the gas tax, would bring in more than $210 million to the State Highway Fund every year after 2027, the analysis said. Tying the gas tax to inflation would eventually bring in an additional $110 million annually, it said.

Several Democrats said Friday that they didn’t necessarily agree with every tax increase or provision in the bill, but they said they support allocating more money to the Oregon Department of Transportation and local governments, which have asked for more funding to better support the state’s transportation network.

“I think the fundamental framework, the building blocks that you’ve landed here, are something that the Legislature can be really proud of,” said Senate President Rob Wagner, a Democrat from Lake Oswego, who appointed himself as Meek’s replacement on the committee before Friday’s meeting.

All five Republicans voted against the bill. They said the dozens of tax and fee increases in the proposal would hurt Oregonians while not doing enough to address inefficiencies and mismanagement at the Oregon Department of Transportation , which has received significant scrutiny in the past year following multiple agency reviews that uncovered those flaws.

“I was really hopeful that we would be here today with ... a product of collaboration,” said Sen. Bruce Starr, a Republican from Dundee who spent months negotiating with Democrats on the package. “Unfortunately, that’s not where we’re at today, and for me, that’s frustrating and sad.”

Starr conceded that some technical aspects of the bill were negotiated by both parties. But he blasted many of the tax hikes, particularly the provision to eventually tie the value of the gas tax to inflation.

Although most of the new taxes would target car drivers, truckers would also pay higher taxes under the proposed bill. By 2030, truck drivers would pay an extra $140 million per year in weight-mile taxes.

The package would also raise DMV fees, increase the state’s vehicle privilege tax and implement a new road user charge that would require drivers of certain vehicles to pay per mile driven starting in 2026. That would eventually include many light electric vehicles and medium-weight electric vehicles owned by businesses.

The bill includes some provisions intended to increase oversight of the Oregon Department of Transportation , such as regular audits and more legislative monitoring of major projects. It also includes some measures to ensure that truckers and car drivers eventually both pay their fair share of taxes for their use of Oregon’s roads.

The partisan vote came as a disappointment to some Democrats who had hoped the need for more transportation funding across Oregon would incentivize some Republicans to support the package.

While Republicans said the latest version of the bill was far from a compromise, some progressive Democrats said the bill landed on middle ground because it did not include all of the tax hikes they had proposed.

“There are definitely things that I firmly believe could have been a lot better about the process,” said Sen. Khanh Pham, a Portland Democrat. “But at this moment, I just think the stakes are really high, and I don’t think Oregonians can afford to take the damage, the hurt that will cause if we kick the can down the road.”

Michigan is once again receiving national recognition as a leader in the future of the advanced manufacturing and clean energy industries, reflecting the impact of the state’s “Make It in Michigan” strategy.

Area Development, the leading publication covering site selection and facility planning, is recognizing Michigan with a Silver Shovel as part of its 20th Annual Shovel Awards, which are presented each year to the states that have achieved the most success in terms of new job creation and company capital investment. This marks Michigan’s 16th Shovel since the award’s 2006 establishment. Previous Silver Shovels were earned in 2006, 2007, 2009, 2010, 2012, 2013, 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019, 2020 and 2023; Gold Shovels were earned in 2011 and 2021.

Michigan is receiving its Silver Shovel recognition for 12 transformational projects, which were delivered through the state’s “Make It in Michigan” economic development strategy focused on investing in People, revitalizing Places and securing Projects.

One of these projects was recognized as a Manufacturing Project of the Year: in February 2024, Corning Inc. announced it would build a new manufacturing facility in Richland Township in Saginaw County with an investment of up to $900 million, supported by the Michigan Strategic Fund. The project was initially expected to create over 1,100 jobs, with starting wages expected to exceed the median wage for the region. In April 2025, Corning Inc. announced that it would increase its investment to $1.5 billion, adding 400 new high-paying advanced manufacturing jobs for a total of 1,500.

The new manufacturing facility, currently under construction, will be dedicated to the production of U.S.-made solar components. This investment will help meet a sharp rise in demand for solar power that the current domestic solar supply chain cannot meet. As reported by the International Energy Agency, the United States added almost 50 gigawatts (GW) of new solar photovoltaic capacity to the grid in 2024, shattering the previous record of 32.3 GW in 2023.

The latest Silver Shovel Award is proof that Team Michigan’s commitment to executing the ‘Make It in Michigan’ economic development strategy focused on People, Places and Projects is delivering results across the state through transformational investments. While work remains, this recognition fuels our relentless resolve to illustrate the impact of every investment, each vote of confidence, regardless of size, in our state. As this and other projects demonstrate, there is promising commercial value in a clean energy future for all Michiganders.

Michigan’s Clean Energy Leadership

Michigan is a proven clean energy leader, from attracting investments and creating jobs to legislation. The 2024 Clean Jobs America Report from E2, based on an analysis of the U.S. Department of Energy’s 2024 Energy and Employment Report (USEER), shows Michigan continues to lead the race for clean energy jobs. According to the report, Michigan is home to 127,690 clean energy jobs, outpacing 44 states’ job numbers, with clean energy jobs continuing to grow nearly twice as fast as economy-wide employment. The 2024 EER report also highlighted Michigan’s position as a leader in overall energy sector job growth, behind only Texas and California.

In August 2024, LuxWall and UL Solutions celebrated the opening of their high-tech facilities in Litchfield and Auburn Hills respectively, helping to create jobs and advance innovation in energy-efficient glass and battery testing. These investments highlight the success of the state's strategy to attract high-tech, sustainable industries and create opportunities for everyone to “Make It” in Michigan.

And in September 2024, the MEDC worked in conjunction with MIT Technology Review Insights on a national survey and report to show how senior U.S. executives are planning for climate change. Executives highlighted the availability of climate-planning programs and access to natural resources as a top criterion when making relocation decisions, with many selecting the Midwest as the least exposed region of the country.

Thanks to the state’s MI Healthy Climate Plan, abundant natural resources and attractive business climate for clean energy investments, Michigan is positioning itself as a leader in the industry.

Throughout the country, interest in nuclear power is higher than it’s been in decades, and many state governments are looking for ways to help bring a new generation of nuclear reactors to their states. State officials who wish to promote nuclear power face a serious obstacle, however. Unlike most types of electric generation, which are licensed or regulated primarily at the state level, nuclear power plants are federally licensed. The process for obtaining a federal license from the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is long and cumbersome, and the regulatory roadblocks it puts up can severely limit states’ room to maneuver when it comes to nuclear policy.

Recently, a coalition of states has sought to reorder the balance of regulatory authority over nuclear energy by giving states a greater role in determining nuclear plant approval. Texas and Utah filed suit against the NRC in December, claiming the agency had exceeded its authority in requiring federal licensure for smaller nuclear plants.

The basis of the lawsuit involves a close reading of the NRC’s statutory authority to issue licenses for particular plants. The Atomic Energy Act of 1946 gave the Atomic Energy Commission (predecessor of the NRC) sweeping licensing authority over “any equipment or device capable of making use of fissionable material or peculiarly adapted for making use of atomic energy.” In 1954, however, the act was amended to narrow federal licensing authority. According to the new language, federal regulators had licensing authority over “any equipment or device, except an atomic weapon, determined by rule of the Commission to be capable of making use or special nuclear material in such quantity as to be of significance to the common defense and security, or in such manner as to affect the health and safety of the public.” In layman’s terms, regulators could only require a license for facilities large enough to pose a risk either to national security or to public safety.

Federal regulators treated these provisions as identical, requiring a license for all nuclear reactors regardless of size or other factors. As a result, federal licenses have been required even for research reactors like the one at Texas A&M University, which is so small it can barely power a single lightbulb.

This may have be somewhat understandable at the time, when large-scale light water reactors posed unique safety and national security risks as the model for nuclear generation. Today, an increasing focus in nuclear energy development is small modular reactors (SMRs), which have a much different risk profile. For example, while the meltdown of a standard reactor could require evacuation of the surrounding area, the NRC has concluded that a meltdown from an SMR likely would not require evacuation of the facility itself.

Importantly, limiting federal licensing authority would not leave smaller nuclear plants unregulated. The narrowing of federal authority would simply clear the way for states to reassert their traditional role as primary regulators of electric generation within their borders. Different states could craft regulatory systems calibrated to their own preferences and situations.

It’s hard to say whether this suit will ultimately be successful; however, the notion that states should play a bigger role in nuclear regulation is a reasonable one. Regardless of the outcome, Congress and the NRC should consider creating regulations that give state governments more authority in overseeing the use of nuclear power in their states.",https://www.rstreet.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/energy-nuclear-power-plant-By-hornyak.jpg,N,,2025-06-23 19:07:58.681482

In this article, the authors provide a high-level refresher of the requirements of (and recent updates to) California's ""first-of-its-kind"" climate-related disclosure laws, and identify key steps that businesses can take to prepare for compliance.

In late 2023, California enacted ""first-of-its-kind"" climate-related disclosure laws comprising the following:

Climate Corporate Data Accountability Act (California Senate Bill 253 (SB253)) – relating to greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions disclosures;

Climate-Related Financial Risk Act (California Senate Bill 261 (SB261)) – relating to climate-related financial risk disclosures; and

Voluntary Carbon Market Disclosure Act (California Assembly Bill (AB1305)) – relating to anti-greenwashing disclosures.

This ground-breaking legislation is set to reshape corporate reporting standards, with ripple effects outside California, including even outside the United States. With reporting deadlines on the horizon (or already upon us), businesses within the scope of these laws must act now to understand their obligations and mitigate compliance risks.

This article provides a high-level refresher of the requirements of (and recent updates to) these laws, and identifies key steps that businesses can take to prepare for compliance.

SB253 (GHG EMISSIONS DISCLOSURES) AND SB261 (CLIMATE-RELATED FINANCIAL RISK DISCLOSURES)

Overview

SB253 and SB261 – which were signed into law on October 7, 2023, and which form part of California's ""Climate Accountability Package"" – impose certain climate-related corporate disclosure requirements, on U.S. companies, public or private, that meet certain revenue thresholds:

SB253 requires businesses with annual revenues of more than $1 billion that do business in California to disclose:

Scope 1 and Scope 2 GHG emissions, starting in 2026; and

Scope 3 GHG emissions, starting in 2027.

SB261 applies to businesses with annual revenues of more than $500 million that do business in California, and mandates disclosure of climate-related financial risks and mitigation measures taken to address such risks, starting January 1, 2026.

Legislative Updates

Following passage of SB253 and SB261 at the end of 2023 – and the subsequent lawsuit challenging the two laws, discussed below – commentators expected that at least some amendments would be passed in 2024, including to clarify and potentially provide relief around effective dates for compliance.

Initially, Governor Gavin Newsom proposed amendments that sought, among other things, to delay the initial reporting deadlines, but these were not adopted.

However, in September 2024, the California Senate proposed different amendments, which were ultimately enacted as California Senate Bill 219 (SB219),1 which introduced limited amendments to SB253 and SB261.

Some key amendments from SB219 include:

Parent-Level Reporting Consolidation: While SB261 originally contemplated consolidation (and hence, reporting) at the parent-level if both a parent and one or more of its subsidiaries fell within the scope of SB261, SB253 was silent about consolidation. SB219 clarified that companies subject to SB253 could also consolidate at the parent-level.

Extended Rulemaking Deadline: SB253 originally required the California Air Resources Board (CARB) to develop and adopt implementing regulations by January 1, 2025. Under SB219, this deadline was extended to July 1, 2025.

Scope 3 Reporting Flexibility: While SB253 originally required reporting entities to disclose Scope 3 GHG emissions within 180 days of Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions disclosures, SB219 now allows CARB to set this deadline at its discretion. However, the initial Scope 3 GHG emissions disclosures are still required to be made during 2027.

Timing of Filing Fee Payment: SB219 removed the requirement for reporting entities to pay filing fees at the time disclosure filings are submitted. Notably, SB219 did not eliminate the obligation to pay these fees altogether, the amounts of which are to be set by CARB.

CARB's Use of Third-Party Organizations: Originally, CARB was required to engage a third-party organization (i.e., an emissions reporting organization or a climate reporting organization) to undertake certain duties, including, for example, engaging an emissions reporting organization to develop a reporting program to receive disclosures under SB253. Under SB219, CARB has flexibility and may – but is not required to – engage a third-party organization to undertake certain duties.

Legal Challenge Updates

Several business and industry trade organizations, including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the California Chamber of Commerce, filed a lawsuit in January 20242 in federal court against CARB (and its representatives) seeking to overturn SB253 and SB261. The plaintiffs in that legal challenge contend that SB253 and SB251:

Violate the First Amendment by compelling speech (Count I);

Are preempted by the U.S. Constitution and federal law, including the Clean Air Act, and violate the Supremacy Clause (Count II); and

Violate the U.S. Constitution's limitations on extraterritorial regulation, including the Dormant Commerce Clause (Count III).

In its November 5, 2024 order, the court denied summary judgment, which had addressed Count I (the First Amendment claims).

Subsequently, in its February 3, 2025 order,3 the court dismissed Count II (the Supremacy Clause claims) and Count III (as to the extraterritorial claims). This dismissal applies to SB253 and SB261 in different ways: (a) Counts II and III as to SB253 are dismissed without prejudice on jurisdictional grounds; (b) Count II as to SB261 dismissed with prejudice ""for failure to state a claim""; and (c) Count III as to SB261 dismissed without prejudice ""for failure to state a claim"". As to the claims dismissed without prejudice, the plaintiffs had 21 days after the date of the order (i.e., February 24, 2025) to file a second amended complaint.

The February 2025 order's dismissal bodes well for the general survival of SB253 and SB261.

CARB UPDATES

Exercise of Enforcement Discretion

On December 5, 2024, CARB issued an Enforcement Notice for SB253.4 CARB announced that it will exercise enforcement discretion for the first reporting cycle in 2026 relating to Scope 1 and Scope 2 GHG emissions disclosures. As a result, subject companies making a good-faith effort to comply with SB253 will not face penalties for incomplete Scope 1 and Scope 2 GHG emissions disclosures, and may submit initial disclosures in 2026 based on data they possess, or are in the process of collecting.5

Solicitation for Public Comment

CARB also issued an Information Solicitation to Inform Implementation of California Climate-Disclosure Legislation: Senate Bills 253 and 261, as amended by SB219 (the Information Solicitation)6 on December 16, 2024, soliciting public comment, on, for example:

The definition of ""doing business"" in California;

Cost-effective methods to identify businesses that meet reporting thresholds; and

Incorporating external protocols and standard while ensuring regulations meet California-specific needs and continue to align with such protocols and standards.

The deadline to submit public comments was extended to March 21, 2025.

These developments show CARB's awareness of the need for clarity, benchmarking, and certainty that companies need, in order to comply with forthcoming requirements.

Key Compliance Considerations

While companies await CARB's implementing regulations for SB253 and SB261 – as well as outcomes of ongoing litigation – they should continue to take proactive steps to assess their climate disclosure readiness. These include:

Conducting a thorough inventory of existing Scope 1 and Scope 2 GHG emissions data and begin evaluating existing Scope 3 GHG emissions data;

Assessing climate-related financial risks by leveraging frameworks such as the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD); and

Engaging internal stakeholders, legal counsel, and sustainability experts. Taking these steps now will help mitigate compliance risks and stay ahead of evolving regulatory expectations.

AB1305 (ANTI-GREENWASHING DISCLOSURES)

Overview

AB1305 was adopted at the same time as SB253 and SB261. AB1305 – an anti-greenwashing law7 – is aimed at increasing transparency and accountability around certain climate-related claims (e.g., achievement of ""net zero"" emissions), and the use of voluntary carbon offsets (VCOs). Unlike SB253 and SB261, AB1305 applies to both US and non-US entities that meet certain California nexus requirements.

Legislative Updates

AB1305 has some ambiguity to it. For example, there was ambiguity as to whether the initial disclosures were due by January 1, 2024 or January 1, 2025.8

In 2024, the California Assembly sought to clarify certain ambiguities through a proposed amendment to AB1305,9 that would have, among other things, clearly set the deadline for initial disclosures. Ultimately, these efforts were unsuccessful.

Furthermore, in an opinion dated July 23, 2024,10 the California Attorney General clarified that renewable energy credits (RECs) used outside of California's regulatory programs are not within the scope of VCOs (as defined in AB1305).

Additional clarification may come through further legislative activity in 2025, and we will continue to monitor for updates.

Legal Challenge Updates

AB1305 has not, to date, been the subject of legal challenge.

Key Compliance Considerations

Absent further clarification, companies will need to treat AB1305 as already being in effect, and should be taking proactive steps to ensure prompt and ongoing compliance. These steps include:

Reviewing and assessing all public statements made by the company regarding claims within the scope of AB1305 (e.g., net-zero commitments and emissions reductions) and/or VCOs being used, purchased, marketed and/or sold in California.

Reviewing evidence and other information to support any such claims and/or any such VCOs, which evidence or other information may be included in reports already prepared by the company (e.g., TCFD reports, ESG/sustainability reports, etc.).

Beginning (or continuing, as applicable) discussions with third-party verifiers.

Preparing and publishing initial disclosures on the company's website to the extent the company is potentially subject to AB1305.11

Establishing and maintaining robust internal controls, including to address public claims and VCOs, and to ensure annual review of AB1305 disclosures.

Conducting ongoing review of internal policies and procedures.

Engaging internal stakeholders, legal counsel, and sustainability experts.

Nuvve has been central to these deployments with 12 (5 DC and 7 AC) V2G-capable chargers installed in New Mexico for electric school buses.","The integration of electric vehicles (EVs) into the U.S. power grid is vital for a sustainable energy future, especially as EV adoption in the U.S. is projected to reach 27 million vehicles by 2030. This surge necessitates substantial infrastructural investment as industry leaders and utilities redefine electric vehicle charging infrastructure (EVCI) not just as a facilitator of transportation, but as a strategic asset essential for supporting grid reliability, flexibility, and resilience. Key advances in bidirectional charging and battery energy storage systems (BESS) are enabling EVs to function as distributed energy resources (DERs), with the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) noting that they will become the primary source of demand-side flexibility in a system increasingly dominated by renewables.

To this end, utilities across the US are piloting Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) programs in collaboration with fleet operators, with companies like Nuvve and Dominion Energy pioneering innovative business models that utilize EV fleets for managing peak loads, demand response and peak shaving. Data from Power Technology Research indicates V2G adoption is set to expand considerably, reaching an installed base of nearly 300,000 V2G-capable chargers in the U.S. by 2035. This trend reflects the dual value proposition of leveraging EVCI across both transportation and energy domains.

Evolving legislative and technical foundations for V2G, DER integration

On April 4, 2024, Maryland became the first U.S. state to mandate utility support for vehicle-to-grid systems. The Distributed Renewable Integration and Vehicle Electrification (DRIVE) Act requires utilities to submit interconnection and virtual power plant (VPP) plans by 2025, with implementation deadlines set through 2028. PTR’s analysis suggests that legislation such as the DRIVE Act can help defer costly grid expansions while enhancing resilience against electrical outages. The Act required utilities to submit V2G charging plans to the Maryland Public Service Commission by 1st April 2025 and virtual power plant plans by 1st July 2025, with a deadline of 1st September 2028 for implementation of time-of-use rates.

Shortly following Maryland's initiative, Colorado enacted similar legislation in May 2024, requiring Xcel Energy, the state's largest electric utility, to establish a virtual power plant program with a performance-based compensation tariff by 2025. This legislation calls to streamline grid interconnection processes and distribution network upgrades. Further, in August, the California Senate also passed legislation requiring all EVs of all weight classes to support future V2G capabilities. These state-level legislative moves are laying the groundwork for widespread V2G integration and utility participation.

Private sector efforts are also accelerating in collaboration with state programs. In the past, Nuvve has partnered with various bus fleets, including NRT Bus in Massachusetts, and deployed 25 bi-directional DC charging stations for electric school buses. The initiative received major funding through the Environmental Protection Agency's Clean School Bus Grant. Recently in February 2025, Nuvve secured a $400 million Statewide Price Agreement in New Mexico for V2G charging infrastructure deployments across the state over the next four years.

Texas remains a leader in V2G integration, with the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) and the Public Utility Commission supporting multiple pilot projects, including the Aggregate DER (ADER) pilot in Houston and Oncor Electric's VPP. The state has endorsed several pilot programs aimed at evaluating the impact of V2G technology on grid stability and efficiency, underpinned by its regulatory framework and grid modernization initiatives.

On the technical standards front, 19th February 2025 marked a major milestone with the release of the Electric Vehicle Supply Equipment (EVSE) Power Export Permitting Standard by the National Electrical Manufacturers Association (NEMA). This standard streamlines the permitting process for bidirectional charging and provides a foundational framework for developing compensation mechanisms for Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) participants. It offers validation for ongoing pilot projects and helps accelerate future deployments by enabling aggregators to build scalable business models. Additionally, local governments benefit from having a vetted reference standard, which reduces administrative delays and promotes consistency in permitting practices.

Canada is also taking initial steps toward V2G charging as of 2024 to support its local distribution and bulk electricity systems and inviting integrations of vehicles fleets as grid assets. Ontario's Independent Electricity System Operator (IESO) announced $9.5 million in V2G funding in 2024 for demand-side electrification projects focused on EVs and grid flexibility. The program includes funds for managed charging (V1G), Vehicle-to-Home (V2H), Vehicle-to-Building (V2B), and bidirectional V2G energy exports.

Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G): Turning electric school buses into grid assets

One of the most promising applications of V2G technology in North America has been the deployment of electric school buses (ESBs). With fixed schedules and long idle periods, ESBs offer a consistent opportunity to support grid needs. As of 2024, over 300 V2G-enabled electric school buses are in operation across at least 19 states, collectively delivering an estimated 15,000 kWh back to the grid during peak summer demand, according to reports from utility pilot programs in Virginia and California. Unlike passenger EVs or commercial trucks, school buses operate on fixed routes and experience extended idle periods, making them particularly well-suited for bidirectional charging.

Key players in these deployments include electric bus fleets such as North Reading Transportation (NRT) Bus alongside charging infrastructure providers like Nuvve and its subsidiary Fermata Energy. With V2G standards gaining traction, site compliance is on the rise. V2G sites are now capable of allowing heavy-duty bidirectional-capable EVs to function as grid-tied generators, particularly while charging via AC. Nuvve has been central to these deployments with 12 (5 DC and 7 AC) V2G-capable chargers installed in New Mexico for electric school buses. Nuvve has also rolled out AC V2G installations in Delaware which enables Ford Mach-E electric trucks to deliver grid services while parked, showcasing the benefits of AC bidirectional power flow.

Dominion Energy’s Electric School Bus Program, initiated in 2019, in collaboration with Thomas Built Buses and Sonny Merryman has surpassed 1.5 million electric miles with over 135 buses in 25 districts, establishing it as the largest utility-led electric school bus initiative in the U.S. As of 2023, Dominion Energy deployed over 50 electric school buses equipped with V2G capabilities in Virginia. Each bus is fitted with a 226 kWh battery capable of discharging up to 60 kW back to the grid, collectively providing up to 3 MW during peak demand periods. The initiative not only bolsters grid stability but also offers environmental benefits, having mitigated approximately 1,632 short tons of greenhouse gas emissions to date. [6]

Moreover, in California, San Diego Gas & Electric (SDG&E) has been administrating a five-year V2G pilot project since 2022, involving six 60 kW bidirectional chargers. Under the SDG&E’s Emergency Load Reduction Program (ELRP), Nuvve has partnered with the San Diego Unified School District to equip 10 electric school buses with Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) charging capabilities, enabling compensation of $2 per kWh for energy supplied during peak demand or emergency events. This initiative demonstrates the viability of V2G as a revenue-generating model for school districts, with potential savings of up to $7,200 per bus annually.

While questions arise regarding the application of V2G technology in the heavy-duty trucking sector, logistical challenges have hindered deployments in this segment. However, depot-based use cases, particularly in school transportation, have proven viable with numerous bidirectional buses already contributing significant kilowatt-hours to local grids. V2G applications remain less prevalent for heavy-duty electric trucks, such as Class 8 vehicles, due to unpredictable routes and stringent logistics schedules, which complicate the reliable discharge of energy without disrupting operations.

Strategic integration and grid resilience

The U.S. EV and EVCI sectors are entering a new era of technological maturity. Bidirectional charging and vehicle-to-grid (V2G) capabilities are transitioning from pilot phases into early commercialization. Over the next decade, V2G-capable chargers are forecast to grow at a CAGR of 70% from 2025 to 2035,[8] driven by fleet electrification and school bus deployments. Utilities in California and New York are piloting real-time pricing models by 2026, with broader regulatory adoption expected by 2028 as managed charging and distributed energy resource (DER) frameworks mature.

One of the most critical enablers of this transformation is cross-sector collaboration. Nuvve’s V2G platform partnerships with OEMs such as Thomas Built Buses, Blue Bird, Lion Electric, and IC Bus have already supported over 20 commercial deployments across the U.S. since 2022. These collaborations demonstrate a scalable blueprint for integrating EVs into grid services while delivering total cost of ownership (TCO) savings of 30–40% for fleet operators leveraging energy arbitrage and grid incentives. As BESS and smart inverters continue to evolve, EVs will no longer be passive loads but active, dispatchable grid assets—playing a central role in enhancing grid resilience, load balancing, and renewable integration by 2030 and beyond.","https://img.tdworld.com/files/base/ebm/tdworld/image/2025/06/6859b5a1894e8bea9f533a6e-gettyimages2100760626.png?auto=format,compress&fit=fill&fill=blur&w=1200&h=630",N,,2025-06-23 17:10:05.819439

However, they’re also controversial, and the current administration wants to get rid of them ASAP. Turns out, that’s not happening — at least, not through the avenues the administration expected to use — thanks to the senate parliamentarian.

Speaking of challenges facing EVs, it might soon be illegal to hardwire in your own Level 2 charging station, and homeowners might turn to a workaround with some added risk. On the plus side, it turns out that EV battery packs are degrading slower than ever, a tidbit of good news in all of this. Oh, and the UAW’s in hot water for something new.

This issue of The Morning Dump is a bit late, and that’s on me. However, I hope you’re still able to grab a cup of something caffeinated, possibly even some lunch this late in the day, and peruse some bite-sized tidbits of automotive news.

The Plan To Scrap Electric Mail Vans Is On Ice For Now

The USPS currently has around 7,200 electric vehicles, some of which are Ford e-Transit cargo vans that anyone can buy, and some of which are electric variants of Oshkosh’s purpose-built Next-Generation Delivery Vehicle. Delivery by electric vehicle is a great concept with low running costs, but it seems the current administration wants to force USPS to ditch its electric mail vans. Why get rid of them? Well, it’s a $3 billion program and it has has faced delays, though it’s possible part of the rationale is ideologically driven. Via Reuters:

Senate Republicans argued scrapping EVs would “focus USPS on delivering mail and not achieving the environmental aims pushed by the Biden administration.”

Those who are dealing with procurement and use of these electric delivery vehicles don’t seem particularly happy about this movement, partly because hundreds of millions of dollars have already been spent on plug-in vans, partly because removing them would leave USPS with a serious shortfall, and partly because the electric mail vans actually seem modern and seem to work, as Reuters reports:

USPS warned on June 13 that scrapping the electric vehicles would cost it $1.5 billion, including $1 billion to replace its current fleet of EVs and $500 million in EV infrastructure rendered useless and “seriously cripple our ability to replace an aging and obsolete delivery fleet.”

Efforts to scrap the postal service’s electric vehicle fleet have been at least stalled for now thanks to the Parliamentarian of the Senate, a position that’s only existed since 1935, and has only even been filled by six people. Among other interpretative duties, the Parliamentarian decides whether a budget clause objected to under the Byrd Rule will require a supermajority to pass, or whether it can be approved by a simple majority. From Reuters:

Senate parliamentarian Elizabeth MacDonough, whose role is to ensure lawmakers follow proper legislative procedure, said a provision to force the sale could not be approved via a simple majority vote in the Republican-controlled chamber and will instead need a 60-vote supermajority, according to Democrats on the Senate Budget Committee.

Given the split of the Senate, it’s unlikely a 60-vote supermajority to make USPS scrap its EVs would be reached. However, it’s worth noting that the role of senate parliamentarian is largely an advisory one. The Vice President, being President of the Senate, can theoretically overrule the parliamentarian’s guidance, and the Senate majority leader can fire the parliamentarian. This certainly isn’t over, but this recent ruling seems to give electric vans the upper hand for now.

From a practical perspective, local mail delivery is just about the perfect application for an electric vehicle. We’re talking about a job with glacial average vehicle speeds, more stops than the door hardware section at Lowes, often relatively short routes, and a central depot to return to. It’s a good enough use case that private sector couriers like FedEx and UPS are giving electric mail vans a shot for city routes, so why not the United States Postal Service?

It May Soon Be Illegal To Install Your Own EV Charging Station

If you’re particularly handy around the house and want to install an EV charging station, you might want to do so soon. Motor Trend reports that under the recently approved 2026 edition of the National Electrical Code, new language means anyone wanting to have a hardwired charging station at home will soon have to pay a professional to install it, along with pulling permits and all that jazz. From Motor Trend:

The change stems from a new addition to the 2026 NEC that reads, “Permanently installed electric vehicle power transfer system equipment shall be installed by qualified persons.” As proposed and ratified, the 2026 NEC defines a qualified person in vague terms likely to be interpreted by states and code enforcement departments to mean a licensed electrician.

The problem with the proposed language is that making do-it-yourself installations illegal doesn’t necessarily stop homeowners from doing their own electrical work. It does guarantee, however, that any EV chargers put in by amateurs will be installed without the appropriate permit and the accompanying safety inspection.

Since the Motor Trend story went live, the National Fire Protection Association has ratified the clause, meaning that once the new code is adopted by individual states, residents of those states will need to hire a professional electrician to install a hardwired Level 2 charging setup at some.

However, there is likely a workaround here. Considering the wording pertains to “Permanently installed electric vehicle power transfer system equipment,” a homeowner installing a UL-listed, GCFI-equipped NEMA 14-50 socket, getting it checked over and okayed by an electrician, and then plugging a NEMA 14-50-compatible Level 2 charger into that socket should be legal, but that comes with extra risk.

In this Reddit thread discussing the issue, several users report issues with inexpensive 14-50 sockets, including one who wrote “I have first hand experience of melting a cheap 14-50 at least, so if this rule leads to more people doing that to avoid hardwiring it would reduce safety like the counter argument in the article states.”

Study Claims Most EV Battery Packs Should Outlast The Cars They’re In

One common concern the public has with EVs is how long the battery packs will actually last. By now, early modern EVs are more than a decade old, and for every Model S with crazy mileage on its original pack, there seems to be a story of a BMW i3 or Nissan Leaf with serious battery degradation. However, battery tech has done anything but stand still over the past ten years or so. Telematics firm Geotab recently released an updated edition of its EV battery health study involving data from 10,000 cars, and the report states that battery degradation has improved significantly.

When we analysed EV battery health in 2019, we found that EV batteries degraded, on average, at a rate of 2.3% per year. However, a new 2024 analysis reveals a significant improvement: EV batteries now degrade at an average of 1.8% per year. This improvement highlights ongoing advancements in battery technology and durability.

According to Geotab research, EV batteries could last 20 years or more if degradation continues at this improved rate. This is particularly encouraging for fleet operators under pressure to reduce CO2 emissions.

Sounds good, right? Well, mostly. There’s math to be done here, and the numbers tell a positive story with one caveat, so let’s start with the upside. The general threshold for degradation under most warranties is about 80 percent of a pack’s original capacity, and if newer packs lose an average of 1.8 percent of original usable capacity every year (it’s not linear, to be clear), that 80 percent capacity threshold won’t be hit until the average EV is 12 years old. That’s not bad considering the average light-duty vehicle on American roads is 12.6 years old according to S&P Global, and that’s average age, not median age. If I were to hazard a guess, the median age would likely trend lower because classics only make up a tiny portion of the fleet but can definitely skew averages.

However, there is a bit of a downside here, and that’s the potential for those in the hooptie end of the market to be somewhat left behind. See, extend the timeline out to 20 years, and the Geotab study suggests the average battery pack will have 64 percent of its original usable capacity by then. That would essentially result in a 36 percent haircut in range, something hybrid and purely combustion-powered cars don’t suffer from when they’re two decades old. Even among staff here, many of us daily drive cars that are around that age, so if that 1.8 percent-per-year loss of original capacity does prove to extrapolate out, hooptie EVs might have limited appeal compared to hooptie hybrids.

[Ed Note: I’m hopeful that this rate flattens out substantially over time, and that my 2021 BMW i3’s battery will last longer than 20 years. -DT].

Another UAW Scandal

Remember in 2023, when United Auto Workers went on strike for better deals that rolled back some of the cuts made during the Great Recession? Well, striking can be expensive, and the UAW pulled funds out of its investment portfolio to cover them. However, Reuters reports that the UAW didn’t re-invest according to policy following this re-allocation of funds for more than a year, and the union could’ve missed out on $80 million according to UAW board members because of this; from Reuters:

UAW investment policy calls for keeping about 30% of its money in stocks, 53% fixed income and 17% alternative investments, according to three union sources and the documents.

The board voted to liquidate about $340 million in stock investments in August 2023 to pay strike costs, according to a union document reviewed by Reuters. The wording of the vote stipulated that the money be reinvested according to union policy after the strike ended and the labor contracts were ratified, though it didn’t specify how quickly.

But almost none of its portfolio was invested in stocks during the year after the strike began in September 2023, according to the records reviewed by Reuters. The news agency was unable to establish why the stock investment wasn’t made.

In February 2025, union staff conducted an analysis that showed the union might have earned $80 million more if its portfolio had been invested according to union policy, according to a document viewed by Reuters.

This irregularity is now being investigated by the feds, and word of it comes at a trying time for the union. Not only has organization momentum weakened over the past year, including failing to organize Mercedes-Benz’s plant in Alabama, but there’s currently another scandal around a dispute between union president Shawn Fein and secretary-treasurer Margaret Mock. Organization often gets workers better pay and conditions, yet allegations like this don’t bolster confidence in the UAW because infighting affects both productivity and image.

What I’m Listening To While Writing TMD

“Y Control” by the Yeah Yeah Yeahs is just a great song, isn’t it? Twinkling guitars, driving drums, and some seriously great lyricism all add up to a timeless track. I mean, just think about the line “I wish I could buy back the woman you stole” for a second.

The Big Question:

Have you seen any electric mail vans out and about? What do you think of them?

Hochul has directed the New York Power Authority to develop and construct a nuclear power plant in upstate, to help meet the state's rising demand for electricity that wouldn't add to climate-changing emissions.
Hochul views nuclear power, which is available on a nearly continuous basis day and night, as part of the solution to closing the gap.
And nuclear power plants are already operating in the towns of Scriba and Ontario in upstate New York.
Also to be determined is how much the new upstate New York nuclear plant would cost, and how soon it could be built and generating power.","Gov. Kathy Hochul wants to find an upstate New York community agreeable to hosting a planned new nuclear power plant.

She insists that finding a location won't be a problem.

""Only receptive, welcoming communities will be considered, and there's a lot of them,"" Hochul said Monday at the Niagara Power Project in Lewiston. ""There's a lot of them because the communities that already host them know these are good-paying, long-term jobs and the benefits to the community are extraordinary.""

The new facility will generate an estimated 1,600 construction jobs and 1,200 permanent jobs once the plant is up and running, she said.

Hochul has directed the New York Power Authority to develop and construct a nuclear power plant in upstate, to help meet the state's rising demand for electricity that wouldn't add to climate-changing emissions.

The governor has pushed for the state to move away from fossil fuels toward renewable sources of energy like solar, wind and hydropower. But the state is facing greater demand for electricity to power homes, vehicles and planned manufacturing plants, like Micron Technology near Syracuse, that are expected to consume huge amounts of electricity.

But the state's older, fossil fuel plants are being retired twice as fast as it is adding new renewable sources, like wind and solar, cutting into the state's generating capacity, according to the New York Independent System Operator, which manages the state's power grid.

Hochul views nuclear power, which is available on a nearly continuous basis day and night, as part of the solution to closing the gap.

Environmental groups, however, have urged Hochul to not add any new nuclear energy capacity in the state, and they reiterated those calls following her announcement.

They view it as much more costly than renewable sources, note that nuclear plants often cost far more than expected to build and generate radioactive waste that must be stored in special sites.

“Nuclear is an expensive, false climate solution that has major environmental problems including the processing and disposal of its uranium fuel,"" said Mark Dunlea, chair of the Green Education and Legal Fund.

“This is the latest mistake in Gov. Hochul's increasing mishandling of the climate crisis,"" he said. ""She is paying far more attention to corporate sales pitches and campaign donations than to the facts about the accelerating climate crisis.”

Deborah Porder of Invisible Scarsdale called nuclear energy a ""bad investment.""

""It is the most expensive form of energy and we all subsidize it,"" Porder said. ""Every community that has a reactor becomes a permanent nuclear waste dump. We should be investing in clean energy − like wind, geothermal, hydropower, solar and storage − which are cheaper and can be built faster.""

State Sen. Liz Krueger, D-Manhattan, raised questions about the proposed new project, including whether radioactive material from it can be ""disposed of in a satisfactory way, or will New Yorkers be stuck dealing with more long-term storage sites like West Valley?""

Others welcomed Hochul's announcement.

State Sen. George Borello, R-Jamestown, called for building a nuclear facility in Dunkirk, at the site of the NRG plant that closed in 2016.

""Dunkirk already has suffered severely since the NRG power plant closing, costing the city jobs and critically needed revenue,"" Borello said in a statement.

Josh Veronica, the Buffalo Niagara Partnership's director of government affairs, said the state needs to embrace all energy sources. He said nuclear is an ""efficient, reliable source of zero-emission energy, and it must be a part of the equation to reverse New York's trend of thinning reliability margins.""

Hochul has directed the Power Authority, in partnership with the state Department of Public Service, to develop at least one new nuclear energy facility with a combined capacity of at least 1 gigawatt of electricity − capable of powering 1 million homes − either alone or in partnership with other entities.

Potential sites will be assessed for suitability based on ""public safety, strength of community support, compatibility with existing infrastructure, as well as skilled labor and land availability,"" Hochul's office said.

""There's no question that communities that already have nuclear power generation in the community already are likely communities,"" said Justin Driscoll, the Power Authority's president and CEO. ""Also communities where there's already embedded energy infrastructure in place, is an added advantage, so potentially, where maybe there was a plant that was closed down previously, a coal plant or something like that where there's already energy infrastructure in place.""

Upstate New York is home to several shuttered plants, including NRG's former sites in Dunkirk and the Town of Tonawanda, and the former Somerset plant in Niagara County.

And nuclear power plants are already operating in the towns of Scriba and Ontario in upstate New York. Those power facilities are owned by Constellation Energy.

David Dardis, Constellation's chief legal and policy officer, praised Hochul's plan. “It is yet another recognition of nuclear energy’s critical role in achieving the nation’s leading clean energy goals,"" he said.

In addition to outreach about a potential site, the Power Authority will be looking for partners, ""either financial partners or investors, or potentially off-takers for the power supply,"" Driscoll said.

Also to be determined is how much the new upstate New York nuclear plant would cost, and how soon it could be built and generating power.

The cost will depend in part on which type of nuclear reactor technology is selected for the project, Driscoll said.

""You could build several small reactors, more advanced in design, or you could build a more traditional plant, and those all have very different costs associated with them,"" Driscoll said. ""It's too early to tell.""

New nuclear reactors in the United States are a rarity – and expensive.

Last year, the second of two new reactors built in Georgia entered into commercial operation. Those two reactors were the first to be built in the nation in decades.

The project was originally projected to cost $14 billion and be completed by 2017. The actual price tag was about $31 billion, coming online years after the project was supposed to be completed.

Hochul said adding nuclear energy capacity is essential to meeting the state's future electricity needs, as older plants are retired. But she pledged the new nuclear technology will be safe, acknowledging the fears stemming from the 1979 accident at Three Mile Island.

""I'm the first Democratic governor in a generation to say to nuclear, 'I'm embracing this, my state will embrace this.'"" she said.

There has never been a Class VI permit issued in Arizona, and there are no pending Class VI permit applications in the state at this time.
This decision may signal that it will be challenging for opponents to successfully challenge EPA’s decision to grant Class VI primacy.
Ultimately, EPA’s Class VI primacy grants to both Louisiana and West Virginia are likely to be upheld.
As more states take primacy in issuing Class VI permits, project proponents anticipate that the Class VI permitting process will move more quickly, allowing more projects to move forward.","Last month saw several developments in the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) ongoing efforts to authorize states to implement Class VI of the federal Underground Injection Control (UIC) program under the Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA) for geologic sequestration of carbon. This push toward state primacy is an important development for the rapidly growing carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) industry, for which Class VI permits are the critical construction and operating permit. Currently, there are 62 CCS projects - including many with multiple wells - with permit applications pending with EPA. Project proponents anticipate that permitting will be faster if administered by the state instead of EPA. The latest developments last month include: (1) EPA’s proposal to grant primacy to Arizona; (2) EPA’s proposal to grant primacy to Texas; (3) a federal court decision rejecting a challenge to EPA’s earlier grant of primacy to Louisiana; and (4) an ongoing challenge to West Virginia’s recently granted primacy.

Arizona

On May 19, 2025, the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) published a federal notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) to grant primacy to Arizona for all well classes under the federal UIC program, including Class VI. 90 Fed. Reg. 21264 (May 19, 2025). Unlike other states that have sought Class VI primacy thus far, Arizona is unique in not currently having primacy over any UIC well classes. If finalized, EPA’s proposal would give Arizona Department of Environmental Quality (ADEQ) authority to regulate all underground injection of carbon dioxide for long-term geological sequestration within Arizona’s jurisdiction, excluding Indian lands. There has never been a Class VI permit issued in Arizona, and there are no pending Class VI permit applications in the state at this time. EPA will hold one virtual public hearing on June 25, 2025, on the proposed grant of primacy to Arizona during the comment period, which ends on July 3, 2025. Based on recent precedent from West Virginia’s Class VI primacy, we expect the final grant of primacy to be issued within a few months.

Texas

As we previously reported, on June 9, 2025, EPA issued a proposal to give Texas primacy over the Class VI program. EPA is taking public comment on the proposal through July 31, 2025, and will hold a public hearing on July 24, 2025. A final rule granting Class VI primacy for Texas is expected in Fall 2025.

When EPA issues final rules, Arizona and Texas would become the fifth and sixth states with primacy over Class VI wells, joining North Dakota (granted primacy in 2018), Wyoming (2020), Louisiana (2023), and West Virginia (2025). Meanwhile, other states’ Class VI primacy grants are facing lawsuits, including Louisiana and West Virginia.

Louisiana

On May 21, 2025, the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit rejected the petition for review of the final rule granting Louisiana Class VI authorization by three environmental organizations, who asserted that EPA’s approval of Louisiana’s primacy did not follow proper procedure and that the transfer liability could potentially lead to environmental harm. Deep South Center for Environmental Justice v. EPA, No. 24-60084, 2025 WL 1452098 (5th Cir. 2025). The Fifth Circuit found that the ENGOs did not have standing to challenge the final rule granting primacy for Louisiana. This decision may signal that it will be challenging for opponents to successfully challenge EPA’s decision to grant Class VI primacy.

West Virginia

EPA is also currently facing a challenge to its Class VI primacy grant to West Virginia in the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals. Petition for Review, West Virginia Surface Owners’ Rights Organization v. Zeldin, No. 25-1384 (4th Cir. filed Apr. 11, 2025). The challenge is based on concerns that there may not be sufficient resources or expertise available to properly regulate the wells. Briefing on the case is scheduled to begin next month.

Ultimately, EPA’s Class VI primacy grants to both Louisiana and West Virginia are likely to be upheld. This marks a continuation of the administration’s cooperative federalism approach to accelerating grants of primacy. As more states take primacy in issuing Class VI permits, project proponents anticipate that the Class VI permitting process will move more quickly, allowing more projects to move forward.

Companies under contract with Apple are required to install clean energy for their Apple production by 2030.","When Lisa P. Jackson was growing up in the Ninth Ward of New Orleans in the 1960s and ’70s, she didn’t appreciate the Mississippi River flowing through the city.

“Back in those days, we thought of rivers as places to put our sewage and our waste, and so they smelled that way and they kind of looked that way,” Jackson said during a May 8 conversation at Stanford University. The construction of a riverside promenade known as the Moon Walk, led by then-Mayor Moon Landrieu, changed her perspective. “[Landrieu] understood, way back then, the power of the natural environment to define a place.”

The connection between humans, communities, and the environment has shaped Jackson’s career. In her role as vice president of environment, policy, and social initiatives at Apple since 2013, she has helped spearhead the company’s efforts to reduce emissions by more than 60 percent. Now, she is leading Apple toward its goal of becoming carbon neutral for its entire footprint by 2030.

Laurene Powell Jobs, founder and president of investment firm and philanthropic venture Emerson Collective, interviewed Jackson on stage at the event. Powell Jobs described Jackson’s life as a “dizzying swirl of brilliance, action, and foresight” and praised her “transformational energy.”

The discussion was part of Big Ideas in Sustainability, a series hosted by the Stanford Doerr School of Sustainability that invites global thought leaders for conversations that engage the entire Stanford community. Dean Arun Majumdar introduced the speakers in his opening remarks, describing the talk as a learning opportunity.

“Our ambition needs to match the scale, the complexity, and the urgency of the issues, and this requires insights and perspectives from a variety of diverse backgrounds and experiences,” Majumdar said.

Government and industry leadership

Jackson spoke about her parents, a mail carrier and a secretary who taught her the power of community. A summer program at Tulane University – to which Jackson was drawn by the promise of a TI programmable calculator – spurred her to pursue engineering. She attended graduate school at Princeton and explored connections between human health and the environment as a young engineer.

Jackson started her public service career at the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), returning as President Barack Obama’s EPA Administrator in 2009. In her role at Apple, she focuses on reducing the environmental repercussions of mineral extraction, energy, travel, and more at one of the largest consumer electronics companies in the world.

For 2030, Apple has set a goal of reducing all of the emissions associated with its operations and the manufacturing and use of its products by 75 percent. The company aims to balance the remaining emissions by having an equivalent amount removed from the atmosphere.

“That means our entire supply chain, and it means the energy used by our users and customers where they charge their devices. So, it’s everything,” Jackson said. “And we are on track to be there.”

Apple’s efforts are informed by a 2007 memo by Steve Jobs called “A Greener Apple,” in which Jobs urged his company to focus on action rather than ratings and rankings.

“That became our mantra. We don’t want to just promise all these things and get 100% on this score or that score,” Jackson said. “We just want to do it, show it can be done, and can be done at the same time as you run a successful company.”

Setting Apple’s goals

When Jackson started at Apple in 2013, CEO Tim Cook gave her a mission: Get to know the company, understand it deeply, and then tell him where Apple should be headed. His goal was not just to make Apple a leader, but to change the broader industry, Jackson said.

She spent months talking to people across the company before identifying three priority areas: making influential climate change impacts; using recycled and renewable materials; and using safer chemistry.

As an engineer herself, Jackson knew Apple employees would be up for the challenge of pursuing carbon neutrality. Engineers love boundary conditions and hard problems, she said, and Apple’s engineers are motivated not only to make great products, but also to figure out how to do it while lowering a product’s carbon footprint or increasing its recycled content.

The business of environmental work

Jackson reminded the audience of nearly 200 that anyone, anywhere can take climate action.

“You don’t have to be the head of the EPA to do this work. You don’t have to be at Apple with an incredible leader like Tim to do this work,” she said. “You have to do this work and find the people in the company who are inspired by it and then move through.”

Jackson suggested starting with easy, efficient changes that save the company money. Apple doesn’t approach its environmental work as philanthropy but as business, she said.

The company looks for partners who want to solve problems and collaborate, Jackson said. Companies connected to Apple through its supply chain, especially, are key.

“Most of the work on our carbon removal, on our clean energy investments, we’re investing alongside them or enabling them to understand how to find deals that will make sense, because a lot of smaller companies don’t have the ability to go out and assess the deal,” she said.

Companies under contract with Apple are required to install clean energy for their Apple production by 2030. Jackson said most companies have agreed to the change, but they often want guidance on how to do it economically.

Powell Jobs pointed out the broader benefit of these partnerships: “Obviously, they supply other products as well, and so it lifts up the whole industry.” They can also play a role in ensuring that the transition away from fossil fuels doesn’t leave people, places, or industries behind.

Advice for students

Jackson ended her talk by responding to a Stanford student asking for advice about entering the job market.

“I didn’t have a plan. I know some of you may have a plan, and you may be now looking at a plan that is kind of disintegrating, changing, or hard to really put your arms around entirely,” she said. “So, embrace the not-planning part, the other side of your brain, and try to find a job. Learn like hell. Get out in the field. Get your hands dirty.”

She encouraged students to take Cook’s advice when they get a new job and first learn what makes the company tick – and to give themselves time to gain experience.

“The world’s going to change again. It really will,” she said. “And that experience you’ve gotten, wherever it is, will be incredibly important.”",https://sustainability.stanford.edu/sites/sustainability/files/styles/large/public/media/image/bigideaslisajacksonfeatured_0.jpg?itok=ef8Wn7YH,N,,2025-06-23 17:09:28.444261

“It’s going to be hard to decide.” Among those likely in the running is the Nine Mile Point nuclear plant in Oswego.
There are 54 operating nuclear power plants in the country, according to the U.S. Department of Energy’s Energy Information Administration.
The last nuclear power plant built in the state was Unit 2 at Nine Mile Point in 1989.
The New York Power Authority previously operated two nuclear plants, including the Indian Point Power Plant, which shut down in 2021.","NEW YORK (AP) — New York’s governor on Monday proposed the construction of the state’s first new nuclear power plant in decades.

Gov. Kathy Hochul directed the state’s power authority to develop an advanced, “zero-emission” facility in upstate New York that she hopes will help create a clean, reliable and affordable electric grid for the state.

She said the state power authority will seek to develop “at least” one new nuclear energy facility with a combined capacity of no less than one gigawatt of electricity. That would increase the state’s total nuclear capacity to about 4.3 gigawatts.

The Democrat, speaking at the Niagara County Power Project in Lewiston, said the state needs to secure its “energy independence” if it wants to continue to attract large manufacturers that create good-paying jobs as it deactivates aging fossil fuel power plants.

Acknowledging critics of nuclear power, she pledged the new facility or facilities would be safer than their predecessors.

“This is not your grandparents’ nuclear reactor,” Hochul said. “The new plan will be a model of 21st century nuclear design with safety at the forefront, automatic safety systems to enhance the containment, and rigorous environmental standards.”

The governor said the state hasn’t decided on a potential location, but that upstate communities appear receptive, given the potential for creating 1,600 construction jobs and 1,200 permanent jobs once the facility is operational.

“Everybody is raising their hand right now,” Hochul said. “It’s going to be hard to decide.”

Among those likely in the running is the Nine Mile Point nuclear plant in Oswego. Hochul’s administration has been supportive of Maryland power company Constellation’s bid to build a new nuclear reactor at the two-reactor facility.

There are 54 operating nuclear power plants in the country, according to the U.S. Department of Energy’s Energy Information Administration.

But American utilities have been broadly reluctant to launch new nuclear plants due to high cost overruns and delays on recent high-profile projects.

Georgia Power Company completed the first two new nuclear reactors in the country in a generation last year. Units 3 and 4 at Plant Vogtle in Waynesboro, Georgia, cost nearly $35 billion and were powered up some seven years later than initially hoped.

Last month, the Tennessee Valley Authority, the nation’s largest public power company, applied to the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission to develop what it bills as a next-generation nuclear power plant at its Clinch River site in Oak Ridge.

New York currently has three active nuclear plants, all located upstate along Lake Ontario and owned by Constellation. The Nine Mile Point, Robert Emmett Ginna and James A. FitzPatrick plants provide about 3.3 gigawatts of power, or roughly 20% of the state’s electricity, according to Hochul’s office.

The last nuclear power plant built in the state was Unit 2 at Nine Mile Point in 1989. At its peak, nuclear power provided about 5.4 gigawatts, or roughly one-third of the state’s electrical supply, according to the advocacy group Nuclear New York.

The New York Power Authority previously operated two nuclear plants, including the Indian Point Power Plant, which shut down in 2021. That facility was located along the Hudson River some 25 miles (40 kilometers) north of New York City in Buchanan.

The other facility, once operated by the state, was the FitzPatrick plant, which the power authority sold in 2000 and is now run by Constellation.

Green tells Daily Report that LABI’s focus this session was on maintaining momentum from last year’s historic insurance, education and tax reforms.

“As we entered into 2025, our board wanted to make sure 2024 wasn’t just a one-off,” Green says. “Our theme was ‘Full Throttle’—let’s keep moving forward.”

Louisiana’s insurance crisis, of course, took center stage. Of particular significance for LABI was the passage of three major bills—House Bills 431 and 450 and Senate Bill 231—that are aimed at lowering rates for consumers and making the state more attractive to insurers.

HB431 shifts Louisiana to a modified comparative fault system, barring drivers who are 51% or more at fault for an accident from recovering damages. HB450 repeals the state’s “Housley Presumption,” which grants injured plaintiffs a presumption that their injuries were caused by their accidents. SB231 allows judges and juries to see evidence of the amounts billed and paid for medical expenses after an accident, limiting recovery to what was actually paid in cases where private insurance and Medicare were used to pay medical bills.

“We know there’s nothing we can do overnight that’s going to lower rates,” Green says, “but we can start signaling that we’re balancing the scales of justice and that we’re back open for business.”

LABI is also celebrating the passage of HB507, which establishes the High Impact Jobs Program; HB624, which creates a “One Door” system that positions Louisiana Works—the rebranded Louisiana Workforce Commission—as a one-stop shop for key social safety net programs; and a package of four bills that restructure the Louisiana Department of Transportation and Development, among other pieces of legislation.

Of the bills mentioned thus far, HB431, HB450 and one of the DOTD restructuring bills have been signed into law by Gov. Jeff Landry. HB507, HB624, SB231 and the three other DOTD bills await the governor’s signature.

Not all went LABI’s way, though. Green says he’s deeply concerned over the passage of HB148, which gives Louisiana’s insurance commissioner—currently Tim Temple—broader authority to regulate insurance rates, including the power to declare rates “excessive” regardless of market conditions. The controversial bill had some high-profile opponents, including the Insurance Council of Louisiana and Temple himself.

“Whether you’re talking about insurance, tax reform or economic development, you want to model what you’re doing after other states and you want to create a fair, predictable environment,” Green says. “HB148 is the opposite of that. It makes us an outlier. Time will tell how devastating it’s going to be.”

Green is also lamenting Landry’s veto of SB111, which would have defined what constitutes “bad faith” by insurers. He says the bill would have protected insurers from being unfairly penalized for routine delays, technical issues or legitimate coverage disputes. He also would have liked to see the LA GATOR school voucher program fully funded. Landry requested $93.5 million for the program, but lawmakers ultimately settled on $43.5 million.

Another disappointment was the failure to temporarily extend the inventory tax credit. Though voters will decide next spring on whether to give parishes the option to phase out their inventory taxes—a move that LABI supports—the credit is set to expire next year regardless of what voters decide. HB383, which did not receive a vote on the Senate floor, would have stair-stepped the credit downward over time, giving businesses time to adjust.

“I think the inventory tax is universally seen as a bad tax. It disincentivizes growth and investment. … As long as we have the bad tax, businesses need the credit,” Green says.

(WPTF) — President Trump’s “big beautiful bill” is casting a shadow over the future of solar energy, with proposed changes that could significantly reduce federal support for clean energy projects. The sweeping legislation, which shifts priority back to traditional energy sources, includes efforts to repeal solar and storage tax credits—sparking concerns across the renewable energy sector.

Abigail Ross Hopper, President of the Solar Energy Industries Association, says the bill would roll back years of bipartisan progress in solar development.

“There is a proposal that came out of the House that would really undercut all of the progress we’ve made in this country around solar and storage deployment, including in North Carolina,” said Hopper.

North Carolina currently ranks fifth in the nation for solar power usage. Hopper says the proposed rollback could hit the state particularly hard.

“There’s enough solar power to power 1.1 million homes, and this change—if Congress does this—would have a really significant impact on North Carolina,” she said. “We anticipate that you would lose around 5,500 jobs, and a number of factories making solar products and racking systems would go out of business.”

The federal solar and storage tax credits, first enacted in 2005 under President George W. Bush, have been renewed under both Republican and Democratic administrations. Hopper notes that the bipartisan support for these credits has historically made them a stable part of long-term planning for energy businesses.

“It has been a very bipartisan effort, and we are hoping that continues,” Hopper added. “You could imagine for business owners who have made plans for the next few years based on these credits—that would be incredibly disruptive.”

Solar energy is widely viewed as one of the most sustainable and abundant energy sources on Earth. According to FreedomSolarPower.com, more energy from the sun strikes the Earth in one hour than all of humanity uses in an entire year. In 2022, solar power accounted for nearly half of all new electricity generation in the U.S.

Supporters of the solar industry warn that repealing these tax incentives could set back national goals for clean energy and climate action—while increasing reliance on fossil fuels. They also point to the broader environmental and health benefits of solar power, which helps reduce pollution and improves public health outcomes.

A budget proposal from Utah Republican Sen. Mike Lee would mandate the sale of more than 2 million acres of federal lands to state or other entities. It was included recently in a draft provision of the GOP’s sweeping tax cut package.

At a summit Monday of Western state governors, New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham said the approach is problematic in New Mexico because of the close relationship residents have with those public lands.

“I'm open” to the idea, said Lujan Grisham, a second-term Democratic governor and former congresswoman. “Except here.”

“Our public lands, we have a very strong relationship with the openness, and they belong to all of us,” said Lujan Grisham, who was announcing written recommendations Monday on affordable housing strategies from the Western Governors’ Association. “And selling that to the private sector without a process, without putting New Mexicans first, is, for at least for me as a governor, going to be problematic.”

Interior Department Secretary Doug Burgum is among the leaders from several federal agencies scheduled to attend the meeting of the association on Monday and Tuesday. Conservation groups vowed to stage public protests over plans to cede public land to development.

Wyoming Gov. Mark Gordon voiced qualified support for plans to tap federal land for development.

“On a piece-by-piece basis where states have the opportunity to craft policies that make sense ... we can actually allow for some responsible growth in areas with communities that are landlocked at this point,” he told a news conference outside the Georgia O'Keeffe Museum in downtown Santa Fe. “There may be value there.”

Lee has said federal land sales under his proposal would target “isolated parcels” that could be used for housing or infrastructure, and would not include national parks, national monuments or wilderness.

Land in 11 Western states from Alaska to New Mexico would be eligible for sale. Montana was carved out of the proposal after its lawmakers objected.

In some states, such as Utah and Nevada, the government controls the vast majority of lands, protecting them from potential exploitation but hindering growth.

The Rio Base, which provides logistical support to offshore energy companies operating in the Campos and Santos Basins, began to derive electricity from renewable sources. This transition is expected to help us reduce around 22.7 tCO₂e of annual indirect Scope 2 emissions associated with electricity consumption both for our use and for the supply of energy to clients served at the base.

As part of the process, the Rio Base will receive, by the end of this year, I-REC (International Renewable Energy Certificate) certificates attesting that the electricity consumed is associated with power generation from renewable sources. I-RECs are internationally recognized for accounting for Scope 2 emissions and reaffirm the company's commitment to reducing greenhouse gas emissions and environmental impacts.

Currently, electricity is used, for example, to light yards, offices, mechanical workshops, and cargo storage areas. Clients docking vessels at the Rio Base will also benefit from this, as the docking facilities already operate with energy from renewable sources by supplying vessels with shore power and replacing diesel with cleaner fuel alternatives, which directly contributes to the reduction of emissions and the decarbonization of operations. A pioneer in the offshore support base business, Wilson Sons owns two private terminals in Guanabara Bay — the Rio Base and the Niterói Base — totaling eight berths. The company has expertise in remote operations. It has set up temporary bases in multiple ports along the Brazilian coastline.

Ford Motor Co. intensified its campaign to preserve clean energy manufacturing subsidies June 23, warning jobs at its electric-vehicle battery plant in southwestern Michigan could be at risk if Republicans in Congress pare back tax credits in President Donald Trump’s multi-trillion dollar economic package.

The $3 billion plant in Marshall, about 100 miles west of Detroit, is slated to produce 20 gigawatt-hours of lithium iron phosphate, or LFP batteries, and employ 1,700 people after it starts production in 2026. The 2 million-square-foot site, which is still under construction, has drawn intense political scrutiny since it was announced in 2023 because Ford is licensing the technology to build the batteries from China’s Contemporary Amperex Technology Co. Ltd., the world’s largest battery manufacturer.

“It would be a shame to build these facilities and then all of a sudden you have to scale back on the most important part of it, which is people,” Lisa Drake, Ford’s vice president of platform programs and EV systems, told reporters during a tour of the plant in Marshall on June 23. “We want to spend our investment creating manufacturing jobs here.”

At risk in congressional budget negotiations is a production tax credit in President Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act known as 45X. The law incentivizes manufacturing of battery cells and packs in the U.S. Ford would stand to earn about $2.3 billion between 2026 and 2029 under the current law, according to data firm Benchmark Minerals.

Ford Executive Chair Bill Ford said at a policy conference last month that the Marshall plant would be at risk if Congress nixed the 45X credits.

“It’s not fair to change policy after all the expenditures have been made,” he said at the time.

RELATED: GM and Ford Lobby to Save EV Tax Incentives

China dominates production of LFP batteries, which are cheaper and more stable than nickel-based alternatives popular in the west. Ford has argued that licensing LFP technology from CATL will help it catch up faster to Chinese EV companies, and that it wholly owns and controls the Marshall plant, which it says would be the first in the U.S. to make LFP cells for automotive applications.

The legislative risks mark the latest potential hurdle for the Ford plant. It was originally intended to produce enough batteries for 400,000 EVs, part of an earlier ambitious plan to electrify Ford’s lineup. The automaker later reduced that target to power about 230,000 EVs as consumer demand for the technology faltered.

To better compete on price, Ford CEO Jim Farley has tasked a former Tesla executive and a “skunkworks” team of engineers and designers in California with developing a line of small EVs starting under $30,000. The Marshall plant would supply batteries for those next-generation models.",https://www.ttnews.com/sites/default/files/styles/social_media_1200x630/public/2025-06/Ford-1200.jpg,N,,2025-06-23 16:09:44.794546

Facility will support Grain Belt Express - America's largest private sector-led transmission investment - with exclusive use of U.S. steel and aluminum for conductor cables

Expansion doubles U.S. manufacturing capacity for certain transmission conductors and creates more good-paying jobs

A world leader in energy expansion and digital transformation, Prysmian announced last week that it added 51,000 square feet and 27 additional permanent jobs to its Williamsport facility as a result of a supply and manufacturing agreement with Invenergy-America's largest privately held independent power producer. The expanded facility will support America's largest private sector-led transmission investment Grain Belt Express with its first order under the agreement to exclusively use U.S. steel and aluminum, representing a major investment in domestic energy supply chains. With the Invenergy agreement and expanded facility, Prysmian now supports almost 430+ jobs across Pennsylvania and over 270 just at the Williamsport facility and doubles U.S. manufacturing capacity for certain advanced transmission conductors.

""We are proud to have a part in this transformative project supplying our most innovative technology for overhead power transmission in the market, E3X®,"" said Andrea Pirondini, Prysmian North America President and CEO. ""Our expanded Williamsport facility enhances our manufacturing capacity and is another step to strengthening the grid and granting energy independence throughout the United States.""

""Critical energy infrastructure projects like Grain Belt Express represent a direct investment in America, our economy, and the domestic supply chain,"" said Shashank Sane, Invenergy's Executive Vice President for Transmission. ""Our partnership with Prysmian only furthers our commitment to the U.S. manufacturing workforce, a stronger grid, and American energy independence.""

The facility expansion is supported by a long-term supply and manufacturing agreement announced in 2023 with Invenergy. As a result, Prysmian will supply up to 12,500 miles of overhead conductors to support Invenergy's portfolio of long-distance high-voltage direct-current (HVDC) transmission projects in the U.S., including Grain Belt Express, the largest electric transmission project in development in the U.S., and the New Mexico North Path and Cimmaron Link lines.

This expansion doubles the United States' ability to manufacture advanced transmission conductors with E3X® technology. Prysmian's E3X® advanced conductor technology increases the capacity, efficiency, and reliability of transmission lines, allowing for more electric power to be transmitted with low losses and delivered across long distances without expanding the physical footprint of the project.

The investment also highlights Prysmian's commitment to Pennsylvania in establishing a global center of excellence in Williamsport. As one of the largest employers in the region, the plant has 277 employees and has been continuously operating since 1965.

""We are proud to manufacture the industry's most advanced overhead conductors right here in Williamsport,"" said David Horton, Williamsport plant manager. ""Every day, every shift, our workers are producing these products, and it gives us a great sense of pride to play a part in helping the country achieve energy independence.""

WHERE: CNBC's ""Power Lunch""

Following is the unofficial transcript of a CNBC interview with U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright on CNBC's ""Power Lunch"" (M-F, 2PM-3PM ET) today, Monday, June 23. Following is a link to video on CNBC.com: https://www.cnbc.com/video/2025/06/23/energy-sec-chris-wright-things-in-middle-east-will-eventually-deescalate.html.

All references must be sourced to CNBC.

BRIAN SULLIVAN: Well, and we also have the perfect guest to talk about it all right now. This is why you tune in to CNBC, folks. Joining us now is the secretary of energy, Chris Wright. Secretary Wright, I can't express thanks enough. I know how busy and sort of scary today in many ways has been. The oil markets are reacting in a positive way. Oil is falling. What message, and you're a former oil and gas executive at Liberty Energy, what do you think the oil markets are trying to say right now?

CHRIS WRIGHT: Look, I think a strong, confident, calm America is just a stabilizing force, both geopolitically and in the energy world. I think when people see where America stands that President Trump's agenda of peace through strength, I think people realize things in the Middle East will eventually de-escalate and we will be in a place of a much safer, a much more stable Middle East and world as a whole.

SULLIVAN: Are you surprised that oil is down 6 percent right now, Secretary Wright?

WRIGHT: I, no. I mean, I would not expect much movement of oil upwards from the tensions that are going on. We have seen a little bit in the run-up, but when it's clear where America stands, I'm not surprised that oil prices are moved down a little bit. They moved down maybe more than I would have guessed. But, no, I think we're in such a good position today. This American energy dominance that President Trump ran on, we're at record high production of oil today, record high production of natural gas. We've got friendly, close communication relationships with our other major energy producing nations, and we're standing strong against the one and only one major destabilizing force in the Middle East. The Biden policy of appeasing Iran and begging them not to harm us obviously was a provocation to Iran and showed a weak, irresolute America. A strong, confident America is a force for stability.

SULLIVAN: You just brought up something that Helima Croft, who's joining us again, by the way, right now, and I were talking about in the past hour, which is this idea that Iran's kind of on an island. They're actually the rotating president of OPEC and its allies this year. There's a huge meeting coming up in a couple of days in Vienna, Austria. Everybody that you just referenced will be in the same room literally talking. Maybe you will be there, Secretary Wright. If you could break some news for us, we'd appreciate that. But if not, can you tell our viewers, is there, sort of, are you on the horn with the Saudis? Are you speaking with the Emiratis? Is Iran increasingly isolated even in its oil and geographic and geopolitical world?

WRIGHT: Yes, certainly. I'm in close contact and have been all weekend with our close allies over there. And, look, what do they want? They want the same thing the U.S. wants. They want the same thing Israel wants, a peace. They want commerce, not instability. That's what everybody wants. The Middle East is poised to thrive, if not for the poison of Iran, through all of its proxy throughout the Middle East and directly from Iran. And I think you see some bubbling confidence that this 46 years of chaos and threat to the United States that Iran brought, that may be coming to an end. We may see a different era, an era of peace and prosperity and commerce as the dominating force in the Middle East. That's what everyone wants. I think that's where we're headed.

CONTESSA BREWER: Secretary Wright, yesterday I was on the phone all day with high-level insurance sources, who said, one after the other, their primary concern is the Strait of Hormuz remaining open because the disruption in trade routes has trickle-down effects, even for companies that don't have direct exposure to the Persian Gulf or to Iran directly. And many companies don't because of the sanctions that have been in place for so long. Can you give us some insight into how the U.S. military is thinking about the Strait of Hormuz and keeping it safe and open?

WRIGHT: Yes, of course. It is a key waterway for the movement of oil and for natural gas. It's important to the world. But, look, all of Iran's exports and all of its imports come through the Strait of Hormuz. So that's kind of like spiting their face to close the Strait of Hormuz.

BREWER: Well, are you saying that you don't think that there's very much cause for concern over mining or closing the strait?

WRIGHT: Oh, there's certainly the risk of that. As Iran is, has been humbled and as Iran has realized they stand alone against the rest of the world that wants peace and trade, it's, you don't know what Iran's going to do in the coming days. So there's some risk of that, but I don't think the risk is huge. The only way Iran gets revenue is to ship its oil through the Strait of Hormuz. If they close the Strait of Hormuz, it's not others they hurt. It's themselves.

SULLIVAN: Yes. And the Strait of Hormuz has never been closed. I mean, it's hard to believe that. Even during the Gulf War in 1990-'91, Secretary, the strait was not closed, even as missiles literally were flying. The president today sort of social media-ing on TRUTH Social coming out and saying, we want to drill, baby, drill, we want to add to U.S. oil production. The United States, to your point at the top, is already at a record high, about 13.5 million barrels per day. Is there, do you think, do you know, is there any way to get the U.S. to produce more oil? Because, ultimately, that's going to come down to the Exxons and the Chevrons and the Occidentals of the world, not the U.S. government.

WRIGHT: Exactly. We have got the price signals of the market that drive investment decision. But, Brian, you give that 13.5 million barrels, that's U.S. crude oil. The 100 million barrels a day you hear global oil market, that's liquid fuels. That's crude oil, that's natural gas liquids, that's ethanol, that's refinery gain. When you add in natural gas liquids, the U.S. is 20 million barrels a day. When you add in ethanol and refinery gain, we're above that. So we're over 20 percent of U.S. production today. And what's growing the most rapidly in the U.S. is natural gas and natural gas liquids, because, as we open up more export markets, the easy ability to build pipelines and export terminals, we can produce more natural gas. Our crude production is continuing to grow this year, half of that from the Gulf of Mexico, half of that onshore. And so, yes, I feel quite good about where U.S. production stands right now. And, more importantly, the investment climate for the companies you mentioned and all the producers in the United States, we want a safe, simple, sensible regulatory environment that allows them to make long-term investment decisions.

SULLIVAN: We are lucky to have with us Helima Croft of RBC Capital Markets as well. And, as you know, probably know, Secretary Wright, she goes to more OPEC meetings than anybody out there in the world. So, Helima, you're here. You have got the secretary of energy here. You represent RBC Capital Markets. What would be the Wall Street view for the energy secretary?

HELIMA CROFT: Well, I think the interesting question I would have for the energy secretary is, there was a fantastic meeting that was held last week. You mentioned dialogue with OPEC members. Secretary Wright was with a big Emirati delegation where they were talking about partnership with investment coming from the Gulf into the United States, the importance of U.S. natural gas for AI. So I would love to hear more about this partnership. And he talked about the need for stability in the Middle East. How important is it to the U.S.-Gulf partnership around energy, around AI?

SULLIVAN: Secretary Wright?

WRIGHT: Oh, it's important, because look, our major allies in the Middle East, Helima, as you know well, are generating just huge amounts of cash. They want to profitably invest that. And there's just simply nowhere better to put capital than the United States. We have a huge build-out for AI infrastructure going on. And, as you mentioned, the UAE was here. They're major investors in that infrastructure here in the United States. They're also investing in U.S. energy infrastructure, natural gas export terminals. And if you saw their announcement for a purchase of Santos, what's the biggest driver behind that? Simply the huge upside in Alaskan oil production. So, yes, I think these cross investments, U.S. investment in the United Arab Emirates, UAE investment in the United States, same thing for Saudi, same thing for Qatar, same thing for Kuwait, this is the kind of Middle East we want going forward. And I think there's been one obstacle to that, Iran. And I think that one obstacle is going to shrink and fade away.

BREWER: Well, China is still importing a lot of oil from Iran. And I'm thinking about this. If the price of oil goes up for China, then the price of manufacturing goods goes up, the price of shipping goes up, and, ultimately, tariffs aside, the cost of goods for Americans goes up. Can you give us any insight into the role China is currently playing in these tensions and the escalating situation in the Middle East?

WRIGHT: Yes, I certainly won't share any intelligence or anything there. But, yes, look, China is the taker of virtually all of Iran's exported oil. Does China want the Strait of Hormuz closed or high oil prices? Absolutely not. But they are the main customer, almost the entire customer, for Iran's oil. And you mentioned energy prices. Yes, of course, they matter. The crazy thing is, here we sit today, oil prices are more than 10 percent lower today than they were 12 months ago. And yet we have got major, we're in the middle of major conflict in the Middle East. Only, only President Trump could bring an energy situation where we could have lower oil prices than we had a year ago in the midst of a major conflict, and likely headed lower after this conflict gets resolved.

SULLIVAN: On a separate note, and this is not related to the Middle East, but I have to ask you about it, Chris, because we're seeing a heat wave across half the United States, and it's spectacularly hot, and there is a real risk for the grid. And, recently, you and your team ordered, I think the oldest power plant in the United States to continue. It's called Eddystone. It's outside of Philadelphia. I think it was built when we used stone tools, to be honest. It's that old. But you ordered it still open, to stay open, because it provides this sort of peaker, this key power toward the end. Can the U.S. energy grid sustain the kind of heat that we're having right now? I know it's off-topic compared to the Middle East, but let's be clear, tomorrow, the next day, it's still going to be hot, and this is first -- this is a lot on the minds of a lot of people, maybe even more than what's happening in Iran.

WRIGHT: Oh, Brian, you're so right. And yes, of course, I took some heat from the suspects you would expect for issuing a 202(c) order to keep that plant open. That was just a few weeks ago. That plant is running today. When you have peak demand, you simply have to keep a capacity you have that's viable and running. I did the same thing with a coal plant in Southwestern Michigan that was slated to close 15 years before its end of life. And, sure enough, two days later, in MISO, in the Midcontinent Independent System Operator, they had a blackout two days later. So we need to stop digging the hole, keep working power plants open today, and do everything we can in the regulatory framework to allow new capacity to be added to our grid so we can lead in the AI race. That's what we're going to do. But it is a meaningful pivot from the last four years.

SULLIVAN: Because we're close. Secretary Wright, you know this. This is an issue for a lot of Americans, just like the Middle East. We are so close sometimes. And the grid operator in the mid-Atlantic area, 60 million households are under what they call PJM. Like a year ago, they issued this Friday night report, really kind of late on a Friday night, oh, we may not have enough power to keep the grid going. This is scary when we need air conditioning to stay cool. It's dangerously hot.

WRIGHT: For four years, the Biden administration dug a hole trying to stand in the way of energy development and forcing the closure of so many coal plants. So we can't reverse that overnight, but we have at least reversed the trajectory overnight. We're stopping the closure of viable coal plants today, and we're doing everything we can to enable the rapid build-out of new energy generation systems.

SULLIVAN: Yes.

WRIGHT: You're right. Americans depend on air conditioning and lights and the incubators in the hospitals working. You can't draw politics and make stupid decisions about energy. We suffered four years about that, of that, and I think that's why President Trump won election.

SULLIVAN: Chris Wright, Secretary of Energy. Secretary Wright, could probably keep you on all hour, but I know you have got a lot more to do. We do appreciate your time very, very greatly today. The world's on edge, oil prices actually down. But thank you, sir, for joining us.

Wolf",,,,,https://www.finehomebuilding.com/2025/06/23/how-trumps-big-beautiful-bill-will-affect-the-inflation-reduction-act,"The Energy Efficient Home Improvement Credit (25C) The 25C tax credit was first introduced through the Clean Energy Act of 2005.

The New Energy Efficient Home Credit (45L) The 45L tax credit, also established through the Clean Energy Act, had previously expired in 2021.
This credit specifically benefits builders of new energy efficient homes of all types, from single-family to manufactured and multifamily buildings.","The Trump administration’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act (yes, that is its formal title), which was passed by the U.S. House of Representatives last month, proposes to “modify, phase out, and terminate multiple energy-related federal tax credits,” according to the bill’s summary, under the subsection “Make America Win Again.”

The patent cruelties embedded in this bill have the potential to decimate livelihoods and economies for a generation or more, not to mention cost actual lives. Setting aside many of the bill’s controversial proposals, like cuts to Medicare and Medicaid benefits, a 10-year moratorium on any state-led efforts to regulate AI models, and repealing EPA block grants that benefit disadvantaged communities, among others, the Big Beautiful Bill (BBB) is particularly preoccupied with getting rid of all manner of tax credits that, to date, have helped millions of builders and homeowners save money and live in healthier buildings.

If passed by the Senate in its current form, which for the time being seems unlikely, the BBB would gut most key provisions in the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), effectively killing the law in piecemeal. (I’m already eating my words after declaring last January that “the IRA will not be repealed.” There is a slim chance this will hold true, but I humbly join a cast of millions who clearly underestimated Trump’s appetite for gutting industries and local economies in deep red states and districts, where much of the IRA’s funding has been directed.) So let’s explore just a few of the home-specific tax credits that are on the chopping block, and the possible impacts of them going away.

The Energy Efficient Home Improvement Credit (25C)

The 25C tax credit was first introduced through the Clean Energy Act of 2005. In its original form, it offered homeowners a fixed (and rather modest) credit, with a cumulative lifetime cap of just $500, for upgrading their HVAC equipment, water heaters, insulation, windows, doors, and other critical features. The benefits were minimal, but the implied gesture of incentivizing people to convert to Energy Star appliances and make other energy efficient upgrades was significant, nonetheless.

With the passage of the IRA in 2022, the 25C credit was amended in several ways, all representing marked improvements on previous iterations. For starters, the maximum allowable credits were increased to 30% of qualified expenses, or up to $3,200 per year, including up to $2,000 for heat pumps and related equipment, and $1,200 for other efficiency measures like doors, windows, insulation, and home energy audits. Also of note, the annual credit was extended through the end of 2032, enabling homeowners to plan and phase various home improvement measures over the long term.

Recent figures published by Rewiring America indicate that in 2023, more than $2 billion in credits were claimed, representing tax relief of $880 per household on average. “For every dollar homeowners received through 25C, contractors generated ten dollars in energy-efficient product sales. That kind of return is rare in federal policy,” according to the nonprofit.

Of the millions of households that took advantage of the Energy Efficient Home Improvement Credit, new insulation and air-sealing, as well as new exterior windows, doors, and skylights made up the highest percentages of tax credit claims by category. Interestingly, the installation of water heaters and/or furnaces that use “efficient natural gas, propane, or oil” also made-up sizable portions of claims, which supports the claim made in a joint, bipartisan letter submitted by a group of congressional members that the “25C tax credit is fuel agnostic.” (A co-author of the letter includes Rep. Jason Smith, a Republican representing Missouri’s 8th Congressional District, and notably the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee.)

“Energy-efficient homes are more resilient in extreme weather; energy-efficient homes are healthier homes; and building energy efficiency enables utilities to better manage demands on the electrical grid,” the letter reads. “It is for these reasons that we urge Congress to maintain the current 25C tax credit.”

The Residential Clean Energy Credit (25D)

Like 25C, the 25D tax credit was also introduced as part of the 2005 Clean Energy Act. The 25D credit directly benefits households that install any form of clean, renewable energy for new or existing properties, and applies to both homeowners and renters, provided the home in question is their principal residence. Qualifying expenses include solar panels, solar water heaters, geothermal systems, wind turbines, fuel cells, and starting last year, battery storage equipment.

The initial payback for the 25D credit was comparatively generous, capped at 30% of expenses, including equipment and installation. One possible reason for this is that, unlike insulation and energy efficient windows, renewable energy technologies were mostly out of reach for the average household 20 years ago. Over time, as the marketplace for solar panels and related systems became more accessible, the applicable percentages dropped a few points. But with the arrival of the IRA, the 30% cap was restored to the Clean Energy Credit and extended through the end of 2032. Recent figures from the Treasury Department indicate that in 2023 taxpayers who installed rooftop panels and home battery storage saved an average of nearly $5,100 in credits, while reaping annual savings of $2,230 on their energy bills.

While the 25D credit has greatly benefitted hundreds of thousands of households, particularly when it comes to solar panels (25D is commonly known as the residential solar tax credit), it has also been a boon for solar installers. According to data from the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA), in partnership with Wood Mackenzie Power & Renewables, a record 178,812 solar installers and developers were employed in 2023. For the same year, that number increases to nearly 280,000 (another record) when including U.S. manufacturers, sales and distribution, and operations and maintenance workers.

Whatever happens with the BBB, in the likely event the solar tax credit goes away at the end of 2025 as proposed, the recourse is clear: for any homeowners who have even a passing interest in installing solar and battery storage (a process that can take several months), it’s best to do it now. The clock is ticking.

The New Energy Efficient Home Credit (45L)

The 45L tax credit, also established through the Clean Energy Act, had previously expired in 2021. This credit specifically benefits builders of new energy efficient homes of all types, from single-family to manufactured and multifamily buildings. The credit was brought back with the passage of the IRA, and in the process raised credits to $2,500 for single family and manufactured homes that meet specific Energy Star standards based on the year built (e.g., homes built after 2024 must meet standard 3.2).

Meanwhile, homes in those same categories built to the Department of Energy’s Zero Energy Ready Home program qualify for a $5,000 tax credit, while multifamily homes that meet Energy Star’s Multifamily New Construction program may qualify for $2,500 per unit, provided construction workers are paid prevailing wages. And like 25C and 25D, the IRA extended the 45L credit through the end of 2032.

According to a 2025 report released by the American Council for an Energy Efficient Economy (ACEEE), the 45L credit was instrumental in the construction of nearly 350,000 energy efficient homes in 2024. The cumulative effect of this new construction is estimated to cut peak energy demand by 1,800MW by 2032. “We estimate that the discounted energy savings benefits are more than four times the value of the credit,” concludes the report. Should the credit remain in place, which again, doesn’t seem likely, the ACEEE estimates that it “will spur the construction of over three million qualifying homes between now and its scheduled expiration in 2032.”

An Accelerated Timetable

Shortly after the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act, in 2022, GBA contributor and home contractor Jon Harrod deftly broke down the various benefits and potential complications of the amended tax credits. In his closing he wrote, “The ethical course is to share what we know with customers in a balanced and transparent way, then let them decide how to proceed. Once we get through this awkward launch, the IRA will help us stay busy for years.”

Harrod’s prudence is admirable, but now, unfortunately, somewhat outdated. In the likely scenario that some amended version of the BBB passes this year, some or all the credits mentioned above (as well as others) will either be terminated or phased out, at which point homeowners will have mere weeks to implement the kinds of improvements and upgrades that they’ve been planning for years.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -U.S. electrical grid operators on Monday directed power plants to be ready to run at maximum force to meet the spiking electricity demand brought by a dangerous heat wave afflicting the eastern half of the country, where power prices are surging to more than six-month highs.

When homes and businesses crank up energy-intensive air conditioners, the risk of power outages increases in extremely hot temperatures if electricity output fails to meet rising consumption.

Several thousand customers of Con Edison, a major investor-owned electric utility in New York, were without electricity due to the sweltering temperatures, the company said. Con Edison restored power to some 1,600 customers in Queens, a borough of New York City, while over 6,200 homes and businesses were still without electricity.

Meteorologists at weather forecaster AccuWeather projected high temperatures in New York, the biggest city in the United States, would tie the 137-year-old record of 96 Fahrenheit (35.6 Celsius) on Monday before breaking that record on Tuesday with an expected 98 F.

Temperatures are projected to cool starting on Wednesday.

PJM Interconnection, which covers one in five Americans as the largest U.S. power grid operator, and the Midwest’s MISO, issued alerts to generators to be prepared to run as much as possible during the heat wave.

PJM said it expected power demand to reach 160,000 megawatts on Monday, 158,000 MW on Tuesday and 155,000 MW on Wednesday.

One megawatt can power about 800 homes on a normal day but much fewer on a hot summer day when homes and businesses crank up their air conditioners.

MISO issued a similar alert, which is aimed at transmission and generation owners who can schedule maintenance work accordingly.

PJM’s alert also signals to neighboring regions that PJM power exports may need to be curtailed, the grid operator said.

Next-day power prices at the PJM West hub in Pennsylvania soared by over 430% to around $211 per megawatt hour, their highest since January.

In addition, one of the proposals would terminate home energy tax credits that help pay for insulation, heat pumps and reductions in home energy bills, she said.

Last week, Senate Finance Committee Chairman Mike Crapo (R-Idaho) said the cuts are necessary to preserve other programs “for the most vulnerable.” He said the proposal “achieves significant savings while slashing Green New Deal spending.”

The uncertainty around the future of the credits is already causing some Maine companies to delay or end projects that had been in the pipeline, said Jacob Norris, a journeyman electrician in IBEW Local 1253.

During a news conference in Bangor’s Peirce Memorial Park Norris said he and “hundreds of other” electricians are unsure if there will be any more work in the clean energy sector.

“Currently, in my local, around half of the apprentices have been laid off from work for months without the option of travel as their licenses limit them to the state of Maine,” he said.

Cheyenne Gallivan of the Maine Labor Climate Council said other workers are leaving the state because projects that had been planned in Maine are being canceled.

“Iron workers from Maine are heading to Virginia to work on offshore wind projects because we’re not moving forward with those projects in our state right now,” she said. “Solar workers are traveling as far as Indiana building data centers because the solar projects in Maine have dried up due to the funding uncertainty.”

CATL will train the workers initially, but the equipment and workforce will belong to Ford.
Ford says LFP batteries charge faster, last longer and cost less than other types to make.
The company has said it will launch a midsize EV pickup in 2027 on a new low-cost platform, although it has not yet confirmed that cells from the Marshall plant will be used in that model.
Drake argued that licensing technology from CATL was the only viable option to quickly make the batteries at scale.","MARSHALL — Despite political headwinds, pushback from some local residents and now costly tariffs on equipment that has yet to reach U.S. shores, Ford Motor Co. executives say they still think building a $3 billion battery plant in Marshall was the right move for the automaker.

Lisa Drake, Ford’s vice president of technology platform programs and electric vehicle systems, told reporters in Marshall on Monday that the company has taken a substantial hit from import tariffs on equipment that will be coming to the U.S. from China.

The 2-million-square-foot plant is slated to open in 2026 and produce lithium-iron-phosphate batteries for future EVs using some intellectual property from China-based Contemporary Amperex Technology Co. Limited, or CATL.

But Drake said the added costs are bearable in the long run.

“Even with the tariffs, this is still the right thing to do versus the choice of importing this technology into the U.S.,” Drake said. “I’d still rather have the equipment here. I don’t really want to pay a tariff, but right now that’s the situation we’re in.”

The tariffs are the latest headwind for the plant 100 miles west of Detroit. Ford already scaled down the project from a larger planned investment in response to slowing EV adoption.

Executive Chair Bill Ford said in May that the site was ""in peril"" if production tax credits from the Biden-era Inflation Reduction Act were eliminated in a federal budget bill making its way through Congress.

Drake said the tax credits essentially became a lifeline to the site after EV adoption rates slowed and that the automaker believes it’s unfair to take away something that was promised when the project began.

“Because our timeline for investment is so long, when these rules change so fast, they’re very material for us,” Drake said. “We don’t want to back off on this facility. If anything we want to go faster.”

Roughly 1,800 workers are building the site, and Ford eventually expects to employ 1,700 people there building batteries. CATL will train the workers initially, but the equipment and workforce will belong to Ford.

Drake said the size of the workforce could change depending on the tax credits.

“It would be a shame to build these facilities and all of a sudden you have to scale back on the most important part of it, which is people,” Drake said. “There are 1,700 jobs that don’t come around that often.”

The site is also under fire from politicians who oppose Ford’s work with a Chinese battery company. CATL will train workers on battery cell manufacturing and how to use the equipment, although Ford will control the design and assembly of the packs that house the finished cells.

Ford says LFP batteries charge faster, last longer and cost less than other types to make. The company has said it will launch a midsize EV pickup in 2027 on a new low-cost platform, although it has not yet confirmed that cells from the Marshall plant will be used in that model.

Drake argued that licensing technology from CATL was the only viable option to quickly make the batteries at scale.

“It probably would have taken us a decade to catch up and have LFP technology on our own, with our own R&D,” she said. “Hundreds of millions [of dollars], time. If Ford has capital, we want to spend our investment creating the manufacturing jobs here.”",https://s3-rd-prod.crainsdetroit.com/styles/1200x630/s3/Marshall%20Ford%20BlueOval%20plant_06232025.jpg,N,,2025-06-23 15:48:59.461551

Jeff Landry signed bill HB 459 into law, creating setback and siting requirements following the state’s surge in the state’s utility-scale solar projects.

The new law grants permitting authority to the Department of Energy and Natural Resources for solar projects on at least 75 acres of land.

The act creates setback requirements for solar projects that are on at least 75 acres of land, unless they are completely within an industrial-zoned area or are a Louisiana Economic Development-certified site, which include:

300-foot setbacks from the property line for residential properties adjacent to solar facilities, with 35-foot new planting or 50-foot natural vegetative barriers.

100-foot setback from natural and navigable waterways.

50-foot setback from public roads with 35-foot vegetative barrier.

The act also prohibits noise greater than 10 decibels above the pre-construction ambient noise level at the property line.

(Read: Sounds from the sun: Addressing acoustics for solar harmony)

Additionally, the act requires solar projects on at least 75 acres of land to have a buffer of native vegetation to conceal the project from view from adjoining properties. The buffers will need to be stamped by a licensed landscape architect or horticulturalist prior to permitting.

However, the bill was also amended to allow landowners to opt out of siting requirements under a written agreement with the solar project’s operator.

The act allows parish governments to create their own siting requirements and to opt out of state siting requirements by resolution. As the act does not specify otherwise, this may open the door to local governments creating more restrictive requirements.

The new law also allows the Department of Agriculture and Forestry and the Department of Wildlife and Fisheries to comment on solar projects.

The amended bill, which will apply to facilities constructed after Jan. 1, 2026, passed the House 75 to 18 and the Senate 32 to 3 before it was sent to the governor and signed into law.

The legislation originally only prohibited permits for renewable energy projects without proof of financial security and a decommissioning plan, certain permits prior to installing batteries, among a few other minor requirements, but was amended to impose a greater set of restrictions.

The act comes after a sudden boom in Louisiana’s utility-scale solar market, leaving many parishes to wrestle with how to go about regulating the state’s utility-scale solar projects.

For example, a local solar project left a parish divided over whether to allow a 10 MW solar project on 1,200 acres of farmland, with some arguing it would be an eyesore, a safety hazard and would take up valuable agricultural land. Others argued landowners should be able to do what they want with their land and that the project was clean and safe.

Legislators introduced a bill in response to these particular incidents, but it ultimately did not pass, with the House divided 46 to 53. The bill was more comprehensive than HB 459, the legislation signed into law, imposing a greater number of restrictions and setback requirements for solar projects on at least 10 acres of land instead of HB 459’s 75 acres.

Last year, the Louisiana Public Service Commission issued a rule to give large commercial and industrial customers in the state a new way to access up to 500 MW of renewable power, stating that customers need renewable power “in order to remain competitive.” Corporations have power purchase agreements with many of the state’s largest solar projects. For example, McDonald’s is the sole offtaker for a 180 MW solar project that recently became operational and Microsoft is the sole offtaker of the 98 MW Bayou Galion Solar project.",https://pv-magazine-usa.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/06/Louisiana_State_Capitol_2012-1200x770.jpg,N,,2025-06-23 19:08:06.705098

Senate budget draft makes minor improvements but keeps major cuts to solar incentives

Solar Power World – June 17

Senator Mike Crapo released draft text of the Senate Finance Committee’s version of the budget reconciliation bill on June 16. The Senate draft budget includes positives for the large-scale solar market, such as amending “start-construction” and “placed-in-service” requirements for the ITC and PTC (48E/45Y). The House version required projects to start construction within 60 days of bill enactment and be placed in service before December 31, 2028, to receive credits, but now the Senate is proposing projects can start construction through the end of the year and be placed in service by the end of 2029 for full credit. While the Senate is sticking to an accelerated phase-out plan for solar and wind, it preserves credits for hydropower, nuclear, and geothermal.

This builds on other opportunities announced in Governor Hochul’s 2025 State of the State to catalyze nuclear energy development in New York.

A rush transcript of the Governor's remarks is available below:

Good morning, good morning, good morning. What a spectacular venue. This is actually the coolest spot in New York City — other than New York City and the rest of the state, the New York State. So anybody who's going to complain about the heat just drive another hour, you'll be grateful that you come from Western New York. But there's no better place to talk about New York's energy future than right here at the Niagara Power Plant.

I've been here so many times, the visitor center is spectacular. I've brought children and guests from all over there and to really just absorb the knowledge that this great creation of humanity, this engineering feat that still holds people in awe is something to be celebrated here in Western New York. And it's built by our great partners here. This hydroelectric partner was the largest hydroelectric power plant in the world when it opened in 1961 and remains the greatest provider of clean energy in our state today.

President Kennedy called it an example to the world of North American efficiency and determination. I think he's right about that. It's that same kind of determination and belief in the sometimes impossible ideas that brings us here today. And I want to acknowledge Justin Driscoll for his embrace of what I am putting on his shoulders in addition to everything else he does. Great, great leader I want to give him a round of applause. Justin Driscoll.

Jim Slevin, you'll be hearing him from the president of Utility Workers. Jim represents people all across the State of New York who will be trained and ready to step into these clean energy jobs. And I want to thank him for his representation of New York State's great unions. Jim, please stand up.

Randy Wolken, the President and CEO of the Manufacturers Association, I've known Randy a long time. He loves to build and we are going to be doing some extraordinary building Randy, you’ll be hearing from Randy shortly as well. Doreen Harris, let's give her a huge round applause. One of our great visionaries, a national visionary when it comes to charting an energy future. The President and CEO of NYSERDA.

Jess Waldorf, the Chief of Staff for the Department of Public Services is here as well. John Koelmel, someone I've known for decades. Our Chairman of NYPA, the entire board, and I want to thank all the board members who are here as well. And all my partners in government, Majority Leader Crystal Peoples-Stokes, has joined us. She’s on our way down.

Also Minority Leader Robert Ortt has joined us as well as many other electeds from the state and local governments. But Labor IBW, utility workers, carpenters, plasterers, plumbers, pipefitters and building trades are here. Let's give all of them a round of applause. Now for generations, Upstate New York was the beating heart of American innovation.

We made typewriters at Smith Corona, automobiles at Franklin, penicillin at Bristol Myers. We invented the products that powered the 20th century, but those of you who are a little bit older know the sad story of when companies began shifting jobs overseas in the seventies. Factories closed main streets from Niagara Falls down to my home turf of Hamburg, New York.

We lost the manufacturing base that had once made us so great and it was hard working families across Upstate were left wondering, what is our future? Do we even stay? I was raised in a family of six kids, I'm the only one who could stay because I could find a job. The rest wanted to stay but couldn't.

So as you know, my dad and grandpa worked at the steel plant. That steel plant now has turbines, wind turbines, generating clean energy. So you show how we're transitioning, but we have to make sure that we take care of the families of today and tomorrow, with a forward thinking approach to government, and what are the areas we can unlock to ensure affordability and livability here in our state.

And also just the belief in what's possible — that was shaken for a long time. But today, a whole new chapter is being written while past administrations have tried to soften the blow of Upstate's economic decline. I'm championing its return and leaning hard into it. And what we're doing is attracting the world's most cutting edge companies — the ones that you hear about globally — and creating thousands of new families sustaining jobs.

Now they want to be here, they're coming, but our challenge now is to give them the power to prosper. That's what we can do in government and help sustain that growth and build the homes. You've heard me talk about it — we need to build more housing. People want to live here. It's real simple friends: you build more housing. There's more supply, the prices go down where people can afford it.

That's what we're trying to accomplish here in New York, and more businesses and the opportunities that come with it. Because the industries of the future — advanced manufacturing, artificial intelligence. Look what we're doing with Empire AI at the University of Buffalo.

The country is talking about this, semiconductor manufacturing. But you know what? They don't run on dreams — they need to be powered, they need a lot of electricity. So if we don't increase New York's electricity supply in a major way, we're going to risk losing our opportunities. They can go elsewhere, but we want them here.

And that's why this announcement is also so important. We cannot risk jeopardizing the pro-business climate that I have worked so hard to create for the last few years. We also have to make sure we don't keep having costs in New York driven up. I'm not talking about some far off future. That future is right now, that demand is right now and the opportunity is right now.

But if we don't increase our capacity over the next decade, we will see rolling blackouts and other disruptions. You see them in other states. We must radically increase supply starting now, and do it in a way that does not threaten our commitment to clean air and a clean environment, and ensure that New York remains a leader in the global fight against climate change. We're capable of doing all of this.

Now, some people say you can't clean the grid and grow it at the same time. Sounds like defeatism to me. This is New York. That's not how we think. We don't back down from the hard problems, we solve them and we build bigger and bolder than anyone could have imagined. We're already scaling up wind and solar, thermal, emerging clean technologies. I embrace all of them.

And all of us from Western New York — you cannot grow up in this area and not be a hardcore environmentalist. We're not far from Love Canal. The world was watching Love Canal when I was growing up, and the genesis of the Superfund saying companies have a responsibility to clean up what they're doing. Same thing when I used to watch Bethlehem Steel in Lackawanna. Anybody from that area? We thought the sky was supposed to be orange. We didn't know we were supposed to have blue skies. It's all we saw. You couldn't see coming over the Father Baker Bridge, it was a cloud of orange smoke every day. And we watched them drop, every night, gallons and gallons of this substance that I knew was toxic, but no one told us not to swim in it by day. I believe in fighting for our environment: clean air, clean water, a renewable future.

And just last week I met some partners in government from Canada. Actually, there's still some talking to us, it was great. I met representatives from Quebec to talk about the timetable for completing the Champlain Hudson Power Express. Now, what is that? We call it CHPE. It's an underground transmission line that'll carry hydroelectric power almost 340 miles from Quebec to power homes in New York City.

It's one of the first things I did as Governor. This had been talked about for a long time, and nobody got it done. And I said, “The time is now. We can partner with them to power homes all the way as far as from Quebec down to New York City.” It'll power a million homes with clean energy and reduce harmful emissions by 37 million metric tons.

Now, I'm glad to see this coming along. That's just one part of the strategy. Just one part. You heard the story of how I had to negotiate pretty intensely with the White House to bring back on one of our nation's largest offshore wind facilities. It was 10 years in the making. It had a year-and-a-half to go and there was a stop work order placed on it back in March — cost this company $50 million a week. I'm telling you, the CEO out of Norway said they were out of here. Any company would have to do that. And I said, “Give me another week. Just give me one more week. Let me try to persuade the administration.” And we were successful — 1,500 jobs, half a million homes powered in Brooklyn with clean renewable energy from offshore wind. We got that done as well. And now that's back on track. I'm so excited about that.

But it shouldn't be this hard. It shouldn't be this hard. But no matter how hard we fight for renewables, solar works when the sun is shining, wind turbines spin when the air is moving. We need electricity that's reliable all day long, regardless of the weather outdoors. And that's what we're talking about, something that's fully reliable, emissions free built to scale, especially when the AI data centers and semiconductor fabs and all the homes will need power 24/7. Take Micron, for example, a global semiconductor facility coming to Upstate New York.

Now, there's a whole story behind this as well. They would say that it was my tenacity that kept them from going to another state. I would not take no for an answer. We won them over 50,000 jobs — good-paying jobs, the vast majority union workers. It's going to be extraordinary, the supply chain opportunities that are going to come here all over the state.

But to power this one facility, Micron is going to need so much power — so much incredible power — and there's only one commercially viable option that can deliver that much clean, renewable, reliable power, and that's what's been operating in New York for decades, nuclear energy. Harnessing the power of the atom is the best way to generate steady zero-emission electricity, and to help this transition, which we want to have this transition from fossil fuels. I'm committed to it. You've heard all the projects, I'm working on putting the weight of my office behind it. But that's why today, seeing everything that's happening on the landscape looking into the future.

I am proud to announce that I'm directing the New York State Power Authority to develop and construct a brand new advanced nuclear plant in Upstate New York. Announcing that here today, and we're going to get it done.

This historic initiative will lay the foundation for the next generation of prosperity, just like this facility did. Just like this one did. And it can also prove what government is supposed to do — build infrastructure that underpins economic growth and security.

Now, a new nuclear plant is a major undertaking, but NYPA is uniquely qualified to lead it. We talked about — as created by FDR — NYPA's always stepped in at a time of need. In 1957, the Schoellkopf Power Station collapsed into the Niagara River. You need to see the photos. And that was an emergency — an environmental emergency — but also an energy, electricity, reliability, emergency. NYPA quickly mobilized 1,200 workers — 1,200 workers to rebuild that plant. Four years later, it was up and running.

We've also had a crisis — 1975 — amid a global crisis. Con Edison sold Indian Point to NYPA, and they operated that plant reliably for 25 years. We got them done. Pataki did it, got some done. But most recently I talked about NYPA, about what we can do to accelerate the building of more plants, and they delivered me a plan within a few months. Time and time again, NYPA delivers and their workers are extraordinary.

We're already identifying potential host communities across Upstate New York. And let me tell you, only receptive, welcoming communities will be considered. And there's a lot of them. There's a lot of them because the communities that already host them know these are good-paying, long-term jobs, and the benefits of the community are also extraordinary.

So everybody's raising their hand right now. It's going to be hard to decide. But unlike what you would've thought years ago, when there was a fear, a legitimate fear of nuclear — I grew up with that as well in the environment — everyone was talking about that. But we'll create 1,600 jobs during construction and 1,200 good-paying, permanent jobs as a result. How does that sound to you? With one facility? That's just one facility.

So to power New York's future, we need three things: reliability, affordability, and sustainability. And nuclear drives all three. Now you'll hear the term base load from a lot of people at NYPA. It's just the minimum amount of power that you need always on, no matter what. It doesn't fluctuate with the weather or the time of day.

Now, if you take nuclear off the table, the only way to do that is more fossil fuels. That's not going to work for us here in New York. We're not going backwards. We're going forward. In the last couple years, we've shut down more than two gigawatts of fossil fuel capacity.

That's why it makes New York's electric grid one the cleanest in the country per capita. But you don't get cleaner air or lower asthma rates for kids by burning fossil fuels. You get there by using more clean power and nuclear is today's answer to that. So look how far we've come.

Why are people like Bill Gates investing in advanced reactors? Why is Microsoft bringing Three Mile Island in Pennsylvania back online to power its cloud computing and AI services? Why are companies like Google and Amazon supporting nuclear capacity around the world? My friends, it's coming and it's back. And if we don't jump on or lead this, they're going to pass us by. These companies will go elsewhere, and I don't want that to happen.

I want to grow our tax base. I want to make New York more affordable. I want good-paying jobs for New Yorkers, and we know this is the best technology to meet this growing demand. One gigawatt, one gigawatt of nuclear. What does that do? It powers a million homes without adding any carbon to the atmosphere and without breaking the bank for consumers. Nuclear power is completely insulated from oil and gas prices. Look what's happening in the Middle East. Imagine a country — imagine a state — that can read that in the news and not worry about the effect on costs going up on the grid or in the utility bills that our hardworking families pay. So no matter what happens in the Middle East, Russia or Venezuela, the cost of operating nuclear won't change. That's the beauty of this as well.

We know that because we have three plants already operating up on Lake Ontario now. When there was fear of losing those jobs, the community was terrified. We had to fight back to save 600 jobs. They've been operating successfully, safely since 1969. The oldest is still functioning right there, and thanks to these, we can generate all this power here. Upstate New York, it's 90 percent of its electricity from clean sources because of what's going on here and those nuclear facilities, but we need to scale it up fast.

So here's the deal, we'll be looking for private partners. Anybody got a lot of money out there? All right, raise your hand if you do. We want to help finance the plant and buy the power it generates. So I'm directing the Department of Public Service to work hand in hand with NYPA to ensure this is done with upfront. The number one focus has to be the ratepayers.

Ratepayers must know that there's going to be reliability, no cost escalation and they'll be able to see into the future what their bills will look like. And we'll make sure this plant keeps the lights on without making it too expensive. So while we're tackling this, leading the transition truly for the nation. I mean, what we do here in New York — the country's watching us, and maybe they're a little surprised and it's unexpected.

But we are bold here. We are not daunted by any challenge. We never hesitate. And you wouldn't have this facility if we weren't bold, audacious — people are willing to try anything. The bigger the better. The bigger the better. And we cannot do this alone. And we're looking forward to partnering with others who've gone before.

Just last week, I sat down with the Premier of Ontario, Tom Ford — had a great conversation about creating a memorandum of understanding because they are taking the lead on small modular reactors; they're building four right now. They'll be underway in 18 months. This is the speed that they're able to accomplish.

So, they're going to work with us, work with the Tennessee Valley Authority. There's people out there that we're going to draw knowledge, technology and expertise from because when we share this expertise, we can deliver clean energy for more households.

And I'm also committed to working with the White House to accelerate this project. I've had some very frank, interesting conversations with the President — all kinds of topics, but every single one of them, I've brought it back to nuclear. So, Mr. President, I need your help. There's a reason people don't embrace nuclear energy — a lot of reasons. One of them: it just takes too long, and the barriers are in Washington. The length of time — 10 years, a decade — of regulatory bureaucracy and red tape that must be gotten through is a reason why it fails and people don't even try. So I said, “Mr. President, if you want energy dominance, I want energy dominance, this is how we do it.” So with their financial planning and hopeful support, we can move as fast as possible, both affordably and safely.

And I said — this is when Elon Musk was still wandering around the White House — I said, “Have Elon Musk and all the ‘DOGE guys’ go over to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. Do you want to find efficiencies? Leave Veterans Administration alone, leave all these other — leave the people who are keeping an eye on our nuclear stockpile; don't be firing them, go help make this operation more efficient. That's how we'll get something done.”

And my last point is safety. I know there's going to be critics, there already are critics of nuclear. I understand that to my — I was going to say to my core — my being. Those arguments went out when we shut down Indian Point; I understood — 26 miles from a major population area; lot of anxiety, I understand it. But, let's be honest, in doing that. We turned off one quarter of New York City's power and it was almost all clean energy. And overnight, without an alternative, we've had to burn more fuels, more fossil fuels have been burned. Greenhouse emissions are up in Downstate New York because of that. There just wasn't a Plan B. I understand it, but there was not a Plan B, so more air pollution Downstate.

We cannot have trade-offs like that. And this is not your grandparents' nuclear reactor. You're not going to see this in a movie starring Jane Fonda — only the early old people caught that — and I wouldn't want that. I don't want to live in a world where people are afraid. But look what's happening, as I said at Three Mile Island. The eyes of the world are watching that place, and now it's going to be a place of jobs and innovation. So the new plan will be a model of 21st century nuclear design with safety at the forefront, automatic safety systems to enhance the containment, and rigorous environmental standards will be met — they truly will.

So — coming to the end here, folks, I know it's a little hot — I'm the first Democratic Governor in a generation to say to nuclear, “I'm embracing this.” My State will embrace this. I want to show this nation that blue states like New York can dream big and build big because we believe in the philosophy abundance. There's a lot of books, and podcasts and conversations about abundance — that's what we do every single day. We find ways where government can drive growth instead of delaying it. And as I've said from the very beginning, we need a government that's on your side, not on your back — there's a big difference. That's how we accomplish great things in partnership with the private sector.

Ideas are easy, but building is hard. But since when do New Yorkers shy away from a challenge — it's just not in our DNA. I'm committed to expanding, not curtailing, New York's carbon free energy capacity, and that means building without fear starting right now. And with this new plant — just like those who are the visionaries, back to FDR, and John Kennedy and others who kept building this facility — we're doing this for our kids, and our grandkids and for generations to come because no matter what technologies define our future, if we want to continue to be an economic powerhouse for the nation and the world, we need reliable power.

And once again, as always, New York will lead the way. Thank you very much.",https://www.governor.ny.gov/sites/default/files/styles/cover_image_660x400_/public/2025-06/energy.jpg?h=b5f6a62e&itok=ulQUj1eC,N,,2025-06-23 15:47:30.761201

Stellantis North America only offers virtual factory tours.","The meteoric rise of China's electric vehicle manufacturers has generated a groundswell of interest from the country's population. Now, tens of thousands of people are signing up for just a chance to get a behind-the-scenes peek at automakers like BYD, Nio and Xiaomi. The chances of winning a tour ticket lottery aren't high, but the slots are far more common than a Wonka Golden Ticket. These companies can't meet the demand to visit these sophisticated assembly plants despite offering daily tours.

Factory tours are typically arranged on a one-off basis for potential investors, government dignitaries and the media. Xiaomi followed this practice at its Beijing assembly plant when it launched the SU7 last year, but allowed 20 members of the general public to visit the site each month. The initial popularity encouraged the smartphone-giant-turned-automaker to dramatically expand its tour capacity for July to handle 1,100 monthly visitors. However, the automaker was swamped with over 27,000 applications, according to Wired.

While Xiaomi is just getting out of the gates, Nio had over 130,000 factory visitors last year. The Shanghai-based company offers tour slots through an in-app loyalty currency. Those wanting to visit the factory can either earn points through using the company's app or simply pay $14 to buy the points necessary.

If you're lucky enough to snag a ticket, you'll be treated to a display of modern automated manufacturing. Xiaomi loads guests onto shuttles that drive through a production line, dodging robotic arms as they construct cars. Human workers are a rare sight during tours, with the plant being 90% automated. It's a similar experience at Nio with the company's fully automated body shop. For the tour's finale, visitors get to experience the product by going for a high-paced ride in a Xiaomi SU7 around a test track. Xiaomi even built a gift shop and cafeteria for visitors.

Automakers offer similar tours in the United States, but they aren't embraced with the same fervor. Ford's River Rouge plant is open to the public sporadically throughout the year. The historic complex opened in 1928 as the largest factory in the world and still produces Ford vehicles today. Corvette fans can also visit the GM Bowling Green Assembly Plant in Kentucky where the iconic sports car is built. However, it's a much rarer experience that is only available for a few weeks per year. It doesn't help matters that an auto theft ring stole eight Corvettes straight from the factory early this year. Stellantis North America only offers virtual factory tours. I'm sure the demand would be there if the Big Three suddenly opened on-site breweries.",https://www.jalopnik.com/img/gallery/chinese-ev-factory-tours-are-so-popular-that-tickets-are-given-out-in-lotteries/l-intro-1750698441.jpg,N,,2025-06-23 18:11:32.638207

But Democrats announced on Sunday that the parliamentarian, a nonpartisan arbiter of the upper chamber’s rules, found that this provision did not pass muster.

“There is no better way to define this Big Beautiful Betrayal of a bill than families lose, and billionaires win,” Sen. Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.) said in a written statement alongside the announcement. “The Byrd Rule is enshrined in law for a reason, and Democrats are making sure it is enforced.”

The Republican bill seeking to advance much of President Trump’s agenda is going through a special process known as budget reconciliation that allows it to avoid the Senate’s typical 60-vote threshold and pass with a simple majority — avoiding the need for any Democratic votes in the process.

However, to qualify for reconciliation, the policies that are included in the bill need to comply with the Byrd Rule, which prevents “extraneous” measures from being included in this type of legislation.

“This is part of the back and forth, and not a big deal,” said a written statement from a spokesperson for Sen Rand Paul (R-Ky.), who chairs the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee.

“If we won everything on the first round, that means we weren’t being aggressive enough. We have contingency plans and will continue to pursue reforms that put the taxpayer first,” the spokesperson said.

Boudette, www.nytimes.com, neal-e-boudette",,,,,https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/23/business/ford-battery-factory-electric-vehicles.html,"But Republicans in Congress are working on a policy bill that could bar federal support for battery plants that use Chinese technology or materials.
“Analysis suggests that repealing clean vehicle tax credits alone could reduce electric vehicle (E.V.)
If the credits survive, they could offset about a quarter of the cost of the plant in Marshall, Ford executives said.
Several other U.S. battery plants use technology from suppliers based in South Korea or Japan, which are not targeted by the bill.
Ms. Drake said the loss of the tax credits would have a “very material” effect on the economics of the Marshall plant.","Ford Motor said on Monday that it was committed to completing and opening a battery plant in Michigan, even if Congress and President Trump make the project ineligible for tax incentives.

The $3 billion plant, in Marshall, Mich., 100 miles west of Detroit, uses battery and manufacturing technology that Ford licensed from a Chinese company, Contemporary Amperex Technology Ltd., known as CATL.

Ford decided to build the factory two years ago under the expectation that a portion of the cost would be offset by federal tax credits provided by the Inflation Reduction Act, former President Joseph R. Biden Jr.’s signature energy and climate change legislation.

But Republicans in Congress are working on a policy bill that could bar federal support for battery plants that use Chinese technology or materials. Mr. Trump has supported that effort and sharply criticized Democratic efforts to encourage the use and production of electric vehicles.

At a tour of the factory on Monday, Lisa Drake, Ford’s vice president for technology platform programs and E.V. systems, said the company would move ahead even if such restrictions were signed into law.

“We don’t want to back off on this facility,” Ms. Drake told reporters. “When we invest, we stick behind our investments. Ford is a company that will weather the storm until we get there.”

Separately on Monday, a senior official of the United Automobile Workers union said eliminating the tax credits related to electric vehicles would hurt manufacturing workers.

“Analysis suggests that repealing clean vehicle tax credits alone could reduce electric vehicle (E.V.) sales as much as 40 percent by 2030, and could result in the idling of existing assembly plants and the cancellation of many planned E.V. battery manufacturing facilities,” Dave Green, the director of the U.A.W. region covering Ohio and Indiana, said in an essay published in The Ohio Capital Journal.

“The irony is stark and painful: thousands of battery workers have just voted to unionize, ensuring their jobs are high-quality and family supporting,” Mr. Green wrote. “Now congressional Republicans are voting to kill those very same jobs.”

In addition to giving tax breaks to consumers who buy or lease electric cars and trucks, the Inflation Reduction Act provides tax credits for automakers and suppliers that build battery plants in the United States. If the credits survive, they could offset about a quarter of the cost of the plant in Marshall, Ford executives said.

The House version of the Republican bill would eliminate credits for plants that were built with materials or technology from China, Iran, North Korea or Russia. The restriction would be particularly damaging to Ford’s Marshall plant. Several other U.S. battery plants use technology from suppliers based in South Korea or Japan, which are not targeted by the bill.

Ford’s plant is scheduled to start production next year and is supposed to create 1,700 jobs. It will churn out a type of battery that uses lithium, iron and phosphate. The technology underlying the batteries was originally developed in the United States, but was commercialized and is now largely dominated by Chinese companies like CATL, the world’s largest battery maker.

LFP batteries costs less than the batteries most commonly found in U.S. electric vehicles because they do not use two relatively expensive materials: nickel and cobalt. Nickel and cobalt batteries can store more energy and, thus, travel longer distances on a full charge. But some automakers like Ford believe that iron-based batteries can provide sufficient driving range at a much lower cost.

Ms. Drake said the loss of the tax credits would have a “very material” effect on the economics of the Marshall plant. She added that Ford probably would have built the plant outside the United States if it had not been promised the credits by the Biden-era law.

“It would really be a shame to build these facilities and then all of a sudden have to scale back on the most important part, which is people,” she said. “It’s 1,700 jobs. They don’t come around all that often.”

The plant has already been affected by the tariffs that Mr. Trump has imposed. The manufacturing machinery for the plant is in transit from China and will be subject to higher tariffs, Ms. Drake said.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/06/23/multimedia/23biz-ford-battery-mjwk/23biz-ford-battery-mjwk-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-06-23 15:46:12.397456

Transform Communities By Adaptive Reuse of Legacy Coal Infrastructure to Support AI Data Centers

06.23.25 | 13 min read | Text by Oreoluwa Runsewe

The rise of artificial intelligence (AI) and the corresponding hyperscale data centers that support it present a challenge for the United States. Data centers intensify energy demand, strain power grids, and raise environmental concerns. These factors have led developers to search for new siting opportunities outside traditional corridors (i.e., regions with longstanding infrastructure and large clusters of data centers), such as Silicon Valley and Northern Virginia. American communities that have historically relied on coal to power their local economies have an enormous opportunity to repurpose abandoned coal mines and infrastructure to site data centers alongside clean power generation. The decline of the coal industry in the late 20th century led to the abandonment of coal mines, loss of tax revenues, destruction of good-paying jobs, and the dismantling of the economic engine of American coal communities, primarily in the Appalachian, interior, and Western coal regions. The AI boom of the 21st century can reinvigorate these areas if harnessed appropriately.

The opportunity to repurpose existing coal infrastructure includes Tribal Nations, such as the Navajo, Hopi, and Crow, in the Western Coal regions. These regions hold post-mining land with potential for economic development, but operate under distinct governance structures and regulatory frameworks administered by Tribal governments. A collaborative approach involving Federal, State, and Tribal governments can ensure that both non-tribal and Tribal coal regions share in the economic benefits of data center investments, while also promoting the transition to clean energy generation by collocating data centers with renewable, clean energy-powered microgrids.

This memo recommends four actions for coal communities to fully capitalize on the opportunities presented by the rise of artificial intelligence (AI).

Establish a Federal-State-Tribal Partnership for Site Selection, Utilizing the Department of the Interior’s (DOI) Abandoned Mine Land (AML) Program.

Develop a National Pilot Program to Facilitate a GIS-based Site Selection Tool

Promote collaboration between states and utility companies to enhance grid resilience from data centers by adopting plug-in and flexible load standards.

Lay the groundwork for a knowledge economy centered around data centers.

By pursuing these policy actions, states like West Virginia, Pennsylvania, and Kentucky, as well as Tribal Nations, can lead America’s energy production and become tech innovation hubs, while ensuring that the U.S. continues to lead the AI race.

Challenge and Opportunity

Energy demands for AI data centers are expected to rise by between 325 and 580 TWh by 2028, roughly the amount of electricity consumed by 30 to 54 million American households annually. This demand is projected to increase data centers’ share of total U.S. electricity consumption to between 6.7% and 12.0% by 2028, according to the 2024 United States Data Center Energy Usage Report by the Lawrence Berkeley National Lab. According to the same report, AI data centers also consumed around 66 billion liters of water for cooling in 2023. By 2028, that number is expected to be between 60 and 124 billion litres for hyperscale data centers alone. (Hyperscale data centers are massive warehouses of computer servers, powered by at least 40 MW of electricity, and run by major cloud companies like Amazon, Google, or Microsoft. They serve a wide variety of purposes, including Artificial intelligence, automation, data analytics, etc.)

Future emissions are also expected to grow with increasing energy usage. Location has also become important; tech companies with AI investments have increasingly recognized the need for more data centers in different places. Although most digital activities are traditionally centered around tech corridors like Silicon Valley and Northern Virginia, the need for land and considerations of carbon emissions footprints in these places make the case for expansion to other sites.

Coal communities have experienced a severe economic decline over the past decade, as coal severance and tax revenues have plummeted. West Virginia, for example, reported an 83% decline in severance tax collections in fiscal year 2024. Competition from natural gas and renewable energy sources, slow growth in energy demand, and environmental concerns have led to coal often being viewed as a backup option. This has led to low demand for coal locally, and thus a decrease in severance, property, sales, and income taxes.

The percentage of the coal severance tax collected that is returned to the coal-producing counties varies by state. In West Virginia, the State Tax Commissioner collects coal severance taxes from all producing counties and deposits them in the State Treasurer’s office. Seventy-five percent of the net proceeds from the taxes are returned to the coal-producing counties, while the remaining 25% is distributed to the rest of the state. Historically, these tax revenues have usually funded a significant portion of county budgets. For counties like Boone in West Virginia and Campbell County in Wyoming, once two of America’s highest coal-producing counties, these revenues helped maintain essential services and school districts. Property taxes and severance taxes on coal funded about 24% of Boone’s school budget, while 59% of overall property valuations in Campbell county in 2017 were coal mining related. With those tax bases eroding, these counties have struggled to maintain schools and public services.

Likewise, the closure of the Kayenta Mine and the Navajo Generating Station resulted in the elimination of hundreds of jobs and significant public revenue losses for the Navajo and Hopi Nations. The Crow Nation, like many other Native American tribes with coal, is reliant on coal leases with miners for revenue. They face urgent infrastructure gaps and declining fiscal capacity since their coal mines were shut down. These tribal communities, with a rich legacy of land and infrastructure, are well-positioned to lead equitable redevelopment efforts if they are supported appropriately by state and federal action.

These communities now have a unique opportunity to attract investments in AI data centers to generate new sources of revenue. Investments in hyperscale data centers will revive these towns through revenue from property taxes, land reclamation, and investments in energy, among other sources. For example, data centers in Northern Virginia, commonly referred to as the “Data Center Alley,” have contributed an estimated 46,000 jobs and up to $10 billion in economic impact to the state’s economy, according to an economic impact report on data centers commissioned by the Northern Virginia Technology Council.

Coal powered local economies and served as the thread holding together the social fabric of communities in parts of Appalachia for decades. Coal-reliant communities also took pride in how coal powered most of the U.S.’s industrialization in the nineteenth century. However, many coal communities have been hollowed out, with thousands of abandoned coal mines and tens of thousands of lost jobs. By inviting investments in data centers and new clean energy generation, these communities can be economically revived. This time, their economies will be centered on a knowledge base, representing a shift from an extraction-based economy to an information-based one. Data centers attract new AI- and big-data-focused businesses, which reinvigorates the local workforce, inspires research programs at nearby academic institutions, and reverses the brain drain that has long impacted these communities.

The federal government has made targeted efforts to repurpose abandoned coal mines. The Abandoned Mine Land (AML) Reclamation Program, created under the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act (SMCRA) of 1977, reclaims lands affected by coal mining and stabilizes them for safe reuse. Building on that, Congress established the Abandoned Mine Land Economic Revitalization (AMLER) Program in 2016 to support the economic redevelopment of reclaimed sites in partnership with state and tribal governments. AMLER sites are eligible for flexible reuse for siting hyperscale AI data centers. Those with flat terrains and legacy infrastructure are particularly desirable for reuse. The AMLER program is supported by a fee collected from active coal mining operations – a fee that has decreased as coal mining operations have ceased – and has also received appropriated Congressional funding since 2016. Siting data centers on AMLER sites can circumvent any eminent domain concerns that arise with project proposals on private lands.

In addition to the legal and logistical advantages of siting data centers on AMLER sites, many of these locations offer more than just reclaimed land; they retain legacy infrastructure that can be strategically repurposed for other uses. These sites often lie near existing transmission corridors, rail lines, and industrial-grade access roads, which were initially built to support coal operations. This makes them especially attractive for rapid redevelopment, reducing the time and cost associated with building entirely new facilities. By capitalizing on this existing infrastructure, communities and investors can accelerate project timelines and reduce permitting delays, making AMLER sites not only legally feasible but economically and operationally advantageous.

Moreover, since some coal mines are built near power infrastructure, there exist opportunities for federal and state governments to allow companies to collocate data centers with renewable, clean energy-powered microgrids, thereby preventing strain on the power grid. These sites present an opportunity for data centers to:

Host local microgrids for energy load balancing and provide an opportunity for net metering;

Develop a model that identifies places across the United States and standardizes data center site selection;

Revitalize local economies and communities;

Invest in clean energy production; and,

Create a knowledge economy outside of tech corridors in the United States.

Precedents for collocating new data centers at existing power plants already exist. In February 2025, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) reviewed potential sites within the PJM Interconnection region to host these pairings. Furthermore, plans to repurpose decommissioned coal power stations as data centers exist in the United States and Europe. However, there remains an opportunity to utilize the reclaimed coal mines themselves. They provide a readily available location with proximity to existing transmission lines, substations, roadways, and water resources. Historically, they also have a power plant ecosystem and supporting infrastructure, meaning minimal additional infrastructure investment is needed to bring them up to par.

Plan of Action

The following recommendations will fast-track America’s investment in data centers and usher it into the next era of innovation. Collaboration among federal agencies, state governments, and tribal governments will enable the rapid construction of data centers in historically coal-reliant communities. Together, they will bring prosperity back to American communities left behind after the decline in the coal industry by investing in their energy capacities, economies, and workforce.

Recommendation 1. Establish a Federal-State-Tribal Partnership for Site Selection, Utilizing the Department of the Interior’s (DOI) Abandoned Mine Land (AML) Program.

The first step in investing in data centers in coal communities should be a collaborative effort among federal, state, and tribal governments to identify and develop data center pilot sites on reclaimed mine lands, brownfields, and tribal lands. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the Department of the Interior (DOI) should jointly identify eligible sites with intact or near-intact infrastructure, nearby energy generation facilities, and broadband corridors, utilizing the Abandoned Mine Land (AML) Reclamation Program and the EPA Brownfields Program. Brownfields with legacy infrastructure should also be prioritized to reduce the need for greenfield development. Where tribal governments have jurisdiction, they should be engaged as co-developers and beneficiaries of data centers, with the right to lead or co-manage the process, including receiving tax benefits from the project. Pre-law AMLs (coal mines that were abandoned before August 3, 1977, when the SMCRA became law) offer the most flexibility in regulations and should be prioritized. Communities will be nominated for site development based on economic need, workforce readiness, and redevelopment plans.

State governments and lawmakers will nominate communities from the federally identified shortlist based on economic need, workforce readiness and mobility, and redevelopment plans.

Recommendation 2. Develop a National Pilot Program to Facilitate a GIS-based Site Selection Tool

In partnership with private sector stakeholders, the DOE National Labs should develop a pilot program for these sites to inform the development of a standardized GIS-based site selection tool. This pilot would identify and evaluate a small set of pre-law AMLs, brownfields, and tribal lands across the Appalachian, Interior, and Western coal regions for data center development.

The pilot program will assess infrastructure readiness, permitting pathways, environmental conditions, and community engagement needs across all reclaimed lands and brownfields and choose those that meet the above standards for the pilot. Insights from these pilots will inform the development of a scalable tool that integrates data on grid access, broadband, water, land use, tax incentives, and workforce capacity.

The GIS tool will equip governments, utilities, and developers with a reliable, replicable framework to identify high-potential data center locations nationwide. For example, the Geospatial Energy Mapper (GEM), developed by Argonne National Laboratory with support from the U.S. Department of Energy, offers a public-facing tool that integrates data on energy resources, infrastructure, land use, and environmental constraints to guide energy infrastructure siting.

The DOE, working in coordination with agencies such as the Department of the Treasury, the Department of the Interior, the Bureau of Indian Affairs, and state economic development offices, should establish targeted incentives to encourage data center companies to join the coalition. These include streamlined permitting, data confidentiality protections, and early access to pre-qualified sites. Data center developers, AI companies, and operators typically own the majority of the proprietary operational and siting data for data centers. Without incentives, this data will be restricted to private industry, hindering public-sector planning and increasing geographic inequities in digital infrastructure investments.

By leveraging the insights gained from this pilot and expanding access to critical siting data, the federal government can ensure that the benefits of AI infrastructure investments are distributed equitably, reaching communities that have historically powered the nation’s industrial growth but have been left behind in the digital economy. A national site selection tool grounded in real-world conditions, cross-agency coordination, and private-public collaboration will empower coal-impacted communities, including those on Tribal lands and in remote Appalachian and Western regions, to attract transformative investment. In doing so, it will lay the foundation for a more inclusive, resilient, and spatially diverse knowledge economy built on reclaimed land.

Recommendation 3. Promote collaboration between states and utility companies to enhance grid resilience from data centers by adopting plug-in and flexible load standards.

Given the urgency and scale of hyperscale data center investments, state governments, in coordination with Public Utility Commissions (PUCs), should adopt policies that allow temporary, curtailable, and plug-in access to the grid, pending the completion of colocated, preferably renewable, energy microgrids in proposed data centers. This plug-in could involve approving provisional interconnection services for large projects, such as data centers. This short-term access is critical for communities to realize immediate financial benefits from data center construction while long-term infrastructure is still being developed. Renewable-powered on-site microgrids for hyperscale data centers typically exceed 100–400 MW per site and require deployment times of up to three years.

To protect consumers, utilities and data center developers must guarantee that any interim grid usage does not raise electricity rates for households or small businesses. The data center and/or utility should bear responsibility for short-term demand impacts through negotiated agreements.

In exchange for interim grid access, data centers must submit detailed grid resilience plans that include:

A time-bound schedule (typically 18–36 months) for deploying an on-site microgrid, preferably powered by renewable energy.

On-site battery storage systems and demand response capabilities to smooth load profiles and enhance reliability.

Participation in net metering to enable excess microgrid energy to be sold back to the grid, benefiting local communities.

Additionally, these facilities should be treated as large, flexible loads capable of supporting grid stability by curtailing non-critical workloads or shifting demand during peak periods. Studies suggest that up to 126 GW of new data center load could be integrated into the U.S. power system with minimal strain if such facilities allow as little as 1% curtailment time (when data centers reduce or pause their electricity usage by 1% of their annual electricity usage).

States can align near-term economic gains with long-term energy equity and infrastructure sustainability by requiring early commitment to microgrid deployment and positioning data centers as flexible grid assets (see FAQs for ideas on water cooling for the data centers).

Recommendation 4. Lay the groundwork for a knowledge economy centered around data centers.

The DOE Office of Critical and Emerging Technologies (CET), in coordination with the Economic Development Administration (EDA), should conduct an economic impact assessment of data center investments in coal-reliant communities. To ensure timely reporting and oversight, the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources and the House Committee on Energy and Commerce should guide and shape the reports’ outcomes, building on President Donald Trump’s executive order to pass legislation on AI education. Investments in data centers offer knowledge economies as an alternative to extractive economies, which have relied on selling fossil fuels, such as coal, that have failed these communities for generations.

A workforce trained in high-skilled employment areas such as AI data engineering, data processing, cloud computing, advanced digital infrastructure, and cybersecurity can participate in the knowledge economy. The data center itself, along with new business ecosystems built around it, will provide these jobs.

Counties will also generate sustainable revenue through increased property taxes, utility taxes, and income taxes from the new businesses. This new revenue will replace the lost revenue from the decline in coal over the past decade. This strategic transformation positions formerly coal-dependent regions to compete in a national economy increasingly shaped by artificial intelligence, big data, and digital services.

This knowledge economy will also benefit nearby universities, colleges, and research institutes by creating research partnership opportunities, developing workforce pipelines through new degree and certificate programs, and fostering stronger innovation ecosystems built around digital infrastructure.

Conclusion

AI is growing rapidly, and data centers are following suit, straining our grid and requiring new infrastructure. Coal-reliant communities possess land and energy assets, and they have a pressing need for economic renewal. With innovative federal-state coordination, we can repurpose abandoned mine lands, boost local tax bases, and build a knowledge economy where coal once dominated. These two pressing challenges—grid strain and post-coal economic decline—can be addressed through a unified strategy: investing in data centers on reclaimed coal lands.

This memo outlines a four-part action plan. First, federal and state governments must collaborate to prepare abandoned mine lands for data center development. Second, while working with private industry, DOE National Labs should develop a standardized, GIS-based site selection tool to guide smart, sustainable investments. Third, states should partner with utilities to allow temporary grid access to data centers, while requiring detailed microgrid-based resilience plans to reduce long-term strain. Fourth, policymakers must lay the foundation for a knowledge economy by assessing the economic impact of these investments, fostering partnerships with local universities, and training a workforce equipped for high-skilled roles in digital infrastructure.

This is not just an energy strategy but also a sustainable economic revitalization strategy. It will transform coal assets that once fueled America’s innovation in the 19th century into assets that will fuel America’s innovation in the 21st century. The energy demands of data centers will not wait; the economic revitalization of Appalachian communities, heartland coal communities, and the Mountain West coal regions cannot wait. The time to act is now.

Frequently Asked Questions

What is an example of a coal mine reclaimed for data center use?

There is no direct example yet of data center companies reclaiming former coal mines. However, some examples show the potential. For instance, plans are underway to transform an abandoned coal mine in Wise County, Virginia, into a solar power station that will supply a nearby data center.

Why collocate energy generation with data centers?

Numerous examples from the U.S. and abroad exist of tech companies collocating data centers with energy-generating facilities to manage their energy supply and reduce their carbon footprint. Meta signed a long-term power-purchase agreement with Sage Geosystems for 150 MW of next-generation geothermal power in 2024, enough to run multiple hyperscale data centers. The project’s first phase is slated for 2027 and will be located east of the Rocky Mountains, near Meta’s U.S. data center fleet.

Internationally, Facebook built its Danish data center into a district heating system, utilizing the heat generated to supply more than 7,000 homes during the winter. Two wind energy projects power this data center with 294 MW of clean energy.

Are there examples of data centers as anchors for a knowledge economy?

Yes! Virginia, especially Northern Virginia, is a leading hub for data centers, attracting significant investment and fostering a robust tech ecosystem. In 2023, new and expanding data centers accounted for 92% of all new investment announced by the Virginia Economic Development Partnership. This growth supports over 78,000 jobs and has generated $31.4 billion in economic output, a clear sign of the job creation potential of the tech industry. Data centers have attracted supporting industries, including manufacturing facilities for data center equipment and energy monitoring products, further bolstering the state’s knowledge economy.

Why are some AMLER-eligible sites less valuable than post-1977 mine sites for reuse?

AMLER funds are federally restricted to use on or adjacent to coal mines abandoned before August 3, 1977. However, some of these pre-1977 sites—especially in Appalachia and the West—are not ideal for economic redevelopment due to small size, steep slopes, or flood risk. In contrast, post-1977 mine sites that have completed reclamation (SMCRA Phase III release) are more suitable for data centers due to their flat terrain, proximity to transmission lines, and existing utilities. Yet, these sites are not currently eligible for AMLER funding. To fully unlock the economic potential of coal communities, federal policymakers should consider expanding AMLER eligibility or creating a complementary program that supports the reuse of reclaimed post-1977 mine lands, particularly those that are already prepared for industrial use.

Why do Brownfields make sense for data centers?

Brownfields are previously used industrial or commercial properties, such as old factories, decommissioned coal-fired power plants, rail yards, and mines, whose reuse is complicated by real or suspected environmental contamination. By contrast, Greenfields are undeveloped acreage that typically requires the development of new infrastructure and land permitting from scratch. Brownfields offer land developers and investors faster access to existing zoning, permitting, transportation infrastructure, and more.

Since 1995, the EPA Brownfields Program has offered competitive grants and revolving loan funds for assessing, cleaning up, and training for jobs at Brownfield sites, transforming liabilities into readily available assets. A study estimated that every federal dollar spent by the EPA in 2018 leveraged approximately $16.86 in follow-on capital and created 8.6 jobs for every $100,000 of grant money. In 2024, the Agency added another $300 million to accelerate projects in disadvantaged communities.

What federal action is needed to situate data centers on public lands?

In early 2025, the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) issued a Request for Information (RFI) seeking input on siting artificial intelligence and data infrastructure on DOE-managed federal lands, including National Labs and decommissioned sites. This effort reflects growing federal interest in repurposing publicly-owned sites to support AI infrastructure and grid modernization. Like the approach recommended in this memo, the RFI process recognizes the need for multi-level coordination involving federal, state, tribal, and local governments to assess land readiness, streamline permitting, and align infrastructure development with community needs. Lessons from that process can help guide broader efforts to repurpose pre-law AMLs, brownfields, and tribal lands for data center investment.

Can we use flooded mines for server cooling?

Yes, by turning a flooded mine into a giant underground cooler. Abandoned seams in West Virginia hold water that remains at a steady temperature of ~50–55°F (10–13°C). A Marshall University study logged 54°F mine-pool temperatures and calculated that closed-loop heat exchangers can reduce cooling power enough to achieve paybacks in under five years. The design lifts the cool mine water to the servers in the data centers, absorbs heat from the servers, and then returns the warmed water underground, so the computer hardware side never comes into contact with raw mine water. The approach is already being commercialized: Virginia’s “Data Center Ridge” project secured $3 million in AMLER funds, plus $1.5 million from DOE, to cool 36 MW blocks with up to 10 billion gallons of mine water held at a temperature of below 55°F.",https://fas.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/clemens-van-lay-5XmeG6wkN3A-unsplash-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-06-23 15:46:46.456086

“It would be a shame to build these facilities and then all of a sudden you have to scale back on the most important part of it, which is people,” Lisa Drake, Ford’s vice president of platform programs and EV systems, told reporters during a tour of the plant in Marshall on Monday. “We want to spend our investment creating manufacturing jobs here.”

At risk in Congressional budget negotiations is a production tax credit in President Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act known as 45X. The law incentivizes manufacturing of battery cells and packs in the US. Ford would stand to earn about $2.3 billion between 2026 and 2029 under the current law, according to data firm Benchmark Minerals.

China dominates production of LFP batteries, which are cheaper and more stable than nickel-based alternatives popular in the west.

“It’s going to be hard to decide.” Among those likely in the running is the Nine Mile Point nuclear plant in Oswego.
There are 54 operating nuclear power plants in the country, according to the U.S. Department of Energy’s Energy Information Administration.
The last nuclear power plant built in the state was Unit 2 at Nine Mile Point in 1989.
The New York Power Authority previously operated two nuclear plants, including the Indian Point Power Plant, which shut down in 2021.","NEW YORK (AP) — New York’s governor on Monday proposed the construction of the state’s first new nuclear power plant in decades.

Gov. Kathy Hochul directed the state’s power authority to develop an advanced, “zero-emission” facility in upstate New York that she hopes will help create a clean, reliable and affordable electric grid for the state.

She said the state power authority will seek to develop “at least” one new nuclear energy facility with a combined capacity of no less than one gigawatt of electricity. That would increase the state’s total nuclear capacity to about 4.3 gigawatts.

The Democrat, speaking at the Niagara County Power Project in Lewiston, said the state needs to secure its “energy independence” if it wants to continue to attract large manufacturers that create good-paying jobs as it deactivates aging fossil fuel power plants.

Acknowledging critics of nuclear power, she pledged the new facility or facilities would be safer than their predecessors.

“This is not your grandparents’ nuclear reactor,” Hochul said. “The new plan will be a model of 21st century nuclear design with safety at the forefront, automatic safety systems to enhance the containment, and rigorous environmental standards.”

The governor said the state hasn’t decided on a potential location, but that upstate communities appear receptive, given the potential for creating 1,600 construction jobs and 1,200 permanent jobs once the facility is operational.

“Everybody is raising their hand right now,” Hochul said. “It’s going to be hard to decide.”

Among those likely in the running is the Nine Mile Point nuclear plant in Oswego. Hochul’s administration has been supportive of Maryland power company Constellation’s bid to build a new nuclear reactor at the two-reactor facility.

There are 54 operating nuclear power plants in the country, according to the U.S. Department of Energy’s Energy Information Administration.

But American utilities have been broadly reluctant to launch new nuclear plants due to high cost overruns and delays on recent high-profile projects.

Georgia Power Company completed the first two new nuclear reactors in the country in a generation last year. Units 3 and 4 at Plant Vogtle in Waynesboro, Georgia, cost nearly $35 billion and were powered up some seven years later than initially hoped.

Last month, the Tennessee Valley Authority, the nation’s largest public power company, applied to the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission to develop what it bills as a next-generation nuclear power plant at its Clinch River site in Oak Ridge.

New York currently has three active nuclear plants, all located upstate along Lake Ontario and owned by Constellation. The Nine Mile Point, Robert Emmett Ginna and James A. FitzPatrick plants provide about 3.3 gigawatts of power, or roughly 20% of the state’s electricity, according to Hochul’s office.

The last nuclear power plant built in the state was Unit 2 at Nine Mile Point in 1989. At its peak, nuclear power provided about 5.4 gigawatts, or roughly one-third of the state’s electrical supply, according to the advocacy group Nuclear New York.

The New York Power Authority previously operated two nuclear plants, including the Indian Point Power Plant, which shut down in 2021. That facility was located along the Hudson River some 25 miles (40 kilometers) north of New York City in Buchanan.

The other facility, once operated by the state, was the FitzPatrick plant, which the power authority sold in 2000 and is now run by Constellation.

She should stay the course by working to repeal the IRA’s clean energy credits in the Big Beautiful Bill.
Tom Pyle is the President of the American Energy Alliance.","By TOM PYLE | AMERICAN ENERGY ALLIANCE

President Trump’s “energy dominance” agenda was on display in Alaska recently when his top energy officials – Energy Secretary Chris Wright, Interior Secretary Doug Burgum, and EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin – spent a week touring and learning more about the state’s critical role and potential in our country’s energy dominance agenda. They underscored the President’s push to expand energy development and production and stood ready to make Alaska front and center. We currently have an administration that, more than any in history, wants to see Alaska succeed. Are you listening, Senator Murkowski?

When the Senate passed the deceptively named Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) in 2022, Senator Murkowski made the right call – she voted no, declaring it was riddled with “new taxes that will burden the American people and American business for years to come.” She even went so far as to say, “There is no doubt in my mind, based on both substance and process, that the Senate should not have passed it.”

Now, less than three years later, Senator Murkowski is openly working to salvage the very subsidies and tax credits she once so publicly, and correctly, opposed.

A massive green spending spree masked as economic policy, the IRA served almost fully to prop up “clean” energy schemes. The many energy credits included were a partisan-fueled giveaway to politically favored industries.

Instead of encouraging the development of Alaska’s natural resources to deliver jobs and affordable energy for Alaskans, the IRA energy credits incentivize companies to use Alaska as a guinea pig, dropping in with pilot projects, and conducting their experiments on the backs of American taxpayers.

The truth is these subsidies are not about “innovation” or “energy independence.” They’re about Washington picking winners and losers and pouring hundreds of billions of dollars into technologies that can’t stand on their own. It’s also certainly not about the environment. Wind and solar generation require 10 times more land per unit of power than coal or natural gas power plants. Not to mention the effect of wind farms on local wildlife.

Alaska’s – and America’s – economy still depends on oil and gas. No amount of subsidized wind turbines or solar panels is going to change that anytime soon. Focusing on taxpayer-funded experiments above the sector that drives the state’s economy is both ineffective and shortsighted.

Senator Murkowski’s effort to protect these Biden-era tax credits is not leadership—it’s backpedaling. If she truly believed the IRA was flawed when it passed, then she should be working to dismantle it, not prop it up. What changed her mind?

Alaska doesn’t need more federal handouts, it needs an energy policy grounded in reality. That means supporting oil and gas development, improving permitting processes, and investing in infrastructure. It does not mean jumping on the green energy bandwagon simply because some of the wasteful money is already flowing.

Senator Murkowski was right in 2022. She should stay the course by working to repeal the IRA’s clean energy credits in the Big Beautiful Bill. It would be good for her state, her constituency, and the country.

The plant will produce enough output to power around one million homes.

Hochul requested that the new plant produce 1 gigawatt of electricity generation to the state’s nuclear power. The New York Power Authority will identify a site in upstate New York to host the new plant, as well as the design. The state will seek out private partners to produce the electricity, and then the state will buy the power.

The new plant is expected to create around 1,200 permanent jobs, on top of 1,600 construction jobs. It is unclear when exactly the new plant will open.

Hochul said that a major focus of the plant will be making sure that rates for electricity don’t go up over time. She wants to work bipartisan with President Donald Trump to ensure that the program happens.

“Rate payers must know that there’s going to be reliability, no cost escalation, and to be able to see into the future what their bills will look like,” Hochul said at the announcement in Lewiston on Monday.

There are currently 54 nuclear plants operating in the U.S. Three of them are located in New York, all on the shoreline of Lake Ontario: Ginna Power Plant, northeast of Rochester and FitzPatrick Power Plant and Nine Mile Point Nuclear Station, both northeast of Oswego. The three of them power just under four million homes in New York combined, according to Nuclear Energy Institute.

State Senator George Borrello has called for the state to put the site in Dunkirk on the former NRG power plant site.

Critics of nuclear power have cited high costs and potential safety risks as reasons why the country should use less nuclear power. New York shut down Indian Point Energy Center, a plant a little over 25 miles north of New York City, in 2020 due to safety concerns.

“I know people are anxious about this. Many people have not experienced it,” Hochul said. “But they need to know we’ve had decades of people living in our state with nuclear right next door. It’s part of the community and they know that their energy is going to be reliable.”

Today's China's Contemporary Amperex Technology Co., Limited (CATL) is the world's leading manufacturer of LFP batteries.
""The [production tax credit] allows us to keep on this path, and to keep going.""
Where it stands: The Republican-controlled Senate could vote as early as Wednesday on a budget bill that would rewrite language around EV tax credits.
A House version of the bill passed last month effectively killed the production tax credits for manufacturers by severely tightening the eligibility requirements.","Ford Motor is pushing ahead with a politically controversial battery factory in Michigan, even as Congress moves closer to eliminating the lucrative Biden-era tax subsidies that made the project financially feasible.

Why it matters: Ford's argument is that by building batteries using technology licensed from China's leading battery producer, CATL, it is helping to re-shore important manufacturing expertise that was long ago ceded to China.

Driving the news: Ford on Monday gave reporters a tour of the 60%-complete factory in Marshall, about 100 miles west of Detroit.

The stated objective was to provide media access to the plant before ""clean room"" equipment is installed and tours would be off-limits.

But Ford clearly wanted to also show off its $3 billion commitment to the facility ahead of an expected Senate vote this week on a budget reconciliation bill that could wipe out many electric vehicle incentives provided under the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act.

Zoom in: Consumer tax credits for EV purchases get the most attention, but for manufacturers, the far more lucrative incentives come in the form of production tax credits.

Companies could receive a tax credit of $35 per kilowatt-hour for each U.S.-made cell, and another $10 per kilowatt-hour for each battery pack.

With an annual production capacity of 20 GWh, Ford's battery plant could potentially receive a $900 million tax credit, offsetting almost one-third of its investment.

The big picture: In the quest to make more affordable electric vehicles, lithium-iron-phosphate batteries have emerged as a reliable, cost-effective solution.

LFP batteries were invented in 1997 at the University of Texas, but, as often happens with U.S.-developed technology, they ended up being industrialized in China during the 2010s.

Today's China's Contemporary Amperex Technology Co., Limited (CATL) is the world's leading manufacturer of LFP batteries.

Ford wanted to use cheaper LFP batteries in its next-generation of EVs, but didn't have the technology, so it made the decision to license CATL's intellectual property in order to be globally competitive.

What they're' saying: ""LFP batteries are produced all around Europe, and the rest of the world,"" said Lisa Drake, Ford's vice president of technology platform programs and EV systems.

""How can we compete if we don't have this technology? Somebody has to take the lead to do this,"" she said, adding that it will lead to homegrown innovation and the seeding of a domestic supply base.

""I'm convinced this is the right thing to do for the United States,"" she said.

Between the lines: Drake said the tax subsidies are even more important in the face of slower-than-expected EV demand.

""When EV adoption slowed, it just became a huge headwind,"" she said. ""The [production tax credit] allows us to keep on this path, and to keep going.""

""We don't want to back off on scaling, hiring or training in an industry we need to be competitive in the future,"" she said.

""It would be a shame to build these facilities and then have to scale back on the most important part of it, which is the people. These are 1,700 jobs. They don't come along very often.""

Where it stands: The Republican-controlled Senate could vote as early as Wednesday on a budget bill that would rewrite language around EV tax credits.

A House version of the bill passed last month effectively killed the production tax credits for manufacturers by severely tightening the eligibility requirements.

It also specifically prohibited credits for batteries made in the U.S. under a Chinese licensing agreement — a direct hit on Ford.

What to watch: A Ford spokeswoman said that draft language in the Senate version appears to be ""more workable.""

The bottom line: Nothing's certain until the two chambers agree on something.",https://images.axios.com/U2v__BOETNog4zsx06Vz6suWleM=/0x447:5866x3747/1366x768/2025/06/23/1750697321146.jpg,N,,2025-06-23 15:46:17.347496

It preserves and reinforces the “proximate cause” standard articulated in Public Citizen for assessing the connection between the federal agency action and the environmental effects of a separate activity.
The Court noted that project opponents may not always be motivated by their concern for the environment, instead using NEPA to prevent new infrastructure projects.","On May 29, 2025, in a decision long-awaited by project developers, the Supreme Court issued Seven County Infrastructure Coalition v. Eagle County, Colorado, which clarified the proper scope of review and deference to be afforded to agency decisionmaking under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA). This decision reinforces longstanding Supreme Court holdings and may help improve the NEPA process by providing support for agencies to focus their NEPA reviews on impacts associated with their authorizations.

Background

In Seven County, the U.S. Surface Transportation Board (Board) prepared a 3,600 page environmental impact statement (EIS) to evaluate a proposal by seven Utah counties to construct an 88-mile railroad line connecting Utah’s oil-rich Uinta Basin to the national rail network. The EIS acknowledged the potential upstream environmental effects from additional oil drilling projects in the Uinta Basin and potential downstream environmental effects of increased oil refining along the Gulf Coast, but found that those impacts did not need to be analyzed in further detail. The D.C. Circuit vacated the EIS and the Board’s final approval of the railway, finding that the Board erred by failing to analyze those potential upstream and downstream effects in the EIS.

The Supreme Court’s Decision

In a unanimous decision authored by Justice Kavanaugh, the Court reversed the D.C. Circuit and held that (1) NEPA requires courts to afford agencies “substantial judicial deference,” and (2) NEPA does not require the Board to evaluate “effects from potential future projects or from geographically separate projects.” The Court also found it salient that the Board would have no authority over such projects. Notably, all eight Justices who took part in the decision concurred in the judgment on the basis that it was consistent with the Court’s longstanding NEPA precedent.

The Court began its analysis by reinforcing the fundamental principle that NEPA is a purely procedural statute; it does not mandate particular results, but simply prescribes the necessary process for an agency’s environmental review of a project. It proceeded to explain that the D.C. Circuit erred both on the deference afforded to the Board’s decisionmaking and on its review of the merits.

Deference

The Court stated that “when determining whether an agency’s EIS complied with NEPA, a court should afford substantial deference to the agency.” In the context of NEPA reviews, agencies are forced to make numerous determinations of fact and policy; the Court “doubly underscored” that NEPA is inherently a “rule of reason,” and lower courts may not substitute their judgement for that of the agency as to the environmental consequences of its actions. The Court noted that agencies are in the best position to “determine whether and to what extent to prepare an EIS.” When it comes to environmental effects associated with a proposed project, feasible alternatives to that project, and the scope of effects to be analyzed (i.e., indirect effects or effects from future or geographically separate projects), it is the agency’s role to draw an appropriate line, “so long as [those decisions] fall within a broad zone of reasonableness.”

The Court observed that some reviewing courts have not applied NEPA correctly and, instead, have “engaged in overly intrusive (and unpredictable) review.” The Court concluded that, absent a “course correction of sorts,” this application of NEPA will continue to hamstring new infrastructure and construction projects. When evaluating an EIS for deficiencies, reviewing courts must keep in mind that NEPA is “purely procedural,” only obligating an agency to prepare an adequate report, and does not impose any substantive constraints on the agency’s ultimate decision to approve or support a project. In short, “[t]he bedrock principle of judicial review in NEPA cases can be stated in a word: Deference.”

The Court also found that even if an EIS is deficient in some aspects, those deficiencies do not necessarily require a reviewing court to invalidate an agency’s decision to approve a project.

Merits

On the merits, the Court concluded that NEPA does not require an agency to evaluate environmental effects from separate projects that may occur in the future or are geographically distinct, reiterating its holding in Department of Transportation v. Public Citizen that the effects of a separate project need not be considered under NEPA because the separate project breaks the chain of proximate causation. Here, the Uinta Basin Railway was the relevant project and the Court concluded that nothing in NEPA required the Board to study environmental impacts from separate upstream or downstream projects. In other words, a mere “but for” causal relationship is insufficient to make an agency responsible for a particular effect.

The Court recognized that indirect effects—i.e., environmental effects generated by the project that occur later in time or outside the project’s location—may fall within NEPA, but consideration of such effects is different than an agency considering effects of separate projects that may result. The Court concluded that NEPA does not require the latter.

Key Takeaways

Seven County is significant for numerous reasons, including:

It reinforces the longstanding principle that NEPA is a purely procedural statute, and it instructs courts to account for that principle when considering the reasonableness of the agency’s decisionmaking.

It highlights the significant deference that is to be afforded to agency decisionmaking under NEPA.

It preserves and reinforces the “proximate cause” standard articulated in Public Citizen for assessing the connection between the federal agency action and the environmental effects of a separate activity. It also confirms that “but-for” causation is not sufficient to demonstrate that an effect should be analyzed.

The decision is also noteworthy for its commentary on how NEPA litigation has negatively impacted project development. The Court noted that project opponents may not always be motivated by their concern for the environment, instead using NEPA to prevent new infrastructure projects. The end result is that “fewer projects make it to the finish line. Indeed, fewer projects make it to the starting line. Those that survive often end up costing much more than is anticipated or necessary, both for the agency preparing the EIS and for the builder of the project.” To the extent the Court’s decision helps clarify and improve the NEPA review process and makes it more difficult to set aside an agency’s NEPA review, this decision may spur additional development and innovation.

The Court’s finding that a determination that a NEPA review is inadequate in some respects does not necessarily require a reviewing court to invalidate an agency’s approval may result in more lower court decisions declining to vacate or set aside NEPA reviews, even where there may be some deficiencies.

Construction of the 2 million square-foot plant in Marshall, Michigan, is well underway. Over the next few months, it will be filled with manufacturing equipment to turn raw materials into LFP battery cells for future EVs. That includes the cheaper model that Ford's ""skunkworks"" team is working on in California.

When completed, it's expected to bring about 1,700 manufacturing jobs. Ford will then be the only automaker building LFP batteries in America. The company isn't saying how many battery cells the plant will make or for how many EVs, but it is targeting about 20 gigawatt-hours per year of energy output, about two-thirds the targets of Tesla's Nevada Gigafactory. Back-of-the-napkin math suggests that's enough for around 250,000 cars with modestly sized packs.

Getting to this point has not been without difficulty or controversy.

Ford LFP battery cells

LFP batteries were indeed developed in the U.S., by researchers at the University of Texas at Austin in the late 1990s. However, the technology was heavily commercialized and patented by an array of Chinese companies. Automakers in that country have since run with LFP batteries and developed groundbreaking new applications for them, including BYD's five-minute fast-charging Flash battery.

Today, when U.S.-based automakers like Ford and Tesla use LFP batteries, they are sourced from the Chinese giant CATL. Those EVs include some current versions of Ford's Mustang Mach-E.

In order to manufacture its own LFP batteries stateside, Ford has to license the technology from CATL, something that has drawn the ire of U.S. lawmakers in recent years and sparked a political uproar in Michigan.

The batteries use a Ford-specific design, and equipment at the plant has been sourced from unnamed global companies; the chemistry itself, product design and manufacturing process to make those batteries are what's licensed from CATL, Ford officials said. CATL employees will eventually arrive to advise and train American workers on how to use that equipment.

While Drake admits the battery project ""got caught up in the political storm,"" she said doing the project this way was ""the right thing to do"" for both jobs and Ford's future EV projects.

""We don't misappropriate [intellectual property] at Ford,"" she said. ""You just can't use it without that. You'll be in violation of a piece of paper that has passed across the globe. It's just a means to get that back.""

The New U.S. Affordable EV Battery Race

China got hold of LFP technology, built it out, scaled it and got better and better at it every year, Drake said. If all goes according to plan for Ford, the U.S. can do the same.

""You'll often hear people say, 'Well, China holds 90% of the raw materials, or you can't build LFP without Chinese materials,'"" she said. ""I'm here to tell you that that's not true, that you can build LFP without Chinese critical minerals. It's very, very difficult to do, but our supply chain team at Ford went and did it.""

Ford is also in a race with crosstown rival General Motors to develop lithium-manganese-rich (LMR) batteries, which should also unlock more affordable EVs independent of China's supply chains. Both are expected to be deployed by the end of this decade.

Like many other automakers, Ford is dipping into several different battery chemistries for different applications. It also currently uses nickel-manganese-cobalt (NCM) batteries developed with South Korean companies SK On and LG Energy Solution; most U.S.-market EVs use this chemistry.

However, Drake said that LFP batteries will be essential to making affordable EVs quickly. It probably could have taken Ford ""a decade"" to fully scale up LFP technology on its own, she said, but this deal will hopefully allow them to get a jump-start. ""We'll use all three [battery chemistries] because we have a full-line EV plan,"" Drake said.

""We have affordable EVs, entry-level. We have our commercial EVs, which are very important to Ford. And then our next generation pickup built in Tennessee, that will get the NCM [battery] as well,"" she said.

The batteries coming out of Marshall will go into the first kind of car specifically, plant officials said. And that alone could represent a comeback of sorts for Ford.

While it was early to the modern electric race with the Mach-E, F-150 Lightning and E-Transit, Ford's immediate ambitions have cooled off as EV demand failed to skyrocket to projected levels. It has since canceled a three-row electric SUV and delayed other products, including an ostensible EV truck successor to the Lightning.

Gallery: Ford Affordable Skunkworks EV Rendering

Besides that vehicle, Ford's hopes for the future rest on its ""skunkworks"" program, a secretive project that aims to make low-cost EVs to compete with China's automakers and Tesla. Those will include a midsize truck (possibly Ranger-sized) and a small crossover, Ford has said, and up to six other body styles.

The hope is that these more affordable EVs, whose prices have not been revealed, will help drive up electric car demand, said Scott Davis, CEO of BlueOval Battery Michigan LLC, the wholly-owned Ford subsidiary behind the plant.

""We are really excited for the EV adoption to pick up,"" Davis said. ""A key part of that is the value story for the end customers. And of course, localizing here in America supports that very directly.""

A Political Fight For Ford

Shifting U.S. policy priorities toward EVs have created headwinds for the project. Ford now stands to lose the battery production credit created by the Inflation Reduction Act if President Donald Trump's tax-slashing Big, Beautiful Bill is signed into law. That tax credit would offset a significant amount of the costs involved with the factory, company officials said. Ford executive chairman Bill Ford has said losing that would imperil jobs.

Meanwhile, the connection to CATL remains a point of contention. The plant was originally slated to go to Virginia, but it was rejected by Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin over his concerns about Chinese involvement. CATL, the world's largest battery manufacturer, was also added to a Pentagon blacklist at the beginning of this year. (The company called the move ""a mistake"" because it ""has never engaged in any military-related business or activities."")

""If [local authorities] and the Ford Motor Company proceed with partnering with CATL, they risk supporting a company linked to the erosion of American manufacturing, and the endangerment of the brave men and women who serve our country in the military, as well as a company linked to the ongoing genocide in Xinjiang,"" said Rep. John Moolenaar, the chairman of the House Select Committee on China.

Ford, however, has maintained that the factory is ""Ford-owned and Ford-operated,"" and Drake said the licensing deal with CATL is merely a ""legal fact"" because of who owns the patents. And not investing in the plant risks putting the American auto industry further behind China's.

""I think if people really knew what was at stake, they'd say 'Go for it,'"" Drake said.

In today’s 24/7, always-on economy, limiting how we meet energy demand can create unintended consequences.
From data centers and artificial intelligence to electric vehicles, cooking, and home heating, electricity demand is growing rapidly—and much of that demand is still powered by natural gas.
Natural gas continues to be a critical enabler, capable of delivering the firm, dispatchable power required to balance the intermittency of renewables.
These industries depend on consistent, high-temperature output, which natural gas uniquely provides.","In March, a massive power outage shut down one of the world’s busiest airports for a full day, canceling over 1,300 flights and stranding tens of thousands of passengers in London.

Then, in May, New Orleans leaders were forced to cut electricity to more than 100,000 customers as early-season heat pushed demand beyond the grid’s capabilities.

These events aren’t isolated; they reflect a broader, emerging pattern. The energy sector is at a pivotal moment.

In today’s 24/7, always-on economy, limiting how we meet energy demand can create unintended consequences. Energy needs aren’t uniform—each community across North America has different requirements, shaped by local geography, availability of infrastructure and economic conditions.

But despite these differences, one reality remains constant: energy is essential to fuel everyday life and our economy. That shared dependence calls for a pragmatic and comprehensive strategy—an all-of-the-above approach to energy.

This “you-need-it-all” mindset positions Enbridge for growth.

Built for moments of rising demand

“Remember, we’ve built this company for exactly this type of moment—a resilient company that can thrive in all seasons,” said Greg Ebel, Enbridge President and CEO.

One example: the accelerating electrification of the economy. From data centers and artificial intelligence to electric vehicles, cooking, and home heating, electricity demand is growing rapidly—and much of that demand is still powered by natural gas. In fact, natural gas was the single largest source of electricity generation in the U.S. in 2023, accounting for 43% of total output, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.

At the same time, clean energy sources like wind, solar, and battery storage are playing a larger and increasingly valuable role. Their low operating costs and deployment flexibility make them essential parts of the energy mix. But even as these technologies expand, they remain dependent on reliable backup. Natural gas continues to be a critical enabler, capable of delivering the firm, dispatchable power required to balance the intermittency of renewables.

Beyond electricity generation, natural gas remains indispensable for high-heat industrial processes that can’t easily be electrified—such as steelmaking, cement production and chemical manufacturing. These industries depend on consistent, high-temperature output, which natural gas uniquely provides. Without it, production efficiency would fall, and costs would rise, sometimes dramatically.

The growing complexity of today’s energy systems is mirrored by North America’s increasing reliance on the power grid, even as that infrastructure shows signs of wear. The American Society of Civil Engineers recently downgraded the energy sector’s 2025 Infrastructure Report Card to a D+ from a C- in 2021. The report cited shortages of essential equipment like transformers and limited transmission capacity as key risks, underscoring the urgent need for investment.

Reliable, always-on energy

For operations with mission-critical functions, uninterrupted power isn’t a convenience—it’s a necessity. In hospitals, military installations and water treatment plants, even brief outages can have life-threatening consequences.

That same reliability is also essential to managing stormwater systems, operating inland waterways, and maintaining secure communications. In an increasingly digital and interconnected world, cybersecurity risks also escalate during prolonged blackouts.

At Enbridge, we understand that being “always on” means keeping energy flowing—we continually modernize our systems to ensure safety, reliability and efficiency—and being equipped to respond, recover and adapt through all types of disruption.

Our longstanding commitment to reliability and delivery for our customers has made us leaders in building and operating high-performance, multi-fuel energy super systems.

Enbridge operates the continent’s largest natural gas utility by volume, transports 20% of the natural gas consumed in the U.S, operates North America’s longest oil and liquids transportation network and generates more than 3,400 MW (net) of renewable power.

That scale and experience reinforce what we know to be true: overcoming today’s energy challenges,and capturing tomorrow’s opportunities, will require a diversified, resilient, all-of-the-above energy approach.",https://www.enbridge.com/~/media/Enb/Images/Stories/2025/June/Banner_ST_06_23_2025_Resilient_diverse_energy_system_1400x600.jpg?rev=8d3002702f364d40980a64ca1ffac9f2&hash=DB8C7DD1487217A7C26F94826C2F1884,N,,2025-06-23 15:47:54.710002

Accordingly, any entity considering a challenge to an EPA action under the CAA, or considering intervening to support an EPA action, should have a clear understanding of these cases and the underlying venue statute.","In a pair of closely watched decisions issued on June 18, 2025, the U.S. Supreme Court answered a critical procedural question under the Clean Air Act (CAA): is the proper venue for judicial review of U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) actions under the CAA the D.C. Circuit or a regional Circuit Court? Together, these cases provide important guidance for determining where to file actions challenging EPA decisions under the CAA.

In Environmental Protection Agency v. Calumet Shreveport Refining, LLC (Calumet), the Court held that the D.C. Circuit was the proper venue to hear challenges to EPA denials of Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) program small refinery exemption (SRE) petitions. By contrast, in Oklahoma. v. Environmental Protection Agency (Oklahoma), the Court ruled challenges to EPA’s disapproval of State Implementation Plans (SIPs) belonged in the applicable regional Circuit Court (in Oklahoma’s case, the Tenth Circuit).

Key Takeaways

Under CAA Section 7607(b)(1), venue for judicial review of EPA actions depends on how the action is classified:

“Nationally applicable” actions go to the D.C. Circuit;

“Locally or regionally applicable” actions go to regional Circuit Courts; and

An exception allows “locally or regionally applicable” actions to be reviewed in the D.C. Circuit if the EPA finds and publishes that the action is “based on a determination of nationwide scope or effect.”

The Court’s decisions set forth tests courts should apply in determining whether an EPA action is “nationally applicable” or “locally or regionally applicable.” The decisions also detail the circumstances in which the exception applies, allowing locally or regionally applicable actions to be reviewed in the D.C. Circuit.

A clear understanding of these cases is critical for any entity considering a challenge to EPA action under the CAA.

Background and Discussion

Calumet: Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) Small Refinery Exemption Denials

In Calumet, the Supreme Court was asked to determine which Circuit Court can properly hear challenges to EPA’s denial of multiple SRE petitions under the CAA’s RFS program. The RFS program requires most domestic refineries to blend specified volumes of ethanol and other renewable fuels into the transportation fuels they produce. Small refineries petitioned EPA to grant a total of 105 SREs exemptions, arguing they faced “disproportionate economic hardship.”

Following the Supreme Court’s decision in HollyFrontier Cheyenne Refining, LLC v. Renewable Fuels Assn., 594 U.S. 382 (2021), EPA denied the SRE petitions in two separate actions (one covering 36 petitions from compliance year 2018, the other covering 69 petitions from compliance years 2016-2021) based on two core principles:

Hardship must be directly caused by RFS compliance; and

Small refineries generally pass compliance costs to consumers (the RIN passthrough theory).

Applying these principles uniformly nationwide, EPA issued nationwide denials for 105 petitions, asserting that the decisions were either nationally applicable or locally applicable, but based on nationwide determinations, which triggered D.C. Circuit review.

The Fifth Circuit disagreed with EPA, concluding that the exemption denials were locally applicable actions involving individualized assessments of each refinery’s circumstances and, therefore, fell within the jurisdiction of the regional Circuit Courts.

The Supreme Court reversed the Fifth Circuit. The Court first addressed whether an EPA action is “locally or regionally applicable” by evaluating two questions, “what the relevant ‘action’ is” and “what it means to be ‘nationally applicable’ as opposed to ‘locally or regionally.’” The Court first determined the “action” at issue was each individual denial of an SRE. The Court concluded that because each denial only applies to a single refiner, “which is a particular entity located in a particular place,” the denials are “paradigmatically ‘locally or regionally applicable’ actions.” The Court rejected EPA’s contention that it could “control the unit of ‘action’ used to determine venue,” observing this would “effectively” allow EPA to control venue under the CAA. The Court concluded the CAA did not authorize “such gamesmanship” or “confer such broad discretion.” The Court also rejected EPA’s contentions that an action should be deemed “nationally applicable” where it “affects more than one Circuit” or may “have follow-on effects” under the RFS program more broadly.

Evaluating the exception that would allow such actions to be reviewed in the D.C. Circuit, the Court held that, in determining whether the denials have “nationwide scope or effect,” “courts should assess EPA’s reasoning de novo” and “parse the reasoning offered by EPA in taking an action to decide which determinations primarily drove the action.” Here the Court emphasized EPA’s uniform application of a consistent framework across all petitions and that both its interpretation of “disproportionate economic hardship” and the RIN passthrough theory were “determinations of nationwide effect that formed the core basis for” its denials.

Oklahoma: State Implement Plan (SIP) Disapprovals

SIPs are a critical element of the CAA, which operates under a cooperative federalism model that generally assigns states the primary role of CAA implementation and enforcement under EPA-approved SIPS. In Oklahoma, the Supreme Court was asked to determine whether EPA’s disapproval of Oklahoma and Utah’s SIPs were locally or regionally applicable or nationally applicable. The Court concluded that each SIP disapproval constituted a distinct EPA “action” and were “undisputedly locally or regionally applicable actions” because SIP approvals and disapprovals are state-specific decisions governed by §7410 of the CAA. Echoing its determination in Calumet that each EPA SRE denial is “paradigmatically” a “locally or regionally applicable action,” that the Court described each decision on an individual SIP as “the prototypical” local action. Accordingly, the Court concluded that each disapproval was local or regionally applicable and, therefore, belonged in a regional Circuit Court under the CAA’s venue provision.

The Court rejected EPA’s argument that the disapprovals should be treated as a single nationwide action because they were aggregated into an omnibus rule. The Court emphasized that the relevant “action” is defined by the underlying CAA provision, not EPA’s packaging. The Court rejected EPA’s contention that its use of a “uniform statutory interpretation and common analytical methods” rendered its SIP determinations “nationally applicable,” emphasizing this is only relevant to the second step of its analysis and whether its action is “based on a determination of nationwide scope or effect.” The determination of whether an action is “nationally applicable” turns on whether “it has binding effect throughout the country.”

The Court ruled that the “nationwide scope or effect” exception to regional review did not apply, finding that the disapprovals were primarily based on intensely factual, state-specific analyses, unique to each state’s circumstances, rather than a nationwide rationale. Although EPA used certain national-level analytical tools like the 1% contribution threshold as screening mechanisms, these did not primarily drive the decisions. Accordingly, the Court held the SIP disapprovals properly fell within the jurisdiction of the relevant regional Circuit Courts.

Broader Implications

Read together, the cases shed important light on how the CAA’s venue selection clause operates. First, the Supreme Court concluded that each small refinery exemption denial and each SIP disapproval are separate, individual actions, that each constitute a “locally or regionally applicable action,” suggesting that EPA actions will be considered “nationally applicable” only in narrow circumstances.

Second, because the outcome of the two cases diverged based on how the Court applied the exception for locally or regionally applicable actions to be reviewed in the D.C. Circuit, the cases are especially instructive for the application of this exception.

In Calumet, the Court found that each local exemption denial was based on a uniform national determination affecting all refineries similarly. Contrastingly, in Oklahoma, the Court determined that each SIP disapproval was grounded in individualized, fact-intensive, state-specific analyses unique to each state’s plan.

The two decisions also reinforce that the venue for CAA challenges turns not on how EPA organizes or publishes its decisions but on the substantive nature of the underlying action and the scope of EPA’s rationale.

Conclusion

The Supreme Court’s twin rulings have significant implications for future CAA litigation and clarify the jurisdictional boundaries between regional Circuit Courts and the D.C. Circuit in CAA cases. Accordingly, any entity considering a challenge to an EPA action under the CAA, or considering intervening to support an EPA action, should have a clear understanding of these cases and the underlying venue statute.",https://jdsupra-static.s3.amazonaws.com/profile-images/og.15478_5804.jpg,N,,2025-06-23 15:48:34.172763

“It’s going to be hard to decide.” Among those likely in the running is the Nine Mile Point nuclear plant in Oswego.
There are 54 operating nuclear power plants in the country, according to the U.S. Department of Energy.
The last nuclear power plant built in the state was Unit 2 at Nine Mile Point in 1989.
The New York Power Authority previously operated two nuclear plants, including the Indian Point Power Plant, which shut down in 2021.","NEW YORK (AP) — New York’s governor on Monday proposed the construction of the state’s first new nuclear power plant in decades.

Gov. Kathy Hochul directed the state’s power authority to develop an advanced, “zero-emission” facility in upstate New York that she hopes will help create a clean, reliable and affordable electric grid for the state.

She said the state power authority will seek to develop “at least” one new nuclear energy facility with a combined capacity of no less than one gigawatt of electricity. That would increase the state’s total nuclear capacity to about 4.3 gigawatts.

The Democrat, speaking at the Niagara County Power Project in Lewiston, said the state needs to secure its “energy independence” if it wants to continue to attract large manufacturers that create good-paying jobs as it deactivates aging fossil fuel power plants.

Acknowledging concerns with nuclear power, she pledged the new facility or facilities would be safer than their predecessors.

“This is not your grandparents’ nuclear reactor,” Hochul said. “The new plan will be a model of 21st century nuclear design with safety at the forefront, automatic safety systems to enhance the containment and rigorous environmental standards.”

But Alfred Meyer, treasurer of Physicians for Social Responsibility’s New York chapter, was unconvinced.

He said nuclear power is a “very slow, expensive and dangerous” way to generate electricity that takes away resources from faster, cheaper renewable options while leaving behind highly toxic, radioactive waste.

“Nuclear power is not clean or green energy,” he said. “It is damaging to public health and the environment.”

Hochul said the state hasn’t decided on a potential location, but that upstate communities appear receptive, given the potential for creating 1,600 construction jobs and 1,200 permanent jobs once the facility is operational.

“Everybody is raising their hand right now,” Hochul said. “It’s going to be hard to decide.”

Among those likely in the running is the Nine Mile Point nuclear plant in Oswego. Hochul’s administration has been supportive of Maryland power company Constellation’s bid to build a new nuclear reactor at the two-reactor facility.

There are 54 operating nuclear power plants in the country, according to the U.S. Department of Energy.

But American utilities have been broadly reluctant to launch new nuclear plants due to high cost overruns and delays on recent high-profile projects.

Georgia Power Company completed the first two new nuclear reactors in the country in a generation last year. Units 3 and 4 at Plant Vogtle in Waynesboro, Georgia, cost nearly $35 billion and were powered up some seven years later than initially hoped.

Last month, the Tennessee Valley Authority, the nation’s largest public power company, applied to the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission to develop what it bills as a next-generation nuclear power plant at its Clinch River site in Oak Ridge.

New York currently has three active nuclear plants, all located upstate along Lake Ontario and owned by Constellation. The Nine Mile Point, Robert Emmett Ginna and James A. FitzPatrick plants provide about 3.3 gigawatts of power, or roughly 20% of the state’s electricity, according to Hochul’s office.

The last nuclear power plant built in the state was Unit 2 at Nine Mile Point in 1989. At its peak, nuclear power provided about 5.4 gigawatts, or roughly one-third of the state’s electrical supply, according to the advocacy group Nuclear New York.

The New York Power Authority previously operated two nuclear plants, including the Indian Point Power Plant, which shut down in 2021. That facility was located along the Hudson River some 25 miles (40 kilometers) north of New York City in Buchanan.

The other facility, once operated by the state, was the FitzPatrick plant, which the power authority sold in 2000 and is now run by Constellation.

The poll from electric vehicles and solar panels has weakened, as well as their enthusiasm for offshore wind farm expansion. While Democrats remain the strongest supporters of these initiatives, the poll reveals signs of growing cynicism within their ranks.

The poll results coincide with sweeping changes President Donald Trump’s Republican administration is making to regulations related to energy and climate change, including slashing the federal workforce in these departments. And although Democrats and independents have weakened their support for some green energy initiatives, there has not been an increase in support for Trump’s energy policies.

The poll found only about 4 in 10 U.S. adults — including only 1 in 10 Democrats and about 2 in 10 independents, along with three-quarters of Republicans — approve of the way Trump is handling climate change, which largely tracks with his overall approval rating.

Democrats and independents drive decline in support for renewable energy credits

About 6 in 10 Democrats, 58%, favor tax credits for purchasing an electric vehicle, down from about 7 in 10 in 2022. Among independents, support declined from 49% in 2022 to 28%. Only one-quarter of Republicans supported this policy in 2022, and that hasn’t changed measurably.

“As far as the pollution goes … the vehicles nowadays put out very little emissions to the air,” said JD Johnson, a 62-year-old Democrat from Meadowview, Virginia, who somewhat opposes tax credits to purchase an electric vehicle. That’s partly because he sees the electric vehicle manufacturing process as energy intensive and believes gasoline-powered vehicles have made improvements with the pollutants they emit.

The decline in favoring solar panel tax credits was across the board rather than being concentrated among Democrats.

“For solar panels, in all honesty, I don’t think they’re that efficient yet,” said Glenn Savage, 78, a left-leaning independent from Rock Hill, South Carolina. “I’d rather see them pour money into research and try to get the solar panels more efficient before they start giving tax breaks to the public. I may be wrong on that, but that’s just my thought.”

Scientists say transitioning to renewable energies and ditching fossil fuels that release planet-warming emissions are essential to protect the planet. Billions of dollars in project grants for clean technologies awarded during President Joe Biden’s Democratic administration have been canceled by the Trump administration, and the offshore wind sector has been stunted by Trump’s executive order that paused approvals, permits and loans for wind energy projects.

Fewer than half of U.S. adults, 44%, now say that offshore wind farms should be expanded in the U.S., down from 59% in 2022. About half favor expanding solar panel farms, while about two-thirds were in support in 2022.

When people are concerned about the economy and their personal finances, environmental issues are sometimes prioritized less, said Talbot Andrews, an assistant professor in the department of government at Cornell University who was not involved in the poll.

“I think it makes people anxious to think about increased taxes or increased spending on environmental issues when the cost of eggs are going through the roof,” Andrews said.

Low support for Trump’s efforts to expand offshore drilling and coal mining

Trump has championed the expansion of offshore oil drilling, as well as domestic coal production.

Despite a decline in support for expanded renewable energies, the new poll shows that only about one-third of U.S. adults think offshore drilling for oil and natural gas should be expanded in the U.S., and only about one-quarter say this about coal mining.

In both cases, Republicans are much more likely than Democrats to support expanding these energy sources.

Trump has sought to open up national monuments for oil drilling, but more U.S. adults oppose than support auctioning off more public space for oil drilling. Only about one-quarter of U.S. adults favor this, while 4 in 10 are opposed. Republicans are much more likely than independents or Democrats to be in support.

Bipartisan support for consumer

rebates and home appliance ratings

The Energy Star program that certifies appliances, such as dishwashers and refrigerators, as energy efficient recently appeared in headlines when the EPA made plans to scrap the program. The blue and white logo is well recognized, and experts say the program has long had bipartisan support until recently.

The poll found three-quarters of Democrats support providing consumer rebates for efficient home appliances, compared with 6 in 10 Republicans.

Patrick Buck, 54, from Chicago, describes himself as a liberal Republican and is a fan of the consumer rebates for energy-efficient appliances. “It seems to work in terms of transforming what people have in their houses, because a lot of people have a lot of old appliances and just can’t afford new ones,” he said.

Safe air, water, meat and produce

The poll found only about 2 in 10 U.S. adults are “extremely” or “very” confident in the federal government’s ability to ensure the safety of their drinking water, the air they breathe and the meat, poultry, fruits and vegetables they buy in grocery stores.

About 4 in 10 U.S. adults are “somewhat” confident in the federal government’s ability to ensure the safety of each of these, and about 4 in 10 are “not very” or “not at all” confident.

The Trump administration has announced plans to roll back rules and policies related to limiting pollution and greenhouse gas emissions, such as rules that limit pollution from power plants and blocking California’s efforts to phase out cars that run on gas. The federal government has also cut staff at the Food and Drug Administration, the federal agency tasked with protecting public health and ensuring food supply safety.

Regarding tax credits for solar panels, support among Democrats and independents remained relatively unchanged. Roughly 72% of Democrats and half of independents still favored those tax credits, down from 79% and 59%, respectively.

Support among Republicans similarly fell, with an 8-point drop from 50% to 42%.

The poll results are notable, considering Democratic lawmakers pushed for increased investment in and development of renewable energy over fossil fuels during the Biden administration. The Trump administration has been rolling back related tax credits.

Enthusiasm for the expansion of offshore wind and solar panel farms is also trending downward. About 68% of Democrats, a 15-point decrease, and 46% of independents, an 18-point drop, back solar farms. Similarly, 57% of Democrats and 39% of independents support offshore wind farms this year. In 2022, 74% of Democrats and 58% of independents were in favor of offshore wind.

Republicans have been more consistent in their opposition to offshore wind and solar energy, AP-NORC said.

The decline in support of renewable energy sources among Democrats and independents comes after the Trump administration has begun prioritizing offshore drilling for natural oil and gas in the place of offshore wind.

President Donald Trump previously signed executive orders to expand offshore drilling and to block the approval of new offshore wind projects.

For months, Trump has maintained that windmills kill birds and whales and harm the environment. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. echoed Trump’s stance, arguing that offshore windmills need to be banned because they harm wildlife and waste money.

“Many of these [whales] are critically endangered species,” Kennedy said in a Sunday interview. “We are going to exterminate these whales. When you put a windmill up, the cod disappear, the groundfish disappear. The fishermen are going out of business.”

TRUMP RAGES AGAINST GREEN SUBSIDIES IN ‘BIG, BEAUTIFUL BILL’

“The energy that they produce is three times the cost of an onshore wind plant,” he added. “They make no economic sense.”

Kennedy noted he speaks with Trump about his opposition to offshore wind energy “all the time.”",https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/solar_wind.webp,N,,2025-06-23 15:46:28.189349

“Cutting climate science might save pennies on paper, but in the end, it costs hundreds of billions of dollars, and lives, when we’re rebuilding after disasters like this,” he said.
According to a Federal Research and Development Funding Report for fiscal year 2025, the Biden administration allocated over $10.7 billion to clean energy research and development, and another $4.5 billion in climate research.
Conte Anadromous Fish Research Laboratory in Turners Falls for 33 years, said the lab’s work with anadromous fish populations, or fish that spawn in fresh water but live in saltwater, supports multi-million dollar fisheries.
“This public research money touches everybody’s lives every day,” UMass PhD candidate Thomas Nuhfer said.","AMHERST — Local scientists warn that the proposed federal cuts to the United States Geological Survey’s Ecosystem Mission Area — a federal research program that studies the country’s natural resources — outlined in the White House’s fiscal year 2026 budget could not only degrade national ecosystems, but the industries and people that rely on them.

“What science does is reduce uncertainty,” said John Organ, former director of the Fish and Wildlife Cooperative Units funded by EMA. “A management action is a product of a decision. If there’s greater uncertainty in the decision-making process, then the less durable and less effective those decisions may be, and the consequences could be greater.”

The Ecosystem Missions Area, formerly the Biological Resources Division, was created in 2010 by combining several other research programs within the U.S. Department of the Interior. It includes seven different scientific research initiatives, including the Cooperative Fish and Wildlife Units and the Climate Adaptation Science Center system, among others. The conservation needs that arose in the early 20th century spurred the formation of these programs, which were reorganized under USGS in the 21st century.

Organ, a Northampton resident who spent his entire scientific career with the Department of the Interior, describes the federal and state governments as the trustees of the public’s fish and wildlife resources, with public management agencies, like the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service, serving as the trust managers. Like any business, the trustees need knowledge to make intelligent, progressive decisions about public resources, but terminating almost all of the EMA’s funding will cut off that pipeline of information.

“The entire federal conservation enterprise is being thwarted and it will be generational damage,” he said.

The data produced by public scientists informs industry quotas for fishing and hunting, policy decisions on conservation and national parks and even natural disaster preparation.

“In the 1980s, hurricane recovery costs were about $40 billion per decade, and by the 2010s it surged to over $460 billion per decade,” biologist and UMass graduate James Garner said. “With climate change, recent storms have caused over $100-plus billion in damages, and science-based adaptation and early warning programs help save billions in avoided disaster costs.”

Warmer air and sea temperatures increase evaporation and raise sea levels, causing larger and more frequent tropical storms and hurricanes. Climate change also decreases the regularity of rainfall, creating common periods of drought that spark more wildfires.

Without the public institutions tracking this severe weather and the conditions that cause them, Garner warns the United States will be less prepared to mitigate the damages.

“Cutting climate science might save pennies on paper, but in the end, it costs hundreds of billions of dollars, and lives, when we’re rebuilding after disasters like this,” he said.

Research and development is a major revenue source for the United States. A report published by the National Center for Science and Engineering Statistics found that research and development accounted for 3.43% of the United State’s GDP in 2022, up from 2.67% in 2012.

This increased percentage is largely due to higher business investment, but private businesses and nonprofits often sign federal contracts to fund or supplement research and development. A study from American University found that slashing public investment in research and development by 25% would reduce GDP “by an amount comparable to the decline in GDP during Great Recession” in 2008.

“The current budget for the cooperative research units nationwide is $28 million and we bring in three times that in external funding,” Organ said. “We support well over 1,000 jobs that are non-federal, in addition to 600 graduate students, masters, PhDs, and post-doctorate students.”

Without reallocation from Congress, many of the science research grants canceled by the federal government sit idle. According to a Federal Research and Development Funding Report for fiscal year 2025, the Biden administration allocated over $10.7 billion to clean energy research and development, and another $4.5 billion in climate research.

Stephen McCormick, a scientist emeritus who worked at the S.O. Conte Anadromous Fish Research Laboratory in Turners Falls for 33 years, said the lab’s work with anadromous fish populations, or fish that spawn in fresh water but live in saltwater, supports multi-million dollar fisheries. Dams built along rivers, such as the Connecticut River, block anadromous fish from traveling from their freshwater birthplaces to their saltwater homes. One of the few ways fish travel around dams is through a fish ladder, but these ladders, which cost upward of $30 million, are between 5% and 40% effective, and many species critical for fisheries cannot even travel through them.

The Conte Lab is the only facility on the East Coast that researches fish ladder improvements. Chopping down the Ecosystems Mission Area could result in the lab’s closure and prevent further infrastructure research.

“All of the anadromous species that we have on the East Coast are either threatened or endangered, almost all of them in parts of the range,” McCormick said. “Without the information that we provide, things like innovative fish passage, and habitats that we need to protect, will be lost, and eventually these species will wink out.”

McCormick adds that animals and plants do not pay mind to state or country boundaries. Many birds migrate to different countries between seasons. Fish swim in U.S. water bodies shared with Canada and Mexico. Only federal entities can negotiate with other countries or control interstate affairs to properly manage these species and the industries that rely on them.

“This public research money touches everybody’s lives every day,” UMass PhD candidate Thomas Nuhfer said. “Most people just aren’t thinking about it because it’s running and working smoothly in the background. But it’s pretty hard to imagine where our country’s population and landscapes would be without all the benefits that this federal funding and support and infrastructure has provided in the past.”",https://www.recorder.com//attachments/31/50783631.jpg,N,,2025-06-23 17:09:19.720011

Recent data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration show New York households on average pay the sixth-highest price for electricity in the continental United States.

For March 2025 the average price of electricity in New York was estimated at $0.25 per kWh for residential users and $0.095 per kWh for industrial users. These rates are significantly above the U.S. averages of $0.17 per kWh and $0.08 per kWh, respectively. Households in New York pay 48 percent more, and industry pays 15 percent more than the national average.

Similarly, despite the big talk about green energy, most of New York’s electricity still comes from natural gas and nuclear power. In fact, according to the New York Independent System Operator (NYISO), which manages the state’s electrical grid, since 2019 the proportion of fossil fuels used in electricity production has increased, while nuclear energy has gone down.

Instead of the green energy revolution, New York is slowly losing the capability to make energy. In a brand new report, NYISO warns Since 2019 New York has retired more electricity generation capacity than it added. Federal data show similar trends: from 2019 to 2024, while New York’s electricity generation dropped, the U.S. added 4 percent, Texas ramped up production by 16 percent, and Florida by 8.

Meanwhile, New York is relying on increasingly outdated infrastructure to produce electricity. A quarter of New York’s electricity generation capacity has been in operation for more than 50 years, and some – for more than 70 years. With the state officially committed to achieving a zero-emission electrical grid by 2040, no one is rushing to invest in modernizing fossil fuel power plants or building new ones.

This reduction in energy production capacity alone should cause concern. But to add fuel to fire, between the laws passed and new ones being considered, Albany is pushing New Yorkers to be more dependent on electricity for everything – heating, cooking and transportation – all of which will require much more electricity. Approximately double what New York produces now, according to the NYISO.

On top of that, Albany is trying to encourage the development of energy-intensive industries such as the Micron chip plant in the Syracuse area. There is also talk about attracting artificial intelligence centers to New York, which, again, requires a lot of electricity which New York likely cannot supply on its current trajectory.

Here we have the makings of a self-inflicted one-two punch. On one hand, Albany is discouraging companies from making the investments necessary to produce abundant and affordable electricity. On the other hand, Albany is driving up demand by making plans for household heating to rely on electricity rather than on their current sources of fuel, such as natural gas.

Albany politicians act as if New York was awash with cheap and abundant electricity. In reality it is full of empty political promises and virtue signaling, but these do not produce electricity.

The situation is not sustainable. A breaking point is approaching – slowed down only by the fact that Albany keeps missing its climate deadlines and doing a poor job of attracting new businesses.

If New York politicians are serious about reindustrializing New York, revitalizing Upstate, and outcompeting other states for energy intensive manufacturing – they need to remove all hurdles to cheap, plentiful energy. That will help with affordability, too.",https://www.empirecenter.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/energy-pic1.jpg,N,,2025-06-23 14:19:27.647522

The New York Power Authority has been instructed to find a site in upstate New York and decide on a design for the reactor project, according to an interview in the Wall Street Journal with Governor Kathy Hochul.
Meanwhile, the Empire State currently hosts about 219 datacenters, according to Datacenters.com.

""It is yet another recognition of nuclear energy's critical role in achieving the nation's leading clean energy goals.","New York State is set to build America's first major new nuclear plant in more than 15 years, amid growing energy demands, particularly from power-hungry AI datacenters.

The New York Power Authority has been instructed to find a site in upstate New York and decide on a design for the reactor project, according to an interview in the Wall Street Journal with Governor Kathy Hochul.

It says that the project aims to add at least 1 gigawatt of generating capacity to that of New York's existing nuclear plants, and that this should be roughly enough to power about a million American homes.

No date was specified for when this nuclear plant is expected to come online, nor was any figure mentioned for how much the project is likely to cost. We asked the Governor's office, and will update if we get answers.

Meanwhile, the Empire State currently hosts about 219 datacenters, according to Datacenters.com. This number is likely to increase as companies rush to add additional facilities to serve the rising requirements driven by all the AI hype.

Compounding this growing demand, New York's capacity was dealt a significant blow when the Indian Point Energy Center, located roughly 36 miles north of New York City, shut down its last two nuclear reactors in 2021, cutting off about 25 percent of the city's electricity supply.

A report last year by management consultancy Bain & Company warned that US energy providers needed to adapt quickly to the rising demand, as power consumption was forecast to outstrip supply within the next few years.

That urgency is sharpened by timing constraints: although several new nuclear projects have been announced to meet the projected needs of AI and emerging technologies like electric vehicles, most of these are unlikely to start producing power until the next decade, while more energy is needed now.

President Trump signed an executive order back in May aiming to quadruple US nuclear generating capacity from 100GW to 400GW by 2050, coming a few weeks after a group of large-scale energy users, including Amazon, Meta, and Google, called for efforts to triple global nuclear capacity by the same date. Amazon recently finalized a deal to buy nuclear energy for its facilities in Pennsylvania as it plans to build a host of new ""high-tech cloud computing and artificial intelligence innovation campuses"" in the state, according to an announcement earlier this month.

Due to be implemented from 2026, trade association UK Steel calculates it will cut electricity costs by £6.50 per MWh.
In a statement, the Chemical Industries Association (CIA) said: “The reappearence of an industrial strategy after a six-year absence is a welcome and long-overdue step”.
Gareth Stace, director general of UK Steel, said: “This is an important milestone, but we are not out of the trenches yet.
While the strategy on industrial electricity costs has largely been welcomed by industry groups, some remain sceptical.","INDUSTRY leaders have cautiously welcomed the UK government’s new industrial strategy, which outlines a long-term vision to boost manufacturing, reduce energy costs, and close critical skills gaps.

Published today by the Department for Business and Trade, the strategy sets out a decade-long plan focused on eight key sectors – from clean energy and advanced manufacturing to digital technology and life sciences – with an emphasis on cutting industrial electricity prices and strengthening the engineering workforce.

The government has also identified chemicals, steel, critical minerals, composites and materials as “foundational industries” that are “vital” to each of the eight priority sectors, along with ports, construction and electricity networks.

A central element of the strategy is the government’s plan to cut industrial electricity costs – among the highest in the developed world – by £35–£40 (US$47–US$53) per MWh from 2027, representing a reduction of around 25%. The government aims to achieve the savings by widening exemptions to emissions levies for energy-intensive businesses such as chemicals and steel manufacturing. The government estimates that 7,000 businesses, employing a total of 300,000 people, could be eligible.

The energy cost reduction plan, known as the “British Industrial Competitiveness Scheme”, will run until 2030, at which point it will be reviewed.

In addition, the government has increased the compensation that energy-intensive businesses can claim for electricity grid charges from 60% to 90%, bringing the UK in line with equivalent schemes in France and Germany. Due to be implemented from 2026, trade association UK Steel calculates it will cut electricity costs by £6.50 per MWh.

Eligibility criteria for grid charge compensation and exemptions to emissions levies are yet to be finalised and will be determined through a consultation which is now open.

Industry leaders have long warned about the impact of high electricity costs, particularly in the chemicals and steel sectors. UK Steel calculated that electricity costs in 2024/25 for British steel producers were on average £66 per MWh, compared to £43 in France and £50 in Germany.

In a statement, the Chemical Industries Association (CIA) said: “The reappearence of an industrial strategy after a six-year absence is a welcome and long-overdue step”. The CIA added it was “pleased to see that chemicals have been recognised in the industrial strategy”.

Gareth Stace, director general of UK Steel, said: “This is an important milestone, but we are not out of the trenches yet. The industrial strategy must be the first of many changes if we are to fully unlock the potential of the UK steel industry to back the growth and stability of our economy.”

The emissions levies covered by the extended exemptions are the renewables obligation, feed-in tariffs and the capacity market, which are all paid by electricity generators to incentivise providers to source more energy from renewable sources. The increased compensation for grid charges, meanwhile, will be funded through “reforms to the energy system”, which includes aligning UK and EU carbon markets.

The government has also said it will cut the administrative costs of regulation by 25% while reducing the number of regulators. As part of the regulatory overhaul, the government plans to increase the threshold above which state subsidies must be referred to the Competition and Markets Authority from £10m to £25m.

While the strategy on industrial electricity costs has largely been welcomed by industry groups, some remain sceptical. Caroline Bragg, CEO of heat network lobby group Association for Decentralised Energy, described the details on funding as “vague” and criticised the strategy for prioritising a “small number of select businesses”.

Bragg added: “Ministers need to wake up. We cannot build a secure, affordable, low-carbon energy system while actively discouraging all the businesses that use it from investing in their future.”

Skills gap

Another key focus of the industrial strategy is addressing skills shortages in engineering and manufacturing, allocating £100m over three years to support engineering skills in England.

The government says this will create an additional 65,000 places for 16- to 19-year-olds on vocational courses by 2028/29. The government will also oversee the rollout of shorter courses and foundation apprenticeships from April 2026.

In addition, the government has announced a temporary exemption to the threshold for skilled worker visas for occupations “crucial to the delivery of the industrial strategy”, including engineering technicians.

Sir John Lazar, president of the Royal Academy of Engineering, said: “Today’s announcement is a big step in the right direction.

“Engineering underpins each of the growth sectors identified by the government, and it is essential that we equip our nation with the skilled workforce needed to meet the future challenges of sustainability and technological advancement.”

The government also plans to launch a “clean energy workforce strategy”, which will include details on developing a carbon capture, utilisation and storage (CCUS) and hydrogen curriculum.

Ann Watson, CEO of engineering skills charity Enginuity, described the industrial strategy as a “sea-change moment”. She added they were pleased to see the strategy included “support to specifically meet SME training needs” and that it addressed “the need for more agile courses, shorter in length and more closely tied to industry needs”.

Future strategies

The industrial strategy namechecked chemicals, steel, cement and critical minerals as “foundational” manufacturing industries to each of the eight target sectors, although details on how the government plans to support them will come in separate strategies published later this year.

The steel strategy was originally scheduled for publication in the second quarter of the year following the launch of a public consultation in February, the delay likely caused by the near crisis at British Steel in April and ongoing turmoil in global steel markets created by US tariffs. However, the industrial strategy does emphasise the need to better utilise “domestic supply of scrap metal”, hinting that electric arc furnaces will be a focus, while “identifying opportunities to stimulate domestic demand”, which the government has previously said will be created by increased defence spending.

The government also plans a separate critical minerals strategy later this year. As for support for chemicals, cement and glass, the industrial strategy says the government will provide “continued relief on electricity prices”.

Other strategies and consultations the government plans for later this year are for non-pipeline CO2 transport in CCUS networks, hydrogen blending in existing gas networks, onshore wind, and development and deployment of nuclear fusion.

David Whitehouse, CEO of the Offshore Energy UK lobby group, said the “government is right to recognise the role of secure and affordable energy at the heart of industrial strategy – it must also be clear in its backing for the sectors that currently deliver it, including oil and gas alongside renewables.

“To build lasting success, it’s critical this new strategy and its supporting funds are inclusive of firms across the whole spectrum of offshore energy.”",https://www.thechemicalengineer.com/media/4562/policy.jpg?width=960,N,,2025-06-23 15:46:52.292948

What they're saying: ""If Republicans have their way, we will never get our public lands back once they are privatized,"" Sen. Alex Padilla (D-Calif.) said in a statement to Axios, vowing to protect the lands.
What's next: The Senate has until July 4 to vote on the budget reconciliation bill, which includes the land-sale provision.","More than 16 million acres of federal public land in California could be eligible for sale if Congress passes the Trump administration's budget bill, according to a new analysis by a conservation nonprofit.

Why it matters: Privatizing that land could limit access to popular hiking, camping and picnic areas in the Cleveland National Forest in San Diego County, The Wilderness Society found.

Zoom in: That includes local hot spots like Three Sisters Falls, Cedar Creek Falls, Garnet Peak Trail and the Laguna Mountain Area.

Across California, land around Yosemite National Park, Mount Shasta, Big Sur and Lake Tahoe, as well as along the Pacific Crest Trail, is at risk of being sold.

The big picture: The Republican-led proposal would require the U.S. Forest Service and the Bureau of Land Management, which oversee vast swaths of public land, to put up to 3.3 million acres on the market for housing development.

The bill's focus is on parcels outside of protected lands (like national parks, monuments and wilderness areas, which are exempt) but near roads and other development deemed suitable by local and state lawmakers.

The Wilderness Society estimates more than 250 million acres across 11 Western states could be eligible for sale.

Follow the money: The majority of proceeds from the potential sale of those public lands — estimated to bring in between $5 billion and $10 billion over the next decade — would go to the U.S. Treasury, while 5% would go to local governments.

A range of complex non-technological barriers stand in the way of this needed deployment, including public opposition to technologies and siting, inefficient planning and permitting processes, and precarious supply chains. Unfortunately, discussions and problem-solving around the issue of clean energy deployment are too often narrowed to blaming the National Environmental Policy Act, or NEPA.

One of the United States’ bedrock environmental protections, NEPA was passed in response to concern around damage to the environment from industrial expansion, resource exploitation, and other factors. NEPA does not mandate particular outcomes or standards; instead, it requires federal agencies to consider the reasonably foreseeable environmental impacts of their activities, integrate those considerations into agency decision making, and enhance public transparency in the decision-making process, which results in an environmental review document.

The proper scope of NEPA reviews, how long they should take, and, fundamentally, whether they improperly slow down needed infrastructure projects has been a subject of dispute among courts, Congress, and experts. The Supreme Court has now entered the battle by firing a broadside directly at the heart of the statute. The Seven County Infrastructure Coalition v. Eagle County ruling, along with legislative proposals and executive actions aimed at weakening NEPA, will not improve project outcomes and fail to address the fundamental challenges of infrastructure deployment.

Policy concerns carry the day at the Supreme Court

On May 29, 2025, the Supreme Court issued its decision in the case Seven County Infrastructure Coalition v. Eagle County. This case, about whether the Surface Transportation Board adequately analyzed the environmental effects of an 88-mile railroad line in Utah, will influence how federal agencies and courts consider NEPA reviews. Although all eight justices hearing the case agreed that the lower court’s decision should be reversed, the five-justice majority opinion written by Justice Brett Kavanaugh went much further than needed to resolve the question before the Court and reflects a blinkered view of the nuances of environmental review and permitting.

One striking aspect of the majority’s opinion is how much it is based on policy concerns rather than an interpretation of NEPA’s text or legal principles and precedent (while selectively quoting from the text of NEPA). The opinion expresses concern about the time and cost of environmental reviews, how many projects never complete—or even start—reviews, and what that might portend for infrastructure-related jobs. Absent from this analysis, however, is any mention of the actual stated policy goals of NEPA, including to “preserve important historic, cultural, and natural aspects of our national heritage.”

One surprising, and thinly supported, policy-motivated reason the Court provides for trimming environmental reviews is that NEPA supposedly harms “clean-energy projects.” However, CATF’s research has found that, by and large, NEPA is not what stands in the way of clean energy projects and associated infrastructure, such as transmission lines and offshore wind projects. Legal experts who have looked at the full environmental review and permitting picture have reached similar conclusions. The picture the Court paints simply does not track with reality.

An uncertain path forward – potential implications of the Court’s ruling

One reason the Seven County decision will produce uncertainty is that the majority opinion speaks separately to courts and to agencies. To courts, the majority directs them to afford substantial deference to agencies when reviewing the sufficiency of environmental reviews. And for agencies, the opinion provides principles that they may choose to, but are not required to, apply in order to limit the scope of reviews. However, how these two directives will change the practice of environmental reviews and legal challenges is far from clear.

Start with the deference owed by courts to agencies on their environmental reviews. On the one hand, this part of the ruling is old news. Courts are already not to “flyspeck” environmental reviews, although the majority opinion opts for the more modern term “micromanage.” On the other hand, this show of deference to agencies is completely inconsistent with the Court’s approach last summer when it blocked an EPA rule limiting emissions of nitrogen oxides based on what Justice Barrett, in dissent, called an “underdeveloped theory.” In any event, the Court reiterates that agency decisions must still be “reasonable and reasonably explained.” And courts will continue to evaluate the sufficiency of NEPA reviews to answer that question.

Moving to the message to agencies, the Court held that agencies need not—but may—evaluate a project’s upstream or downstream effects under NEPA, and that projects permitted by third parties and outside of an agency’s authority may fall outside of that scope. This message ultimately boils down to the Court directing agencies to draw a “manageable line” around a project’s effects.

What drawing a “manageable line” for an environmental review’s scope will look like in practice, though, remains murky. Unfortunately, the Court’s discussion of the facts around the railroad does not help this line-drawing exercise because, the majority asserts, this case was “not close.” The majority opines on a number of stylized examples that would fall inside or outside of this scope, but those all lack detail and, because they were not actually before the court, are not binding.

Actual NEPA reviews are far more complicated than the Court’s simplified examples, and figuring out how and where to draw this “manageable line” will take time. Ironically, the D.C. Circuit’s series of cases underlying the overturned decision were designed to create a manageable line for when a review must consider upstream or downstream effects based on reasonable foreseeability. How much of that test remains after Seven County remains to be seen, and the difference between a manageable line and an arbitrarily narrow scope of review has been left to other courts to work out.

There are two clear implications of this ruling. First, even though it does not establish a categorical rule, limiting the obligation of agencies to consider upstream and downstream effects under NEPA benefits one type of project above all others: fossil fuel infrastructure. Clean energy projects simply do not have the issues of downstream greenhouse gas emissions or upstream oil and gas drilling that were at issue in this case. Second, agencies retain the ability to undertake thorough environmental reviews that still consider these impacts. Continuing to analyze these effects will serve NEPA’s purposes of informed decision-making and public transparency and involvement. And a thorough review of impacts remains essential for judicial review of the reasonableness of agency decisions, which will continue to depend on the sufficiency of environmental reviews.

NEPA is under attack in all three branches of government

The Seven County decision takes place amidst a wave of assaults on NEPA and other key protections across government, with wide-ranging adverse implications for people and the environment.

On the first day of his new term, President Trump revoked a 1977 executive order that directed the White House Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) to issue NEPA regulations to guide federal agencies’ implementation of NEPA. In its place, the new order directed CEQ to rescind its NEPA regulations. In March, CEQ complied by eliminating all of its NEPA regulations while simultaneously recommending—but not requiring—that agencies follow CEQ’s 2020 regulations (now reconceived as guidance) while developing their own, agency-specific regulations or guidance.

These actions fail to live up to the level of good practice on both the process and substance fronts. On process, they will increase uncertainty for agencies and applicants, limit opportunities for community input and Tribal consultation on new agency-specific procedures, and will not achieve their stated outcome of expediting federal permitting processes. And on substance, this effort also eliminated CEQ’s 2024 NEPA regulations update, which included new requirements for agencies to consider applicable environmental justice implications, conduct early public engagement, and assess greenhouse gas emissions, among other provisions. Removing these considerations from environmental reviews will result in weaker analyses that diminish environmental, historic, and cultural protections.

Perhaps even more disturbingly, the Trump administration has begun to circumvent normal agency procedures under an unsubstantiated “energy emergency” for a wide range of energy resources (though notably not wind and solar). The Department of the Interior complied and announced it would review qualifying projects in 28 days or less. These timelines are severely inadequate to thoroughly analyze environmental and socioeconomic effects as required by NEPA and render functionally impossible any opportunity for the public to provide public comments or for Tribes to be consulted.

This assault on NEPA is not limited to the executive branch. In Congress, the reconciliation bill that recently passed the House of Representatives, and draft text from the Senate, contain several concerning provisions that would undermine NEPA. The Senate version would repeal funds to the Environmental Protection Agency, Department of Transportation, and CEQ that are specifically dedicated to environmental reviews, undermining agency capacity and data tools and transparency. Both the House and Senate versions include deeply concerning “pay to play” permitting proposals, under which a project sponsor could pay a fee equal to 125% of the anticipated costs of expected agency activity to prepare an environmental review. In exchange, the agency would complete their environmental impact statement in one year and an environmental assessment in six months. Both the House and Senate drafts contain a provision that environmental reviews prepared under this provision would not be subject to judicial review; however, the Senate parliamentarian has advised that this elimination of judicial review violates the Senate’s Byrd Rule, and would therefore have to be passed by a 60-vote threshold.

As a result, environmental reviews prepared under the pay-to-play fee structure would still be reviewable by the courts, preventing the worst-case scenario of a backdoor repeal of NEPA with no recourse for accountability. Nonetheless, requiring an expedited timeline while gutting staff at federal agencies is likely to decrease the quality of environmental reviews and, subsequently, increase legal challenges (and therefore project timelines).

Taken together, these attacks on NEPA represent a grave threat to the environmental protection, community engagement, and Tribal sovereignty principles that our bedrock environmental laws are intended to further—while bringing us no closer to clean energy deployment at scale.

How can environmental reviews be improved?

Rather than taking a wrecking ball to NEPA, CATF research has identified opportunities to improve environmental reviews that will accelerate clean energy deployment and protect communities and the environment, all while providing project certainty to developers. These recommendations can continue to be implemented by agencies, states, developers, and Congress.

First, improving federal agency coordination, cooperation, and capacity is key to effective and timely environmental review. Under Seven County, substantial deference is granted to agencies in determining the scope and breadth of reviews; agencies should, in turn, continue to robustly analyze environmental impacts, engage with communities, and consult with Tribes. Rather than eliminating funding to improve environmental reviews and cutting staff in key offices, Congress should invest in permitting personnel and data tools, which would continue the improvement in review timelines that has taken place since 2020. Here, CEQ’s new Permitting Innovation Center is a welcome step in the right direction that should be complemented by additional agency staff capacity.

Second, aligning permitting requirements among jurisdictions with permitting authorities would help to eliminate duplicative or overlapping reviews and simplify permitting processes. While revoking CEQ’s regulations represents a setback at the federal level, states should work to harmonize their permitting processes to create regulatory efficiency and allow for more concurrent processes. Such work can also be advanced at the federal level by the Permitting Council, which should work with agencies to advance projects and coordinate with local authorities and continue to facilitate interagency coordination and transparency through the Permitting Dashboard.

Finally, agencies and developers alike should prioritize early, sustained, and meaningful community engagement to inform project development and ensure community benefits; agencies should also conduct meaningful government-to-government Tribal consultation. Such engagement and consultation can substantively improve projects by providing local perspectives on a range of environmental, social, and economic implications, as well as mitigate local opposition, delays, and litigation risk. Thoughtful agency procedural changes, including careful expansions of categorical exclusions and use of programmatic reviews, can also help to reduce timelines while increasing project certainty.

Unfortunately, the attacks on NEPA by the Trump administration, members of Congress, and now five justices on the Supreme Court will lead to more uncertainty and fail to improve project outcomes. Instead, CATF will continue to research and advocate for sensible, evidence-based reforms that accelerate clean energy infrastructure deployment, promote community benefits, preserve historic and cultural resources, and, as Congress instructed in 1969, “fulfill the responsibilities of each generation as trustee of the environment for succeeding generations.”

The New York Power Authority has been instructed to find a site in upstate New York and decide on a design for the reactor project, according to an interview in the Wall Street Journal with Governor Kathy Hochul.

""It is yet another recognition of nuclear energy's critical role in achieving the nation's leading clean energy goals.","New York State is set to build America's first major new nuclear plant in more than 15 years, amid growing energy demands, particularly from power-hungry AI datacenters.

The New York Power Authority has been instructed to find a site in upstate New York and decide on a design for the reactor project, according to an interview in the Wall Street Journal with Governor Kathy Hochul.

It says that the project aims to add at least 1 gigawatt of generating capacity to that of New York's existing nuclear plants, and that this should be roughly enough to power about a million American homes.

No date was specified for when this nuclear plant is expected to come online, nor was any figure mentioned for how much the project is likely to cost. We asked the Governor's office, and will update if we get answers.

Meanwhile, the Empire State currently hosts about 219 datacenters, according to Datacenters.com. This number is likely to increase as companies rush to add additional facilities to serve the rising requirements driven by all the AI hype.

Compounding this growing demand, New York's capacity was dealt a significant blow when the Indian Point Energy Center, located roughly 36 miles north of New York City, shut down its last two nuclear reactors in 2021, cutting off about 25 percent of the city's electricity supply.

A report last year by management consultancy Bain & Company warned that US energy providers needed to adapt quickly to the rising demand, as power consumption was forecast to outstrip supply within the next few years.

That urgency is sharpened by timing constraints: although several new nuclear projects have been announced to meet the projected needs of AI and emerging technologies like electric vehicles, most of these are unlikely to start producing power until the next decade, while more energy is needed now.

President Trump signed an executive order back in May aiming to quadruple US nuclear generating capacity from 100GW to 400GW by 2050, coming a few weeks after a group of large-scale energy users, including Amazon, Meta, and Google, called for efforts to triple global nuclear capacity by the same date. Amazon recently finalized a deal to buy nuclear energy for its facilities in Pennsylvania as it plans to build a host of new ""high-tech cloud computing and artificial intelligence innovation campuses"" in the state, according to an announcement earlier this month.

For example, in the Shenendehowa Central School District, only two of 20 vehicles taxpayers agreed to purchase were electric.
One outlier was Guilderland Central School District, where voters approved a proposition to acquire five electric school buses.
That program provides grants for 60% of the purchase price for a new electric school bus, plus bonuses for priority districts and for scrapping the fossil-fuel vehicle being replaced.
They may instead be a dead-end sign for the state’s zero-emission school bus deadlines.","Cost may be a factor. Bethlehem Central School District stated that plainly in its budget newsletter: “The district is not planning to add to its fleet of electric school buses in 2025-26 due to uncertainty surrounding the federal grant funding that has made EV buses affordable.”

It’s easy to blame President Donald Trump and the Republican Congress, but consider this: As part of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, Congress allocated $5 billion over five years for school bus replacements, money that’s being distributed to all 50 states. Yet in New York alone, the added cost of replacing buses with electric rather than fuel-powered models is estimated to total $9 billion by 2035, based on today’s prices.

In other words: New York is demanding so much, so quickly that school districts may not be able to keep up.

Every school bus on the road must be zero-emission as of July 1, 2035. That may sound far off, but school buses are replaced on an eight- to 12-year cycle, depending on the model and the mileage dictated by a district’s bus routes. It follows that propositions to buy more than a small handful of electric school buses should have been before voters this spring.

But most local school districts that asked taxpayers to purchase student transportation vehicles stuck with fossil-fueled models (including the Olean City School District. A few hedged, proposing to buy mostly diesel- or gas-powered vehicles and one or two electric-powered vehicles.

For example, in the Shenendehowa Central School District, only two of 20 vehicles taxpayers agreed to purchase were electric. And Shenendehowa made clear to its voters that it had state grants of $220,500 per unit for the Type-C EV buses. But that incentive amount does not cover the entire premium of over $263,000 for those buses — assuming they are available — under this year’s prices.

One outlier was Guilderland Central School District, where voters approved a proposition to acquire five electric school buses.

Bethlehem may be blaming the feds today for its change of heart, but for its initial electric school bus purchases it relied on limited funds from the Volkswagen legal settlement over its diesel engine pollution violations, and later on the New York School Bus Incentive Program.

That program provides grants for 60% of the purchase price for a new electric school bus, plus bonuses for priority districts and for scrapping the fossil-fuel vehicle being replaced. Yet New York allocated only $500 million to the program from the environmental bond voters approved in 2022.

And then there are the costs of adding charging infrastructure and upgrading electrical service.

New York’s utilities charge a fee to electricity customers to fund the state’s Electric Vehicle Make-Ready Program, which helps eligible nonresidential customers defray the costs of charging infrastructure.

Yet the available incentives did not stop voters in Scotia-Glenville Central School District from rejecting a $2.6 million proposal for an electric vehicle infrastructure project that the Board of Education presented as tax neutral.

Their reluctance may be rewarded: Absent a fiscal miracle in New York, this spring’s school bus votes are not likely just a bump in the road. They may instead be a dead-end sign for the state’s zero-emission school bus deadlines.",https://www.oleantimesherald.com/oleantimesherald/news/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2025/06/Macdonald.jpg,N,,2025-06-23 14:20:26.014058

Businesses canceled $1.4 billion worth of clean energy factories and projects last month, according to the latest numbers from E2 and the Clean Economy Tracker. That pushes total canceled investments to $15.5 billion this year, wiping out nearly 12,000 potential jobs.

The reason for the slowdown: the Senate is preparing to vote on the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act,” a Republican-led tax and spending bill to raise taxes on clean energy and roll back key tax credits. A similar measure passed in the Republican-majority House. Those credits, passed in 2022, had helped drive a surge in US EV and renewable manufacturing.

As a result, renewable and EV momentum are reversing. GM scrapped plans to build EVs at its Tonawanda plant in New York. Instead, the automaker will use that money to expand production of gas-powered V8s.

Republican-led districts are ironically losing out the most. In 2025 alone, more than $9 billion in clean energy investments and nearly 10,000 jobs have been canceled, delayed, or closed in GOP districts.

May’s cancellations weren’t just on paper. About 600 workers lost their jobs thanks to the five site closures announced last month.

“The consequences of continued policy uncertainty and the expectation of higher taxes on clean energy businesses are becoming painfully clear,” said E2’s communications director, Michael Timberlake. “These cancellations are just the first shoe to drop.”

Still, there were some bright spots. Companies announced $450 million in new clean energy investments last month, including:

Rivian’s $120 million supplier park in Illinois, expected to bring 100 new jobs

A $140 million electricity transformer factory from Prolec-GE Waukesh in North Carolina, which could create 330 jobs

If completed, the eight new projects announced in May would create at least 1,310 permanent jobs if they come to fruition.

So far in 2025, Republican districts have claimed the majority of clean energy activity: 62% of project announcements, 71% of jobs, and 82% of investment.

But if Congress repeals clean energy tax credits, everyone will feel the impact. The Clean Energy Buyers Association estimates households could pay $110 more a year for electricity, and businesses could see energy costs spike by 10% or more.

Since the Inflation Reduction Act passed in August 2022, 397 major clean energy projects have been announced across 42 states and Puerto Rico. These projects total nearly $132 billion in planned investment and 123,000 permanent jobs. But 53 have already been canceled, closed, or scaled back, taking $18.2 billion and 21,000 jobs with them.

The governor described the plan as “a critical energy initiative” that would complement the construction of renewable energy and the state agency would “safely and rapidly deploy clean, reliable nuclear power for the benefit of all New Yorkers”.

Hochul said that the nuclear plant would add zero-emission baseload power and help to advance New York’s goal to achieve a clean energy economy.

Renewable energy groups slammed the decision.

“NYPA has the power and mandate to build 15GW of renewables and should not let Trump promises lead New Yorkers away from it. After appointing a Republican to lead NYPA while remaining silent on its mandate to build wind and solar, Hochul’s decision to step in based on promises from Donald Trump shows just how unserious she is about New Yorker’s energy bills and climate future,” said a statement from the Public Power NY Coalition.

It added: “NYPA should be laser focused on rapidly scaling up their buildout of affordable solar and wind which is the only way to meet the state’s science-based climate goals and lower energy bills.”

The development will be a test of Donald Trump’s executive orders to accelerate nuclear-power development in the US. But a site and reactor design has not been decided. One gigawatt of production is enough energy to power around a million homes.

Nuclear plants currently produce about 19% of the country’s electricity, down 4% from its 2012 peak. It is expected to decline further, though big technology companies have recently licensed power from ageing reactors to meet the demands of AI computing centers.

Only five new commercial reactors have come online in the US since 1991 and electric utilities companies have forecast the US will need the equivalent of 34 new, full-size nuclear power plants over the next five years to meet power requirements.

Last year, Microsoft signed a 20-year purchase agreement with the private generator Constellation that will see one of the reactors at Three Mile Island in Pennslyvannia restarted. Amazon signed a deal to purchase nuclear-generated power from the Susquehanna nuclear power plant, also in Pennsylvania, to supply data centers.

Separately, Google announced a deal to purchase nuclear energy from small modular reactors (SMRs) and Amazonsaid it had signed agreements to invest in four SMRs in Washington state to power data centers in Oregon. Oracle is designing an AI data center to be powered by three SMRs.

Given its geography, water supply and proximity of IBM and university tech research centers, Hochul is supporting plans to develop upstate New York into a tech center akin to Silicon Valley.

But the state retired the Indian Point nuclear plant 40 miles from Manhattan in 2021 in part due to environmental concerns and because the hijacker-pilots of the 9/11 attacks on the World Trade center used the twin reactor’s domes along the Hudson river as sign posts. As one consequence of the closure, New York had to burn more fossil fuels, raising greenhouse-gas emissions even as local and state legislatures demanded a reaction.

“There was no Plan B,” Hochul told the Wall Street Journal on Monday.

Trump’s order to speed up regulatory approval of new nuclear power production could jump-start an industry that’s been in decline for three decades because of safety concerns, cost overruns and an unfavorable political environment.

But environmental groups have warned that the push for nuclear could also reduce regulatory controls related to health and safety. Earlier this month, the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) unveiled a plan that would repeal a landmark climate rule that aims to mostly eliminate greenhouse gases from power plants by the 2030s.

Hochul told the outlet that she suggested to Trump that Elon Musk’s “department of government efficiency” should turn its attention to streamlining regulatory approval at the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.

“Why does it take a decade?” she said. “That’s why no one is doing it; the barriers are too high.”",https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c30addd41ba37cde4081dd900524185f8f310e35/312_0_3294_2634/master/3294.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=8c9ac5560c953a6d6eec75ae2cd35510,N,,2025-06-23 15:47:59.463555

The Honorable John R. Thune

The Honorable Michael D. Crapo

Chairman, Committee on Finance

United States Senate

Washington, D.C. 20510

Re: Maximizing Economic Growth Through Permanent Tax Policy in H.R. 1

Dear Leader Thune and Chairman Crapo:

On behalf of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce (“Chamber”), I am pleased to submit the enclosed comments and recommendations regarding select business and international tax proposals in H.R. 1, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (“OBBBA”), as amended by the legislative text released by the Senate Committee on Finance on June 16. Among other things, the OBBBA is the intended vehicle for Congress to avert the largest automatic tax increase in American history at the end of this year, when many of the historic reforms in the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“TCJA”) are set to expire. We commend House and Senate tax writers for their efforts to deliver critical, long-term tax certainty and stability.

Through our Growing America’s Future campaign, the Chamber calls on lawmakers to prioritize policies that would help achieve the goal of at least 3% annual economic growth. Ensuring that America has a stable, pro-growth, and globally competitive tax code is central to this effort. The House-passed legislation made substantial progress toward this goal, on which the Senate amendment would double down. Below we highlight the crucial ways in which the Senate amendment would maximize the bill’s effects on economic growth, consistent with President Trump’s America First agenda. We also raise several acute, broad-based concerns among the U.S. business community with certain elements of the legislation and offer constructive recommendations for the Senate to address them.

I. Preserving our Competitive Business Tax Rates

Low marginal tax rates promote capital formation and minimize the effects of other distortions in the tax code, contributing to economic growth. It is laudable, therefore, that both the House bill and Senate amendment would preserve our competitive tax rates on businesses of all types and sizes by maintaining the 21% corporate income tax rate and permanently extending the deduction for qualified business income (“QBI”) in section 199A of the Internal Revenue Code (“Code”), which is otherwise slated to expire at the end of this year.[1]

[1] The QBI deduction in section 199A effectively operates as rate reduction for pass-through businesses like sole proprietorships, partnerships, and S corporations, which make up over 95% of all U.S. businesses.

The Chamber commends House and Senate tax writers for ensuring the long-term competitiveness of our business tax rates in this legislation, giving businesses of all types and sizes the certainty they need to hire, invest, and grow.

II. Restoring a Pro-Growth Business Tax Base

a. Prioritizing Permanence for Maximum Economic Growth

Equally important as the competitiveness of a country’s business tax rates is the composition of its tax base to which those rates are applied. Accordingly, the Chamber has long championed reforms to restore the competitiveness of our business tax base by permanently reinstating three critical pro-growth tax policies: (1) the deduction for research and experimentation expenditures; (2) 100% bonus depreciation (full capital expensing for certain business assets); and (3) a globally competitive (EBITDA-based) limitation on the deduction for business interest expense.

The House-passed legislation would generally reinstate all three business tax policies for five years, retroactive to January 2025 through the end of 2029. The bill also included a potentially potent new business tax incentive, elective 100% expensing for “qualified production property,” which would temporarily allow firms to immediately write off the cost of new business investment in factories and other manufacturing facilities. Collectively, these four pro-growth reforms are intended to strengthen the industrial capacity of the United States, promote capital investment and modernization, and facilitate job creation.

The Senate amendment would double down on the first three proposals to permanently restore a pro-growth business tax base in the United States.[2]

[2]But see discussion infra note 17.

In so doing, the Senate amendment would eliminate the current tax bias against capital investment and provide businesses the certainty necessary to invest, create jobs, and boost the economy while also simplifying the tax system. And in pairing the permanence of these business tax incentives with the preservation of our lower business tax rates, the bill would help to reassert America’s tax competitiveness in the global tug-of-war for cross-border investment.

As history shows, certainty and stability are critical to driving major, long-term capital investment. And the economic data bear this out: according to the Tax Foundation, making all four of the bill’s business tax incentives permanent would increase long-run gross domestic product (“GDP”) by 1.0% and more than double the long-run economic effect of the House-passed tax package as a whole.[3]

[3] Erica York & Garrett Watson, Tax Found., House Tax Package Could Double Economic Growth Impact by Prioritizing Permanence for TCJA Business Provisions (May 15, 2025), https://taxfoundation.org/blog/house-tax-plan-economic-growth-impact-business-tax-permanent/.

We therefore urge Senate tax writers to stay the course and empower American businesses, workers, and their families to realize the full potential of permanent, pro-growth tax reform.

b. Avoiding Distortionary Treatment of State and Local Business Taxes

While the OBBBA would make important strides toward restoring a pro-growth business tax base in the United States, there are at least two critical areas in which the legislation proposes changes that would undermine this important aim. The first concerns the competing House and Senate proposals to deny pass-through businesses the ability to deduct entity-level state and local business taxes (“B-SALT” deduction).[4]

[4] Both House and Senate proposals would amend section 702(a) of the Code to require partnerships and S corporations to treat specified and other entity-level taxes as separately stated items. Both proposals would also deny the partnership or S corporation a deduction for any such taxes or payments in computing its taxable income, thereby abrogating IRS Notice 2020-75. See H.R. Rep. No. 119-106, pt. 2, at 1718.

As set forth below, both proposals are highly problematic and the enactment of either would constitute an unprecedented distortion of the federal income tax base for American businesses.

Regardless of the legal form of organization (e.g., sole proprietorship, partnership, S or C corporation), the same general principles apply in the computation of taxable business income—realized gross receipts reduced by allocable costs and expenses.[5]

[5]See, e.g., Staff of J. Comm. on Tax’n, 118th Cong., Estimates of Federal Tax Expenditures for Fiscal Years 2024–2028, JCX-48-24, at 7 (Dec. 11, 2024).

Net income rather than gross revenue has long been viewed as the appropriate tax base, both to accurately measure economic well-being and to avoid distortions of economic activity.[6]

[6] Louis Kaplow, Fiscal Federalism and the Deductibility of State and Local Taxes Under the Federal Income Tax, 82 Va. L. Rev. 413, 461 (1996).

The federal income tax system reflects this view and generally allows an uncapped above-the-line deduction for state and local business taxes,[7]

[7] Under existing law, C corporations may claim an uncapped above-the-line deduction for state and local property taxes, income taxes, and other taxes incurred in carrying on a trade or business or an activity to produce income (collectively, “business taxes”). Similarly, an uncapped above-the-line deduction is available for state and local business taxes imposed on pass-through entities, like partnerships and S corporations, that are reflected in a partner’s or S corporation shareholder’s distributive share or pro rata share of income or loss on a Schedule K-1 (or similar form). See H.R. Rep. 115-466, at 260 n.172 (2017); Staff of J. Comm. on Tax’n, 115th Cong., General Explanation of Public Law 115-97, JCS-1-18, at 67 n.289 (2018).

which are but one of the many ordinary and necessary expenses incurred in carrying on a trade or business.[8]

[8]See generally I.R.C. §§ 62, 164. The deductibility of these taxes has been a feature of the federal income tax throughout its history. See, e.g., Daniel J. Hemel, Easy on the SALT: A Qualified Defense of the Deduction for State and Local Taxes, Public Law and Legal Theory Working Paper No. 652 at 4 (2017), https://chicagounbound.uchicago.edu/public_law_and_legal_theory/836/.

The allowance of these deductions is axiomatic. State and local business taxes are not optional. Rather, they are the quintessential ordinary and necessary business expense. Fully deducting these expenses is necessary to compute net income, and thus necessary to correctly tax businesses.[9]

[9] This principle is reflected in annual reports of the Office of Management and Budget and the Joint Committee on Taxation, which generally classify the itemized deduction for state and local income, property, and sales taxes as a “tax expenditure” while classifying the above-the-line deduction for state and local business taxes as part of the “normal” income tax structure. See, e.g., Off. of Mgmt. & Budget, Exec. Off. of the President, Analytical Perspectives, Budget of the U.S. Government, Fiscal Year 2021, at 148 (2020); Staff of J. Comm. on Tax’n, 116th Cong., Estimates of Federal Tax Expenditures for Fiscal Years 2020–2024, JCX-23-20, at 2–3 (2020).

Enacting either the House bill or Senate amendment’s proposal to preclude unincorporated businesses from deducting their state and local business taxes, therefore, would be tantamount to taxing them on phantom profits.

The B-SALT deduction is an indispensable element of the federal income tax system and should not be curtailed for any business—regardless of its legal form of organization or sectoral affiliation. We respectfully urge Senate tax writers to fully restore it by omitting the proposed limitation in section 70601(b) of the Senate amendment from the final legislation.

c. Ensuring Stability in Energy Tax Policy to Unleash Growth

Like any major piece of tax reform legislation, the OBBBA includes a wide range of proposals animated by different—and sometimes competing—policy aims. Perhaps nowhere is this phenomenon more apparent, however, than with the bill’s proposed changes to priority pro-growth energy tax policies on which American businesses, workers, and investors rely.

i. Catalysts for Economic Growth and Investment

In the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (“IRA”), Congress enacted a range of new and expanded energy tax incentives that are catalyzing tremendous amounts of private-sector investment in new manufacturing and energy infrastructure—investments that are poised to keep the U.S. economy competitive for decades. Since the IRA’s enactment in August 2022, businesses have invested roughly $321 billion in new manufacturing, clean electricity, and industrial facilities and created thousands of new American jobs.[10]

[10] Rhodium Group and MIT Center for Energy and Environmental Policy Research, Clean Investment Monitor: Q1 2025 Update (May 13, 2025), https://www.cleaninvestmentmonitor.org/reports/q1-2025-update.

Critically, these benefits extend to interests across the energy sector, positively impacting oil, gas, hydrogen, nuclear energy, renewables, and battery storage systems, as well as power generation, transportation, manufacturing, and beyond. And a recent independent study commissioned by the American Clean Power Association, with Chamber support, lays bare the law’s potential impact. It found that IRA energy tax incentives are expected to grow the U.S. economy by $1.9 trillion while creating 13.7 million jobs over ten years—boosting the U.S. labor market while helping to meet America’s rapidly growing energy demand.[11]

[11] American Clean Power Association, Inflation Reduction Act Delivers Massive Economic Boost and 4X Return on Investment (Dec. 19, 2024), https://cleanpower.org/news/economy-wide-benefits-of-energy-tax-credits/.

As the data suggest, countless projects enabled by IRA energy tax incentives are currently in advanced stages of development, with construction underway, contracts signed, and large amounts of job-creating capital committed. The Chamber therefore appreciates Senate tax writers’ efforts to refine and improve upon several proposals in the House bill that would have generated uncertainty, weighed on these investments, and risked halting billions of dollars in deployment of expanded energy resources.[12]

[12] For example, a Japanese company halted construction on $1.6 billion factory in South Carolina to help make batteries for electric BMWs, citing “policy and market uncertainty.” Jeffrey Collins, Billion-Dollar Battery Plant Pauses Construction Amid Electric Vehicle and Tariff Uncertainty, AP News (June 6, 2025), https://apnews.com/article/battery-plant-south-carolina-tariffs-evs-f5965cac01dfa1bba9102f6ce4c71299.

The U.S. hydrogen sector is illustrative of these incentives’ return on investment. A new analysis by S&P Global estimates that every $1 invested in Department of Energy hydrogen hub projects using the section 45V clean hydrogen production credit will generate $7 in GDP over the next four years, while supporting an annual average of 22,000 jobs.[13]

[13] EFI Foundation, The Return on Investment of U.S. Clean Hydrogen (June 5, 2025), https://efifoundation.org/foundation-reports/analysis/the-return-on-investment-of-us-clean-hydrogen-policy/.

The U.S. hydrogen industry is truly poised for liftoff, with another recent analysis estimating that new hydrogen production projects could support 60,000 jobs per year—a critical advantage in the race to develop the global hydrogen supply chain, given China’s rapidly growing market share in the sector.[14]

[14] CresForum, The Economic Impact of Blue Hydrogen (May 5, 2025), https://cresforum.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/American-Blue-Hydrogen-04.16.25-CRES-Format_VF.pdf.

The ability of such projects to deliver these investments and jobs is contingent, however, on the continued availability of section 45V. This is why the Chamber joined a coalition of over 250 other organizations—including 20 state and local chambers of commerce—in calling on Congress to maintain the clean hydrogen production credit until at least 2029 and allow this nascent sector a chance to firmly take root on U.S. soil.[15]

[15] Coalition Letter to Hon. John Thune and Hon. Mike Crapo, Preserve the Section 45V Credit for Production of Clean Hydrogen (June 5, 2025), https://fchea.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Senate-45V-Sign-On-Letter-Final-6-5-2025.pdf.

ii. Effects on the Power Grid

Another critical benefit of the IRA’s energy tax incentives has been their moderating influence on energy generation costs and affordability. Growth in U.S. electricity demand is now accelerating exponentially after a period of relative stagnancy, driven by the rapid growth of energy-intensive data centers and the reshoring of industrial and manufacturing activity. As a result, the U.S. power sector is working to expand generation of all energy resources as quickly as possible. But recent proposals to repeal or impose prohibitive restrictions or phaseouts on a range of IRA energy tax incentives would significantly impede this effort. Furthermore, the limited supply of new electrons could increase electricity costs.

For example, the House bill proposed to accelerate the statutory sunset of the Code’s technology-neutral clean electricity credits, with nearly all qualifying facilities required to commence construction within 60 days of the bill’s enactment and be placed in service by December 31, 2028. We commend Senate tax writers for extending this deadline to limit the negative impacts to deploying new power-generation resources in a timely manner. The revised phaseouts in the Senate amendment would partially restore these energy tax incentives, which will safeguard economic growth, defend jobs in urban and rural communities, and ensure America’s energy independence and technological leadership for decades to come. We also commend Senate tax writers for preserving the transferability of energy tax credits—a valuable tool that allows companies of all sizes to raise private-sector funds for large, capital-intensive energy projects, such as those in the power sector that would otherwise be at risk of not moving forward.

iii. Foreign Entity of Concern Restrictions

The Chamber supports policymakers’ desire to reshore industrial and manufacturing activity in the United States, including the extended supply chains necessary to improve energy and economic security. Taxpayers need more time, however, to onshore and develop those capabilities domestically. Businesses need a longer runway for the industry to advance projects that are or will soon be in development.

The Chamber applauds Senate tax writers for moderating the proposed rules on what constitutes a “foreign-influenced entity” and providing certain exceptions for publicly traded companies. We particularly appreciate the Senate amendment’s inclusion of an improved definition of “material assistance from a prohibited foreign entity,” which would clarify that a foreign entity provides “material assistance” only where a project’s non-foreign content falls below a specified cost ratio threshold.

While the Senate amendment’s foreign entity of concern (“FEOC”) rules appear to be clearer and more workable than those in the House bill, we urge Senate tax writers to continue working with impacted industries to further improve the language. For example, concerns remain that the Senate amendment would impose significant compliance burdens on companies that may constrict the number of qualifying projects across the credits. Moreover, the quick phase-in of the FEOC rules proposed in both the House bill and Senate amendment would leave little practical opportunity for companies to comprehensively examine their supply chains for the purpose of determining credit eligibility. Further refinements to the Senate amendment’s FEOC provisions could increase their administrability and provide needed certainty to critical sectors.

iv. Treatment of Intangible Drilling and Development Costs

Finally, the Chamber commends Senate tax writers for proposing a long-sought fix to the punitive treatment of intangible drilling and development costs under the corporate alternative minimum tax (“AMT”). Intangible drilling and development costs are expenses incurred during the drilling of oil and natural gas wells that have no salvage value, like workers’ wages, supplies, and maintenance. By preventing the full deduction of such costs, however, the corporate AMT imposes a tax penalty on investment in American oil and gas drilling. The Senate amendment would end this counterproductive treatment by adding an appropriate adjustment for intangible drilling and development costs to section 56A of the Code.

III. Maintaining a Globally Competitive U.S. International Tax System

a. Permanently Extending Competitive Rates and Other Reforms

Both the House bill and Senate amendment seek to maintain the overall competitiveness of our post-TCJA international tax system by permanently extending lower effective U.S. tax rates on two principal categories of international business income: foreign-derived intangible income (“FDII”) and global intangible low-taxed income (“GILTI”). Absent congressional intervention, both regimes will become more restrictive—and therefore less competitive—at the end of this year, with effective U.S. tax rates on FDII and GILTI set to increase from 13.125% to 16.406% (a 25% increase).

The Chamber commends House and Senate tax writers for taking action to prevent these scheduled tax hikes from taking effect at the end of the year, which would otherwise reduce the incentives for multinational companies to maintain their headquarters and intellectual property in the United States while decreasing America’s attractiveness as a destination for inbound business investment.[16]

[16] For taxable years beginning after December 31, 2025, the Senate amendment would permanently adjust the effective U.S. tax rates on FDII and GILTI to 14% (after considering the adjusted GILTI foreign tax credit “haircut”).

Like many of the bill’s other proposed changes, permanently extending lower effective U.S. tax rates on international business income would provide U.S. multinational employers the predictability necessary to support continued investment and innovation.[17]

[17] The limitation on the deduction for business interest expense in section 163(j) of the Code is principally based on a percentage of the taxpayer’s “adjusted taxable income,” which both the House bill and Senate amendment would generally redefine as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA). See discussion supra Section II.a. For unexplained reasons, however, the Senate amendment includes a separate proposal that would exclude subpart F and GILTI inclusions and the associated section 78 gross-up amounts, as well as amounts determined under section 956, from a taxpayer’s adjusted taxable income for purposes of section 163(j). This counterintuitive proposal would undermine the Senate’s push to permanently reinstate the pro-growth, EBITDA-based limitation by increasing the tax burden on U.S. multinationals that use debt financing to create jobs and invest in America. We suspect this was not Senate tax writers’ intent.

But unlike those other changes, merely preventing these scheduled tax increases alone would ultimately fail to ensure the global competitiveness of our U.S. international tax system in the years ahead.

The Senate amendment seeks to meet this challenge head on by tackling certain structural issues inherent in the TCJA’s design that are known to result in excessive or double taxation for U.S. multinationals, placing them at a disadvantage relative to foreign-based competitors. Perhaps the most obvious example is the current 20% GILTI foreign tax credit “haircut,” which is a form of structural double taxation without analog or precedent anywhere in the world. Another is the requirement to allocate U.S. expenses to foreign-source income in the GILTI foreign tax credit limitation basket, which can trigger residual U.S. taxation in cases where a U.S. multinational’s foreign effective tax rate on GILTI exceeds the level below which Congress intended the levy to apply.[18]

[18] If the GILTI regime operated as a true “minimum tax” on foreign income, as Congress intended, there would be no residual U.S. tax liability in cases where a U.S. multinational’s foreign effective tax rate exceeds 13.125%. See H.R. Rep. No. 115-466, at 626–27 (2017) (Conf. Rep.) (explaining Congress’s intent that “[a]t foreign tax rates greater than or equal to 13.125 percent, there is no residual U.S. tax owed on GILTI, so that the combined foreign and U.S. tax rate on GILTI equals the foreign tax rate”).

Among other proposed reforms, the Senate amendment would halve the 20% GILTI foreign tax credit “haircut” and eliminate the requirement to allocate indirect U.S. expenses (e.g., interest, research, stewardship) to foreign-source income in the GILTI foreign tax credit limitation basket. Beyond the TCJA, the Senate amendment would, inter alia, permanently extend the expiring look-through rule for related controlled foreign corporations in section 954(c)(6) of the Code—a critical feature of our international tax system on which U.S. multinationals rely but whose longevity is perpetually uncertain.

Viewed holistically, the Senate amendment’s collection of international tax reform proposals resembles a thoughtful and logically cohesive attempt to permanently enhance the global competitiveness of the U.S. international tax system, ensure the TCJA’s reforms operate as intended, and reduce the incidence of international double taxation. We commend Chairman Crapo for his leadership in prioritizing these additional systemic reforms.

b. Protecting Our Corporate Tax Base

Both the House bill and Senate amendment would add a new section 899 to the Code to deter foreign countries from inappropriately taxing the income of U.S. corporations and their subsidiaries through the imposition of extraterritorial or discriminatory taxes (collectively, “unfair foreign taxes”). In general, the provision would protect against unfair foreign taxes of the extraterritorial variety, like the OECD-inspired undertaxed profit rule (“UTPR”),[19]

[19] As the Chamber and others have warned, the UTPR is unprecedented in its design and contemplates the extraterritorial taxation by foreign countries of U.S. multinational companies’ U.S.-source income without any genuine nexus to the taxing jurisdiction, in breach of customary international law. See, e.g., Watson M. McLeish, Chamber of Com. of the U.S., U.S. Chamber Supports Legal Challenge to EU Undertaxed Profit Rule (Sept. 30, 2024), https://www.uschamber.com/taxes/u-s-chamber-supports-legal-challenge-to-eu-undertaxed-profit-rule.

by increasing rates of tax on a foreign country’s residents (and their subsidiaries) and other entities connected to such country. The provision would also protect against unfair foreign taxes more broadly, including both extraterritorial and discriminatory taxes (e.g., digital services taxes (“DSTs”)),[20]

[20] DSTs are unilateral attempts by foreign countries to impose taxes on the revenue generated by the digital activity of (largely) U.S. multinational companies operating within their jurisdictions. DSTs are often drafted to appear nondiscriminatory on their face but are designed to disproportionately impact American companies and therefore are discriminatory in effect.

by increasing the base erosion and anti-abuse tax (“BEAT”) rate and generally revoking certain favorable BEAT provisions for U.S. corporations that are owned by tax residents of offending foreign countries.

The Chamber applauds House and Senate tax writers for their efforts to reassert Congress’s prerogative in global tax matters impacting U.S. companies and advance responsive measures to defend the U.S. corporate tax base against unfair foreign taxes. We also appreciate that the intent of proposed section 899 is not to penalize inbound companies or investors but rather to provide the Trump administration with a more effective tool in the negotiator’s toolkit for persuading foreign countries to revoke their discriminatory or extraterritorial taxes. To that end, we invite Senate tax writers to consider making the following changes to the proposal with the goal of optimizing the administration’s negotiating position in related bilateral and multilateral talks.

i. Clarify Definition of Unfair Foreign Tax

As explained in the report of the House Committee on Ways and Means, proposed section 899 would create an incentive for foreign jurisdictions to remove the unfair treatment of U.S. multinational companies because the provision would cease to apply if the country revokes its discriminatory or extraterritorial tax or if the country provides that the discriminatory or extraterritorial tax does not apply to U.S. persons and their subsidiaries.[21]

Short of repealing its unfair foreign tax, therefore, a foreign country should be able to avoid triggering the application of proposed section 899 by taking measures to ensure its tax applies to the income of neither U.S. corporations nor their subsidiaries. This income-focused approach makes sense and aligns with the Treasury Department’s current negotiating position at the OECD/G20 Inclusive Framework on Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS).[22]

[22]See, e.g., Lauren Vella, Senate GOP’s ‘Revenge Tax’ Still Packs Punch Despite Changes, Bloomberg Law (June 18, 2025) (reporting on a recent statement by the top U.S. delegate to the OECD/G20 Inclusive Framework on BEPS, Rebecca Burch, that proposed section 899 is the “ultimate backstop” to cement the U.S. position to persuade other countries to change their unfair tax policies), https://news.bloombergtax.com/daily-tax-report/senate-gops-revenge-tax-still-packs-punch-despite-changes.

In defining an “unfair foreign tax” for purposes of proposed section 899, both the House bill and Senate amendment provide an exception for any tax that does not apply to any U.S. person or any controlled foreign corporation owned more than 50% by vote or value by U.S. persons. On its face, however, this definition appears to be inconsistent with the legislative intent and U.S. negotiating position described above, which seek to deter foreign countries from inappropriately taxing the income of U.S. corporations and their subsidiaries.[23]

[23] H.R. Rep. No. 119-106, pt. 2, at 1760. Indeed, the committee report goes on to explain that proposed section 899 is intended to treat a foreign country’s UTPR as an unfair foreign tax only if it applies to the income of U.S. corporations and their subsidiaries. See id.

This distinction is important to the proper application of proposed section 899, especially with respect to UTPRs. If enacted in its current form, proposed section 899’s definition of an “unfair foreign tax” could be both overinclusive and underinclusive as applied to foreign countries imposing UTPRs, which are designed to impose top-up taxes on local entities rather than directly on low-taxed entities in other jurisdictions.[24]

[24]See Danielle Rolfes et al., Take 2: Evaluating the Revised Retaliatory Measures in the House Bill, 118 Tax Notes Int’l 1525, 1529 (June 9, 2025); see also Lee A. Sheppard, House Budget Reconciliation Bill’s Revenge Tax, 118 Tax Notes Int’s 1467, 1471 (June 9, 2025) (calling this an “obvious drafting error”).

Accordingly, we offer the following alternative recommendations for Senate tax writers to resolve this ambiguity.

Recommendation: Revise proposed section 899(d)(1)(B) by substituting the phrase “with respect to the income of” for the word “to,” as follows: “(B) Exceptions.—Such term shall not include any tax which does not apply towith respect to the income of—”

Alternative Recommendation: Revise the definition of “offending foreign country” in proposed section 899(c)(1), as follows: “(1) Offending foreign country—.The term ‘offending foreign country’ means any foreign country which has one or more unfair foreign taxes and has not suspended the application of such tax(es) against United States persons and with respect to income subject to tax by the United States.”

ii. Optimize U.S. Negotiating Tools to Facilitate Productive Talks

Consistent with its purpose as a negotiating tool to strengthen U.S. leverage over foreign countries with respect to their extraterritorial or discriminatory taxes, early evidence suggests that proposed section 899 may already be having its intended effect.[25]

[25] Reporting has linked New Zealand’s recent removal of a DST from its legislative agenda as, in part, a response to proposed section 899. See, e.g., Stephanie Soong, New Zealand Considered Trump Before Scrapping Digital Tax Bill, 118 Tax Notes Int’l 1251 (May 26, 2025).

But exercising this new leverage will take time, especially where foreign countries have both UTPRs and DSTs in effect. Treasury Department officials face complex multilateral negotiations at the OECD/G20 Inclusive Framework on BEPS, after which other countries will need time to enact legislation to reflect any negotiated outcome and repeal any DSTs—potentially exposing taxpayers to higher taxes in the interim. We therefore commend Senate tax writers for providing a more reasonable period of time after enactment for unfair foreign taxes to be removed.[26]

[26] In effect, for applicable persons with a calendar year end, the increased rates of tax and BEAT modifications would not apply until a taxable year beginning after December 31, 2026—one year later than under the House bill.

To further enhance the value of proposed section 899 as a negotiating tool, we encourage Senate tax writers to add language to the bill allowing the Secretary a one-time option to suspend the provision’s application for up to 12 months in cases where negotiations with an offending foreign country are progressing in good faith but have yet to reach a successful conclusion.

Recommendation: Amend proposed section 899(i) by adding a new paragraph (2) (and making current paragraph (2) new paragraph (3)), authorizing the Secretary of the Treasury to issue regulations or other guidance which “(2) suspend the application of this section for up to 12 months with respect to an offending foreign country on his determination that such offending foreign country is engaged in good faith negotiations with the United States to address its unfair foreign tax(es).”

c. Reassessing the Proposed Excise Tax on Remittance Transfers

In a surprise to many observers, both the House bill and Senate amendment include proposals to impose a new 3.5% excise tax on remittance transfers from individual consumers to foreign recipients. And while the Senate proposal represents a vast improvement over the version approved by the House, either would impose burdensome implementation, compliance, and reporting costs on remittance transfer providers (“RTPs”) like money services businesses, thrift institutions, and certain other financial institutions—notwithstanding that none of these businesses is an intended target of the tax.[27]

[27]See H.R. Rep. No. 119-106, pt. 2, at 1779 (explaining the belief of House tax writers that “the ability of non-citizens and non-nationals of the United States to send payments to individuals in other countries through the system of remittance transfers may encourage illegal immigration and lead to the overreliance of some jurisdictions on the receipt of such remittance flows”).

Furthermore, under either chamber’s proposal, RTPs failing to collect and remit the new excise tax would be liable for its payment. So, although the proposed excise tax is not technically a business tax, the costs of its implementation and application would nonetheless be borne by many U.S. companies. The Chamber has material concerns about the unfunded mandates and collection risk facing American businesses under the proposal, and we respectfully urge Senate tax writers to withdraw it from the final legislation.

* * *

Maintaining a globally competitive business tax system that fuels economic growth and opportunity for all Americans is the Chamber’s top priority this year. The Senate amendment to the House-passed bill represents another crucial step forward in the 2025 tax reform debate. As the legislative process continues to advance, we renew our call for policymakers to prioritize the enactment of permanent, pro-growth tax reforms that will drive American innovation, boost investment, and benefit workers, businesses, and communities nationwide. Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,

Watson M. McLeish

For taxable years beginning after December 31, 2025, the Senate amendment would permanently adjust the effective U.S. tax rates on FDII and GILTI to 14% (after considering the adjusted GILTI foreign tax credit “haircut”).

[17]

Click to go to inline citation.

The limitation on the deduction for business interest expense in section 163(j) of the Code is principally based on a percentage of the taxpayer’s “adjusted taxable income,” which both the House bill and Senate amendment would generally redefine as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA). See discussion supra Section II.a. For unexplained reasons, however, the Senate amendment includes a separate proposal that would exclude subpart F and GILTI inclusions and the associated section 78 gross-up amounts, as well as amounts determined under section 956, from a taxpayer’s adjusted taxable income for purposes of section 163(j). This counterintuitive proposal would undermine the Senate’s push to permanently reinstate the pro-growth, EBITDA-based limitation by increasing the tax burden on U.S. multinationals that use debt financing to create jobs and invest in America. We suspect this was not Senate tax writers’ intent.

If the GILTI regime operated as a true “minimum tax” on foreign income, as Congress intended, there would be no residual U.S. tax liability in cases where a U.S. multinational’s foreign effective tax rate exceeds 13.125%.

As the Chamber and others have warned, the UTPR is unprecedented in its design and contemplates the extraterritorial taxation by foreign countries of U.S. multinational companies’ U.S.-source income without any genuine nexus to the taxing jurisdiction, in breach of customary international law.

DSTs are unilateral attempts by foreign countries to impose taxes on the revenue generated by the digital activity of (largely) U.S. multinational companies operating within their jurisdictions. DSTs are often drafted to appear nondiscriminatory on their face but are designed to disproportionately impact American companies and therefore are discriminatory in effect.

President Donald Trump recently signed a series of executive orders that will have major implications for U.S. energy policy and America’s power grid. The provisions of the orders include reorganizing the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, accelerating the nuclear licensing process, and ramping up support for nuclear infrastructure. The stated goal of these policies is to facilitate and incentivise the construction of new nuclear power plants and to quadruple America’s nuclear energy capacity by 2050.

According to the White House, these initiatives are necessary to maintain American energy independence in the face of growing demand, partially driven by technological advances – particularly those related to artificial intelligence. But regardless of whether these policies are sufficient to realize the president’s goals, increased reliance on nuclear power will confer several ancillary benefits.

Currently, the energy sector is one of the heaviest polluters in the United States. Data from the Environmental Protection Agency shows that 25% of the more than 6.3 billion metric tons of greenhouse gas emissions in 2022 were generated by electricity production. Air pollution generated by the U.S. energy sector is largely attributable to the power grid’s reliance on fossil fuels, like natural gas and coal – two sources which, together, currently account for nearly 60% of all electricity production in the United States.

Unlike coal and natural gas, however, nuclear reactors do not release harmful emissions into the atmosphere. Nuclear power plants are also far more reliable than intermittent clean energy sources, like wind and solar. Nuclear power is also more efficient, as a solar plant requires 46 times the amount of land area to produce the same amount of energy as a nuclear facility, according to the International Atomic Energy Agency.

The recent measures taken by the Trump administration will present a break from the longer-term trend of stagnation in U.S. nuclear energy production. Over the course of the 21st century so far, nuclear energy production has increased nationwide by a marginal 1.7%. Notably, American nuclear energy production has also fallen by 1% in the last five years, and by 1.9% in the last decade.

Still, it is important to note that each state has its own unique energy mix, and despite the broader national trend, many states have meaningfully ramped up nuclear energy production in recent years.

Using data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration, Climate Crisis 247 identified the states that have ramped up nuclear energy production the most so far this century. States are ranked on the relative change in the total amount of nuclear power generated from 2001 to 2024. Only the 16 states where the change in nuclear power generation in the 21st century exceeds the 1.7% national increase were considered.

Among the states on this list, nuclear energy production has increased by anywhere from 2.3% to 46.5% between 2001 and 2024. The states on this list include New York, which is home to Nine Mile Point’s Unit 1, the oldest nuclear reactor still in operation, as well as Georgia, where the Alvin W. Vogtle plant houses the newest nuclear reactor to come online in the United States.

“Western governors have the unique ability to come together and get things done. The West faces a variety of issues from dealing with wildfires and natural disasters, to managing our incredible public lands, pursuing low-cost renewable energy options and more. During this meeting we are discussing some of the issues that matter most to Coloradans, including housing, education, agriculture and wildfire mitigation - issues we are delivering on for Coloradans. While we may not agree on every issue, we still manage to find a way to learn from each other to better support the people we serve,” said Governor Jared Polis.

In 2023, as chair of the Western Governors' Association, Governor Polis launched The Heat Beneath Our Feet initiative, focused on expanding geothermal energy research and exploration. This low-cost clean energy resource is largely untapped, despite the amount of it found across the West, providing a unique opportunity for the region to lead the nation and the world in developing this renewable energy source.

To kick off the summer meeting, Governor Polis will moderate a session focused on collaboration between the state and federal government to strengthen career pathways and prepare all students for good-paying jobs includingU.S. Department of Education Secretary Linda McMahon.

As Chair of the bipartisan National Governors Association, Governor Polis launched the Let’s Get Ready: Educating All Americans For Success initiative, which is focused on real solutions to ensure that students gain the skills needed to succeed in the classroom and beyond.

Governor Polis will then join a roundtable discussion on housing solutions and increasing the supply of housing people can afford. During this session, Governor Polis will highlight Colorado’s leadership in breaking down barriers to housing to increase housing supply and reduce costs. Over the last two years, Governor Polis has signed new laws to increase housing near transit, eliminate costly parking requirements and discriminatory occupancy limits, allow Coloradans to build accessory dwelling units on their property, break down barriers to more condos being built, increase the use of modular housing, and allow for more smart-stair buildings in Colorado.

Governor Polis will also participate in discussions about ways to bolster agricultural production in Colorado across the western states, increasing accessibility in the outdoors, land management opportunities and conservation efforts, wildfire mitigation, forestry workforce development, rural health care and more.

White House Cabinet members U.S. Department of Agriculture Secretary Rollins, Department of the Interior Secretary Doug Burgam, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Administrator, Lee Zeldin, and Secretary of Labor Lori Chavez-DeRemer will also be joining for discussions with the governors.

Hochul told The Wall Street Journal that she directed the state’s public electric utility to build at least 1 GW of new nuclear generation. NYPA will find a site in upstate New York and determine the reactor design, she told the publication. Candidate locations will be assessed for suitability based on public safety, strength of community support, compatibility with existing infrastructure, as well as skilled labor and land availability.

Like many other states, New York is grappling with rising electricity demand and the retirement of fossil-fueled power plants, prompting a search for clean and reliable energy sources. NYPA, in coordination with the Department of Public Service (DPS), will seek to develop a new nuclear facility, either alone or in partnership with private entities.

“We must embrace an energy policy of abundance that centers on energy independence and supply chain security to ensure New York controls its energy future,” Gov. Hochul said.

This effort builds on the state’s ongoing financial support to Constellation to pursue an early site permitting process for a new project at its Crane Clean Energy Center, a restoration of the former Three Mile Island Unit 1.

The move, which also included measures to discourage biofuel imports, was welcomed by the biofuel industry, which had been lobbying on the issue for months.

On June 13, the Environmental Protection Agency proposed total biofuel blending volumes at 24.02 billion gallons in 2026 and 24.46 billion gallons in 2027. That compares with blending requirements of 22.33 billion gallons in 2025.

Saskatchewan may ask to trigger AgriRecovery for producers affected by bovine tuberculosis.

Under the Renewable Fuel Standard, refiners are required to blend large volumes of biofuel into the nation’s fuel supply or purchase credits, called RINs, from those that do.

The proposal is driven in part by an increase in biomass-based diesel requirements. EPA set a quota of 7.12 billion biomass-based diesel RINs for 2026, a measurement of the number of tradable credits generated by blending the fuel.

It said it projected that mandate would lead to the blending of 5.61 billion gallons. The EPA expressed the biomass-based diesel requirement in billion RINs in accordance with the agency’s proposal to reduce the number of RINs that could be generated from imported biofuel.

After accounting for the reduction for imported biofuels, the EPA said it projected the number of RINs generated for biomass-based diesel would be 1.27 and 1.28 RINs per gallon in 2026 and 2027, respectively.

Nuclear power has received renewed interest as tech companies and data center developers scour the grid for new sources of power.","New York governor Kathy Hochul announced Monday that her state will host a large new nuclear power plant designed to generate at least 1 gigawatt of electricity.

“If you take nuclear off the table, you have to burn more fossil fuels,” Hochul said at a press conference. “That’s not going to work for us here in New York.”

The governor is directing the New York Power Authority (NYPA), which owns and operates two dozen power plants — mostly dams and gas turbines — to develop the new facility. The plans are still in their infancy: NYPA, a state government entity, has yet to pick a location or a design.

Hochul said the state will work with private partners to develop the power plant and will finance construction while buying the power it generates.

Among the sites under consideration are three nuclear plants currently operating in upstate New York, according to the Wall Street Journal. All of them are owned by Constellation Energy, which has been wooing tech companies to purchase output from its nuclear portfolio.

Microsoft and Meta both currently have deals with Constellation: Microsoft is reopening a reactor at Three Mile Island in Pennsylvania in a $1.8 billion project, while Meta is buying the clean energy attributes of the Clinton Clean Energy Center in Illinois in a deal that is reportedly worth billions of dollars. Amazon recently signed a deal with Talen Energy to buy nearly 2 gigawatts of nuclear in Pennsylvania.

But the nuclear industry still faces some potential headwinds. No new nuclear power plant has broken ground in the U.S. in over 15 years.

The most recent large-scale nuclear power plants in the U.S. have blown through deadlines and exceeded budgets by billions. Small modular reactors, which many startups are pursuing, promise to address those concerns by leveraging mass manufacturing, but the commercial viability of the technology remains untested until a few are built.

Hochul said that the success of the project will depend on regulatory and permitting reform at the federal level. Previous large nuclear power plants took years to complete the process. “The barriers are in Washington,” she said.

Nuclear power has received renewed interest as tech companies and data center developers scour the grid for new sources of power. It has also become a rare point of agreement between Democrats and Republicans, suggesting that the nascent nuclear renaissance might refresh the nation’s aging nuclear fleet.

The Trump administration’s attempt to circumvent tightened emissions standards that the president’s predecessor adopted for coal-fired power plants has generated a lawsuit with ramifications for Montana’s largest power plant.

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency moved June 11 to reverse the Mercury and Air Toxics Standard rule that the Biden administration implemented last year to reduce airborne emissions of heavy metals and soot when coal is burned to create electricity.

In a press release that day, EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin described the rule implemented by former President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris as an attempt to “regulate coal, oil and gas out of existence” because those energy sources don’t “align with their narrow-minded climate change zealotry.”

The repeal attempt comes two months after Zeldin granted Colstrip, the coal-fired plant in eastern Montana, a short-term exemption from the rule using a provision of federal law relating to “national security” interests. NorthWestern Energy CEO Bryan Bird, who has negotiated deals with other utilities in Washington to double his utility’s ownership in the 40-year-old plant, praised the EPA for the exemption when it was announced.

“This relief means our Montana customers will not be burdened with hundreds of millions of dollars of costs to comply with a new regulation that would only marginally increase the Colstrip Plant’s air toxics efficiency,” Byrd wrote in an April press release.

Both the rule rollback EPA announced last week and a lawsuit environmental groups filed the following day to halt the exemptions have been widely anticipated as Trump and his agency heads work to prop up the increasingly uneconomic coal-fired power industry over the objection of climate and public health groups.

Montana Environmental Information Center Executive Director Anne Hedges said in a June 12 press release about the lawsuit that Colstrip is a national outlier because it lacks the pollution control technology the emissions rule requires.

“Harming human health to eke out a bit more shareholder profit from a coal plant — especially one that is the nation’s dirtiest for toxic emissions and is frequently broken when we need it most — is misguided, harmful and expensive,” Hedges said. “Perhaps the billionaires in charge don’t care about human health or their electricity bills, but everyday Montanas sure do.”",https://montanafreepress.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Colstrip-1200x675-1.png,N,,2025-06-23 14:18:44.214909

The old Liberal government launched its rebate program – the Incentives for Zero-Emission Vehicles program or iZEV – in 2019. The iZEV program offered up to $5,000 off the cost of a new EV. Between May 2019 and January 2025, the federal government spent nearly $3 billion on the EV rebate program for more than half a million new passenger vehicles. But the program ran out of funding earlier this year, leading Ottawa to pause the program.

EVs remain more expensive than their gas-powered equivalents, and the first quarter of 2025 saw zero-emissions vehicles represent only 8.11 per cent of all new vehicle sales in Canada, which represents a drop from the 16.5 per cent in the fourth quarter of 2024, according to data from Statistics Canada.

But as is now being reported by The Canadian Press, a renewed consumer rebate is being worked on. “Will it be named, iZEV? That I can’t tell you. But there will be a consumer rebate,” Environment Minister Julie Dabrusin told the news agency on June 17. This is in keeping with the Liberal platform during the election, which suggested the party would look for a way to reintroduce the $5,000 rebate program.

Canada’s EV mandate requires all new light-duty passenger vehicles sold to be zero-emissions by 2035. Sales of used gas-powered vehicles will still be allowed after 2035. Plug-in hybrid vehicles would also be allowed for sale.

“It’s been in place since 2023. I don’t see why the Conservatives believe we need to change it in the face of what we’re facing with the U.S. tariffs on the auto industry,” Dabrusin told The Canadian Press following question period.

Canada’s auto manufacturers have grown on their calls for the government to repeal the mandate, as EV sales dropped in early 2025 as the rebates ended.

Electric vehicles remain more expensive than their gas-powered equivalents.

On a monthly basis through 2024, the share of EVs among new vehicle sales never dropped below 10.65 per cent, and peaked at 18.29 per cent in December. But in the first quarter of 2025, zero-emissions vehicles represent only 8.11 per cent of all new vehicle sales in Canada — a drop from the 16.5 per cent in the fourth quarter of 2024, according to data from Statistics Canada. In April of 2025, the most recent data from StatCan says that EV sales dropped to 7.53 per cent of all new vehicles on Canadian lots.

Beginning in 2026, the government’s EV mandate requires at least 20 per cent of new light-duty vehicles offered for sale in that year be zero-emission. That share rises each year until it reaches 100 per cent in 2035.",https://www.canplastics.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/favicon.png,N,,2025-06-23 13:19:58.369247

Intel's decision to delay the launch of its Ohio semiconductor facility, once called Silicon Heartland, to 2031 has left AEP Ohio with completed but idle power infrastructure that costs $95 million.
Back in September 2024, the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio (PUCO) approved a financial arrangement between Intel and AEP Ohio.
On June 5, 2025, Intel and AEP submitted a request to PUCO to amend their existing agreement, just four days after AEP Ohio announced an increase in customer rates.
As part of the revised arrangement, AEP is seeking continued cost coverage to bridge the gap created by Intel's delay.","Financial troubles have forced Intel to delay building and equipping its site in Ohio on multiple occasions, and now that the timeline has slipped to 2031, it is beginning to impact Intel's partners. NBC4i reports that the company now expects to start making chips at its Ohio fab in 2031, which leaves American Electric Power (AEP) Ohio with an idle power substation that cannot start operations without Intel.

Intel's decision to delay the launch of its Ohio semiconductor facility, once called Silicon Heartland, to 2031 has left AEP Ohio with completed but idle power infrastructure that costs $95 million. The utility company built a major substation specifically to meet Intel's expected power needs, but now it must wait years before it can start generating a return on its investment.

Back in September 2024, the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio (PUCO) approved a financial arrangement between Intel and AEP Ohio. Under that deal, AEP would invest in building a new 500-megawatt substation, which Intel would begin using once the first fab (Mod 1) at its Ohio site comes online. In 2024, Intel expected this to happen in 2027 – 2028, which was already a delay from the originally expected 2025 kick-off. However, in early 2025, Intel shifted the completion of the first fab to 2030, with production to start at the Silicon Heartland Mod 1 in 2030-2031.

The substation, known as Green Chapel Station, was designed to meet Intel's massive power demand and is scheduled to be operational by August 2025. The infrastructure is capable of supporting the electricity needs of up to half a million homes, but it will stand idle until Intel's site becomes operational. Under the 2024 agreement, Intel was set to receive electricity at a reduced rate for 20 years, while other users of the substation would be billed separately. As a consequence, Intel and its supplier need to revise their deal.

On June 5, 2025, Intel and AEP submitted a request to PUCO to amend their existing agreement, just four days after AEP Ohio announced an increase in customer rates. Despite the overlap in timing, AEP stated that the new rates had nothing to do with the Intel-related deal, emphasizing that the changes were caused by power supply and demand dynamics across its 13-state energy grid.

Once the fabrication plant is active, Intel's electricity costs will be partially offset through small charges on residential bills under a program called the Distribution Investment Rider. This mechanism already appears on customer bills for other infrastructure projects, typically adding $2 to $3 per month. AEP explained that none of the Intel-related costs will appear on bills until the facility actually begins drawing power.

AEP Ohio noted that the construction of Green Chapel Station was aligned with Intel's original project schedule, which aimed to start making chips in Ohio between 2027 and 2028. Despite being ready on time, the equipment cannot be placed into service without Intel, which prevents AEP from recovering its costs.

As part of the revised arrangement, AEP is seeking continued cost coverage to bridge the gap created by Intel's delay. Meanwhile, Intel has agreed to absorb any additional expenses if the project ultimately exceeds the original plan, which will protect AEP from financial loss caused by the Silicon Heartland delay.",https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/bY2KNEZf57HJG4Rkadxbni.png,N,,2025-06-23 13:19:45.013308

Americans’ support for green energy tax credits and renewable energies like wind and solar power has decreased in recent years, according to a new poll, driven by a softening in support from Democrats and independents.

The poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research finds that U.S. adults’ support for tax credits for electric vehicles and solar panels has weakened, as well as their enthusiasm for offshore wind farm expansion. While Democrats remain the strongest supporters of these initiatives, the poll reveals signs of growing cynicism within their ranks.

The poll results coincide with sweeping changes President Donald Trump’s Republican administration is making to regulations related to energy and climate change, including slashing the federal workforce in these departments. And although Democrats and independents have weakened their support for some green energy initiatives, there has not been an increase in support for Trump’s energy policies.

The poll found only about 4 in 10 U.S. adults — including only 1 in 10 Democrats and about 2 in 10 independents, along with three-quarters of Republicans — approve of the way Trump is handling climate change, which largely tracks with his overall approval rating.

Democrats and independents drive decline in support for renewable energy credits

About 6 in 10 Democrats, 58%, favor tax credits for purchasing an electric vehicle, down from about 7 in 10 in 2022. Among independents, support declined from 49% in 2022 to 28%. Only one-quarter of Republicans supported this policy in 2022, and that hasn’t changed measurably.

“As far as the pollution goes … the vehicles nowadays put out very little emissions to the air,” said JD Johnson, a 62-year-old Democrat from Meadowview, Virginia, who somewhat opposes tax credits to purchase an electric vehicle. That’s partly because he sees the electric vehicle manufacturing process as energy intensive and believes gasoline-powered vehicles have made improvements with the pollutants they emit.

The decline in favoring solar panel tax credits was across the board rather than being concentrated among Democrats.

“For solar panels, in all honesty, I don’t think they’re that efficient yet,” said Glenn Savage, 78, a left-leaning independent from Rock Hill, South Carolina. “I’d rather see them pour money into research and try to get the solar panels more efficient before they start giving tax breaks to the public. I may be wrong on that, but that’s just my thought.”

Scientists say transitioning to renewable energies and ditching fossil fuels that release planet-warming emissions are essential to protect the planet. Billions of dollars in project grants for clean technologies awarded during President Joe Biden’s Democratic administration have been canceled by the Trump administration, and the offshore wind sector has been stunted by Trump’s executive order that paused approvals, permits and loans for wind energy projects.

Fewer than half of U.S. adults, 44%, now say that offshore wind farms should be expanded in the U.S., down from 59% in 2022. About half favor expanding solar panel farms, while about two-thirds were in support in 2022.

When people are concerned about the economy and their personal finances, environmental issues are sometimes prioritized less, said Talbot Andrews, an assistant professor in the department of government at Cornell University who was not involved in the poll.

“I think it makes people anxious to think about increased taxes or increased spending on environmental issues when the cost of eggs are going through the roof,” Andrews said.

Low support for Trump’s efforts to expand offshore drilling and coal mining

Trump has championed the expansion of offshore oil drilling, as well as domestic coal production.

Despite a decline in support for expanded renewable energies, the new poll shows that only about one-third of U.S. adults think offshore drilling for oil and natural gas should be expanded in the U.S., and only about one-quarter say this about coal mining.

In both cases, Republicans are much more likely than Democrats to support expanding these energy sources.

Trump has sought to open up national monuments for oil drilling, but more U.S. adults oppose than support auctioning off more public space for oil drilling. Only about one-quarter of U.S. adults favor this, while 4 in 10 are opposed. Republicans are much more likely than independents or Democrats to be in support.

Bipartisan support for consumer rebates and home appliance ratings

The Energy Star program that certifies appliances, such as dishwashers and refrigerators, as energy efficient recently appeared in headlines when the EPA made plans to scrap the program. The blue and white logo is well recognized, and experts say the program has long had bipartisan support until recently.

The poll found three-quarters of Democrats support providing consumer rebates for efficient home appliances, compared with 6 in 10 Republicans.

Patrick Buck, 54, from Chicago, describes himself as a liberal Republican and is a fan of the consumer rebates for energy-efficient appliances. “It seems to work in terms of transforming what people have in their houses, because a lot of people have a lot of old appliances and just can’t afford new ones,” he said.

Safe air, water, meat and produce

The poll found only about 2 in 10 U.S. adults are “extremely” or “very” confident in the federal government’s ability to ensure the safety of their drinking water, the air they breathe and the meat, poultry, fruits and vegetables they buy in grocery stores.

About 4 in 10 U.S. adults are “somewhat” confident in the federal government’s ability to ensure the safety of each of these, and about 4 in 10 are “not very” or “not at all” confident.

The Trump administration has announced plans to roll back rules and policies related to limiting pollution and greenhouse gas emissions, such as rules that limit pollution from power plants and blocking California’s efforts to phase out cars that run on gas. The federal government has also cut staff at the Food and Drug Administration, the federal agency tasked with protecting public health and ensuring food supply safety.

The AP-NORC poll of 1,158 adults was conducted June 5-9, using a sample drawn from NORC’s probability-based AmeriSpeak Panel, which is designed to be representative of the U.S. population. The margin of sampling error for adults overall is plus or minus 4 percentage points.

To build on this momentum and reinforce America’s technological and competitive edge, decisive action is needed in three key areas.
Now, we can extend that success to the AI era—securing America's technological leadership for generations to come.
The AI revolution is moving at lightning speed, and our energy policy must rapidly evolve to keep pace.
The necessary path forward is clear: streamline permitting, modernize grid connections, and secure supply chains.","President Trump and his administration are prioritizing innovation and domestic manufacturing, and, thanks to their efforts, U.S. electric companies are once again able to plan, invest, and build toward the future.

For example, EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin is carrying out President Trump’s bold agenda with his Powering the Great American Comeback Initiative. Administrator Zeldin recently took action that will allow energy companies to provide the power needed to advance America’s AI dominance, calling the move “the first, and certainly not the last step” toward “working with artificial intelligence and data center companies and utilities to resolve any outstanding challenges and make the U.S. the AI capital of the world.”

President Trump’s Made in America policies have reshaped the policy environment for U.S. manufacturers. As Duke Energy CEO Harry Sideris noted, “We see the potential for some of our customers to increase production” because of the administration’s policies. This shift marks a new direction in U.S. economic policy. To build on this momentum and reinforce America’s technological and competitive edge, decisive action is needed in three key areas.

First, we must cut the excessive red tape that is delaying critical energy projects. We must streamline permitting by updating NEPA, the Clean Water Act, and the Endangered Species Act processes. Strengthening and enforcing firm deadlines for agency reviews and limiting frivolous litigation could cut permitting timelines in half while maintaining the environmental standards they originally envisioned. For context, this red tape means it frequently takes more than a decade to build new high-voltage transmission lines in the U.S. Let’s empower those who demonstrate the grid can be rebuilt in weeks – or even days – after every storm to do it quickly enough to meet the moment.

Second, we must speed up the connection of power plants to the grid. Today, adding new generation to the grid can take up to 4-7 years, with interconnection to the grid taking up a large part of that time. In recent comments filed in response to the White House Office of Science and Technology’s request for information on its AI Action Plan, Schneider Electric, a leading physical infrastructure provider for data centers, included in its recommendations the need to “streamline time to power by improving interconnection queues and establishing clear processes and criteria for prioritization that are transparent, timely, and support national, energy, and economic security objectives.” A “fast lane” for critical energy projects – covering everything from siting and permitting to generation and transmission – will dramatically reduce these timelines and get more power faster to where it is needed.

Third, all of these reforms will be for naught if we do not take steps to ensure the necessary components are available by clearing barriers to onshoring production and securing our supply chains. Overreliance on China creates the risk of supply chain bottlenecks that could choke off access to the materials needed for infrastructure development.

These commonsense reforms build upon successful energy policies implemented under Republican leadership. During President Trump's first term, America achieved energy independence for the first time in decades. Now, we can extend that success to the AI era—securing America's technological leadership for generations to come.

The AI revolution is moving at lightning speed, and our energy policy must rapidly evolve to keep pace. The necessary path forward is clear: streamline permitting, modernize grid connections, and secure supply chains.

Motiva Enterprises' Port Arthur, Texas, plant became the largest single refinery by capacity at 640,500 bpd, passing Marathon Petroleum's Galveston Bay Refinery in Texas City, Texas, according to the report. Motiva's increase of 14,500 bpd from a year ago was due to improving operating efficiency.

National capacity may possibly fall by as much as 402,476 bpd by next year's report because of refinery closures: Lyondell Basell Industries permanently shuttered its 263,776 bpd Houston refinery in February, while Phillips 66 plans to close its 138,700-bpd Los Angeles refinery by the end of this year.

In 2026, assuming no growth at refineries through efficiency improvements, referred to as de-bottlenecking, U.S. capacity would fall below the 2023 level of 18.06 million bpd reported by the EIA.

Marathon, based in Findlay, Ohio, continues to be the largest single refiner in the United States with 13 refineries operating a combined production capacity of 2.96 million bpd equal to 16% of the national total, according to the EIA report, which is issued annually.

Valero Energy Corp., based in San Antonio, is the second largest, with 13 refineries operating 2.2 million bpd, equal to 12% of U.S. capacity, according to the EIA.

Exxon Mobil Corp. is the third-largest, with four refineries with 1.96 million bpd in crude oil throughput, equal to 10.6% of national capacity, the EIA report said.

The EIA report reflects refinery capacity as of January 1, 2025 and is based on reports filed by refiners on individual capacities for each refinery by January 1. As such, it provides a portrait of growth in the previous year.

The long-term trend in U.S. refining has been for shrinking numbers of refineries to overcome increasing capacity at remaining ones.

The total number of refineries in the United States remained unchanged at 132 from 2024, but the EIA report lists the 32,000-bpd CPI Operations refinery in Paulsboro, New Jersey as idle.

To wit, there is still demand for passenger cars in the U.S. market, and those two divisions prove it.
Current wisdom portrays a lack of consumer interest as the primary reason for the decline in passenger car sales.
It would also reduce complexity and be a potential catalyst to reinstate passenger cars into the portfolio of the Detroit 3.","Imagine sitting in an automotive situation room after understanding that tariff and regulation changes have made vehicle sales growth much less certain. Everybody is nervous. A Detroit 3 boss comes in and says to all the planning types that are sitting around the conference room: “We need volume. Go out and find me a market that sells more than two million units a year. No excuses.’

Heads turn, revealing quizzical faces on the planners waiting for someone to speak. Finally, a voice from the back of the room says, “Boss, that market is right here in the United States. It’s the passenger car market and we have abandoned it.” Boss’s reply: “How did that happen”?

Let’s explore the answer to that question. The Detroit 3 used to be the preeminent players in the mainstream passenger car market in the late 70s, with GM leading the pack with Oldsmobile Cutlass and Chevrolet Impala. Yes, a nostalgic era! Those days are gone. Currently, GM has no mainstream cars, and it seems painful, and inaccurate, to say the Ford Mustang and Dodge Charger provide customers a real range of choice. But that is where those U.S. automakers are today.

Asian brands offer up a different mainstream portfolio. First off, they have 11 of the top 20 selling SUVs in the U.S. market. Toyota’s RAV4 (#1) and Honda’s CR-V (#3) are at the top of the list. Importantly, Asian companies capture nine of the top-10-selling passenger cars. Toyota and Honda have the top three passenger car models, with each selling over 200,000 per year. Are the cars expensive? No! Their hybrid models are priced as low as $24,000 and get 46 miles per gallon.

Imagine, cars and trucks living in the same showroom. To wit, there is still demand for passenger cars in the U.S. market, and those two divisions prove it.

Government Regulations: Not Car-Friendly

It’s no secret that the passenger car sector has lost a significant share of the market over the past eight years. Overall, passenger car sales have declined by 56% since 2016, a whopping 3.9 million units. The Detroit 3 have fared much worse, with passenger car sales declining by 84%.

Current wisdom portrays a lack of consumer interest as the primary reason for the decline in passenger car sales. That argument has merit but does not explain the total picture. A large portion of that variance can be attributed to the decline in passenger car entries at the Detroit 3, a reduction much larger than their competitors.

Toyota and Honda have only dropped six entries (mostly imported), allowing them to hold on to car market leadership. Their overall portfolio is a measure of consumers’ desire for more choice, affordability, and fuel economy. Toyota and Honda have succeeded in satisfying all three with fuel-efficient gasoline engines, hybrids, and a few electric and fuel-cell vehicles thrown in.

The Detroit 3 followed a different strategy. They were guided by government policies that helped them exit the car business and slide knee-deep into battery-electric vehicles to comply with the regulations. The 2017-25 CO2 standards for passenger cars and light trucks made it difficult to maintain small cars with gasoline engines in their portfolio. It was much easier to meet the higher standard with longer and wider cars to reduce the potential for non-compliance penalties or the need to purchase credits.

The ultimate penalty was the release of the very stringent 2026-30 CO2 standards. For example, the 2030 standards decreased the requirements to 91 grams of C02/mile for passenger cars and 110 grams/mile for light trucks, a reduction from 2024 standards by 39% and 49%, respectively. This set the stage for more non-compliance penalties moving forward.

Decision time: if you don’t have passenger cars, you don’t have passenger-car penalties for non-compliance, especially if those costs continue to chip away at car margins. Seems like bean counter-rather than consumer focused logic. The lower CO2 standard ultimately resulted in the elimination of Chevy’s Sonic, Spark, Cruise and Malibu, Ford’s Fiesta, Focus and Fusion and the Dodge Dart. Light trucks, with higher profit margins, were spared.

The Inflation Reduction Act also had an influence on the Detroit 3’s portfolio. The law made it very easy for manufacturers to get overextended on battery-electric vehicles on the taxpayer’s dime. Their first moves were to electrify trucks and SUVs and avoid a mainstream electric car entry. This was a missed strategic opportunity. Perhaps the planners did not explain that Tesla was already selling a Model 3 passenger car at a clip of 175,000 units a year.

The passing of Section 177 of the Clean Air Act did not help either. The act allows states to adopt California’s stricter vehicle emission standards. Twelve states formally adopted California’s Advanced Clean Cars II regulation. This likely led to a decision to declutter a vehicle portfolio that would need to be managed as if the United States were no longer united. Production schedules and inventory management complexity would be substantial. Passenger cars ended up on the chopping block.

Objectively, maybe the Detroit 3 cannot make cars profitably in the United States no matter the regulatory environment. This would not bode well for competing with the Chinese in the global export market. Maybe Chevrolet, Ford and Dodge are just truck divisions that will exit the global stage and hold on for dear life. Perhaps the UAW does not care, as long as the government protects them.

Detroit 3: 20/20 Hindsight

Looking backward, it is easy to see how good intentions about improving the environment became an unrealistic burden on the Detroit 3, for both cars and trucks (Note: At various stages of regulation development the Detroit 3 supported all the regulations previously discussed). The current administration and Republican-controlled Congress are looking to relieve that burden, though not all their initiatives will help in that arena (see second bullet below).

The California exemption, allowing stricter CO2 standards, has been eliminated by President Donald Trump pending further litigation. A return to federal-only regulations helps Ford and GM reduce manufacturing and inventory complexity.

Elimination of the Inflation Reduction Act has been approved by the House and is awaiting approval in the Senate. Overall, this hurts the Detroit 3, and all U.S. battery-electric development. Keeping the investment credits would help immensely.

Unfortunately, EPA’s CO2 regulations are not likely to be modified to be less stringent (WP Browne Consulting previously proposed a five-year delay). An easing of the standard would significantly reduce payment penalties or the need to purchase credits. It would also reduce complexity and be a potential catalyst to reinstate passenger cars into the portfolio of the Detroit 3. A boost to consumers’ affordability and choice would be the result. (Note: As of June 20, the Senate parliamentarian has ruled that the emissions changes cannot be included in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act. The Senate would have to overrule the decision, and that is problematic. Changes to both the IRA and CO2 standards must happen within the same year. Otherwise, the disruption to investment could be significant).

The changes outlined above could collectively alter the strategic direction of the Detroit 3, and put more money in their pockets, assuming that the changes are approved and last. Ford, GM, and Stellantis will need that money to pay for continued BEV and hybrid development that is not paid for by taxpayers, move some vehicle production back to the United States and fund more innovation to keep them from falling farther behind China’s vehicle development. They also have an opportunity to reach more U.S. consumers and consumers beyond U.S. borders (Mexican sales were 42% passenger cars in 2024). Collectively, they could gain plus volume from their competitors in multiple markets. Thinking outside the box is required.

Asian manufacturers have a plan to continue with cars in their portfolio—gasoline, hybrid and electric. It is time for the Detroit 3 to leverage the policy changes that are coming and alter their truck-only strategy.","https://img.industryweek.com/files/base/ebm/industryweek/image/2025/06/685979aa6153c3db841ab491-fordf150lightning_promo.png?auto=format,compress&fit=fill&fill=blur&w=1200&h=630",N,,2025-06-23 12:23:44.873743

Americans’ support for green energy tax credits and renewable energies like wind and solar power has decreased in recent years, according to a new poll, driven by a softening in support from Democrats and independents.

The poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research finds that U.S. adults’ support for tax credits for electric vehicles and solar panels has weakened, as well as their enthusiasm for offshore wind farm expansion. While Democrats remain the strongest supporters of these initiatives, the poll reveals signs of growing cynicism within their ranks.

The poll results coincide with sweeping changes President Donald Trump’s Republican administration is making to regulations related to energy and climate change, including slashing the federal workforce in these departments. And although Democrats and independents have weakened their support for some green energy initiatives, there has not been an increase in support for Trump’s energy policies.

The poll found only about 4 in 10 U.S. adults — including only 1 in 10 Democrats and about 2 in 10 independents, along with three-quarters of Republicans — approve of the way Trump is handling climate change, which largely tracks with his overall approval rating.

Democrats and independents drive decline in support for renewable energy credits

About 6 in 10 Democrats, 58%, favor tax credits for purchasing an electric vehicle, down from about 7 in 10 in 2022. Among independents, support declined from 49% in 2022 to 28%. Only one-quarter of Republicans supported this policy in 2022, and that hasn’t changed measurably.

“As far as the pollution goes … the vehicles nowadays put out very little emissions to the air,” said JD Johnson, a 62-year-old Democrat from Meadowview, Virginia, who somewhat opposes tax credits to purchase an electric vehicle. That’s partly because he sees the electric vehicle manufacturing process as energy intensive and believes gasoline-powered vehicles have made improvements with the pollutants they emit.

The decline in favoring solar panel tax credits was across the board rather than being concentrated among Democrats.

“For solar panels, in all honesty, I don’t think they’re that efficient yet,” said Glenn Savage, 78, a left-leaning independent from Rock Hill, South Carolina. “I’d rather see them pour money into research and try to get the solar panels more efficient before they start giving tax breaks to the public. I may be wrong on that, but that’s just my thought.”

Scientists say transitioning to renewable energies and ditching fossil fuels that release planet-warming emissions are essential to protect the planet. Billions of dollars in project grants for clean technologies awarded during President Joe Biden’s Democratic administration have been canceled by the Trump administration, and the offshore wind sector has been stunted by Trump’s executive order that paused approvals, permits and loans for wind energy projects.

Fewer than half of U.S. adults, 44%, now say that offshore wind farms should be expanded in the U.S., down from 59% in 2022. About half favor expanding solar panel farms, while about two-thirds were in support in 2022.

When people are concerned about the economy and their personal finances, environmental issues are sometimes prioritized less, said Talbot Andrews, an assistant professor in the department of government at Cornell University who was not involved in the poll.

“I think it makes people anxious to think about increased taxes or increased spending on environmental issues when the cost of eggs are going through the roof,” Andrews said.

Low support for Trump’s efforts to expand offshore drilling and coal mining

Trump has championed the expansion of offshore oil drilling, as well as domestic coal production.

Despite a decline in support for expanded renewable energies, the new poll shows that only about one-third of U.S. adults think offshore drilling for oil and natural gas should be expanded in the U.S., and only about one-quarter say this about coal mining.

In both cases, Republicans are much more likely than Democrats to support expanding these energy sources.

Trump has sought to open up national monuments for oil drilling, but more U.S. adults oppose than support auctioning off more public space for oil drilling. Only about one-quarter of U.S. adults favor this, while 4 in 10 are opposed. Republicans are much more likely than independents or Democrats to be in support.

Bipartisan support for consumer rebates and home appliance ratings

The Energy Star program that certifies appliances, such as dishwashers and refrigerators, as energy efficient recently appeared in headlines when the EPA made plans to scrap the program. The blue and white logo is well recognized, and experts say the program has long had bipartisan support until recently.

The poll found three-quarters of Democrats support providing consumer rebates for efficient home appliances, compared with 6 in 10 Republicans.

Patrick Buck, 54, from Chicago, describes himself as a liberal Republican and is a fan of the consumer rebates for energy-efficient appliances. “It seems to work in terms of transforming what people have in their houses, because a lot of people have a lot of old appliances and just can’t afford new ones,” he said.

Safe air, water, meat and produce

The poll found only about 2 in 10 U.S. adults are “extremely” or “very” confident in the federal government’s ability to ensure the safety of their drinking water, the air they breathe and the meat, poultry, fruits and vegetables they buy in grocery stores.

About 4 in 10 U.S. adults are “somewhat” confident in the federal government’s ability to ensure the safety of each of these, and about 4 in 10 are “not very” or “not at all” confident.

The Trump administration has announced plans to roll back rules and policies related to limiting pollution and greenhouse gas emissions, such as rules that limit pollution from power plants and blocking California’s efforts to phase out cars that run on gas. The federal government has also cut staff at the Food and Drug Administration, the federal agency tasked with protecting public health and ensuring food supply safety.

The AP-NORC poll of 1,158 adults was conducted June 5-9, using a sample drawn from NORC’s probability-based AmeriSpeak Panel, which is designed to be representative of the U.S. population. The margin of sampling error for adults overall is plus or minus 4 percentage points.

What Adoption of these Bills Means Collectively, these bills represent a landmark for nuclear energy in Texas.","The Texas Legislature recently passed three key bills: House Bill 14 (H.B. 14); Senate Bill 1061 (S.B. 1061); and Senate Bill 1535 (S.B. 1535), which introduce a comprehensive legal framework to promote nuclear energy in Texas, including uranium mining and workforce development. The bills are expected to be signed by Texas Governor Greg Abbott, who during the interim session instructed the Texas Public Utility Commission to establish an advanced nuclear working group to study and plan for the use of advanced nuclear reactors in Texas. The final report of the working group contains many of the recommendations on which these bills are based.

Key Provisions of the Advanced Nuclear Bills

1. Creation of the Texas Advanced Nuclear Energy Office

At the heart of H.B. 14 is the creation of the Texas Advanced Nuclear Energy Office (TANEO), a new agency housed within the Office of the Governor. [New Section 483.101(a) of the Texas Government Code]. TANEO is designed to facilitate advanced nuclear development in Texas by providing strategic leadership for the advanced nuclear reactor system in Texas, coordinating permits and regulatory efforts, engaging in public education and outreach, promoting the development of advanced nuclear reactors for dispatchable electric generation, creating high-wage manufacturing jobs, identifying barriers to nuclear project development, and supporting the creation of an in-state advanced nuclear supply chain. [Id. at subsection (b)]. The bill authorizes the Governor to appoint a Director of the Office to oversee and administer programs established under the Office [New Section 483.103 of the Texas Government Code] and a Nuclear Permitting Coordinator to assist developers with navigating federal, state, and local permitting requirements. [New Section 483.104 of the Texas Government Code].

2. New Grant Programs to Support Nuclear Development

H.B. 14 establishes the Texas Advanced Nuclear Development Fund, a dedicated account in the state's General Revenue fund. [New Section 483.201(a) of the Texas Government Code]. The fund will support three new grant programs designed to reimburse expenses for qualifying projects using advanced nuclear technologies, including small modular reactors and microreactors. The Legislature has appropriated $350 million into the fund.

Project Development and Supply Chain Reimbursement Grants. Reimburses up to 50% of eligible early-stage costs (e.g., feasibility studies, engineering, licensing work), capped at $12.5 million per project. [New Section 483.203 of the Texas Government Code].

Advanced Nuclear Construction Reimbursement Grants.Covers up to 50% of qualifying construction costs, including Nuclear Regulatory Commission application fees and long-lead component procurement, with a cap of $120 million per project. Projects must have a construction permit or license application docketed with the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission. [New Section 483.204 of the Texas Government Code].

Completion Bonus for ERCOT-Connected Reactors. Provides performance-based grants for advanced nuclear reactors that reach commercial operation and connect to the ERCOT power grid. Award amounts will be based on the facility's generation capacity determined on a per-megawatt basis. [New Section 483.205 of the Texas Government Code].

TANEO will evaluate each grant applicant based on the applicant's quality of services and management, efficiency of operations, access to resources essential to the project, application for a permit or license with the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, ability to repay the grant if benchmarks are not met, and the project's potential benefit to the state. [New Section 483.206 of the Texas Government Code]. H.B. 14 ensures that these grants are reimbursement-based and not up-front funding. [New Section 483.202(b) of the Texas Government Code]. Recipients must repay grant funds if project milestones are not met. [Id. at subsection (e)(2)]. The bill also prohibits grants to applicants who already received state-appropriated funds under certain conditions. [Id. at subsection (c)].

3. Legislative Oversight and Confidentiality

Before finalizing any grant award under H.B. 14, TANEO must provide notice to the Lieutenant Governor and Speaker of the House, who may jointly disapprove of the proposed grant within 30 days (with one possible 14-day extension). [Id. at subsection (d)]. Grant application materials are deemed confidential and not subject to public disclosure under the Texas Public Information Act. [New Section 483.207 of the Texas Government Code].

4. Streamlined Procedures for Uranium Mining and Production

S.B. 1061 streamlines the uranium-mining application process by reducing procedural delays and clarifying permitting rules. Specifically, S.B. 1061 amends the Texas Water Code to provide that applications for authorization or amendment to authorization can be uncontested if:

the authorization covers a production area located within the boundaries of a permit that incorporates a range table of groundwater quality restoration values for each area;

the restoration values for each production area are below the established range's upper limit;

the authorization covers a production area located within the boundaries of a permit that incorporates wells' groundwater baseline characteristics as required by Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ) rule; and

the TCEQ mails the application's notice of receipt to the county's groundwater conservation district and surface and mineral owners in the area no later than 30 days after the TCEQ determines the application to be administratively complete. [New Sections 27.0513(d)(1) – (4) of the Texas Water Code].

These changes allow companies to avoid the full permitting process when amending applications and will apply to applications or amendments submitted on or after September 1, 2025. [S.B. 1061, Sections 3 and 4].

5. Creation of an Advanced Nuclear Energy Workforce Development Program

S.B. 1535 creates the advanced nuclear energy workforce development program to develop a talent pipeline for the anticipated advanced nuclear industry growth. The bill directs the Texas Workforce Commission (TWC) to create and administer this initiative. [New Section 302.0081(b) of the Texas Labor Code]. The TWC must collaborate with the Texas Education Agency and the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board to assess labor supply gaps in the advanced nuclear energy industry, retain talent and strengthen the nuclear workforce pipeline [Id. at subsection (c)(1)(A)], and support the development of academic and training programs in nuclear-related disciplines. [Id. at subsection (c)(2)]. The bill also authorizes support for public-private partnerships to create nuclear career awareness, academic pathways into nuclear fields, workforce training programs offered by public colleges and technical schools, and research and leadership development at general academic institutions. [Id. at subsection (c)(1)(B)]. Overall, S.B. 1535 intends to increase workforce capacity to meet the anticipated growth of Texas's advanced nuclear energy industry.

What Adoption of these Bills Means

Collectively, these bills represent a landmark for nuclear energy in Texas. They institutionalize state-level support, from permitting coordination to sizable grant and workforce development. With full gubernatorial backing and alignment with established energy needs, lawmakers and industry are positioned to see a major shift in Texas's energy portfolio. For the energy sector, emerging nuclear capacity could greatly strengthen much needed grid resilience, drive economic activity in project development, manufacturing and finance, and signal that Texas is preparing for diverse and reliable power sources in addition tofossil fuels and renewables.

It includes a number of flagship, economically interventionist policies, such as subsidising energy bills for businesses, as well as plans to invest in the national grid and redouble efforts to boost home-grown technical skills, in partnership with the private sector.

This economic approach, the government says, will support some of the UK’s highest-growth sectors. The industrial strategy backs eight in particular: advanced manufacturing, clean energy, the creative industries, defence, the digital and technologies sector, financial services, life sciences and, finally, professional and business services.

Industrial strategy: energy savings for businesses

The focus on energy will be particularly welcome news to heavy industry. Manufacturers and other resource-intensive businesses have long been painfully aware that energy costs in the UK are high, especially compared with the US and other countries in Europe.

To address this, and boost domestic manufacturing, the UK will intervene in energy costs for sectors such as automotive, aerospace and chemicals, starting from 2027. These sectors will also be exempt from paying energy levies such as the Renewables Obligation, Feed-in Tariffs and the Capacity Market.

A new British Industrial Competitiveness Scheme will cut those costs by £40 per megawatt hour. Other energy-intensive sectors will enjoy reduced electricity network charges via the so-called British Industry Supercharger. This mechanism will grant a 90% discount to such charges.

Meanwhile, the government announced a plan to speed up grid connection for heavy industries through the Connections Accelerator Service, where projects deemed important enough to the national interest will be able to book energy capacity in advance.

Further details on eligibility will be announced pending an upcoming consultation, but the initial announcement has proved popular both with Labour’s traditional support base and with business.

Gary Smith, the general secretary of the GMB union, welcomed the energy cost-cutting as a “big step forward”.

“This is a great opportunity to rebuild our industry, save iconic home-grown sectors like our potteries and bring good jobs home,” Smith said. “The devil will be in the detail, but at long last we have a grown-up strategy that will allow industry to thrive.”

Michael Moore, chief executive of the British Private Equity & Venture Capital Association (BVCA), agrees. “Energy is a significant cost of doing business for many sectors and weighs heavily on private capital firms in deciding where to deploy the vital capital the UK’s high-potential businesses need. Action which addresses the UK’s competitiveness in this important area is positive.”

Tech and the UK industrial strategy: what tech leaders need to know

With a flood of data centre investment and a slush fund for domestic compute capacity, the Labour government has worked to position itself as an emerging AI and technology powerhouse since taking up office.

Fittingly, the industrial strategy provides further details on how the government intends to make this a reality.

A major component here, outlined further in the separate Industrial Strategy Digital And Technologies Sector Plan, is the development of regional clusters that aim to further support existing expertise in those regions – for instance, boosting semiconductor research in Wales and quantum R&D funding in Scotland.

Industrial strategy: tech, engineering and defence skills

A new industry partnership programme, in league with big tech players including Nvidia, Google and Microsoft, aims to train 7.5 million workers in “essential AI skills” by 2030, alongside a series of AI “adoption hubs” located across the UK.

The government previously announced the TechFirst skills programme at London Tech Week and will be injecting £187m in digital skills and AI learning for classrooms. This package includes upskilling 4,000 graduates, researchers and innovators in AI, cyber and computer science.

A further £100m will be invested in engineering skills via the Skills England organisation, while ‘Technical Excellence Colleges’ aim to boost learning in advanced manufacturing, clean energy and digital.

Industrial strategy and the AI Action Plan

The industrial strategy draws attention to the £2bn previously committed to the UK AI Action Plan, plus the Sovereign AI Programme recently teased at London Tech Week.

Additionally, a £500m Sovereign AI Unit will aim to “maximise the UK’s stake in frontier AI”. It’ll work with the British Business Bank to invest in data, compute and talent for UK AI capabilities, partnering with both startups and larger organisations.

An industrial strategy AI adoption fund will facilitate the development of cutting-edge AI in firms that display high-growth potential.

And a new £600m Strategic Sites Accelerator aims to speed up the development of more AI Growth Zones, areas where planning restrictions are relaxed for data centres.

Boosting frontier industries: quantum, semiconductors and cybersecurity

Through the National Quantum Technologies Programme, the government has promised to make the UK an “international pacesetter” for quantum, including through establishing UK Quantum Hubs in Glasgow and Edinburgh.

The domestic semiconductor industry will also receive a boost in funding for skills around design and production, including in materials science.

Industry partners will play an important role in the development of cyber, AI and quantum planning, says the government, through the Quantum Strategic Advisory Board, AI Energy Council, and Cyber Growth Partnership.

The government shouted out the UK’s cyber industry, mentioning Darktrace, NCC Group and BAE Systems in the report as exporters of “world-leading cyber solutions and services”.

“Today’s industrial strategy clearly recognises that you cannot have sustainable economic growth without strong cyber resilience, identifying cyber as a ‘frontier’ industry,” says Mike Maddison, CEO of NCC Group, a cybersecurity firm headquartered in Manchester. “The document highlights the immense potential for the UK to solidify its position as a true global leader in cybersecurity.”

The UK, the report suggests, must work to maintain this edge with regional investment, including the building of a new National Cyber Innovation Centre in Cheltenham, near to the headquarters of GCHQ, the UK’s signals intelligence agency.

Industrial strategy: the bottom line for business leaders

The strategy signals a clear commitment from the UK government towards an interventionist economic policy, funneling government funding into key research areas and encouraging the adoption of innovative tech and tooling.

For UK businesses, the white paper shows a willingness to work hand-in-hand with industry while accelerating collaboration between the public and private sectors in procurement. Big tech will be ecstatic that its major players have the government’s ear in shaping the AI skills curriculum for the future of the country. For smaller firms, development for expertise clusters will likely be encouraging signs for regional development.

It is an ambitious document but, as with every manifesto, the tricky part will be actioning the points within it and translating them into real value.",https://assets.raconteur.net/uploads/2025/06/250623_subsidised-electricity_illo.png,N,,2025-06-23 14:17:40.025408

As a vital link in the largest freshwater system on Earth, the Great Lakes, this river carries not only water but a deep, storied industrial history—one of both pride and persistent environmental challenges. Cleaning up contaminated sediments in the Detroit and Rouge Rivers alone is expected to cost over $1 billion.

Cuts across environmental agencies in the last few months have led to significant staff losses. The EPA has been threatened with a 65% budget cut, according to The New York Times. With these cuts goes institutional knowledge, crucial relationships, and momentum. Programs essential to the health of the Great Lakes — such as algal bloom monitoring and invasive species research — hang in the balance.

The Great Lakes region supports over $4 trillion in economic activity. If it were a country, it would be among the world’s largest economies. From commercial shipping to recreation, drinking water to sustenance fishing, the Great Lakes and the Detroit River are foundational to life across the region. If they suffer, we all suffer.

What does it take to protect places like the Detroit River and the Great Lakes? It takes committed partnerships between federal agencies and local groups, working together to restore habitats, monitor threats, and safeguard the natural resources on which we all depend.

A shining example is the Sugar Island restoration project, located at the mouth of Lake Erie in Grosse Ile Township. Purchased in 2012 by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service using Great Lakes Restoration Initiative funds, Sugar Island became part of the Detroit River International Wildlife Refuge.

Through significant partnership and funding with the U.S. EPA and NOAA through the GLRI, 26 acres of coastal wetland on the island were restored, enhanced, and protected. More than 120 habitat structures were installed, supporting species such as mudpuppies, bald eagles, smallmouth bass, yellow perch, walleye, lake sturgeon, and native snakes.

The results are remarkable. Post-restoration monitoring revealed the return of five species of herpetofauna, including the eastern American toad and the northern water snake, species that hadn’t been seen in significant numbers on the island before.

These findings validate the power of restoration and the importance of sustained funding. Beyond ecological success and enhanced quality of life, the resurgence of these species also offers significant economic benefits.

Increased biodiversity attracts nature enthusiasts, birders, photographers, and eco-tourists, boosting local tourism and creating new opportunities for jobs in recreation, conservation, and environmental education. In this way, restoring wildlife isn’t just good for nature, it’s a smart investment in the region’s economy.

“Sugar Island is the perfect example of how partnership and collaboration between local, state and federal partners can lead to tremendous beneficial impacts for our local community. Friends of the Detroit River prides itself on being the voice of the community and the bridge between our federal partners and local communities.” said Bob Burns, the Detroit Riverkeeper.

So, where do we go from here? Now more than ever, we need to raise our voices in support of our environment and the agencies and programs that protect our natural resources. We must show our elected officials that environmental protection and funding matter to us, to our communities, and to future generations. Call your representatives and let your voice be heard that protecting our backyard is critical to the future of our rivers.

The story of Sugar Island proves what’s possible when we invest in our backyard and work with our federal partners. Let’s make sure we don’t lose that momentum now.

Iran vows payback after US strike on nuclear facilities

Dubai, 23 June (Argus) — Iran said today that US airstrikes on its nuclear facilities have expanded the range of legitimate military targets for its armed forces, intensifying concerns over supply disruptions in a region that underpins global oil trade. Powerful and targeted operations with ""serious consequences"" await the US in response to its direct involvement in strikes on Iranian soil, according to Ebrahim Zolfaqari, spokesperson for Iran's Khatam al-Anbiya central military headquarters. ""Mr. Trump, the gambler, you may start this war, but we will be the ones to end it,"" Zolfaqari said. The US strikes on three heavily fortified nuclear facilities in Iran early on 22 June local time marked a clear shift, with Washington now openly joining Israel's military campaign against Tehran's nuclear programme, which Israel views as an existential threat. Israel and Iran have been trading airstrikes and missiles since 13 June. The US has thousands of troops stationed across the Middle East, including in Bahrain, Qatar, the UAE, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia and Iraq. While Iran has threatened retaliation, it has so far held back from steps often floated by its leadership, such as striking US bases in the region or closing the strait of Hormuz — a vital waterway through which about a quarter of global seaborne oil trade flows. The US bombing and Iran's threats of retaliation caused crude futures to rise sharply in early trading on 23 June , with front-month Ice Brent climbing above $80/bl for the first time in five months, as the US bombing raised fears of wider escalation. But markets later pared gains. The August Ice Brent contract was trading at $76.56/bl as of 08:25 GMT, down by 45¢/bl from its 20 June settlement. Trump warned Iran against retaliating for the strikes and signalled he is open to regime change in Tehran. ""If the current Iranian Regime is unable to MAKE IRAN GREAT AGAIN, why wouldn't there be a Regime change??? MIGA!!!"" he said on Sunday, as Tehran continued to show defiance. He followed up by claiming the strikes had caused ""monumental"" damage to Iran's nuclear sites, adding that the ""biggest damage took place far below ground level. Bullseye!!!"" The full extent of the damage remains unverified. But ""even if nuclear sites are destroyed, game isn't over, enriched materials, indigenous knowledge, political will remain"", said top Iranian military and nuclear adviser, Ali Shamkhani. The UN's nuclear watchdog, the IAEA, said on 22 June that no increases in off-site radiation levels had been reported following the US strikes. Director general Rafael Grossi, in an address to the UN Security Council, confirmed that Fordow — Iran's main facility for enriching uranium to 60pc — was hit. He also said the Esfahan nuclear site and the Natanz enrichment facility were struck again. By Bachar Halabi Send comments and request more information at feedback@argusmedia.com Copyright © 2025.

Pakistan loses EU GSP+ ethanol status

London, 20 June (Argus) — The European Commission today suspended Pakistan's Generalised Scheme of Preferences Plus (GSP+) status for imports of ethanol. The removal is effective from today, 20 June. A request was lodged in May last year by France, Germany, Spain, Italy, Hungary and Poland, who sought to activate Article 30 of the GSP Regulation, arguing that ethanol coming from Pakistan since 2022 has ""caused a serious disturbance to the Union ethanol market"". Under Article 30, the commission can ""adopt an implementing act in order to suspend the preferential arrangement in respect of the products concerned"". Pakistan was granted GSP+ status in 2014, and this expired at the end of 2023. The status was temporarily extended until 2027. The GSP+ grants reduced-tariff or tariff-free access to the EU for vulnerable low- and lower- to middle-income countries that, according to the EU, ""implement 27 international conventions related to human rights, labour rights, protection of the environment and good governance"". It fully removes custom duties on two-thirds of the bloc's tariff lines in Pakistan's case, including ethanol. Pakistan is a major supplier of industrial-grade ethanol to Europe, but it does not export fuel-grade ethanol. According to market participants, this is because production facilities in the country lack sustainability certifications such as the International Sustainability and Carbon Certification (ISCC) that are required for biofuels to qualify under the EU Renewable Energy Directive (RED) targets. Fuel-grade ethanol was not included in the bloc's measures. Several Pakistani market participants were hopeful the GSP+ status will remain in place, which has continued to support ethanol exports from the country to the EU ( see table ). But uncertainty has weighed on demand from Europe recently, suppliers said. A participant told Argus that Pakistani sellers may look to offer more into Africa to soften the drop in demand. Some European suppliers anticipated this outcome, and have already stopped importing from Pakistan. European renewable ethanol association ePure expressed concern about the decision to exclude fuel ethanol from the scope of the measures, noting this could open the door to unintended loopholes and weaken the overall effect of the safeguard efforts.

French Bugey nuclear cuts likely from 25 June: EdF

London, 19 June (Argus) — High temperatures on the River Rhone are ""likely"" to drive production cuts from nuclear plants along the river, especially Bugey, according to French utility EdF. The potential cuts will be reviewed on 24 June, and a specific publication will detail the cuts if they are confirmed, EdF said. France is about to see a combination of a heatwave and dry spell, with daily highs in Grenoble forecast to remain mostly above 30°C until the beginning of July. The combination of heat and a lack of rain in the Alps has increased the chance of hotter water and lower flows on the Rhone, which could have a knock-on effect on France's nuclear fleet. Eight of the country's 57 reactors discharge their cooling water directly into the river, and environmental regulations limit the temperature at which they can do this, meaning if the river's flow is low and temperatures high, the units can be forced to reduce output. Flows out of Lake Geneva — where the Rhone leaves Switzerland and enters France — have remained at 239-328 m³/s since 2 June. Earlier in the month this was within the 25th to 50th percentile of historical values, but is now slightly below the 25th percentile, as flows typically increase in June to peak at the end of the month and into July. The low outflows are reflective of low inflows, as the lake's level is regulated by the Seujet dam at the lake's exit to the Rhone, which keeps its level about 1m all year. The lake's level typically falls in the first quarter and rises in the second to a peak in June and July, and the level has been creeping up over June in line with the historical trend. The outflow's average temperature of 20.9°C on Wednesday was between the 75th and 95th percentile for the date. A convention between France and Switzerland guarantees that the flow of the Rhone upstream of Bugey, the first nuclear plant on the river, is to remain above 150 m³/s, with the potential for release of water from the Emosson reservoir in Switzerland to the Arve River to achieve this. In recent days, flows at Bugey — combining outflows from Lake Geneva and tributaries of the Rhone, which have brought more than 100 m³/s — have been well above this minimum. And thermal limits for Bugey are set at a maximum temperature downstream of the plant of 26°C and a maximum temperature difference between upstream and downstream of 5°C. If grid operator RTE determines that the plant is necessary to maintain supply, this maximum limit can increase to 27°C, but with only a 1°C temperature difference allowed. Only two of Bugey's four units discharge their cooling water directly into the Rhone, with the other two using cooling towers, which sharply reduce their thermal impact on the river, and so the extent to which the regulations affect them. If water flows were at their minimum of 150 m³/s, and at a temperature of 21°C upstream of the plant, this stream would have the capacity to carry 3.14GW of waste heat away from the plant before hitting the regulatory limit of 5°C of temperature difference and 26°C maximum temperature downstream. This is less than the roughly 3.8GW of waste heat generated by Bugey 2 and 3 operating at full power, including their thermal power of 5.6GW less their electrical power of 1.8GW. Bugey 4 and 5 contribute a small amount of extra waste heat downstream, as their cooling towers do not completely eliminate waste heat. Both units have had to stop at moments in the past two years because of heat-related constraints. In the last period when Bugey was constrained, in mid-August, flows leaving Lake Geneva were significantly hotter than now, roughly 24-26°C. At that point, output from Bugey 2 was reduced to zero, before a sharp fall in water temperature to roughly 20°C by 18 August allowed constraints to be lifted. But air temperatures in the region are forecast to remain elevated for the next two weeks, which will boost water temperatures over time. Daily highs in Sion, Switzerland, are seen at 3-4°C above the norm through to the beginning of July. Temperatures and flows at reactors further downstream which do not possess cooling towers — 2.6GW Saint Alban and 3.6GW Tricastin — are affected by other flows on tributaries to the Rhone, which cool the river down and increase its volume after passing Bugey.

,IRA Tax Credits,2025-06-23 16:02:44+00:00,IER,Lazard Releases Its Levelized Cost Report with the Same Misrepresentations,IER,,,,,https://www.instituteforenergyresearch.org/renewable/solar/lazard-releases-its-levelized-cost-report-with-the-same-misrepresentations/,"Lazard Inc. recently released its 18th edition of its Levelized Cost of Energy report which provides the cost of building and operating various generation technologies.
Solar power is not charged for the backup power in the levelized cost calculation.
Onshore wind power is in the same situation as solar power in that when the wind does not blow, backup power is needed.
The EIA, however, finds that in some regions, the levelized cost of solar power is higher than that of natural gas combined cycle when subsidies are removed.
The cost of the backup power, whether it is from a coal or natural gas unit or from an expensive battery, is not considered as part of the levelized cost calculation.","Lazard Inc. recently released its 18th edition of its Levelized Cost of Energy report which provides the cost of building and operating various generation technologies. It finds that utility-scale solar and onshore wind remain the most cost-effective forms of new-build electricity generation on an unsubsidized basis (i.e., without tax subsidies) and indicates that this trend is expected to persist over the next 10 years. One needs to question the result since more wind and solar plants have been built over the last 10 years than any other technology, and yet residential electricity prices have increased 32% over that time period. They increased by 25% during the Biden years alone. This increase occurred because solar and wind are intermittent, weather-driven technologies that must be backed up by traditional technologies or very expensive batteries that get charged when generation exceeds demand. Thus, wind and solar power require duplicative sources for backup, resulting in consumers paying twice.

According to the U.S. Solar Market Insight 2024 Year in Review report, released by the Solar Energy Industries Association and Wood Mackenzie, solar and storage accounted for 84% of all new electric generating capacity added to the grid last year. The United States installed 50 gigawatts of new solar capacity in 2024 — more new capacity than any energy technology in over two decades. Utility-scale solar increased by 33% in 2024 with a record of 41.4 gigawatts of installed capacity. The reader, however, should be aware that solar attains less than a 25% capacity factor, which means that for the same capacity as a natural combined cycle plant, it only produces about a quarter of the energy.

When the sun does not shine, other conventional generators are called to fill in the gap because consumers expect electricity to be supplied when they demand it. Solar power is not charged for the backup power in the levelized cost calculation. Utility customers, however, must pay for that backup power in their electricity bills. Politicians and the public are made to believe that the cost of solar and wind is the most economical of the current slate of generating technologies because the backup charges are not assessed to them.

In Texas, the state with the most renewable energy, the Legislature was considering several bills that “clean energy companies” called “industry killers,” but those bills failed to pass. One of the failed bills, Texas Senate Bill 715, would have required wind and solar facilities to contract with power plants or battery operators capable of supplying backup power when the sun is not shining or the wind is not blowing, which would have helped stabilize power supply and reduce costs that arise from price volatility. Two other bills that would have placed additional fees, regulations, and permitting requirements on renewable energy also failed to pass.

Solar power was able to capture lucrative federal tax credits last year that resulted in those massive additions due to President Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), which was passed solely by Democrats. While the Congressional Budget Office estimated the cost of those subsidies at $369 billion, others have estimated them to cost taxpayers over $1 trillion because the subsidies are essentially uncapped in the IRA. Those credits, however, may be in jeopardy as President Trump’s “big, beautiful bill” is being debated in Congress, and the House version of the bill has effectively killed them.

As a result, solar developers are either delaying or cancelling their projects until the uncertainty is clarified. In Texas, in the past two months, four gigawatts of battery storage systems and 3.5 gigawatts of solar farms were either deemed inactive or canceled, according to a recent analysis of Electric Reliability Council of Texas data. Renewable developers are awaiting the result of Trump’s tariffs, which increased module prices, and the “big, beautiful bill” before entering construction. If Lazard’s levelized cost numbers, indicating that these plants are economic even without subsidies, were the reality, one would think that the developers would continue with their projects.

Onshore wind power is in the same situation as solar power in that when the wind does not blow, backup power is needed. According to the Energy Information Administration (EIA), onshore wind has capacity factors that average less than 35%. Despite their volatility, taxpayers pay for lucrative tax credits given to wind from the IRA, and utility consumers pay for the needed backup power or expensive batteries in their utility bills.

Background

The EIA defines levelized cost as “the present value of the total cost of building and operating a generating plant over its economic life, converted to equal annual payments.” In its model documentation report for the Electric Power Module, the EIA provides the overnight capital cost for natural gas combined cycle as $824 per kilowatt (in 2024 dollars), solar PV’s capital cost as $1379 per kilowatt (67% higher than gas combined cycle), and onshore wind’s capital cost as $1626 per kilowatt (97% higher than gas combined cycle). Even with lower capital cost estimates, both the EIA and Lazard calculate that the levelized cost of natural gas combined cycle is higher than that of wind and solar power when these sources are subsidized by federal tax credits under the IRA. The EIA, however, finds that in some regions, the levelized cost of solar power is higher than that of natural gas combined cycle when subsidies are removed.

The EIA rightly points out that the levelized cost of electricity is limited because it only reflects the cost to build and operate a plant, not the value of the plant to the grid. The EIA uses the avoided cost of electricity, a measure that provides the value of the plant serving the electric grid, to address the issue. The agency finds that the avoided cost of electricity for resource-constrained technologies is generally lower because of their lower contribution to energy, capacity, and spinning reserve in the grid, which is precisely what makes the grid more unstable and caused the blackout in Spain in April.

Conclusion

In its most recent levelized cost calculation, Lazard finds that wind and solar power are the least expensive generating technologies, even on an unsubsidized basis, that is, even when the tax credits in the IRA are not assumed as part of the calculation. That result is questionable for several reasons. First, wind and solar power are intermittent, weather-driven technologies that can only generate electricity when the when is blowing and the sun is shining, which means that other technologies must provide the power to fill any gaps in meeting demand. The cost of the backup power, whether it is from a coal or natural gas unit or from an expensive battery, is not considered as part of the levelized cost calculation. Yet, consumers must pay it, which is one of the reasons that residential electricity prices increased 25% during the Biden administration. Second, if those technologies are economic without subsidies, why are solar developers delaying or canceling projects until Congress finishes debating Trump’s “big, beautiful bill” and Trump’s tariffs are resolved?",https://www.instituteforenergyresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Renewables-.jpg,N,,2025-06-23 12:24:49.352141

Texas, which involved challenges to the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission's (NRC or Commission) decision to grant a license to a privately owned temporary nuclear waste storage facility that is not co-located with nuclear reactors. Specifically, the Court was tasked with determining whether the challengers were allowed to bring a lawsuit under a procedural statute known as the Hobbs Act and, if so, determining whether the NRC has authority to issue such licenses under the Nuclear Waste Policy Act (NWPA) and Atomic Energy Act (AEA). A six-member majority of the Court held that the challengers were not authorized to bring suit under the Hobbs Act and thus did not formally decide the question of the NRC's licensing authority, though it did leave plenty of clues in its decision.

Hobbs Act

The Hobbs Act states that only ""parties aggrieved"" by an NRC proceeding may subsequently challenge the NRC's decision in court. The NRC argued that this language requires challengers to have been admitted as parties to the agency's licensing proceeding. In this case, some of the challengers had attempted to gain admission to the NRC's proceeding but were denied by the NRC, a decision that was upheld on appeal by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. Other challengers had not attempted to gain admission to the NRC proceeding but did submit comments during a public comment period regarding a related National Environmental Policy Act review, and separately wrote to the Commission to express concerns about the project. The challengers argued that any person who is aggrieved by an NRC decision is a ""party"" or, alternatively, that at most a party should only be required to participate in some fashion, including submitting comments or attempting to intervene in the proceeding.

The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, relying on an ultra vires exception to the Hobbs Act, held that any person, regardless of participation in the underlying agency proceeding, may challenge an agency action on the basis that it exceeds the agency's statutory authority or is unconstitutional. This holding split with four other U.S. Courts of Appeal, including a Tenth Circuit opinion regarding the same waste storage licensing proceeding. With split decisions in the various circuit courts, the case came before the Supreme Court for review.

In its ruling, the majority of the Supreme Court held that each of the arguments raised in support of the challengers failed. First, the Court compared the phrase ""party aggrieved"" in the Hobbs Act to the similar phrase ""person … aggrieved"" used in the Administrative Procedure Act, which was passed four years before the Hobbs Act. The Court concluded that Congress must have had different standards in mind when deciding to use different language and so ""party"" must be more specific than ""person"" in this instance. The Court further looked to the AEA, which says that when a ""person"" is affected by the proceeding and meets the criteria for admission, the Commission ""shall admit any such person as a party to such proceeding"", further demonstrating the disparate meanings of the words ""person"" and ""party.""

Next, the Court held that attempts by the challengers to assert that they qualified for intervention and should have been admitted as parties amounted to an impermissible collateral attack on the Commission's decision to deny intervention and the D.C. Circuit's opinion upholding that decision. The Court noted that the challengers did not appeal that D.C. Circuit decision to the Supreme Court and left open the question of whether it would have agreed that the NRC lacks authority to deny participation in the underlying licensing proceeding.

Lastly, the Court overruled the Fifth Circuit's ultra vires exception for two reasons. First, applicable Supreme Court precedent states that ultra vires exceptions are not available for a mere allegation that an agency action is extra-statutory, but instead the agency action must be ""entirely in excess of its delegated powers and contrary to a specific prohibition in a statute."" The Court found the NRC's action did not rise to that level. Second, the Court held that ultra vires exceptions are unavailable when parties have another meaningful path to judicial review, in this case pointing to the ability to appeal their denials of interventions.

Because the Court found that all of the challengers' Hobbs Act arguments failed, it held that the challengers were ineligible to bring the lawsuit and thus it did not need to reach the merits of the NRC's waste facility licensing authority.

NRC Nuclear Waste Licensing Authority

Although the merits of the challenge were expressly left undecided in NRC v. Texas, both the majority and dissent left plenty of clues about how a decision might play out if the issue is raised in a future case.

The dissent argued that the text of the NWPA should be the beginning and end of the analysis. The NWPA expressly authorizes two locations for interim storage: at reactor sites and on federal property. The NWPA further states that ""nothing in [the NWPA] shall be construed to encourage [or] authorize"" storage at any ""facility located away from the site of any civilian nuclear power reactor and not owned by the Federal Government."" Further, the dissent reasoned that the AEA's grant of licensing authority for source, byproduct and special nuclear materials – the components of nuclear waste – is superseded in this instance by the more specific term for waste, ""spent nuclear fuel."" According to the dissent, special nuclear material is handled by the more specific provisions of the NWPA and, following passage of the NWPA, was incorporated into the AEA and used as a separate term, distinct from its underlying components. The dissent further argued that the NRC's authority to license specific uses of source, byproduct and special nuclear material does not extend to storage and that a catchall for ""appropriate"" uses must be interpreted in light of the enumerated allowable uses, which are not similar to storage. Lastly, the dissent determined that the fact that the NRC promulgated interim storage regulations under the AEA prior to passage of the NWPA is not evidence that those regulations remain valid following the NWPA's passage.

Despite going out of its way to say that it does not decide the merits issue, the majority nonetheless devoted more than four pages of its opinion to explaining why the merits question does not weigh so clearly against the NRC's authority. First, the majority pointed to a 1983 Supreme Court decision – one year after passage of the NWPA – that relied on the conclusion that the NRC regulates spent fuel storage under the AEA as a basis for concluding that nuclear waste disposal is a regulatory field occupied by federal law.

Further, the majority recited the history of the NRC's licensing of private, temporary away-from-reactor storage facilities beginning in 1971, prior to the 1980 regulations specifically asserting authority under the AEA, and continuing beyond 1980. As the majority pointed out, due mostly to the dismantling of former reactors at sites that still hold waste from those reactors, there are currently about 10 privately owned storage sites not co-located with reactors.

Contrary to the dissent's view that the 1982 NWPA superseded the 1980 regulations, the majority asserted that Congress was aware of and did not intend to disturb the 1980 regulations with passage of the NWPA. The majority further asserted that under the dissent's reading, the logical (and absurd) conclusion is not that the NRC cannot license storage facilities and, therefore, they cannot be built, but rather that the NRC cannot license storage facilities and, therefore, they do not require a license in order to be built.

Given the above, it is a reasonable conclusion that if the current iteration of the Supreme Court were presented with the merits question, then the result may be a 6-3 decision in favor of the NRC maintaining licensing authority over private, temporary, away-from-reactor storage facilities. However, the majority made clear that it was not deciding the issue and that its arguments merely demonstrate that by deciding on the Hobbs Act question, it is ""not somehow assuming or buying into a premise that the Commission is wrong on the underlying merits."" For that reason, it is similarly reasonable to believe that at least some members of the majority have not yet made up their minds on the merits and simply wanted to ensure there was no implication drawn about their views on the merits by virtue of deciding the case on procedure. Substantial uncertainty remains unless and until the merits issue is decided.

Implications

The decision on the Hobbs Act question reaffirms Congress' intent that challengers must fully litigate their claims in front of the NRC before seeking judicial relief. Though contested NRC licensing proceedings add significant time and expense to the licensing process for applicants, giving the agency an opportunity to address challenges before license issuance results in robustly supported licenses that are more likely to withstand judicial review. In addition, the contested hearing process acts as a barrier to entry that prevents potential challengers from engaging in only token participation at the agency level and then skipping straight to court in an attempt to further delay nuclear projects after license issuance. The Court did not decide the related question of whether the NRC has authority to prevent affected parties from intervening in licensing proceedings to begin with. The possibility thus remains that a future challenger will be able to secure a Supreme Court decision that severely limits the NRC's ability to prevent challengers from meeting the prerequisite of participating fully at the agency level.

Although courts typically do not decide merits questions when the case has already been disposed of on procedural grounds, failure to reach the merits question in this case creates new regulatory uncertainty where none had existed for decades before this case was initiated. As the nuclear energy industry seeks to expand – sometimes to new types of sites with less available space – and as older reactors continue with the decommissioning process, availability of reliable off-site waste storage is critical. Absent new action from Congress or action by the executive branch to complete its statutorily mandated duty to provide a permanent repository, the NRC's authority under the AEA remains the only available avenue for such storage. In this case, a three-justice dissent made clear that it does not believe the NRC has authority to act in this arena. Although a six-justice majority provided a detailed analysis in support of the NRC's authority, it made clear that its analysis was merely intended to rebut any possible implication that its decision on procedure could be viewed as direct support of the dissent's view on the merits. Significant uncertainty will remain until the Court is presented with an opportunity to decide the merits or Congress takes action.

If the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission approves both the gas plant and this agreement, Duke Energy Indiana will perform an engineering study to evaluate whether someone else could keep running the existing coal units at the Cayuga site. If that looks doable, Duke will ask other companies if they’re interested in buying those coal units. The coal units could be sold after the new gas units start operating in 2029 and 2030.

The settlement is aligned with Indiana Governor Mike Braun’s recent executive orders aimed at making sure there’s a careful evaluation before retiring coal units, said Duke Energy Indiana President Stan Pinegar.

A condition of the settlement is that this process will not affect the construction schedule, estimated cost or future operation of the new gas units.

We reported last October that Duke proposed retiring Cayuga coal-fired units 1 and 2 by 2030 and 2031, respectively. Two 1×1 natural gas combined-cycle (NGCC) units would be added at the site, replacing the retiring coal and adding 440 MW of incremental capacity by 2031.

It’s part of a larger proposal where Duke Energy Indiana would continue burning coal through 2038.

According to its IRP, the company’s Gibson Units 1 and 2 would be converted to enable co-firing natural gas with coal, allowing them to continue to operate through 2038. The plant was previously expected to retire three years earlier. Under the plan, Duke Energy would retire Gibson Units 3 and 4, replacing them with a 2×1 NGCC plant by 2032. Gibson 5 is listed as being retired by 2030.

Finally, the company’s Edwardsport plant would be converted to operate on 100% natural gas by 2030. Renewables and energy storage would also be added in the late 2020s, according to the plan.",https://www.power-eng.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/image-24.jpg,N,,2025-06-23 13:19:37.885763

“Green Marine brings together hundreds of global members from different backgrounds that all share the same objectives,” said Ryan. “They all want to improve their own organization’s environmental performance through measurable action and transparent reporting, which in turn contributes to the efforts of the entire maritime industry. Green Marine helps by providing a roadmap and access to experts who can help create and assess strategies that lead to successful certification.”

The Green Marine program targets key environmental issues related to biodiversity protection, air/water/soil quality, and community relations, and how those areas can be improved by various participants, including ship owners, ports, terminals, shipyards. In addition, Green Marine welcomes supporters (environmental groups, scientific institutions, and government agencies), associations, and partners to its membership ranks. To obtain Green Marine certification, participants benchmark their environmental performance on a 1-to-5 scale using indicators reviewed annually in the spirit of continual improvement at the heart of the certification program.

The Port of Albany continues to be a key regional economic driver with an annual impact of more than $428 million and approximately 1,400 local jobs (and more than $813 million and 4,500 jobs throughout the state).",https://www.ajot.com/favicon.ico,N,,2025-06-23 14:20:13.263160

The automaker deployed a small fleet of self-driving taxis in Austin, Texas, on Sunday, marking the first time its cars have carried paying passengers without human drivers. The rides were being offered for a flat fee of $4.20 in a limited zone.

The trial’s success is crucial for Tesla as Musk has pivoted the company to self-driving cars and robots, shelving plans for mass-market dominance in the EV space as Chinese competition heats up and demand slows for its aging line-up of models.

“It was a comfortable, safe, and personalized experience,” said Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives, who took multiple robotaxi rides on Sunday and has long been a Tesla bull.

“There was a moment where we drove up a narrow road going up a hill with cars parked on both sides with oncoming traffic and people opening their car doors into the road and the robotaxi masterfully maneuvered with patience and safety.”

Many social-media influencers also posted videos of their first rides on X, showing the cars navigating busy city streets by slowing down and making room for incoming traffic.

Still, the tightly controlled trial – with about 10 vehicles and front-seat riders acting as “safety monitors” – is just the first step in what could be a years-long process of scaling up the service, according to some industry experts.

Tesla, as well as rivals including Google-backed Waymo, have faced federal investigations and recalls following collisions.

Industry experts have questioned the efficacy of Tesla’s self-driving technology that depends mostly on cameras and AI, without redundant sensors such as lidar and radar, claiming fog, heavy rain and glaring sunlight can hamper safety.

The company will also have to navigate a new Texas law taking effect September 1 that requires a state permit for self-driving vehicles and reflects bipartisan calls for a cautious roll-out.

The unit will supply oxygen and nitrogen essential to low-carbon ammonia production at Blue Point Number One, a joint venture between CF Industries, JERA and Mitsui & Co.

Linde’s new project is expected to create 15 direct new jobs at the Ascension Parish facility with an average annual salary more than 45% above the parish average wage, while also retaining over 100 current positions across the state. Louisiana Economic Development estimates the project will also result in 50 indirect new jobs, for a total of 65 potential new jobs in the region. The facility is anticipated to begin construction in 2026 and start up in 2029.

“This project is another application of Linde’s world-scale air separation technology and we are honored to contribute to Blue Point’s vision for a low carbon ammonia supply chain,” Linde Executive Vice President North America Sean Durbin said. “We appreciate the support from Louisiana Economic Development, which enables us to strengthen our industrial gas infrastructure and increase U.S. manufacturing capacity.”

“This announcement is yet another win for the West Bank as we build out the industrial base and bring high-wage job opportunities to the area,” Louisiana Economic Development Secretary Susan B. Bourgeois said. “For more than half a century, Linde has helped make Louisiana a global energy leader. Their latest investment reflects our shared commitment to optimizing our legacy sectors while driving our entire business ecosystem toward growth, innovation and global impact.”

The ASU will enable Linde to supply both nitrogen and oxygen for the production of low-carbon ammonia at the Blue Point Number One complex — a $4 billion world-scale facility currently under development and projected to become the world’s largest low-carbon ammonia plant upon completion.

This project marks a major milestone in the ongoing development of the RiverPlex MegaPark. The addition of Linde’s advanced ASU alongside Blue Point Number One and Hyundai’s nearly $6 billion steel mill signals growing momentum for the 17,000-acre site, reinforcing Louisiana’s position as a hub for next-generation energy and manufacturing investments.

“Industrial growth like this doesn’t happen by accident. It’s the result of smart planning, long-term vision, and people working together to create opportunity where it’s needed most,” Ascension Economic Development Corp President and CEO Kate MacArthur said. “We are looking forward to Linde’s new location in west Ascension and appreciate their continued investment in our parish.”

MARCELLUS/UTICA REGION

PJM issues alert requiring all electric generators to operate at maximum output

PA Environment Digest Blog/David Hess

On June 22, 2025, PJM Interconnection, the regional electric grid operator serving 13 states and Washington, D.C., issued a Maximum Generation Alert for June 23 due to a forecasted peak electricity demand of 154,000 MW driven by an intense heat wave with temperatures exceeding 90 degrees. This alert requires all generators to operate at maximum output and is accompanied by a NERC EEA-1 alert, indicating all resources are committed to meet demand and reserve requirements. No customer action is required at this time, as PJM anticipates sufficient reserves. The alert follows a Hot Weather Alert for June 22–25, prompted by expected high humidity and temperatures. PJM’s actions include recalling generators from maintenance to ensure reliability. This comes amid concerns about rising electricity costs and grid reliability, with governors criticizing PJM’s capacity auction rules and slow integration of renewable energy sources. [MDN: Lots of natural gas will get burned today, tommorow, and Wednesday in order to keep the lights on in the PJM region. It will all come from the Marcellus/Utica. Thank God for the miracle of shale gas!]

Manchin said ‘we cannot get back into another war’

Hart Energy

Retired U.S. Senator Joe Manchin, speaking at the Independent Petroleum Association of America’s annual meeting on June 19, urged the U.S. to let Israel handle Iran’s nuclear capabilities and terrorism, emphasizing that America cannot afford another war due to its $36 trillion debt. Manchin, a former Democrat turned Independent, praised Israel’s advanced and lethal military, suggesting U.S. support should be limited to technical aid, air support, and bombs. He highlighted Iran’s role as a major terrorism supporter and its nuclear enrichment potential. Manchin, who represented West Virginia until January 2025, also noted Israel’s recent strikes on Iranian targets, which boosted oil prices. He referenced past U.S. wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, unpaid and costly, and recalled a general’s warning that financial troubles, not foreign militaries, pose the greatest threat to the U.S. Manchin remains politically active, aiming to mobilize moderate voters. [MDN: We’re not in another war. We dropped bombs. In this case Manchin is right. We shouldn’t get into a war with Iran, and our debt threatens to topple the country. Too bad Manchin sold his vote on the misnamed Inflation Reduction Act and did more harm to this country and anything else in the last four years. Shame on the IPAA for paying him big bucks to speak. He’s a political pariah.]

NATIONAL

Climate lawsuits are weakening America and strengthening China

Forbes/Dan Eberhart

In his Forbes article, Dan Eberhart argues that climate lawsuits, supported by U.S. nonprofits, are undermining American energy security while bolstering China’s strategic position. He highlights a Senate hearing led by Ted Cruz examining how these lawsuits, often funded by groups like Energy Foundation China, align with Chinese interests by weakening U.S. energy production. Eberhart cites a State Armor report showing China’s dominance in clean energy supply chains, like lithium and solar panels, which benefits from U.S. policies pushing premature fossil fuel reduction. He warns that such litigation increases U.S. reliance on Chinese-controlled technologies, posing a national security risk. Eberhart calls for greater transparency in nonprofit funding and stronger domestic energy production to counter foreign influence, emphasizing that these lawsuits, driven by plaintiff firms like Sher Edling, threaten U.S. energy dominance and economic stability while advancing China’s global energy and manufacturing agenda. [MDN: It’s time to sue Sher Edling out of existence. Eberhart is 100% correct. Many of these lawfare lawsuits are funded by China-backed sources. Trump needs to sick the IRS on these so-called green groups with an eye on revoking tax-exempt status if they are violating the law to stay out of politics.]

Interior releases major update on oil and gas potential beneath U.S. public lands

U.S. Department of Interior

The U.S. Department of the Interior released a U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) report estimating 29.4 billion barrels of undiscovered, technically recoverable oil and 391.6 trillion cubic feet of natural gas beneath federally managed public lands, enough to meet U.S. oil needs for 4 years and gas needs for nearly 12 years at current consumption rates. This significant increase from the 1998 USGS estimates (7.86 billion barrels of oil and 201.1 trillion cubic feet of gas) reflects advancements in unconventional resource extraction, like shale and tight oil/gas, enabled by fracking, which were not fully assessed previously. The report, covering lands managed by multiple federal agencies, compiles data from 579 assessment units across 69 geologic provinces, allocating resources based on public land proportions. Secretary Doug Burgum emphasized the report’s role in supporting energy security and economic opportunities, while USGS acting director Sarah Ryker highlighted its utility for land management and energy planning. [MDN: Our country is blessed with abundant, cheap, safe fossil energy. More than we thought.]

INTERNATIONAL

World braces for Iran response to US strikes

Bloomberg/Ramsey Al-Rikabi

The U.S. launched unprecedented airstrikes on Iran’s nuclear sites at Fordow, Natanz, and Isfahan, using bunker-busting bombs for the first time, escalating tensions in the Middle East following Israel’s surprise attack on June 13. President Trump’s direct military action, involving 125 aircraft and Tomahawk missiles, has raised global geopolitical risks, pushing oil prices up nearly 6% and potentially toward $100 a barrel, while stock futures fell and Bitcoin dropped below $100,000. Iran warned of retaliation, with its armed forces deciding the response’s scale, possibly targeting U.S. regional bases. Trump vowed a forceful counter to any Iranian retaliation, though regime change was not the stated goal. The strikes’ impact on Iran’s nuclear capabilities remains unclear, and fears of disruptions in the Strait of Hormuz threaten global energy markets. Amid global economic fragility, allies like the UK and France distanced themselves, while Iran’s allies, Russia and China, offered only rhetorical support. [MDN: Notice how Bloomberg lefties are pushing to see the price of oil go to $100 per barrel? It’s nonsense. What will Iran do? If they try anything, they will be sorry. The response will be swift and lethal. They have no options. Trump did the right thing. Iran can’t have a nuke, period.]

Iran’s parliament backs blocking Strait of Hormuz

CNBC

Iran’s parliament has approved a measure to potentially close the Strait of Hormuz, a critical global oil transit chokepoint, in response to U.S. airstrikes on Iranian nuclear sites, though the final decision rests with the Supreme National Security Council. The strait, connecting the Persian Gulf to the open ocean, handles about 20% of the world’s oil supply, and its closure could spike global energy prices, with Goldman Sachs predicting Brent crude could hit $110 per barrel. Experts like Vandana Hari from Vanda Insights argue the move is unlikely, as it would alienate Iran’s neighbors and key trade partner China, which relies heavily on Gulf oil. U.S. officials, including Secretary of State Marco Rubio, have urged Beijing to dissuade Tehran, warning that closing the strait would be “economic suicide” for Iran, disrupting its own oil exports. No immediate threats to shipping have been reported, but the risk of escalation remains. [MDN: Also in this story…”Besides oil, natural gas flows could also be ‘severely impacted,’…with Qatar’s gas exports of about 77 million metric tons per year potentially unable to reach key markets in Asia and Europe. Qatar’s LNG exports represent about 20% of global LNG supply.” So yeah, go right ahead, Iran. Close down the Strait of Hormuz and shoot yourselves in the head! We’re all for it.]

U.S. radical groups urge EU commissioners to reject Trump’s pressure to purchase LNG

Oil Change International

On June 23, 2025, 188 so-called U.S. environmental groups and allies sent a letter to EU Commissioners, urging them to resist President Donald Trump’s pressure to increase EU reliance on U.S. LNG and fossil fuel imports, valued at USD 350 billion, to avoid tariffs. Supported by a petition with over 50,000 signatures, the letter argues that replacing Russian gas with U.S. LNG would raise EU household energy prices, worsen health and safety risks for communities near LNG infrastructure, expose the EU to U.S. market volatility, and undermine EU climate commitments. Community leaders like Roishetta Ozane and James Hiatt from Louisiana emphasized the toxic pollution and health crises caused by LNG facilities, while Laurie van der Burg from Oil Change International advocated for a transition to renewables to ensure energy security and economic resilience, aligning with global climate goals. [MDN: This is why nobody is listening to groups like Oil Change International. They are radicals. They are kooks. They are so far outside the mainstream that nobody wants to be affiliated with them.

Finance, Rivian Chief Software Engineer Wassym Bensaid revealed that the EV startup will be providing the underlying tech stack for all future EVs from the Volkswagen Group. The partnership between the two companies was first announced last year, when the German auto conglomerate agreed to invest $5 billion into their much smaller American friend in exchange for its software and electrics knowhow. That eventually lead to the two creating a joint venture together to allow the free flow of intellectual property while keeping the actual brands separate.

Bensaid said that Rivian's upcoming R2 SUV would be the technological foundation for the VW Group's future offerings ""in a way where we will still allow each of the brands to express their own identity."" In other words, Audi's future tech platform might be different from Bentley's or Lamborghini's, but they would all be building off of the same electric guts as the R2.

This is probably welcome news for the German giant, as the woes of their own internal tech division, Cariad, have lead to delays from Porsche and Audi. That has in turn lead to layoffs in the division itself. Basically, Volkswagen and its brands have decades of mechanical engineering experience, but comparatively little in software engineering. And it turns out their electrical engineers are in for a bit of a wake up call as well.

Obviously, it would be nice to get a car with a fast and bug-free infotainment system. But Rivian is offering quite a bit more than a refreshed touchscreen UI. Starting with the 2025 models of the R1T and R1S, the American startup switched to a zonal architecture for its electrics, which allowed it to remove a truly jaw-dropping 1.6 miles of wires from every single car (which in turn saved it 44 pounds in weight).

First developed by Tesla, zonal architecture essentially switches the electrical design of the car from being super centralized, with every electric part reporting back to a central processor, to a decentralized one with regional hubs (zones) that the electrics in that area report to (which then themselves report back to the central hub). That makes for a vastly more efficient management of car performance, reducing the total ECUs needed from 17 to seven. This revolution in electrical engineering is sometimes called software-designed vehicles (SDV), since the physical wiring is only engineered after the software team figures out what would be the best way to run the car.

For all its carmaking prowess, this newfangled method of electrical engineering is not something VW knows how to do right now. Little Rivian, more tech-focused and starting essentially from scratch, was able to pivot their entire production to zonal architecture. What Rivian didn't have was, of course, money, since it still can't make any. So selling their tech stack IP to VW for $5 billion was a pretty good move for both parties.",https://www.jalopnik.com/img/gallery/rivian-will-literally-be-the-brains-behind-volkswagen-groups-future-evs/l-intro-1750683563.jpg,N,,2025-06-23 15:49:47.310758

Your food and drink orders in Virginia may start to look a little different.

Starting July 1, large food vendors across the state will no longer be allowed to use single-use expanded polystyrene, a plastic foam material commonly referred to by the brand name Styrofoam. That includes plates, cups, bowls, trays and hinged containers.

State lawmakers passed the ban four years ago, following the lead of others such as Maryland, New York and Washington, D.C. Implementation was delayed. Gov. Glenn Youngkin tried unsuccessfully to push it further through a proposed budget amendment earlier this year.

For now, it only covers food vendors with 20 or more locations in Virginia, including restaurants, grocery stores, food trucks and caterers.

The law also applies to schools and community groups that use food programs such as the National School Lunch Program.

Next July, the ban will expand to all food vendors in Virginia.

Advocates say Styrofoam, though cheap to purchase, is harmful to the environment and contributes to global plastic pollution.

The material breaks apart easily, allowing bits to get loose and become litter. It also takes hundreds, or even thousands, of years to decompose and can leach toxic chemicals.

State officials launched a “Foam Free Virginia” campaign in line with the legislation.

The Virginia Department of Environmental Quality recommends using reusable containers, paper products, recyclable plastic, foil or metal instead of polystyrene.

Food vendors are allowed to request a one-year exemption from their local government, demonstrating that they have no reasonable alternative and compliance would “cause significant economic hardship.”

People who violate the new law could face civil penalties of up to $50 per day, which would go into the state’s Litter Control and Recycling Fund or to the locality.

DEQ says people who want to file a complaint about ban violations should reach out to the locality where the food vendor is operating.",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/s3/files/styles/social_large/s3/articles/feeds-state-98/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/styrofoam-1024x7001750686557.jpg?h=2ffd00db&itok=7JxyEftq,N,,2025-06-23 13:19:41.272050

The country wants its clean energy future to be ‘built in Britain’ and will invest £700 million to achieve this goal. The new investment will be distributed through its publicly-owned power company Great British Energy to help build manufacturing facilities for key energy transition components, such as floating offshore platforms, electric cables, and hydrogen infrastructure.

This builds on Great British Energy’s initial £300 million investment in offshore wind supply chains, which was announced last week and helped catalyse a further £700 million from industry and The Crown Estate.

Great British Energy Chief Executive Dan McGrail said: “Great British Energy will help the UK win the global race for clean energy jobs and growth by investing in homegrown supply chains and ensuring key infrastructure parts are made here in Britain. We are working closely with businesses across the clean energy sector to invest in areas of strategic need and will get funding out as fast as possible to get new projects off the ground.”

Doubling funding for domestic clean energy

This new investment brings total public and private funding in clean energy supply chains to £1.7 billion, supporting the UK’s target to decarbonise its energy system by 2030. Other public funding sources will include, the National Wealth Fund with a total £27.8 billion in capital, and the British Business Bank with £25.6 billion in total financial capacity, including £4 billion in additional scale-up and start up support.

Now, the UK government aims to at least double current investment levels in clean energy industries to over £30 billion per year by 2035, targeting not just onshore and offshore wind projects, but also nuclear fission, fusion energy, carbon capture, utilisation and storage (CCUS), hydrogen, heat pumps and electricity networks.

As part of the Clean Energy Industries Sector Plan announced today, the UK has also appointed Lucy Yu, CEO and founder of the Centre for Net Zero, as the government’s Clean Energy AI Champion to help drive the adoption of AI across the UK’s clean energy sector.

Clean Industry Bonus scheme

In addition, the government is considering expanding its Clean Industry Bonus scheme, which offers financial rewards to offshore wind developers that invest in local supply chains, to other industries such as hydrogen and onshore wind.

The plan was developed with industry, trade unions, and workers across all regions of the country, and aims to “unleash the tidal wave of jobs and investment that clean energy can bring” to the UK.

Energy Secretary Ed Miliband said: “This government is doubling down on Britain’s clean power strengths as we build this new era of clean energy abundance, helping deliver good jobs, energy security and lower household bills.

Advanced nuclear energy technology has come a long way.
Nuclear power is clean, has a relatively small land footprint and is a longer-term solution than wind or solar power.
Nuclear energy not only ensures grid stability as demand rises, but it does so in a way that is environmentally responsible.
Advanced nuclear is the only 24/7 zero-emission technology ready today that can deliver on that promise.","Governor Kathy Hochul today directed the New York Power Authority (NYPA) to develop and construct a zero-emission advanced nuclear power plant in Upstate New York to support a reliable and affordable electric grid, while providing the necessary zero-emission electricity to achieve a clean energy economy. This builds on other opportunities announced in Governor Hochul’s 2025 State of the State to catalyze nuclear energy development in New York.

“As New York State electrifies its economy, deactivates aging fossil fuel power generation and continues to attract large manufacturers that create good-paying jobs, we must embrace an energy policy of abundance that centers on energy independence and supply chain security to ensure New York controls its energy future,” Governor Hochul said. “This is the second time during my administration that I am calling on the New York Power Authority to lead a critical energy initiative, and just as it is doing with the expedited buildout of renewable energy and transmission, it will now safely and rapidly deploy clean, reliable nuclear power for the benefit of all New Yorkers.”

As a result of economic growth and fossil fuel power plant retirements, New York needs new, clean electricity resources to meet growing power demand from new industrial development, building electrification and electric vehicles. The advanced nuclear plant will complement New York’s ongoing deployment of renewable energy by adding zero-emission baseload power, providing reliable and affordable clean energy to advance the State’s goal to achieve a clean energy economy.

NYPA, in coordination with the Department of Public Service (DPS), will seek to develop at least one new nuclear energy facility with a combined capacity of no less than one gigawatt of electricity, either alone or in partnership with private entities, to support the state's electric grid and the people and businesses that rely on it.

NYPA will immediately begin evaluation of technologies, business models, and locations for this first nuclear power plant and will secure the key partnerships needed for the project. This process will include site and technology feasibility assessments as well as consideration of financing options, in coordination with the forthcoming studies included in the master plan for Responsible Advanced Nuclear Development in New York, led by the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority (NYSERDA) and DPS. Candidate locations will be assessed for suitability based on public safety, strength of community support, compatibility with existing infrastructure, as well as skilled labor and land availability.

This initiative also builds on the State’s ongoing financial support to Constellation to pursue an early site permitting process for a new project at its Nine Mile Point Clean Energy Center and will allow for future collaboration with other states and Ontario, building on regional momentum to strengthen nuclear supply chains, share best practices, and support the responsible deployment of advanced nuclear technologies.

New York Power Authority President and CEO Justin E. Driscoll said, “Time and time again, the Power Authority has been called upon by New York State leadership to take bold action and we have delivered outcomes to support the public good. I am honored by Governor Hochul’s confidence in NYPA to lead the buildout of the affordable and reliable clean energy economy of the future and we are eager to deliver on this impactful nuclear initiative for New Yorkers.”

Working together, we will develop a project-based plan and identify the substantial potential that nuclear power can provide to New Yorkers to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, provide grid reliability, and support and complement other innovative energy generation and storage technologies–all in a cost-effective manner.”

New York State Energy Research and Development Authority President and CEO Doreen M. Harris said, “The use of advanced nuclear technology can provide the State with a greater diversity of its energy resources that will support New York’s goal of a growing economy with a reliable, zero-emission electricity system. As NYSERDA advances the state’s Master Plan process, we look forward to collaborating with NYPA and DPS to undertake this advanced nuclear project and how it will help deliver reliable, affordable energy to our grid, while stimulating jobs and economic development.”

New York State AFL-CIO President Mario Cilento said, “New York’s clean energy future depends on reviving and expanding nuclear power. Without it, emissions are rising, and grid reliability is at risk. We support Governor Hochul’s vision of investing in nuclear energy to stabilize our power system and meet our climate goals while creating good-paying, family-sustaining, union careers to build a stronger, greener economy for all New Yorkers.”

New York State Building Trades President Gary LaBarbera said, “The development of nuclear plants is a proven method for not only lowering emissions and generating reliable energy, but also creating thousands of family-sustaining, union careers that pump economic stimulus into local communities. The expansion of our nuclear capabilities has long been a missing piece of New York's pursuit of our climate goals and the construction of a new power plant will be crucial to the success of our green economy. We applaud Governor Hochul and the New York Power Authority for recognizing this need and laying the foundation necessary to set this new development in motion. The addition of this location to our fleet of nuclear plants will enhance the livelihoods of countless New Yorkers by limiting harmful pollutants, cutting energy costs, and bolstering the middle class in our local communities.""

Utility Workers Union of America (UWUA) President James Slevin said, “We’re glad the state recognizes the need for growing grid capacity and understands that nuclear is the right choice. This zero-emission energy source will deliver grid stability and help meet the needs of businesses and consumers as demands on the power grid continue to add up. Advanced nuclear energy technology has come a long way. It is without a doubt the right choice to power New York’s future in a way that will create family and community-supporting union jobs and benefit the economy.”

Laborers' International Union of North America Vice President & New England Regional Manager Donato A. Bianco, Jr. said, “Governor Hochul is right to recognize that nuclear energy must play a central role in New York’s energy future. If we’re serious about meeting our climate goals and sustaining the thousands of good-paying, union careers that come with green infrastructure, new nuclear development is essential. The Governor’s announcement is a strong step forward that reaffirms New York’s climate leadership while creating long-term career opportunities for New York’s skilled tradesmen and tradeswomen.

Advanced nuclear is the only 24/7 zero-emission technology ready today that can deliver on that promise. We applaud Governor Hochul for taking national leadership in making safe, advanced nuclear power a reality for our future.”

Clean Air Task Force Senior Northeast Policy Manager John Carlson said, “Nuclear energy is an essential strategic asset in the face of a rapidly electrifying economy and mounting threats from climate change. Every successful scaling of nuclear resources began with a strong state-led procurement or sponsorship, just as we witnessed with the rapid scaling of renewables. Putting NYPA at the front of this task follows a proven playbook to quickly build scale and learning, bring costs down, and enable us to deploy this important clean technology faster.”

Cornell Professor and Senior Faculty Fellow at Cornell Atkinson Center for Sustainability Lindsay Anderson said, “Meeting the ambitious decarbonization goals of New York’s Climate Leadership and Community Protection Act (CLCPA) will require not only maximizing renewable energy, but also ensuring a stable supply of clean, dispatchable electricity. This is especially critical as the state prepares for a surge in electricity demand driven by the rapid growth of data centers and high-tech manufacturing. A 1 GW advanced nuclear power plant in New York would be a strategic investment—bolstering grid reliability, supporting economic development, and helping to turn the CLCPA’s vision into a resilient and achievable reality.”",https://www.governor.ny.gov/profiles/contrib/nygov/themes/custom/nygov-theme/nygov_theme/favicon.ico,N,,2025-06-23 12:22:15.285258

Postal Service to scrap thousands of electric vehicles and charging equipment in a massive tax and budget bill, the Senate parliamentarian said late on Sunday.

The U.S. Postal Service currently has 7,200 electric vehicles, made up of Ford e-Transit vehicles and specially built Next Generation Delivery Vehicles built by Oshkosh Defense .

USPS warned on June 13 that scrapping the electric vehicles would cost it $1.5 billion, including $1 billion to replace its current fleet of EVs and $500 million in EV infrastructure rendered useless and ""seriously cripple our ability to

replace an aging and obsolete delivery fleet.""

Senate parliamentarian Elizabeth MacDonough, whose role is to ensure lawmakers follow proper legislative procedure, said a provision to force the sale could not be approved via a simple majority vote in the Republican-controlled chamber and will instead need a 60-vote supermajority, according to Democrats on the Senate Budget Committee.

She ruled last week that Republicans cannot use the bill to overturn landmark rules to drastically reduce vehicle emissions and boost EV sales.

Senate Republicans have also sought to reclaim more than $1 billion out of $3 billion Congress gave USPS in 2023

as part of a $430 billion climate bill to buy EVs and charging infrastructure - including $1.2 billion for electric vehicles.

USPS told Congress ""summarily removing all electric vehicles and charging infrastructure would hobble our ability to deliver to the American people, it would directly harm our ability to serve your constituents, and it would waste crucial funds for no reasonable purpose.""

Replacing the current 7,200 electric vehicles would directly cost the Postal Service at least $450 million and USPS has also spent $540 million on electrical infrastructure upgrades ""which is literally buried under parking lots, and there is no market for used charging equipment,"" the company added.

USPS would also face significant costs from Oshkosh for halting EV purchases under its contract. USPS said in December that purchases in 2025 would be around ""50-50"" EVs and gas-powered.

USPS plans to buy some 66,000 electric vehicles by 2028.

Senate Republicans argued scrapping EVs would ""focus USPS on delivering mail and not achieving the environmental aims pushed by the Biden administration.""

In March, the White House forced out Postmaster General Louis DeJoy, who led efforts to restructure the money-losing U.S. Postal Service for nearly five years. USPS has lost more than $100 billion since 2007.

David Steiner, a FedEx board member and former CEO of Waste Management, has been named as incoming postmaster general.

All were part of the conversation at the Gary Solar Energy Planning Conference for the opening of a 2-day information session (June 11-12) hosted by the City of Gary and FAITH CDC.

Both are recipients of grants, with a combined total of $34 million, from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s Solar for All Fund. Providing them with technical assistance in the early stages of deploying their projects is a team from the National Renewable Energy Lab, an agency within the U.S. Department of Energy.

FAITH CDC, the community development arm of Progressive Community Church, has proposed that it and the city acquire 2-3 abandoned school properties; and build solar farms, which could provide backup power to critical buildings in case of a natural disaster or power outage.

A solar farm at the Emerson school site would provide backup electrical power to 5 priority buildings –city hall, fire and police headquarters, Methodist Hospital, and the Hudson Campbell Fitness Center.

The solar grants are structured for 5 years. This first year, the projects are undergoing feasibility studies. In order to get funding for the next year, project milestones have to be met.

“Just because you have a really interesting idea does not mean that, in practice, it can be implemented,” said Alexis Myers, Technical Lead for the NREL team.

For the Emerson School solar farm, the team is determining the current energy use and projected needs of the critical buildings. “Maybe you have a solar farm, and it actually doesn’t even provide enough energy to power those buildings up. So that was one thing that we have had to figure out,” Myers said.

The team is looking at the land at the Emerson site to determine how much of it can be used for solar.

“You can’t just say I’m going to build a solar farm here and start running that energy. We have worked with NIPSCO to understand the utility’s interconnection rules,” Myers said.

By seeking solutions that solar could provide for current energy problems, like power outages and natural disasters, “We can ask what are the gaps in our community and how do we plan for that in the future,” said Brenda Scott-Henry, Director of Gary’s Office of Sustainability and Environmental Affairs.

“And then, how can we begin to look at Gary as a whole? How do we start shifting our thinking to what Gary will look like in the next 10 years, in the next 15 years?” Scott-Henry said.

Separate from the project on former school sites, the City of Gary has an EPA grant to construct residential solar farms on 3 brownfields. Scott-Henry said the vacant land on east 21st Avenue, once home to the Bear Brand Hosiery factory and other unused industrial and commercial properties are identified as brownfields. Solar farms are one way of returning those lands to productive use.

Last week’s information session was the third this year; all were held at the Gary Public Library & Cultural Center. “We have to get the word out to more people to come and participate in these events, so that we can get good information that we can incorporate into future planning for the city,” Scott-Henry said.",https://chicagocrusader.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Full-Sized-Single-Photo-2025-06-23T102049.618.jpg,N,,2025-06-23 12:25:25.193773

Louisiana sought another shot at convincing the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit that Tesla’s lawsuit should not be allowed to move forward. But the justices declined to intervene in the case.

Tesla in 2022 sued members of the Louisiana Motor Vehicle Commission, composed of dealerships owned by individual commissioners, and the Louisiana Automobile Dealers Association, claiming they were abusing their control of the commission to take aim at Tesla’s sales model and push it from the market.

Tesla sells its vehicles directly to customers via company-owned showrooms and online, as opposed to utilizing traditional dealerships. Nine of the 18 commissioners, on the other hand, are associated with dealerships that Tesla alleges are competitors, which Musk’s company said violates its due process.

In the state’s petition to the justices, Louisiana’s attorney general argued that the 5th Circuit erred in allowing Tesla’s suit to move forward. A district court dismissed Tesla’s complaint but the appeals court revived several claims in a 2-1 decision, including the due process claim.

“In an opinion for only himself, Judge [Jerry] Smith held that Tesla plausibly alleged that the Commission’s industry-participant members possess a ‘substantial pecuniary interest’ that creates a due process problem,” Louisiana Attorney General Elizabeth Murrill wrote. “His opinion, however, never identifies such an interest; instead, the most it offers is Tesla’s alleged competitor status.”

She said the case prevents a “straightforward grant-vacate-remand (GVR) issue” for the justices, pointing to a maneuver used by the court to send a pending petition back to a lower court for reconsideration. Tesla, meanwhile, said the court should not use the maneuver on the Fifth Circuit’s decision.",https://www.kxan.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/40/2025/06/Tesla_060725_Getty_Spencer-Platt_a53f2e.jpg?w=1280,N,,2025-06-23 12:25:44.194532

Terry Gerton What are the implications of all of these proposals and then disposals for conferencing of this bill?
Terry Gerton Right, it’ll be really interesting to see then if the pocket recisions come up in that.
Loren Duggan Well, a lot of it is who regulates what and how does it work, right?
Loren Duggan This might be another thing that comes up in these hearings we’ve talked about.","Terry Gerton So palace intrigue continues around the mega bill. What’s the latest you’re hearing on the Hill?

Loren Duggan Well, this has been the week the senators were thinking they might get to vote on the bill. They’ve been releasing texts from Senate committees and the parliamentarian has begun her review of those sections to see if they comply with all the rules. So we’ll be seeing what they can cobble together to be the version of the bill that goes to the floor and then see what they do about the whip counting to see, if it could get over the line, but that’s kind of where we are this week with July 4th, their self-imposed deadline, not too far away. Not too many working days left before that.

Terry Gerton Some of the proposals that came up from committee that the parliamentarian has disposed of were moves, I would say, to interpret and implement [the Department of Government Efficiency’s] proposals, like one was zeroing out [the Consumer Finance Protection Bureau]. Do you think that’s an indication of how some of those other proposals are going to fare?

Loren Duggan It could be. There’s some complex rules here about how wide ranging some of the effects can be or some of the details there. And the parliamentarian is going line by line through all these provisions with the committee. So I assume starting with that list from Friday that we’ll see more that’s on the potential chopping block, whether they pull it out before they get to the floor or do it on the floor, something we’ll be watching to see. But yeah, those provisions are at risk because of these rules that the Senate set for itself. And because Sen. John Thune (R-S.D.), the majority leader, has said he’s going to uphold what the parliamentarian said. He didn’t want to break the rule so that when they’re in the minority again, they still have the same flexibility to knock things out of this bill, because the whole point of using this is it only needs a simple majority, not the 60 votes you need for most things. So that’s kind of the narrow path that they have to tread on this piece of legislation.

Terry Gerton What are the implications of all of these proposals and then disposals for conferencing of this bill? Is Thune trying to get it to the point where they don’t have to have a conference or is a conference looking like it’s going to be inevitable?

Loren Duggan We’ve heard different things there. I think he told reporters that he’d like to avoid a conference. And that’s understandable because conference takes time. That means you have to form the conference, which takes steps in both chambers and then actually meet, produce the report and get it through. I think the ideal scenario here for Republicans would be if the Senate passes something the House can take up and pass, then they do that. But the House also has to digest and agree to whatever the Senate did. And one of the biggest gaps has been [State and Local Tax (SALT)], the $40,000 in the House versus the $10,000 in the at least initial Senate proposal. That’s how much you can deduct from your state and local taxes, that could be a sticking point. And they have time to resolve that in the Senate bill, maybe take care of that, but you can see where the choke points are between here and that process playing out.

Terry Gerton It’s going to be really interesting to watch. So obviously that’s the biggest news, but we talk about rescissions too. The Trump administration sent up a rescission bill, but Russ Vought has also been talking about pocket rescissions, which apparently even some Republicans think might be a step too far. Tell us about what you’re hearing there.

Loren Duggan Yeah. So we’ll have a hearing this week in the Senate Appropriations Committee on that rescissions request, which the House has already passed and sent over. The Senate may make its mark on that bill. I think they’re using this hearing as the first step there, asking him questions about it, asking him questions undoubtedly about all the things the administration has done to withhold funding that was put into place. The [Government Accountability Office] has had to weigh in here and others, but this is the senators’ chance to weigh in; do they want to oppose or make changes to the [President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief] language or changes to the Corporation for Public Broadcasting language that was in the bill, because those are some of the provisions that have flared up, but they were looking for a debate maybe after July 4th on the floor, but this is a step where they’re going to use their convening power to take a look at the bill and hear from the person who’s the progenitor of these cuts, Russ Vought, who leads [the Office of Management and Budget].

Terry Gerton Right, it’ll be really interesting to see then if the pocket recisions come up in that. He’s been pretty transparent, speaking about it even on TV.

Loren Duggan Yeah, absolutely. And by the way, on the House side, the DOGE subcommittee, as it’s called, which is led by Marjorie Taylor Greene, the Georgia Republican, they’re also doing a hearing about DOGE cuts and how to lock those in. So I think that’ll be a discussion that comes up there. And as they write these fiscal 2026 appropriations bills of trying to consider what DOGE has done or proposed doing in those bills as well.

Terry Gerton I’m speaking with Loren Duggan, the deputy news director at Bloomberg Government. Well, speaking of appropriations bills and maybe any other bill that might ever make it through, one of the ones that typically does is the National Defense Authorization Bill. And there’s some competing legislation going on around that. Tell us what you’re hearing about NDAA.

Loren Duggan Well, NDAA is one of these things that’s been caught in late action on the fiscal 2025 bills and then late requests being delivered. The NDAA is annual legislation. They’re always going to get to that at some point. Secretary [Pete] Hegseth and the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff were up on the Hill the last couple of weeks talking about their proposal. So we’ll probably start to see pen on paper here, I would assume, pretty soon. But one of the things I think that they’ll be looking at is some acquisition reform efforts. There’s a house proposal from the leaders of the House Armed Services Committee. And then a Senate proposal from Senate Armed Services. A little differences here or there, but this is often one of the things that they do every few years, in NDAA as it’s known, is try to take care of some of these acquisition questions. So we’ll be watching that pretty closely as it begins to move.

Terry Gerton Well, we’re hearing that this may be the week that the defense budget actually comes to the Hill. So that’s kind of important as a baseline for moving forward on the NDAA for next year.

Loren Duggan Absolutely. And for the defense appropriations bill, which has already been under development, but some of the procurement questions and how many weapons systems, all that sort of thing, they do need more documents from the administration and that should help kickstart that process.

Terry Gerton Well, we’ll keep our fingers crossed on that. President Trump has said he’s supporting a crypto bill that’s originating in the house. What are you hearing about crypto?

Loren Duggan Well, we had the big vote last week in the Senate on the GENIUS Act, as it’s known there, and that is more about stable coins and regulating those. But in the House, there was a bill that came out of the Financial Services and Agriculture Committee that would say what the [Securities and Exchange Commission] and the [Commodities Future Trading Commission], those two agencies, would do more broadly around digital assets. So you’re beginning to see several components of a possible bill coming out here, or possible package, at least, of regulating crypto and stable coins. And also the meme coins, which have come up into the debate. So I think that we’re seeing more movement on that. I do feel it’s becoming more of a priority and happening perhaps behind the scenes while the mega bill is moving, but maybe in the future will become more to the fore as they try to get that piece of legislation over the line.

Terry Gerton What are the key points in there?

Loren Duggan Well, a lot of it is who regulates what and how does it work, right? So that’s the Clarity Act, is the one I mentioned out of the House committees. That’s more about how do these two agencies regulate digital assets. And what you hear from members on both sides is sort of a Wild West. So they’re trying to rein that in a little bit and give some more kind of shape to what the regulation will look like, who gets to do what, and what people have to do to participate in that. So it’s sometimes very complex legislation. The definitions matter a lot in what qualifies for different things. So the devil’s going to be in the details on some of those bills, but we’ve seen a lot of action and perhaps even more interest in it, given the Trump administration’s own interest in the subject and their donors and backers as well.

Terry Gerton Well, for an administration that’s not too keen on regulation, having predictable regulation, especially in crypto and in banking, is so important for the markets.

Loren Duggan Absolutely, and they’ll be pushing for that more, I would say, in coming weeks.

Terry Gerton I got one more thing I want to ask you about. GAO has come out with another finding that the Trump administration has violated the Impoundment act. So they’re two for two right now. What are you hearing? Any discussion about that up on the hill?

Loren Duggan This might be another thing that comes up in these hearings we’ve talked about. Lawmakers have traditionally wanted to guard the power of the person, avoid these things. There’ve been lawsuits about this and agencies have weighed in. So this is part of the ongoing battle here that I think is not close to being resolved, but certainly a lot of data points are being calculated on that one.

Terry Gerton Well, much to watch in the coming weeks.

STEP (Spherical Tokamak for Energy Production) is the UK’s flagship fusion programme, aiming to deliver a prototype fusion power plant by 2040 at West Burton, Nottinghamshire. Built on the site of a former coal-fired power station, STEP is delivering a ‘fossil to fusion’ mission and will create thousands of jobs, as well as acting as an anchor for a new industrial ecosystem in the region as part of the East Midlands Combined Authority’s Clean Energy Supercluster along the River Trent. Delivered by UK Industrial Fusion Solutions (UKIFS), STEP is a cornerstone of the UK’s clean energy and industrial future.

The Industrial Strategy features STEP as a case study for fusion energy development, alongside further workstreams in the sector, such as the UK Atomic Energy Authority’s (UKAEA) Fusion Futures careers programme. Today’s announcements serve to highlight the government’s support for the sector and confidence in the STEP programme’s progress to date.

Other recent UK fusion milestones include a UKAEA–ENI fusion energy fuels partnership announced in March, working to build the world’s largest tritium fuel cycle facility in the UK, and a £100 million investment boost via the Starmaker One fund from central government. Fusion is already delivering spillover benefits in AI, robotics and advanced materials - securing the UK’s place at the forefront of clean technology.

UKIFS CEO Paul Methven reflected on the Industrial Strategy announcement:

The UK is at the forefront of global fusion energy research, and STEP is the flagship initiative poised to transform that leadership into commercial reality. By building our prototype fusion power plant in the East Midlands, we’re not only advancing clean energy but also creating high-quality jobs, driving innovation, and delivering economic growth both regionally and nationally.

Maintaining our global edge in such a transformative technology demands ambition and today’s Industrial Strategy publication, with STEP at its heart, shows that government is rising to that challenge. We’re ready to turn this bold vision into action and ensure the UK leads the way in this exciting sector.

Secretary of State for Energy Security and Net Zero (DESNZ) Ed Miliband visited UK’s Fusion Research Campus in Oxfordshire earlier this year, where he said:

After scientists first theorised over 70 years ago that it could be possible, we are now within grasping distance of unlocking the power of the sun and providing families with secure, clean, unlimited energy.

In the introduction within the Industrial Strategy today, he lists fusion as a key part of the government’s mission:

(By delivering) fusion in the East Midlands we will deliver the benefits of our Clean Energy Superpower Mission to communities up and down the country.’

The project offers exciting innovation opportunities and a chance to shape the future of clean energy. STEP is currently in dialogue with potential Construction and Engineering partners, with announcements expected this coming winter 2025/26.

This will pave the way for the potential development of a fleet of future fusion power plants around the world and the commercialisation of fusion energy.

We’ll achieve this by producing a prototype tokamak power plant - in an innovative spherical shape - that will demonstrate net energy. That’s why the programme is called STEP: it stands for ‘Spherical Tokamak for Energy Production’. But STEP is about more than tokamak technology - it’s a huge endeavour encompassing design, site development and construction, alongside supply chain logistics and industry. Fusion research and development has the potential to catalyse new ideas and technologies that will benefit multiple industries and help secure our future on this planet.

By fusing government and business, inspiration and pragmatism, theory and practice, UK-expertise and international impact, we’re going to realise the step-change that will secure humanity’s bright future.

Campbell power plant will provide benefits to ratepayers in the Midcontinent Independent System Operator footprint, according to the Citizens Utility Board of Illinois and 15 other public interest groups.
The Michigan attorney general’s office and a coalition of advocacy groups last week asked DOE to reverse its order.
Consumers Energy on June 6 filed a complaint at FERC seeking to establish a pathway for it to recover its costs to keep the plant in Michigan running.
MISO supported creating a cost-recovery mechanism for the DOE’s order on the Campbell plant, according to a filing at FERC.","The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission should limit who pays for the U.S. Department of Energy’s decision to keep a coal-fired power plant in Michigan operating past its planned retirement, according to comments filed at the agency on Friday.

Further, there is no evidence that delaying the retirement of Consumer Energy’s majority-owned, 1,560-MW J.H. Campbell power plant will provide benefits to ratepayers in the Midcontinent Independent System Operator footprint, according to the Citizens Utility Board of Illinois and 15 other public interest groups.

Forcing MISO customers to pay for a power plant that does not benefit them would violate the Federal Power Act’s cost causation requirement, the groups said in their comments, which was filed by the Environmental Law & Policy Center on behalf of the coalition.

On May 21, DOE declared that there is an energy emergency in MISO’s northern and central regions and ordered that the Campbell plant should run until Aug. 21, past its planned May 30 shutdown date. The Michigan attorney general’s office and a coalition of advocacy groups last week asked DOE to reverse its order.

Consumers Energy on June 6 filed a complaint at FERC seeking to establish a pathway for it to recover its costs to keep the plant in Michigan running. Currently, MISO lacks a mechanism to pay generators that run under DOE emergency orders, and the grid operator has no way to allocate those costs, according to Consumers. Consumers proposed allocating its costs related to DOE’s decision to ratepayers in MISO zones 1 to 7, which covers parts of Michigan, Indiana, Kentucky, Illinois, Missouri, Iowa, Wisconsin, Minnesota, North Dakota, South Dakota and Montana.

MISO supported creating a cost-recovery mechanism for the DOE’s order on the Campbell plant, according to a filing at FERC.

MISO said it did not intend to contest DOE’s characterization that a shortage of electricity or power plants has triggered an emergency in its footprint. However, MISO’s capacity auctions cleared enough generating capacity to meet its reliability needs this summer, the grid operator said.

MISO has worked with its members, state utility regulators, FERC and others to develop policies and processes that address its immediate and future capacity needs, according to the regional grid operator. “MISO is confident that these collaborative efforts do not require further intervention and will help ensure the region continues to procure sufficient capacity to meet demand,” it said.

The Michigan Public Service Commission said it “adamantly disputes” there is an energy emergency in the region. However, the agency agrees with Consumers Energy that the costs from the DOE order should be spread to MISO zones 1 to 7, because the order is directed at MISO’s northern and central zones, according to the agency’s comments.

The Illinois Commerce Commission said that without “a clear and substantiated connection between the continued operation of the Campbell Plant and specific, measurable benefits to identified customers and regions, it would be neither just nor reasonable to assign those costs to any state, zone, or broader footprint.”

Keeping the Campbell plant online will unnecessarily increase consumer energy costs when they are already rising, the ICC said. “Even worse, consumers will bear these costs for no measurable reliability benefit,” the agency said.

The ICC urged FERC to direct Consumers Energy to provide cost and benefit information, and to order MISO to launch a stakeholder process to set a cost recovery mechanism for the Campbell plant.

Costs related to keeping the Campbell plan running should be limited to MISO zone 7, which covers part of Michigan, according to Great River Energy, a wholesale generation and transmission cooperative with utility members in Minnesota and Wisconsin.

“Like other similarly situated [load-serving entities,] GRE’s customers in MISO Local Resource Zones 1 and 3 do not directly benefit from the availability or operation of the Campbell plant and should not be responsible for any of its costs,” Great River said.

If FERC decides the costs of complying with the DOE order should be spread across MISO zones, the agency should reject the Consumers Energy’s complaint and direct the grid operator to launch a stakeholder process to address the cost allocation issue, Great River said.

A coalition of energy user groups also called for a MISO-led stakeholder process, noting that the PJM Interconnection has launched one to consider how to allocate costs related to another DOE 90-day emergency order affecting a Constellation Energy power plant in Pennsylvania.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/wMgzarU6yPSHcgng1Q2SoQ_qEjUC8X1Ya_K-BkZYGv4/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9HZXR0eUltYWdlcy01MjI3MzE3OTQuanBn.webp,N,,2025-06-23 13:17:41.189139

The industry must clean up their mess before any new leases are issued.” Oil companies sometimes avoid decommissioning by selling old oil wells to smaller companies that can’t afford to decommission them.","WASHINGTON— Conservation organizations filed a legal petition today calling on the Trump administration to bar oil and gas companies that have failed to plug old wells and remove inactive platforms from obtaining new offshore drilling rights.

“Federal officials need to stop handing out new leases to deadbeat oil companies that skip out on their responsibilities and put marine life at grave risk,” said Rachel Mathews, a senior attorney at the Center for Biological Diversity. “Our oceans aren’t the oil industry’s junkyards. They’re home to wildlife who deserve unpolluted places to live. Oil companies should have to play by the same rules as everyone else. If they make a mess, they need to clean it up.”

More than 2,700 wells and 500 platforms in the Gulf of Mexico were overdue for decommissioning as of June 2023, according to a 2024 Government Accountability Office investigation. In the Pacific, roughly 100 unused wells require permanent plugging and eight platforms that should be decommissioned remain in the water. This backlog will continue to grow if Trump’s Interior Department allows oil companies to expand drilling operations while deferring their cleanup obligations.

“No one wants to see these wells rust and fall into the ocean like they do. There’s a lot of work left to do. We’ve got to finish the job. Every abandoned well and rusting platform left in the Gulf is a threat to our fisheries, our coastal economies, and the safety of coastal communities. Fossil fuel companies walk away from their messes, and it’s our people who pay the price in lost income, polluted waters, and public health risks. Allowing the oil and gas industry to create even more messes while decades worth of rusting, leaking infrastructure still sit in our waters is wildly irresponsible,” said Scott Eustis, community science director for Healthy Gulf. ""Decommissioning isn’t just cleanup, it’s an opportunity to create good paying, local jobs that restore our coast and protect the livelihoods that depend on it.”

Decommissioning preserves jobs for oil and gas workers while protecting wildlife and coastal ecosystems. Decaying wells and pipelines may leak oil, chemicals, methane and heavy metals. In late April an unplugged oil well near Garden Island Bay, La., spilled nearly 172,000 gallons of oily liquid into coastal marshes. The 82-year-old well had been inactive for decades before the blowout.

“Federal officials have for too long had little to no response to the environmental dangers of abandoned offshore oil wells,” said Joanie Steinhaus, ocean program director for Turtle Island Restoration Network. “These wells leak oil and hazardous materials, harm air and water quality, contribute to climate change and are a continuous detrimental threat to wildlife and human health. The industry must clean up their mess before any new leases are issued.”

Oil companies sometimes avoid decommissioning by selling old oil wells to smaller companies that can’t afford to decommission them. These companies may ultimately go bankrupt, leaving “orphaned” infrastructure in the ocean that the government is left to clean up using taxpayer money. The Interior Department is currently responsible for approximately $183 million in offshore clean-up costs from just nine company bankruptcies.",https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/s3-wagtail.biolgicaldiversity.org/images/RSSpill-Garden-Island-Bay-6-US-Coast-Guard-FP-s.original.jpg,N,,2025-06-23 13:20:07.641755

The Senate’s version of the ‘One Big Beautiful Bill’ closely resembles the House’s version, with some key differences. Transferability of tax credits is reinstated. Tax credits for hydropower, nuclear, geothermal, and battery energy storage are maintained in full through 2033, followed by a gradual phase-down.

On the other hand, solar and wind would begin phasing out in 2026 and be eliminated in 2028. Electric vehicle tax credits and home energy rebates will be eliminated within six months of the passage of the bill. Clean energy groups warned that the bill would undermine recent manufacturing investment, raise electric bills and threaten energy security.

Since the passage of the IRA, investment in domestic battery production has boomed. But a new report warns that U.S. capacity could exceed demand through 2030 if tax credits are cut. That would cut domestic demand for batteries while reducing the incentive for automakers to buy American-made. Meanwhile, China’s battery glut adds more pressure to American manufacturers.

Earlier this month, the Trump administration announced plans to roll back current Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) limits on fossil fuel plant emissions, including restrictions on mercury and carbon dioxide. Mercury’s effects include complications for fetal development and damage to the digestive, immune, and nervous systems. Carbon dioxide, which accelerates global warming, has been considered a pollutant under the Clean Air Act since a 2007 Supreme Court ruling.

Power plant emissions have been regulated at the federal level since the 1963 Clean Air Act. Subsequent regulations like the 2012 Mercury and Air Toxins Standards (MATS), 2015 Clean Power Plan, and stricter EPA standards implemented in 2024 are on track for reversal. The Trump administration has defended its decision by arguing that current power plant emissions are insignificant, while environmental organizations and experts have condemned the rollback.

New polling from Data for Progress shows strong voter support for current regulations to curb coal- and gas-fired power plant pollution, with roughly 2 in 3 voters supporting both mercury limits (69%) and carbon dioxide limits (66%).

Voters also oppose EPA regulation rollbacks. When asked whether they think the EPA’s current limits on power plant pollution should be kept in place or repealed, a strong majority of voters say they think limits on mercury (62%) and carbon dioxide pollution (59%) should be kept in place. Less than 1 in 5 (19%) voters think mercury limits should be repealed, while less than a quarter (22%) think the same for carbon dioxide limits. Nearly a fifth of voters (18% and 19%, respectively) are unsure about whether mercury and carbon dioxide limits should remain in place, suggesting limited awareness of these regulations.

Finally, when told that the EPA plans to repeal its limits on how much carbon dioxide and mercury pollution power plants can emit, a strong bipartisan majority of voters (74%) say that they are either somewhat concerned or very concerned. Only 6% of Democrats, 11% of Independents, and 14% of Republicans say they are not at all concerned about the EPA’s plans. Concerns about pollution deregulation are also more prevalent among those who hold at least a four-year college degree: 43% of degree-holding voters say they are very concerned, while only 31% of non-college-educated voters respond that way.

The latest cancellations — including battery, electric vehicle and solar panel factories in West Virginia, New York, Alabama, Arizona and Washington — mean $15.5 billion in new factories and electricity projects have been cancelled since January 1. The cancelled projects were expected to create nearly 12,000 new jobs.

The $1.4 billion in projects cancelled in May were expected to create at least 1,000 new jobs. Another 600 workers were laid off across five closures announced last month. May’s cancellations also include GM’s decision to switch an EV factory in Tonawanda, New York, to build eight-cylinder gas vehicles there.

“The consequences of continued policy uncertainty and the expectation of higher taxes on clean energy businesses are becoming painfully clear,” said Michael Timberlake, communications director at E2. “Businesses are reacting to the Senate’s proposal — like the House’s — that would drastically scale back the very tax credits that had been driving an American energy and manufacturing boom.

Amid the cancellations, businesses in May also announced nearly $450 million in investments for new solar, EV and grid and transmission equipment factories across five states — including a $120 million investment by electric vehicle maker Rivian to build 1.2 million-square-foot supplier park in Illinois that is expected to create 100 new jobs. Separately, Prolec-GE Waukesh announced plans for a $140 million electricity transformer manufacturing facility in North Carolina expected to create 330 new jobs.

Through May, 62% of all clean energy projects announced — along with 71% of all jobs and 82% of all investments — are in congressional districts represented by Republicans.

“These cancellations are just the first shoe to drop,” Timberlake said. “With renewable energy supplying more than 90 percent of new electricity in America last year, canceled projects will likely mean less available energy and higher electricity prices for consumers and business alike.”

Since federal clean energy tax credits were passed by Congress in August 2022, a total of 53 announced projects have been cancelled, closed or downsized. More than 21,000 jobs and $18.2 billion in investments were connected with the abandoned projects.

Your food and drink orders in Virginia may start to look a little different.

Starting July 1, large food vendors across the state will no longer be allowed to use single-use expanded polystyrene, a plastic foam material commonly referred to by the brand name Styrofoam. That includes plates, cups, bowls, trays and hinged containers.

State lawmakers passed the ban four years ago, following the lead of others such as Maryland, New York and Washington, D.C. Implementation was delayed. Gov. Glenn Youngkin tried unsuccessfully to push it further through a proposed budget amendment earlier this year.

For now, it only covers food vendors with 20 or more locations in Virginia, including restaurants, grocery stores, food trucks and caterers.

The law also applies to schools and community groups that use food programs such as the National School Lunch Program.

Next July, the ban will expand to all food vendors in Virginia.

Advocates say Styrofoam, though cheap to purchase, is harmful to the environment and contributes to global plastic pollution.

The material breaks apart easily, allowing bits to get loose and become litter. It also takes hundreds, or even thousands, of years to decompose and can leach toxic chemicals.

State officials launched a “Foam Free Virginia” campaign in line with the legislation.

The Virginia Department of Environmental Quality recommends using reusable containers, paper products, recyclable plastic, foil or metal instead of polystyrene.

Food vendors are allowed to request a one-year exemption from their local government, demonstrating that they have no reasonable alternative and compliance would “cause significant economic hardship.”

People who violate the new law could face civil penalties of up to $50 per day, which would go into the state’s Litter Control and Recycling Fund or to the locality.

DEQ says people who want to file a complaint about ban violations should reach out to the locality where the food vendor is operating.",https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/styrofoam.jpg,N,,2025-06-23 14:19:40.033113

The filings represent the most definitive evidence yet suggesting DTE employees have controlled the activities of Michigan Energy First (MEF), a 501(c)(4) nonprofit that over more than a decade has channeled millions of dollars into other dark money funds and efforts to sway Michigan elections and policy. While DTE employees sit on MEF’s board, the utility has long implied a separation between the two – including when asked about the very same donation flagged in the recent court documents.

Court records show that the chief of staff in DTE’s corporate and government affairs division, Pam Headley, in 2020 facilitated a $100,000 donation from MEF to Michigan Citizens for Fiscal Responsibility (MCFR), a dark money group helmed by then-Republican Senator Mike Shirkey and Republican political operative Heather Lombardini. MCFR sought to end pandemic emergency restrictions. Headley has no known public affiliation with MEF and used her DTE email to communicate with MCFR officials, sometimes during business hours. Messages included the subject line “RE: Contribution from Michigan Energy First”.

Headley’s emails came to light as part of an ongoing criminal proceeding stemming from Lombardini’s alleged failure to file required MCFR campaign finance disclosures in a broader dark money scheme. The messages contrast sharply with DTE’s earlier public denials.

After rumors of DTE’s financial ties to MCFR and the affiliated Unlock Michigan campaign first bubbled up in 2020, the utility told a Planet Detroit reporter that “DTE unequivocally is not financially supporting the Unlock Michigan/MI Citizens For Fiscal Responsibility campaign.” Even after a later tax filing confirmed MEF’s six-figure contribution, DTE spokesman Peter Ternes doubled down, telling the Guardian that DTE “unequivocally” did not make the donation and “[does] not speak” for MEF.

But Headley used her DTE email to confirm MEF’s contribution to MCFR and to manage the logistics of the fund transfer. The emails suggest Headley was familiar with the MCFR leaders, Shirkey and Lombardini.

“As always, thanks for your help,” Headley closed one of her emails to the pair. “Have a wonderful weekend!”

The Energy and Policy Institute sent a series of specific questions to DTE about its relationship to MEF, the dark money group’s support of MCFR, and whether the salaries of Headley and another DTE employee involved in MEF’s donation activity were paid by DTE customers. DTE spokesperson Jill Wilmot responded with a brief statement that largely did not answer the questions and focused on DTE’s campaign giving through its political action committee (PAC), which is separate from dark money accounts. The questions and DTE’s statement are published in full at the bottom of this article.

Dark money group funded by DTE, run by utility lobbyists

Even before revelations in the recent court filings, the boundary between DTE and MEF appeared porous at best. For MEF’s entire existence, DTE executives and lobbyists have comprised a majority of its board. DTE recently confirmed longstanding suspicions that it had contributed to MEF, but did not disclose when and how much. (Since 2014, the dark money nonprofit has reported having received over $51 million in contributions but is not required to publicly list its donors.)

Yet utility representatives have repeatedly told reporters that DTE does not speak for MEF. The utility reiterated that statement in a response to questions from the Energy and Policy Institute.

“While DTE has contributed to Michigan Energy First (MEF) in the past, we can’t speak on behalf of MEF or the contributions the organization makes,” Wilmot said.

But at the time of its 2020 donation to MCFR, the MEF board president was Renze Hoeksema, who spent decades as a DTE lobbyist before he retired in 2022. In one email unearthed in the criminal court filings, Headley notes that Hoeksema instructed her – a DTE employee, with no known role with MEF – to manage the MCFR contribution.

“Renze asked me to let you know that today the Michigan Energy First Board approved a $100,000 contribution to Michigan Citizens for Fiscal Responsibility,” Headley wrote. “In order to process this contribution they have requested some additional information,” she continued, with a request for an invoice and signed letter. Headley offered her help with any questions, and closed out the email with her DTE email signature.

Transcripts from the criminal proceeding also show Lombardini referred to the MEF money as a donation from DTE. Lombardini emailed Shirkey on July 15, 2020: “I think I’m getting the $100,000 tomorrow from DTE.” The next day, Lombardini tells Shirkey: “Unlock Michigan update: $100,000 DTE check arrived today.”

DTE deception mirrors high-profile utility fraud

Its most recent available tax filing, for 2023, describes MEF’s mission to “educate legislators & the general public on the issues facing Michigan, & to advocate citizen participation & obtain grassroots support.” But for years, it has been part of a utility dark money network known as a powerful – and bruising – political force in Lansing.

Former Republican Michigan State Representative Gary Glenn, a vocal critic of monopoly utilities who served as chair of the House Energy Committee, blamed his loss of a state senate seat on $1 million in utility dark money deployed against him. Conversely, MEF has buoyed more sympathetic lawmakers with big-ticket donations to their nonprofits. By setting up secret 501(c)(4) accounts of their own, elected officials can skirt campaign contribution limits and conceal their benefactors.

Reporting by the Detroit News has exposed widespread dark money activity among Michigan elected officials, including influential leaders in both parties – among them, Governor Gretchen Whitmer.

While utility dark money activity is pervasive in Michigan, it is not unique to the state.

Another Midwest utility, FirstEnergy in Ohio, used dark money to orchestrate a massive bribery scheme that lined the pockets of a top lawmaker who pushed a billion-dollar bailout for failing nuclear and coal plants, then-Speaker of the Ohio House Larry Householder.

In that scheme, FirstEnergy secretly paid nearly $60 million into a dark money 501(c)(4) nonprofit controlled by Householder. Investigators exposed the scheme, ultimately leading to federal indictments and convictions.

Additionally, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission charged FirstEnergy and its former CEO Charles Jones with fraud, in part because the utility “failed to disclose material related party transactions with respect to payments FirstEnergy made to a 501(c)(4) organization funded and controlled in part by certain former FirstEnergy executives.”

Another Ohio utility, American Electric Power, was similarly penalized by federal regulators over its failure to disclose to shareholders payments made to a dark money group formed to bankroll Householder and support his extended tenure as Ohio House Speaker. The fraud charge resulted in a $19 million civil penalty for the utility. Nicholas Akins, who was CEO of American Electric Power while the dark money changed hands, currently sits on DTE’s board.

DTE has acknowledged funding MEF, which in turn has funneled cash to other dark-money nonprofits linked to elected officials. But in a comprehensive search of DTE securities filings, the Energy and Policy Institute did not find a single instance where DTE mentioned Michigan Energy First, explained its affiliation, or noted its contributions to the dark money nonprofit. DTE did not respond to a question from the Energy and Policy Institute asking if it could identify any securities filings that refer to MEF.

Dark money a pervasive undercurrent in Lansing

In addition to its donations to nonprofits tied to individual elected officials, MEF has made hefty contributions to general party funds that support both Republicans and Democrats. MEF board member Eric Doster – an attorney linked in state records to dozens of political and 501(c)(4) groups in Michigan – previously told the Detroit News that MEF has disbursed donations in a “deliberately non- and bipartisan manner” over “many years.”

Although the MCFR donation that recently surfaced in the ongoing criminal case was a direct attack on Whitmer’s power and policymaking, she has lately emerged as a key beneficiary of MEF giving – especially after her Democratic party swept state elections in 2022, with plans to overhaul energy laws. MEF pumped $2 million into Democrat-affiliated accounts that year, including $1.1 million to the Michigan Democratic Party’s 21st Century Fund and $750,000 to the Whitmer-affiliated 501(c)(4) Road to Michigan’s Future. The latter was MEF’s largest-ever donation to a nonprofit linked to a single officeholder, according to the Detroit News.

Then in 2023, when a widespread push for utility accountability sputtered amid inaction from the Democratic-controlled legislature, MEF sent $100,000 to yet another 501(c)(4) – this one tied to then-House Speaker Joe Tate. Environmental advocates criticized lawmakers for watering down key bills as they took DTE money.

“This entire process has really been co-opted by utilities,” Christy McGillivray, political and legislative director for Sierra Club Michigan, said at the time. “We have a really serious secret money problem in Michigan politics.”

Frustration over DTE’s political spending in Michigan spawned a legislative push in 2024 to restrict campaign contributions from monopoly utilities. A bipartisan coalition revived the popular effort this year, as proponents accused utilities of “buying outcomes.”

Dark money reforms long sought in Michigan

Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel has repeatedly raised utility dark money spending as a problem in Michigan politics, calling for more expansive required disclosures to help the public track how much utilities are funneling to dark money groups like MEF. It’s Nessel’s office that brought criminal charges in the ongoing case that exposed the emails where DTE staff coordinated donations by MEF.

In 2023, Nessel urged the Michigan Public Service Commission to require more transparent reporting by utilities of their political spending, including their use of dark money. Regulators ultimately adopted a version of Nessel’s proposal that requires DTE to submit an annual filing that lists any corporate contributions over $5,000 made to nonprofits – including 501(c)(4) dark money groups – during the prior year. DTE made a public disclosure in fall 2024, covering its spending since September 2023.

But while the disclosures provide a long-sought boost in transparency, they do not capture the scope of the dark money machinations that preceded them – or tell how much money DTE parked in or routed through MEF in prior years. DTE reporting to date indicates that the utility has not given more than $5,000 to MEF since September 2023, after new requirement took effect. Meanwhile, MEF’s most recent tax filing shows a fund balance of more than $7.6 million. It is not known how much of that total, and how much of the $51 million that MEF has raked in since 2014, came from DTE.

Months before the PSC added its disclosure requirement, a group of DTE shareholders proposed a resolution that would have required the utility to detail dark money spending, including corporate cash funneled into 501(c)(4) nonprofits. Utility leadership opposed the proposal, which specifically called out MEF and noted that DTE “critically fails to disclose its payments” to such groups. Shareholders ultimately followed DTE’s guidance to vote down the measure.

DTE Foundation head included on dark money emails

Recent court records show that copied on Headley’s emails confirming MEF’s donation to MCFR is another DTE employee using a company email address: Rodney Cole.

At the time of the 2020 email exchange that appears in court records, Cole was director of state government affairs – a top lobbying role in which he “spearheaded state legislative activities and worked closely with state legislators and the governor’s administration to meet the needs of DTE’s customers and other stakeholders.” DTE did not respond to a question from the Energy and Policy Institute about whether DTE customers paid for Cole’s salary in 2020, when he was copied on emails related to the MCFR donation.

The next year, Cole took on a leadership role within the DTE Energy Foundation, which facilitates the utility’s charitable giving.

The DTE foundation doles out tens of millions of dollars in grants annually to community organizations including, for example, those affiliated with prominent and influential community leaders. DTE’s charitable giving has over the years appeared political in nature: grant recipients have shown up in regulatory proceedings, public hearings, and the media to advocate for DTE’s preferred policy positions. Leveraging charitable giving to promote the utility agenda appears in a ”tactical guide” from the Edison Electric Institute, the trade association for electric utilities.

Questions the Energy and Policy Institute submitted to DTE

1. DTE representatives have said that the utility does not speak for Michigan Energy First. Does DTE stand by these previous statements?

2. DTE representatives also said “DTE unequivocally is not financially supporting the Unlock Michigan/MI Citizens For Fiscal Responsibility campaign.” Does DTE stand by that statement?

3. What is the total amount of corporate money that DTE has contributed to Michigan Energy First since the 501(c)(4)’s inception?

4. Have DTE shareholders ever been informed of the corporation’s contributions to Michigan Energy First? If so, please direct me to the SEC filing(s) in which Michigan Energy First is referenced.

5. Was any portion of Pam Headley’s salary charged to ratepayers in 2020? If so, what percentage?

6. Was any portion of Rodney Cole’s salary charged to ratepayers in 2020? If so, what percentage?

DTE’s response to the questions

“DTE Energy is committed to being a responsible corporate citizen and complies with all applicable laws regarding corporate donations and political contributions. These disclosures showcase DTE’s commitment to our customers and communities we serve, helping us meet our aspiration of being best in the world and best for the world. The political contributions the company makes are supported by the DTE voluntary employee PAC or DTE shareholders – not from customer revenue.

Oil prices jumped to a five-month high Monday following U.S. airstrikes on Iranian nuclear facilities, sparking concerns that prices could climb higher in the coming days and weeks.

While the full economic impact remains uncertain, much depends on how Iran responds, particularly whether it attempts to shut down the Strait of Hormuz.

Iran threatens to close Hormuz Strait

On Sunday, the Iranian Parliament approved a measure to close the waterway.

About 20 million barrels of crude oil pass through the strait daily, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Located between Iran and Oman, the waterway is one of the world’s most critical oil chokepoints.

If Iran shuts it down, oil prices would likely spike globally, with serious implications for the U.S. economy.

“The important thing to know is that the Strait of Hormuz ships 20% of global oil production,” said Patrick De Haan, head of petroleum analysis at GasBuddy. “While we are not a beneficiary — we are not a buyer of crude oil from Iran — the U.S. cannot detach itself from the global economy.”

US warns Iran against closing Hormuz Strait

The White House has not confirmed whether it anticipates further retaliation, but top officials have warned Iran against taking steps that could further escalate tensions.

Secretary of State Marco Rubio, in an interview with Fox News’ “Sunday Morning Futures,” warned closing the strait would be a “massive escalation that would merit a response from the U.S. and others.”

Vice President JD Vance went further, calling such a move “economic suicide” for Iran.

“Their entire economy runs through the Strait of Hormuz,” Vance told NBC’s “Meet the Press.” “If they want to destroy their own economy, it can cause disruption in the world. I think that would be their decision, but why would they do that?”

Instead, he urged Iran to return to the negotiating table and abandon its nuclear weapons program.

“If they are willing to do that, they are going to find a willing partner in the United States of America,” Vance said.

Despite rising prices, De Haan said there’s no immediate reason to fear what he described as “apocalyptic” gas costs. Still, he warned the national average could increase by 10 to 25 cents per gallon within the next week or two.",https://www.wspa.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/53/2025/06/AP25173345229488-3-e1750684006842.jpg?w=1280,N,,2025-06-23 13:19:25.021930

Why it matters: Oil prices have climbed during the Israel-Iran conflict, which will eventually filter through to U.S. gasoline costs.

Reality check: The Energy Department and other resource agencies don't make output decisions.

Private companies do that, though federal regulations, trade policies, leasing and other federal decisions can affect production on various timescales.

The big picture: U.S. output growth has stagnated this year amid producers' caution during a stretch of lower prices before the conflict, ample global supplies, tariff uncertainty, and just modest global demand growth.

The Energy Department's independent stats arm and some other analysts project a decline in 2026 from this year's record average levels.

What they're saying: Oil analyst Clay Seigle said it's not surprising to see Trump hoping for more supply ""as the Mideast escalation has added about $10 to prices that were previously weighed down by economic concerns from the trade war.""

The Energy Department did not immediately respond to an inquiry about Trump's post.

Yes, but: ""Producing companies don't make decisions based on day-to-day headlines, or presidential posts,"" Seigle, a senior fellow with the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said via email.

""They decide capital spending programs (including drilling and fracking) based on profitability and shareholder returns, and Trump's $50 oil price target is a big disincentive.""

Across the country, homeowners and housing providers are struggling to afford insurance prices driven up by climate change. The Trump Administration’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) is apparently trying to accelerate that trend by gutting the federal climate data sources necessary to model and prepare for disasters, just in time for hurricane season.

The loss of public climate data will hasten insurers’ retreat, as it leaves insurers without a reliable data source to estimate potential losses. Cuts to climate data will also indirectly drive up the costs paid by consumers and taxpayers. Policyholders will invariably pay a price as public climate data sources are decimated, and the only question is how high the price will be.

State insurance commissioners, the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC), and state lawmakers from climate-vulnerable states should be leading the charge to preserve U.S. climate data infrastructure. Instead, a coordinated campaign has narrowed in on the opposite priority: gutting the Federal Insurance Office (FIO), the small group in the Treasury Department responsible for tracking the costs of climate change to insurance consumers. By attacking the Treasury Department’s ability to collect insurance-related climate data, these officials could ensure the data on those collective costs will never reach the public.

By Attacking the Federal Insurance Office, States Shoot the Messenger.

In January, FIO published the first and most comprehensive national dataset on how climate change is affecting homeowners’ insurance policyholders. FIO’s report detailed the rising premiums, deductibles, and insured losses that are increasingly cutting into households’ budgets. The data highlighted serious challenges in states like Florida and Louisiana, while revealing troubling trends in the Midwest. While the data only covered a limited set of residential policies and just several years, it represented the first step towards greater transparency and recognition of the tangible costs of climate change after decades of industry secrecy.

Shortly before and after the publication, a group of lawmakers and state regulators, some of whom refused previously to fully participate in the original data collection, have attacked FIO’s power to collect more data moving forward. Introduced in May by Congressman Scott Fitzgerald (R-WI), H.R. 3437 would prevent FIO from collecting any additional data from insurance companies. Another bill, H.R. 643, introduced in January by Congressman Troy Downing (R-MT), would abolish FIO entirely.

As DOGE cuts at NOAA threaten to conceal the national tally of billion-dollar disasters, gutting FIO would in turn hide everyday costs paid by consumers through their insurance premiums. Absent a national data collection authority, the public will depend on a weak and fragmented state regulatory system to voluntarily produce a patchwork of data far too slowly to respond to an unfolding crisis — if it publishes any national data at all. Even if the NAIC made a meaningful commitment to publish such data — something it has so far failed to do — it is likely that any effort would be partial and incomplete without the subpoena power held by FIO.

Those legislative proposals were also preceded by demands from a minority of state regulators. Back in November, North Carolina Insurance Commissioner Mike Causey and North Dakota Insurance Commissioner Jon Godfread called for the elimination of FIO. The following month, nine state insurance commissioners wrote a letter urging DOGE to axe FIO. This March, the NAIC, a trade group that represents state regulators and is now led by Godfread, likewise wrote to Congress listing the abolition of FIO — not climate resilience or preparing for catastrophes — as NAIC’s top priority for Congress. In appealing to DOGE, commissioners from states like Louisiana asked DOGE to eliminate the national office and instead delegate the power to fifty-six different state commissioners — hardly a model of “efficiency.”

Table 1 summarizes how officials in over half of the states have attacked FIO, the federal office with authority to collect climate-related insurance data.

Table 2 shows mounting insurance problems in some of the states that have attacked FIO.

Even this snapshot understates the problem, given that the refusal of some states to share certain data means that we don’t know how bad things are in those places. Texas, for example, didn’t provide data on nonrenewals (when an insurer stops providing coverage instead of renewing a policy at the end of the year) or cancellation rates (when an insurer cancels a policy due to nonpayment, alleged fraud, or other factors). So while the table suggests that the state didn’t have any ZIP codes with significant increases in nonrenewal or cancellation rates, it’s likely that some jurisdictions would be in “top 100” had Texas shared data.

To Hide From Rising Seas, State Officials Bury Their Heads in the Sand.

The states whose politicians and regulators are trying to bury this data are those suffering the most from a climate-driven insurance crisis.

In states like Florida, Texas, and Louisiana, none of which fully participated in FIO’s data collection, the climate crisis has become an imminent financial threat to many households. According to NOAA’s billion-dollar disaster tracker, which is no longer being updated, Florida leads the nation in disaster losses with at least $450 billion worth of damage since 1980. The state similarly contains 37 of the top 100 ZIP codes for insurance cancellations due to nonpayment, suggesting a growing number of households in Florida are no longer able to afford rising premiums.

Louisiana is third in the nation for disaster losses since 1980 at $310 billion. The state also has 43 out of the top 100 ZIP codes across the country for nonrenewals. As large insurers have withdrawn from Louisiana and Florida, small, undercapitalized companies are proliferating and extracting quick profits. Last-resort insurance programs like Florida Citizens and Louisiana Citizens are expanding, setting up what could be a ticking time bomb for policyholders, taxpayers, and the public. What will happen if, in the wake of a catastrophic hurricane, those undercapitalized insurers are unable to pay out claims?

This game of distraction will not only harm communities in the Gulf South. Congressman Troy Downing, who introduced the bill to abolish FIO, represents the wildfire-plagued state of Montana. As longer-lasting and more destructive wildfires threaten Montana, state legislators hope to study the root causes and propose solutions; without granular data, it will be difficult to begin — let alone accomplish — any of those tasks.

Preventing the collection of insurance data will also harm the Midwest in particular, as existing data shows the Midwest is already home to the fastest premium increases and a wave of nonrenewals. Wisconsin, the home of H.R. 3437 sponsor Congressman Scott Fitzgerald, represents an unusual 10% of the top 100 ZIP codes across the country for claims frequency rate. Nebraska policyholders, likewise, have seen “unbelievable” insurance premium increases and the state is home to 5 of the top 100 ZIP codes for nonrenewals, 6 for cancellations, and 8 for claims frequency. While Nebraska Representative Mike Flood has acknowledged the threat to his constituents and Nebraska’s housing market and need for national reform, he has also co-sponsored legislation to prevent further data collection or publication.

In the absence of data, state officials may continue to obscure the root cause of climate-related insurance chaos. State officials in Louisiana, Texas, and Florida have invented an increasingly absurd series of scapegoats such as litigation costs, “woke” ESG insurance companies, and FIO. In some states, regulators and lawmakers back policies that accelerate climate change that will harm consumers. In Texas, for example, lawmakers have sought to prevent insurers from even considering climate-related risks.

Secretive State Turf Wars Turn Climate Disasters into Financial Disasters.

There is ultimately no way to hide the reality of climate change from people experiencing disasters and paying through higher insurance premiums. The financial risks from climate change are already too urgent and too apparent. Cutting the tools to monitor the crisis and respond to risks will create a devastating delay for emergency planners and responders, impede the development of targeted investments for communities who need it most, and stymie efforts to develop data-driven solutions and compare the effects of interventions.

Cutting data on the financial costs of climate change will also prevent federal financial regulators from monitoring the potential for systemic risk to the economy. While large insurance companies can continue to profit as premiums rise, consumers are more likely to default on their mortgages and to take on more debt. As large insurers retreat, more households are falling onto subprime insurance that offers less coverage for higher premiums, while ballooning rosters of last-resort programs threaten to send enormous bills to the public when they run out of money to pay claims, as has happened in Florida and California. In the aftermath of back-to-back disasters, unchecked price-gouging, mortgage defaults, and a local foreclosure crisis could impact local and regional banks, creating a financial spiral that would be difficult to recover from.

Leaving it up to states to track the financial risks of climate change is a recipe for fragmentation, inequality, and failure. Instead of building a public database to identify the early warning signs of a climate-driven insurance crisis, too many state insurance regulators are focused on winning a petty turf war with a small Treasury Department office, having failed to prepare for the scale of destruction climate change has in store for the insurance markets they are responsible for protecting. As they ignore the cuts to public climate and weather data and prioritize further cuts to federal data, these regulators are not only failing to address the immediate financial concerns, but blocking others from responding too.

This is no time for turf wars. Climate-driven insurance problems are accelerating: Families are being priced out of their homes. Regional insurers are collapsing. State-run safety nets are swelling unsustainably. And instead of confronting these problems with the full force of public data and oversight, state regulators and lawmakers are working to blindfold the public and hamstring the institutions designed to help.

If Congress and federal agencies allow this campaign to succeed — if they gut the Federal Insurance Office, defund climate data, and surrender to the loudest voices in the room — they won’t just be hiding the cost of climate change. They’ll be helping to cause the next financial crisis.

We need more data, not less. We need stronger oversight, not weaker. And above all, we need leadership that acknowledges what consumers already know: the costs of climate change are mounting — and the longer we look away, the more expensive they’ll become.

Attero says its move “directly supports the National Critical Mineral Mission (NCMM), launched by the government of India in 2025 to reduce import dependence and promote self-reliance in critical mineral supply chains.”

The REEs being targeted are used in applications including electric vehicles (EVs), wind energy and consumer electronics, says Attero, and are part of a global market projected to reach more than $10.9 billion in value by 2029.

“Attero has consistently advocated for India’s self-reliance in critical minerals to reduce dependence on imports and counter China’s dominance in rare earth supply chains,” says Nitin Gupta, CEO and co-founder of Attero.

“We are proud to be the only Indian company with proven deep-tech and globally patented processes to refine black mass and recover REEs with over 98 percent efficiency and 99.9 percent purity,” Gupta adds.

“The current global environment only reinforces the urgency of building domestic infrastructure,” he continues. “With our existing capability and technology leadership, we are ready to scale our REE recycling capacity from 1 to 100 metric tons per day to reach a total of 30,000 metric tons annually and explore further expansion as demand accelerates.”

In addition to neodymium, praseodymium and dysprosium, Attero says its patented technology also can extract cerium and gadolinium. The firm calls its process energy efficient and cost effective and says it “significantly reduces greenhouse gas emissions compared to traditional mining.”

Beyond REEs, Attero says it also refines black mass to produce high-purity recycled-content lithium, cobalt, nickel and manganese, “reinforcing its position as a leader in the circular economy for critical metals.”

In its most recent fiscal year, Attero says it processed more than 150,000 metric tons of obsolete electronics and another 15,000 metric tons of lithium-ion batteries.

This year, Attero says it is targeting year-on-year growth of 100 percent, including plans to expand its geographic footprint in the United States and Europe.

AUSTIN, Texas — A package of bills that will eliminate what state investigators called a regulatory “no man’s land” that allows for faulty oil and gas field power equipment to go unaddressed, creating the type of hazard blamed for starting the worst wildfires in Texas history, were signed into law by the governor ahead of Sunday’s bill signing deadline.

Right now, it looks like Senate Majority Leader John Thune (R-SD) will press ahead, even at the expense of next week's recess. His task is tougher than that faced by House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA) last month in getting H.R. 1 to the Senate. Speaker Johnson had to do just enough to get it over the finish line in the House. Leader Thune needs a bill that can pass both chambers. If all goes according to plan in the Senate – always a dicey assumption – this is how it should unfold.

Later this week, once the ""Byrd Bath"" is complete, Leader Thune would bring to the floor a unified reconciliation bill judged to be within reasonable range of securing a House majority vote – presumably resolving the differences with respect to the level of Medicaid cuts, the individual state and local tax (SALT) deduction cap, the phase-out of Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) green energy credits, and a host of other issues. Senate rules provide both parties no more than 10 hours of debate. Democrats can be expected to use every minute available to make their case against the bill. Republicans may speed the process by yielding back a few hours.

We're especially interested to see if Senate Committee on Finance Chairman Mike Crapo (R-ID) engages in any tax colloquies on the floor with other colleagues. These pre-scripted Q&A sessions between the Chairman and senators typically seek to firmly cement the intent of Congress for a particular provision. They can give Treasury regulators more clear instructions on implementation and forestall future litigation. The lack of a Committee on Finance markup and an associated committee report arguably increases the demand for such colloquies.

Once debate time expires, the vote-a-rama begins, allowing opponents of the bill to offer an unlimited number of amendments. Where Republicans may need to adopt an amendment or two on the floor to reflect changes needed for passage, Democrats are expected to make full use of the opportunity to force many difficult votes on Republicans – although all are likely to fail on a partisan vote. Don't be surprised if the Senate breaks its 44-vote record set back in 2008.

Fending off these amendments and getting the final product to the House will take a few days. It could easily drag into the weekend, delaying the Fourth of July recess before final passage. From there, Speaker Johnson and the president would join to force the weight of the world on any Republican House members with second thoughts about supporting final passage.

A different (and some would say more realistic) timeline puts the reconciliation bill on pace for Senate passage by the Fourth of July. Under this scenario, July would see GOP leaders in Congress working behind closed doors to fashion the delicate policy balance needed to squeeze a final bill through each chamber.

This timeline is a bit longer but punctuated with a real deadline to hasten conclusive action: Treasury is forecasting an August drop-dead date for lifting the statutory debt ceiling. The reconciliation bill would raise the debt limit, making it a must-pass bill with a real deadline that Congress cannot waive. #TaxTake

Its executive arm, the European Commission, has significantly diminished the scope and effect of the climate policy known as the Corporate Social Responsibility Directive (CSRD).
This is more than two-and-a-half times greater than the implementation costs of California’s climate disclosure laws at $3.6 billion.
The EU’s mandate is also about 13 times more expensive than the Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) climate disclosure rule, which is nothing to sneeze at.
While California’s climate disclosure mandate similarly requires Scope 3 reporting, the EU’s version is much more far reaching.","The European Union (EU) is undergoing a major reality check regarding its climate disclosure policy for corporations. Its executive arm, the European Commission, has significantly diminished the scope and effect of the climate policy known as the Corporate Social Responsibility Directive (CSRD). This set of rules would require companies to report on their environmental, social, and governance (ESG) activities across 12 disclosure categories.

The European Parliament recently voted to delay the implementation of the CSRD and its companion law, the Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive (CS3D). As a result, both mandates will be simplified, and the reporting start date has been postponed by several years for large enterprises and parent firms. Additionally, small- and medium-sized enterprises will not begin reporting until 2029, rather than the original 2027 date.

On top of that, the European Commission has proposed an omnibus bill that would impose drastic reductions in the scope of regulations going forward. Eighty percent of the thousands of firms originally targeted, for example, will now be exempted from compliance. This is done by raising the compliance threshold to firms employing 1,000 or more employees, rather than the 250 minimum. This means that 40,000 of the original 50,000 companies will get a pass from the sustainability directive, including many US-based firms with operations in Europe.

This would mark a significant and welcome downsizing of what has been widely viewed as an overly burdensome and invasive mandate. While the majority of these 40,000 firms were based in European countries, thousands of these enterprises were satellite firms or subsidiaries of big US conglomerates. These include Lockheed Martin, SpaceX, Apple, Microsoft, Facebook, and Amazon.

The primary focus of the CSRD is to compel firms to reveal their sustainability activities and carbon footprints. This would be achieved via highly invasive and incriminating reporting requirements. Despite the seemingly noble efforts to promote environmental transparency across Europe, the grim reality is that the compliance costs of the CSRD far outweigh the ostensible benefits.

According to my recent CEI report, the EU’s CSRD comes with a massive price tag of $8.09 billion (€7.45 billion) in compliance costs for the 50,000 reporting firms. This is more than two-and-a-half times greater than the implementation costs of California’s climate disclosure laws at $3.6 billion.

The EU’s mandate is also about 13 times more expensive than the Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) climate disclosure rule, which is nothing to sneeze at. Notably, the SEC was pressured by an array of GOP-led states and interest groups to reduce the original costs of the rule by roughly 90 percent before publishing its final draft. Responding to the sheer unworkability, intense opposition, and implementation woes, it seems that the EU may be moving in a similar direction with its own policy.

Another major issue with the CSRD is that many EU member states have faced difficulties codifying the directive into law. Since the time my CEI report was published in December 2024, only nine EU countries had codified the CSRD into law among the 27 member countries. As of April 2025, this increased to 20 member countries that have codified the CSRD (at least in part) and six countries with pending legislation, marking a notable progression.

Yet, the lingering question is why the policy has not been adopted by all 27 countries. The original deadline for this was last July. Much of this delay stems from the complicated components of the climate rule, chief among these being the Scope 3 mandate and mandatory assurance reporting.

Scope 3 reporting requires companies to reveal all greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions generated by their value chain. Such data is exceedingly difficult to gather or accurately assess, since value chains capture a wide range of product development and services. Attributing GHG emissions to these processes represents a tall task for compliant companies.

While California’s climate disclosure mandate similarly requires Scope 3 reporting, the EU’s version is much more far reaching. The CSRD seeks to capture emissions across the value chains of companies located across 27 different countries and multiple jurisdictions. Many of the primary reporting firms may also collaborate across third-party value chains, requiring a crisscross of overlapping Scope 3 emissions disclosures.

Thankfully, the European Commission’s proposed reduction would mitigate some of the far-reaching effects of the Scope 3 mandate. This includes shielding many large overseas firms conducting business in Europe from compliance. It would also mitigate Scope 3’s “trickle-down effect,” ensuring that “requests for value chain information could not exceed what would be reported under an amended voluntary reporting standard for SMEs [small and medium-sized enterprises].”

The CSRD also goes beyond the SEC and California’s climate policies by imposing mandatory assurance reports. This would require firms to hire independent auditors to conduct costly examinations to verify the validity of their sustainability reports.

By contrast, the SEC’s rule only reserves assurance reporting for a subset of complying firms, namely accelerated filers. Accelerated filers are firms that must periodically disclose their financial information to the SEC within tighter deadlines. Thankfully, the omnibus bill notably reduces the CSRD’s reasonable assurance standard to a lesser, more easily disclosable form known as limited assurance. These are two chief areas in which the EU’s policy adopts a more aggressive approach than its peers.",https://cei.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/GettyImages-1203523661-1200x628.jpg,N,,2025-06-23 11:18:29.494947

By 2050, traditional petroleum fuels are projected to occupy a significantly diminished share of the global energy landscape, largely relegated to niche applications or regions slower in their transitions.","Last Updated on:

The June 2025 U.S. bombing of Iran’s nuclear facilities is shaping up to be a pivotal geopolitical event, one whose immediate shockwaves extend far beyond military calculations. Within hours of the U.S. and Israeli strikes on key nuclear sites at Natanz, Isfahan, and Fordow, global oil prices surged sharply. President Trump’s provocative declaration that “Fordow is gone” and his blunt demands for Iran to accept peace quickly have dramatically heightened uncertainty in energy markets, underscoring once again the acute vulnerabilities that accompany reliance on petroleum.

History has repeatedly shown how disruptions centered on the Persian Gulf, whether from political upheaval, sabotage, or outright warfare, instantly sends crude oil prices higher. This pattern is repeating itself, intensifying pressures on consumer nations around the globe.

I assembled this necessarily coarse perspective this morning, first finding data sources sufficient to get at least approximate numbers of metric tons of petroleum-based fuels consumed in the four countries/regions, then assessing the near-term implications through 2030, then extending that through 2050 with policy and competition-based drivers of transformation. Errors in data gathering, conversion, and transcription from 1990 to the present are mine, while errors in projection are also mine, but differently. As always, with my projections in the future, I don’t claim to be right, just less wrong than most.

The sharp oil price spike following Trump’s strikes has immediately pushed inflation fears back into the spotlight. Already fragile economies, including the United States, are facing renewed recessionary pressures, dubbed by many analysts as the Trumpcession. American consumers, uniquely sensitive to fuel costs due to the comparatively massive distances they drive and fly, and the lack of alternatives, now see gasoline prices soaring at the pump, directly squeezing disposable incomes. This immediate hit to household spending could further stall the U.S. economy, a dynamic that, paradoxically, is likely to boost consumer interest in electric vehicles and other less oil-dependent transport options, despite the absence of robust federal policy to promote such technologies.

In contrast to the reactive, consumer-driven scenario playing out in the U.S., China is responding to the crisis with clear-eyed strategic intent. Already leading global markets in electric vehicle production, battery manufacturing, and renewable energy deployment, China is now likely to double down on its transition. Beijing has long understood energy security as synonymous with national security, and with its oil imports critically exposed to geopolitical disruptions, the government will aggressively accelerate its electrification agenda. Policy initiatives such as stringent EV quotas, massive investment in battery factories, and widespread deployment of charging infrastructure all appear prescient as China seeks to further insulate itself from the volatility now gripping oil markets.

All countries are exposed to increasing volatility as demand drops, as major oil-producing regions will become uneconomic, major fields and refineries go off line, bulk shipping transitions to aging and less reliable ships, and major pipeline infrastructure becomes stranded assets. The illegal US strikes on Iran — illegal under both US and international law, but as always with the USA, never coming with consequences — are just sharpening the awareness of the volatility.

Ironically, the global decline in oil demand will accelerate itself, as recurring price spikes and supply chain disruptions caused by economic instability make oil even less attractive.

The European Union, similarly positioned on the frontline of petroleum dependency, will take this geopolitical crisis as further justification for its ambitious electrification and renewable energy programs. Europe’s accelerated pivot away from Russian fossil fuels in response to the 2022 invasion of Ukraine already set a strong precedent. That policy momentum will now be amplified by fears of another sustained price spike driven by Middle Eastern conflict.

The EU’s Fit for 55 plan, its rapid expansion of charging infrastructure, and its steadfast implementation of carbon pricing mechanisms collectively position Europe to decisively reduce petroleum dependency. Policymakers across the continent clearly see electrification as the best hedge against geopolitical volatility and as a cornerstone of broader decarbonization and energy security strategies.

This doesn’t bode well for some aspects of the Netherlands, where I’m typing this prior to the start of a week of workshops with TenneT. At present, 4% of their GDP is tied up in energy and petrochemicals, with the large majority being for fossil fuels. That’s broken down as 3% fossil fuels, 0.4% petrochemicals, 0.5% transmission, and 0.05% biofuels. The country imports crude and exports petroleum products, mostly fuel for ground, water, and air transportation. The country refines the majority of shipping and aviation fuels for Europe, some 70 million of 90 million tons of demand. While longer haul shipping and aviation will continue to need liquid fuels, the volumes won’t be nearly as large as present. (These numbers are approximate and from public sources over the last few years, assembled quickly to give me a sense of scale, so where they are obviously out, the error is with me.)

I expect the roughly 120 million metric tons of liquid fuels the country exports, including bunkering for cross-border aviation and ships, will plummet to 20 million tons. The current 2.5 million tons of biofuels will expand supply. That won’t satisfy European’s demand, but biofuels will be made from European waste biomass where the biomass is — biomass won’t be shipped to the refineries of the Netherlands in my opinion.

India, meanwhile, faces a particularly stark choice. Its petroleum demand has been growing rapidly, placing significant strain on the country’s import-dependent energy economy. Note that despite having 1.4 billion citizens and being the most populous country in the world, having just overtaken China, and having a GDP that’s fifth in the world and purchasing power parity that’s third in the world, its consumption of petroleum fuels for transportation is the lowest among the four major economies under consideration. It’s still consuming a quarter of a billion tons of oil-based fuels a year.

The current crisis underscores the acute risks this dependency poses, likely prompting Indian authorities to seize the moment to accelerate their electrification efforts. With ambitious targets for electric vehicle adoption, large-scale renewables deployment, and incentives aimed at building domestic battery production capacity, India is signaling a strategic pivot. Although still at an earlier stage of transition compared to China or Europe, India’s momentum will visibly intensify in response to this latest geopolitical shock, underscoring the importance of secure, domestically-controlled energy infrastructure.

While the U.S. market reaction is dominated by short-term consumer pain rather than coordinated policy, this crisis underscores an important insight I presented on the Redefining Energy podcast earlier this year. My prediction was that 2025 would mark a decline in U.S. oil production, driven by factors such as the financial discipline imposed by investors, maturing shale assets, and limited appetite among drillers to ramp up production again quickly.

Many industry observers incorrectly assume that price spikes automatically trigger substantial new shale investment and production. However, today’s volatile environment and the profound financial uncertainty of another boom-bust cycle mean that this traditional response is no longer likely. Producers learned harsh lessons during the shale boom-and-bust of the last decade. Investors are now unwilling to bankroll new shale developments solely in response to short-term price volatility. Consequently, even this latest dramatic increase in oil prices is unlikely to lead to a meaningful resurgence in U.S. shale oil production.

Looking ahead, global liquid fuel demand is set for significant transformation. By mid-century, it is clear that electrification will dominate ground transportation markets in China, Europe, and India, with the U.S. somewhat slower but inevitably following suit. Passenger cars, buses, and trucks will become predominantly electric, driven not just by climate policies but also by national energy security strategies. Rail will all electrify, with India approaching 100% today and the U.S.A. lagging badly at present. Similarly, short-haul aviation and coastal shipping are on trajectories to embrace electrification technologies, including battery-electric and hybrid solutions. The technology required to electrify shorter routes is rapidly maturing and will be economically and strategically compelling by 2035.

However, long-haul aviation and maritime shipping face more challenging energy requirements and will largely transition to sustainable liquid biofuels. Advanced biofuel technologies, particularly sustainable aviation fuels and marine biofuels, are likely to become dominant, supported by policy frameworks that prioritize secure, low-carbon energy sources. Biofuels supplied by domestic waste biomass feedstocks — notably sewage, animal dung, food waste — are also a form of energy security, with citizens and food production for them being the source. By 2050, traditional petroleum fuels are projected to occupy a significantly diminished share of the global energy landscape, largely relegated to niche applications or regions slower in their transitions. That doesn’t apply to petrochemicals. The end of the age of oil for energy isn’t the end of the age of oil for useful molecules, we just won’t be burning them, and the volumes will be vastly smaller.

This unfolding scenario presents clear implications for policymakers and investors. Governments in China, Europe, and India are rapidly aligning their energy policies toward electrification and renewable power already, and will accelerate this, providing clarity and certainty for investors. Capital will increasingly shift away from petroleum infrastructure, including refining and pipelines, toward electricity grids, battery manufacturing, EV production, renewable power generation, and biofuel processing facilities. Conversely, investors exposed heavily to long-term petroleum infrastructure risk significant asset stranding, particularly as major markets shrink their reliance on liquid fuels in response to repeated geopolitical shocks.",https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/ChatGPT-Image-Jun-23-2025-02_39_22-PM-1-800x397.png,N,,2025-06-23 11:17:25.280628

In the evening of April 8, more than 11% of Texas electricity was coming from batteries, a record.
Meanwhile, NERC expects batteries to juice roughly one-quarter of California’s peak power demand in coming months.
Rosenow, at Oxford’s Environmental Change Institute, says big batteries are surging and affordable enough that their adoption will steepen quickly.
Trump’s spending plan also threatens to throttle big batteries and green energy projects.","In any other year, May 14 may well have been an energy disaster in Texas.

Temperatures climbed to seasonal levels not seen in over a century: 92 degrees in Dallas, 95 in Houston and 104 in Laredo. Air conditioners hummed en masse and power demand surged. Meanwhile, scores of natural-gas powered generators were offline, getting tuned up for summer.

But Texas skies were pretty sunny and windy and startups had spent the preceding months building big banks of batteries to store electricity. When power demand peaked around 4:30 in the afternoon, almost half the electricity on the grid was coming from renewables, according to the energy analytics platform GridStatus. IO. As the sun set, battery banks that had been soaking up electrons in the heat of the day stepped up to cover 8% of demand, keeping power flowing.

“Batteries are very good at handling these types of events,” said Andrew Gilligan, director of commercial strategy at Fluence Energy Inc., a battery developer with three storage sites in Texas. “Things have gotten a lot better than a couple years ago.”

This summer will be an energy doozy in the U.S. as climate change exacerbates heat waves and a rash of new data centers and crypto mines come online. But these new power vacuums arrive in concert with a stack of big batteries. America, particularly its Sun Belt, has been a gusher of renewable energy for years; now, utilities will be able to bottle up much of that sun and wind and discharge it around the clock.

In the 12 months through April — the most recent data available — energy storage in the U.S. surged from roughly 18 gigawatts to 25 gigawatts, a 41% increase, according to a Bloomberg Green analysis of federal data. In Arizona, battery bandwidth nearly tripled; in Texas, it has almost doubled. In the evening of April 8, more than 11% of Texas electricity was coming from batteries, a record.

If the U.S. is able to reach the Biden Administration’s goal of emissions-free electricity by 2035 — or even get close — batteries will be a big reason why. Renewable electricity is setting records every few days and comprised almost one-third of all U.S. power generation in March. Batteries can make sure those electrons hit at the most opportune time — or at least that they don’t go to waste. Along the way, they’ll drag electricity prices down, speed the retirement of fossil fuel plants and preclude plans for new ones, according to Jan Rosenow, head of the energy program at Oxford University’s Environmental Change Institute.

“Twenty years ago, the main problem with renewables was that they were so expensive,” Rosenow explained. “Now, renewables are cheap, but we need to be able to match that supply to demand. For that, battery storage is clearly one of the best tools in the box.”

104 million face outages

Summer is always a fraught time for grids and utilities. Cooling takes more electricity than heating and with a fast-changing climate, Americans are doing it more and more. Annual cooling degree days, an indicator of AC use, have increased 17% compared with the 1990-1999 average, according to BloombergNEF. Last summer was the fourth hottest on record in North America and meteorologists are forecasting a similarly sweaty sequel.

“An increase in heat extremes is the most obvious symptom of climate change,” Karen McKinnon, a professor who studies the statistics behind climate change at University of California at Los Angeles. “Even seemingly small changes in temperatures of a few degrees can make summers feel substantially more extreme.”

As a result, three of the continent’s six major power grids are at risk of power outages this summer, according to the North American Electric Reliability Corp. (NERC), a Washington D.C.-based nonprofit. All told 104 million Americans — roughly one in three people — live in areas where extreme heat and rising demand could shut out the lights, though NERC says the risk would be far higher without the new banks of batteries.

In Texas, for example, NERC’s odds of an energy emergency this summer have dropped from roughly 15% a few months ago to 3.6% thanks to battery capacity. Meanwhile, NERC expects batteries to juice roughly one-quarter of California’s peak power demand in coming months.

“Reliability is the ability to react to sudden changes in the grid,” explained Chris McKissack, chief executive officer of Fullmark Energy, which is building two storage sites in Texas. “And when it comes to reacting, nothing moves faster than battery storage.”

Homeowners have realized as much, adding their own small battery systems to keep the lights on and avoid time-of-use electric price peaks. Last year, residential storage surged by 64%, systems that also help lower summer demand peaks and stabilize the grid.

Last summer, there were no major power outages in the U.S., a success the Department of Energy primarily attributed to new solar generation and storage.

Officials who run the Texas grid say batteries have also been critical in lowering prices, particularly in the summer. They expect storage in the state to triple over the next five years.

Where solar was 10 years ago

To be sure, it’s still very early days for storage. In 2024, it represented just 2% of U.S. power capacity, but that’s ramping quickly. BNEF expects utility-scale battery storage to nearly double again this year regardless of how much the Trump administration manages to dial down green incentives, with some 18 gigawatts of new capacity.

Utilities and developers are building battery stacks because they are often the most affordable way to add capacity, essentially by stretching power generation that’s already built. The average price for stationary storage systems in 2024 was $125 per kWh, 19% lower than in 2023, according to BNEF.

Storage systems are also getting more resilient. A decade ago, industrial batteries generally discharged all of their electrons in 30-minutes or less. Today, the average system can put out energy for four hours straight, and some are tuned for cycles as high as eight hours. This means, they can kick in more frequently and stay on for longer, not just during brief windows in the morning and evening.

Rosenow, at Oxford’s Environmental Change Institute, says big batteries are surging and affordable enough that their adoption will steepen quickly.

“Storage is now where solar was maybe 10 years ago,” Rosenow explained. “That’s kind of how it feels to me. It’s really mind-blowing.”

As the battery blitz evolves, Rosenow says, people will pay less for electricity, outages will abate and the largest energy hogs, including AI data centers, will spool up with minimal added emissions. But there are diminishing returns.

Storage systems thrive on being able to sock in electrons when they are cheap and sell them when power prices surge. As storage capacity ramps up, those arbitrage opportunities narrow. McKissack at Fullmark says battery executives are becoming much more strategic about what they build and where.

“The race for quantity is over,” he explained. “At this point, very few of us want to bolster up the number of dots on a map.”

What’s more, recent federal tariffs will likely raise the cost of big battery projects from 12% to 50%, depending on how high the levies go and how long they stay elevated, according to Woods Mackenzie. And while American battery factories are booting up, it will be a long time before domestic supply meets even more than a small fraction of U.S. demand, the company says.

Trump’s spending plan also threatens to throttle big batteries and green energy projects. Sabah Bayatli, chief executive officer of solar and battery developer OCI Industries, traveled to Washington DC this week to encourage senators to maintain Inflation Reduction Act incentives or, at the very least, step them down gradually.

“If [the ‘big, beautiful bill’] passes as is, it’s an overnight kill for the solar industry,” he said.

Bayatli may more easily make his case after a summer of heat-wave drama and power outages, but the solar and storage that’s already been built could preclude all that.

McKissack at Fullmark concedes that most people and businesses won’t realize how big of a part renewables and batteries will play in keeping the grid healthy in coming months. Charts of disaster averted because of them aren’t all that powerful, he explained.

“It’s almost easier to talk about when there’s a blackout, but then people’s lives are at risk,” he said.",https://imengine.public.prod.pdh.navigacloud.com/?uuid=d2c18ba0-1464-5b19-9c1f-451129f91d9f&function=fit&type=preview,N,,2025-06-23 11:19:05.779771

With a focus on reducing green levies, modernizing grid infrastructure, and pouring billions into R&D, the strategy is designed to transform energy-intensive sectors into growth drivers while positioning the UK as a global leader in frontier technologies. For investors, this represents a rare alignment of policy tailwinds, structural cost advantages, and sector-specific upside—creating a compelling case for strategic allocations in undervalued equities and emerging technologies.

The Cost Advantage: Energy-Intensive Sectors Reap Immediate Benefits

The strategy's most immediate impact lies in its targeted relief for energy-intensive industries. Over 7,000 businesses in manufacturing (e.g., automotive, aerospace, chemicals) will see electricity costs drop by up to £40 per megawatt hour by 2027, thanks to exemptions from green levies like the Renewables Obligation and Capacity Market. Starting in 2026, energy-intensive sectors such as steel and ceramics will also benefit from a 60%-90% discount on network charges—a move that could slash operational costs without taxpayer subsidies.

For investors, this creates a clear opportunity in companies that operate in these sectors. Rolls-Royce, a key beneficiary of reduced aviation manufacturing costs, could see margins expand as it transitions to hybrid-electric and hydrogen propulsion systems. Similarly, Jaguar Land Rover—already pivoting to electric vehicles—may gain a competitive edge in a sector where energy efficiency is critical.

Grid Reforms: Unlocking Infrastructure and Investment Potential

The Connections Accelerator Service, set to launch by late 2025, will fast-track grid access for major projects, reducing delays and unlocking investment in renewable energy and manufacturing. This is paired with the £600 Million Strategic Sites Accelerator, which will upgrade regional infrastructure to attract private capital.

The reforms favor companies involved in grid modernization and renewable energy. National Grid and SSE—already leaders in offshore wind and grid management—are well-positioned to capitalize on this. Meanwhile, the £1 billion Great British Energy Supply Chain Fund (focusing on offshore wind, hydrogen, and advanced manufacturing) could fuel growth for firms like Sembcorp Industries (active in hydrogen infrastructure) and Siemens Gamesa (offshore wind).

R&D and AI: The Next Frontier for Scalable Growth

The strategy's £22.6 billion annual R&D investment by 2030—directed at AI, robotics, and semiconductors—offers long-term upside. Key allocations include £2 billion for the Sovereign AI Programme and £2.8 billion for advanced manufacturing. This funding aims to turn the UK into a leader in cutting-edge technologies, from quantum computing to next-gen semiconductors.

For investors, the focus should be on firms with strong R&D pipelines and partnerships. ARM Holdings (semiconductors), Graphcore (AI chips), and Babcock International (defence and advanced manufacturing) are among those poised to benefit. The Made Smarter Programme, which supports SMEs adopting automation and AI, also opens opportunities in venture capital-backed tech startups.

Strategic Timing: Act Before Competitiveness Improves

The strategy's success hinges on execution, but the policy tailwinds are already reshaping sector valuations. Energy-intensive sectors are underappreciated by markets, which have yet to price in the full impact of cost reductions and competitiveness gains. Meanwhile, R&D-backed sectors like AI and clean energy are still in early adoption phases, offering asymmetric upside.

Investors should prioritize:

1. Energy-intensive manufacturers with clear transition plans to clean tech (e.g., hydrogen, EVs).

2. Infrastructure firms exposed to grid upgrades and renewable projects.

3. R&D-driven tech companies with government partnerships in AI or quantum computing.

The risks—energy price volatility and EU-UK carbon pricing alignment—are manageable, but delays in grid reforms or regulatory hurdles could stall momentum.

Conclusion: A Structural Shift Demands Strategic Allocations

The UK's Industrial Strategy is more than policy—it's a roadmap for turning structural disadvantages into advantages. For investors, the window to capitalize on undervalued equities in energy-intensive sectors and scalable tech firms is narrowing. With cost advantages locked in and R&D pipelines firing, now is the time to position portfolios for the next phase of the UK's green industrial revolution.",,N,,2025-06-23 12:22:40.863470

Louisiana sought another shot at convincing the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit that Tesla’s lawsuit should not be allowed to move forward. But the justices declined to intervene in the case.

Tesla in 2022 sued members of the Louisiana Motor Vehicle Commission, composed of dealerships owned by individual commissioners, and the Louisiana Automobile Dealers Association, claiming they were abusing their control of the commission to take aim at Tesla’s sales model and push it from the market.

Tesla sells its vehicles directly to customers via company-owned showrooms and online, as opposed to utilizing traditional dealerships. Nine of the 18 commissioners, on the other hand, are associated with dealerships that Tesla alleges are competitors, which Musk’s company said violates its due process.

In the state’s petition to the justices, Louisiana’s attorney general argued that the 5th Circuit erred in allowing Tesla’s suit to move forward. A district court dismissed Tesla’s complaint but the appeals court revived several claims in a 2-1 decision, including the due process claim.

“In an opinion for only himself, Judge [Jerry] Smith held that Tesla plausibly alleged that the Commission’s industry-participant members possess a ‘substantial pecuniary interest’ that creates a due process problem,” Louisiana Attorney General Elizabeth Murrill wrote. “His opinion, however, never identifies such an interest; instead, the most it offers is Tesla’s alleged competitor status.”

She said the case prevents a “straightforward grant-vacate-remand (GVR) issue” for the justices, pointing to a maneuver used by the court to send a pending petition back to a lower court for reconsideration.

The clean vehicle tax credit would be essentially eliminated, and the advanced manufacturing tax credit would be severely restricted.
The choice is clear: support policies that create good union jobs, or let other countries take the lead in building the industries of the future.","In 2019, GM closed the Lordstown Complex, where I worked for 30 years. Donald Trump, president at the time, promised revival but delivered nothing.

With the rise of EVs, Lordstown got a glimmer of hope. Lordstown Assembly stayed closed, but GM formed a new company, Ultium, which opened a massive EV battery facility right around the corner, buoyed by federal subsidies for the emerging industry.

As the U.S. Senate debates Trump’s “One Big Beautiful Bill,” the people of Lordstown, Ohio, have a simple message: don’t shut us down again. I am the proud leader for the United Auto Workers in Region 2B, which covers Ohio and Indiana, and I hope the U.S. Senators representing our states will hear that message.

It is time for the Senate to stand up for our members and the working class. America must preserve clean energy and manufacturing tax credits that have given communities like Lordstown a lifeline.

These credits helped make it possible for the UAW to organize the first union battery cell manufacturing facility in the country at Ultium. There is also a new StarPlus Energy Gigafactory in Kokomo, Indiana, a joint venture between Samsung and Stellantis.

This plant was estimated to create and support 2,800 good union jobs with two facilities, with one on hold now because of the current policy uncertainty.

Just recently, workers at the StarPlus battery facility also voted to be recognized by the UAW, following in the footsteps of the workers at Ultium Cells in Lordstown.

GM is planning on building another battery plant in northern Indiana, and the companies, workers, and communities need to have stability moving forward.

Our contracts at these facilities have helped set a new standard for wages, benefits, and health and safety in EV battery manufacturing for workers everywhere. And we’re just getting started.

These targeted energy and manufacturing tax incentives have enabled billions in private investment, and hundreds of thousands of jobs are at stake. The advanced manufacturing tax credit is driving major growth in the battery supply chain, and we are organizing across the country to create tens of thousands of union battery jobs.

Meanwhile, the consumer electric vehicle tax credit has boosted demand for the batteries our members produce in Kokomo, Lordstown, and across our nation.

We’re witnessing a domestic manufacturing renaissance, and when these new jobs have the benefits that come with collective bargaining—better wages, safer working conditions, health care, retirement security, and a voice on the job — they lead to the kind of family-supporting careers that built the American Dream.

Unfortunately, the U.S. House of Representatives passed a bill that would devastate this progress and harm workers, and the Senate has so far failed to fix the bill.

This misguided legislation would gut the very tax credits that are benefiting our workers and bringing manufacturing back to America. The clean vehicle tax credit would be essentially eliminated, and the advanced manufacturing tax credit would be severely restricted.

Analysis suggests that repealing clean vehicle tax credits alone could reduce electric vehicle (EV) sales by as much as 40% by 2030, and could result in the idling of existing assembly plants and the cancellation of many planned EV battery manufacturing facilities.

The irony is stark and painful: thousands of battery workers have just voted to unionize, ensuring their jobs are high-quality and family-supporting. Now congressional Republicans are voting to kill those very same jobs.

They’re choosing to undermine American manufacturing in favor of what exactly? Tax cuts for billionaires and corporations?

This isn’t about party politics — it’s about our economic future. And the UAW has long said there is room for improvement in the design of these credits.

Too many companies taking the money are guilty of paying substandard wages and benefits, illegal union busting, and dangerous working conditions.

Subsidies like these need strings attached to protect workers; we can do better than corporate giveaways. But gutting the whole thing isn’t the answer.

Instead of kneecapping the credits, Congress should improve them: most importantly, by making wage and benefit standards a prerequisite for receiving the advanced manufacturing tax credit.

The choice is clear: support policies that create good union jobs, or let other countries take the lead in building the industries of the future.

The working class deserves leaders who will fight for our economic interests, not legislators who would rather slash taxes for the wealthy and greedy corporations while raising energy prices, sabotaging domestic manufacturing, and kicking millions off their health care to boot.

When our government invests in good, American jobs, workers, and communities win. Now it’s time for our Senators to decide if they’re on our side.

Across the country, homeowners and housing providers are struggling to afford insurance prices driven up by climate change. The Trump Administration’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) is apparently trying to accelerate that trend by gutting the federal climate data sources necessary to model and prepare for disasters, just in time for hurricane season.

The loss of public climate data will hasten insurers’ retreat, as it leaves insurers without a reliable data source to estimate potential losses. Cuts to climate data will also indirectly drive up the costs paid by consumers and taxpayers. Policyholders will invariably pay a price as public climate data sources are decimated, and the only question is how high the price will be.

State insurance commissioners, the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC), and lawmakers from climate-vulnerable states should be leading the charge to preserve U.S. climate data infrastructure. Instead, a coordinated campaign has narrowed in on the opposite priority: gutting the Federal Insurance Office (FIO), the small group in the Treasury Department responsible for tracking the costs of climate change to insurance consumers. By attacking the Treasury Department’s ability to collect insurance-related climate data, these officials could ensure the data on those collective costs will never reach the public.

By Attacking the Federal Insurance Office, States Shoot the Messenger

In January, FIO published the first and most comprehensive national dataset on how climate change is affecting homeowners’ insurance policyholders. FIO’s report detailed the rising premiums, deductibles, and insured losses that are increasingly cutting into households’ budgets. The data highlighted serious challenges in states like Florida and Louisiana, while revealing troubling trends in the Midwest. While the data only covered a limited set of residential policies and just several years, it represented the first step towards greater transparency and recognition of the tangible costs of climate change after decades of industry secrecy.

Shortly before and after the publication, a group of lawmakers and state regulators, some of whom refused previously to fully participate in the original data collection, have attacked FIO’s power to collect more data moving forward. Introduced in May by Congressman Scott Fitzgerald (R-WI), H.R. 3437 would prevent FIO from collecting any additional data from insurance companies. Another bill, H.R. 643, introduced in January by Congressman Troy Downing (R-MT), would abolish FIO entirely.

As DOGE cuts at NOAA threaten to conceal the national tally of billion-dollar disasters, gutting FIO would in turn hide everyday costs paid by consumers through their insurance premiums. Absent a national data collection authority, the public will depend on a weak and fragmented state regulatory system to voluntarily produce a patchwork of data far too slowly to respond to an unfolding crisis — if it publishes any national data at all. Even if the NAIC made a meaningful commitment to publish such data — something it has so far failed to do — it is likely that any effort would be partial and incomplete without the subpoena power held by FIO.

Those legislative proposals were also preceded by demands from a minority of state regulators. Back in November, North Carolina Insurance Commissioner Mike Causey and North Dakota Insurance Commissioner Jon Godfread called for the elimination of FIO. The following month, nine state insurance commissioners wrote a letter urging DOGE to axe FIO. This March, the NAIC, a trade group that represents state regulators and is now led by Godfread, likewise wrote to Congress listing the abolition of FIO — not climate resilience or preparing for catastrophes — as NAIC’s top priority for Congress. In appealing to DOGE, commissioners from states like Louisiana asked DOGE to eliminate the national office and instead delegate the power to fifty-six different state commissioners — hardly a model of “efficiency.”

Table 1 summarizes how officials in over half of the states have attacked FIO, the federal office with authority to collect climate-related insurance data.

Table 1

Table 2 shows mounting insurance problems in some of the states that have attacked FIO.

Even this snapshot understates the problem, given that the refusal of some states to share certain data means that we don’t know how bad things are in those places. Texas, for example, didn’t provide data on nonrenewals (when an insurer stops providing coverage instead of renewing a policy at the end of the year) or cancellation rates (when an insurer cancels a policy due to nonpayment, alleged fraud, or other factors). So while the table suggests that the state didn’t have any ZIP codes with significant increases in nonrenewal or cancellation rates, it’s likely that some jurisdictions would be in “top 100” had Texas shared data.

Table 2

To Hide From Rising Seas, State Officials Bury Their Heads in the Sand

The states whose politicians and regulators are trying to bury this data are those suffering the most from a climate-driven insurance crisis.

In states like Florida, Texas, and Louisiana, none of which fully participated in FIO’s data collection, the climate crisis has become an imminent financial threat to many households. According to NOAA’s billion-dollar disaster tracker, which is no longer being updated, Florida leads the nation in disaster losses with at least $450 billion worth of damage since 1980. The state similarly contains 37 of the top 100 ZIP codes for insurance cancellations due to nonpayment, suggesting a growing number of households in Florida are no longer able to afford rising premiums.

Louisiana is third in the nation for disaster losses since 1980 at $310 billion. The state also has 43 out of the top 100 ZIP codes across the country for nonrenewals. As large insurers have withdrawn from Louisiana and Florida, small, undercapitalized companies are proliferating and extracting quick profits. Last-resort insurance programs like Florida Citizens and Louisiana Citizens are expanding, setting up what could be a ticking time bomb for policyholders, taxpayers, and the public. What will happen if, in the wake of a catastrophic hurricane, those undercapitalized insurers are unable to pay out claims?

This game of distraction will not only harm communities in the Gulf South. Congressman Troy Downing, who introduced the bill to abolish FIO, represents the wildfire-plagued state of Montana. As longer-lasting and more destructive wildfires threaten Montana, state legislators hope to study the root causes and propose solutions; without granular data, it will be difficult to begin — let alone accomplish — any of those tasks.

Preventing the collection of insurance data will also harm the Midwest in particular, as existing data shows the Midwest is already home to the fastest premium increases and a wave of nonrenewals. Wisconsin, the home of H.R. 3437 sponsor Congressman Scott Fitzgerald, represents an unusual 10% of the top 100 ZIP codes across the country for claims frequency rate. Nebraska policyholders, likewise, have seen “unbelievable” insurance premium increases and the state is home to 5 of the top 100 ZIP codes for nonrenewals, 6 for cancellations, and 8 for claims frequency. While Nebraska Representative Mike Flood has acknowledged the threat to his constituents and Nebraska’s housing market and need for national reform, he has also co-sponsored legislation to prevent further data collection or publication.

In the absence of data, state officials may continue to obscure the root cause of climate-related insurance chaos. State officials in Louisiana, Texas, and Florida have invented an increasingly absurd series of scapegoats such as litigation costs, “woke” ESG insurance companies, and FIO. In some states, regulators and lawmakers back policies that accelerate climate change that will harm consumers. In Texas, for example, lawmakers have sought to prevent insurers from even considering climate-related risks.

Secretive State Turf Wars Turn Climate Disasters into Financial Disasters

There is ultimately no way to hide the reality of climate change from people experiencing disasters and paying through higher insurance premiums. The financial risks from climate change are already too urgent and too apparent. Cutting the tools to monitor the crisis and respond to risks will create a devastating delay for emergency planners and responders, impede the development of targeted investments for communities who need it most, and stymie efforts to develop data-driven solutions and compare the effects of interventions.

Cutting data on the financial costs of climate change will also prevent federal financial regulators from monitoring the potential for systemic risk to the economy. While large insurance companies can continue to profit as premiums rise, consumers are more likely to default on their mortgages and to take on more debt. As large insurers retreat, more households are falling onto subprime insurance that offers less coverage for higher premiums, while ballooning rosters of last-resort programs threaten to send enormous bills to the public when they run out of money to pay claims, as has happened in Florida and California. In the aftermath of back-to-back disasters, unchecked price-gouging, mortgage defaults, and a local foreclosure crisis could impact local and regional banks, creating a financial spiral that would be difficult to recover from.

Leaving it up to states to track the financial risks of climate change is a recipe for fragmentation, inequality, and failure. Instead of building a public database to identify the early warning signs of a climate-driven insurance crisis, too many state insurance regulators are focused on winning a petty turf war with a small Treasury Department office, having failed to prepare for the scale of destruction climate change has in store for the insurance markets they are responsible for protecting. As they ignore the cuts to public climate and weather data and prioritize further cuts to federal data, these regulators are not only failing to address the immediate financial concerns, but blocking others from responding too.

This is no time for turf wars. Climate-driven insurance problems are accelerating: Families are being priced out of their homes. Regional insurers are collapsing. State-run safety nets are swelling unsustainably. And instead of confronting these problems with the full force of public data and oversight, state regulators and lawmakers are working to blindfold the public and hamstring the institutions designed to help.

If Congress and federal agencies allow this campaign to succeed — if they gut the Federal Insurance Office, defund climate data, and surrender to the loudest voices in the room — they won’t just be hiding the cost of climate change. They’ll be helping to cause the next financial crisis.

We need more data, not less. We need stronger oversight, not weaker. And above all, we need leadership that acknowledges what consumers already know: the costs of climate change are mounting — and the longer we look away, the more expensive they’ll become.

It is the first big data center announced since Louisiana passed large tax breaks for data centers last summer.
Entergy has argued the new power plants are necessary to satiate the energy need from Meta’s massive hyperscale data center, which will be Meta’s largest data center and potentially the largest data center in the United States.
This is because they approve the power plants that fuel the data centers but do not have jurisdiction over the data centers themselves.
Glick says Entergy’s gas plants may not even be enough to satisfy the energy needs of Meta’s massive data center.","A massive data center for Meta’s AI will likely lead to rate hikes for Louisiana customers, but Meta wants to keep the details under wraps.

Holly Ridge is a rural community bisected by US Highway 80, gridded with farmland, with a big creek—it is literally named Big Creek—running through it. It is home to rice and grain mills and an elementary school and a few houses. Soon, it will also be home to Meta’s massive, 4 million square foot AI data center hosting thousands of perpetually humming servers that require billions of watts of energy to power. And that energy-guzzling infrastructure will be partially paid for by Louisiana residents.

The plan is part of what Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg said would be “a defining year for AI.” On Threads, Zuckerberg boasted that his company was “building a 2GW+ datacenter that is so large it would cover a significant part of Manhattan,” posting a map of Manhattan along with the data center overlaid. Zuckerberg went on to say that over the coming years, AI “will drive our core products and business, unlock historic innovation, and extend American technology leadership. Let's go build! 💪”

What Zuckerberg did not mention is that ""Let's go build"" refers not only to the massive data center but also three new Meta-subsidized, gas power plants and a transmission line to fuel it serviced by Entergy Louisiana, the region’s energy monopoly.

Key details about Meta’s investments with the data center remain vague, and Meta’s contracts with Entergy are largely cloaked from public scrutiny. But what is known is the $10 billion data center has been positioned as an enormous economic boon for the area—one that politicians bent over backward to facilitate—and Meta said it will invest $200 million into “local roads and water infrastructure.”

A January report from NOLA.com said that the the state had rewritten zoning laws, promised to change a law so that it no longer had to put state property up for public bidding, and rewrote what was supposed to be a tax incentive for broadband internet meant to bridge the digital divide so that it was only an incentive for data centers, all with the goal of luring in Meta.

But Entergy Louisiana’s residential customers, who live in one of the poorest regions of the state, will see their utility bills increase to pay for Meta’s energy infrastructure, according to Entergy’s application. Entergy estimates that amount will be small and will only cover a transmission line, but advocates for energy affordability say the costs could balloon depending on whether Meta agrees to finish paying for its three gas plants 15 years from now. The short-term rate increases will be debated in a public hearing before state regulators that has not yet been scheduled.

The Alliance for Affordable Energy called it a “black hole of energy use,” and said “to give perspective on how much electricity the Meta project will use: Meta’s energy needs are roughly 2.3x the power needs of Orleans Parish … it’s like building the power impact of a large city overnight in the middle of nowhere.”

404 Media reached out to Entergy for comment but did not receive a response.

By 2030, Entergy’s electricity prices are projected to increase 90 percent from where they were in 2018, although the company attributes much of that to damage to infrastructure from hurricanes. The state already has a high energy cost burden in part because of a storm damage to infrastructure, and balmy heat made worse by climate change that drives air conditioner use. The state's homes largely are not energy efficient, with many porous older buildings that don’t retain heat in the winter or remain cool in the summer.

“You don't just have high utility bills, you also have high repair costs, you have high insurance premiums, and it all contributes to housing insecurity,” said Andreanecia Morris, a member of Housing Louisiana, which is opposed to Entergy’s gas plant application. She believes Meta’s data center will make it worse. And Louisiana residents have reasons to distrust Entergy when it comes to passing off costs of new infrastructure: in 2018, the company’s New Orleans subsidiary was caught paying actors to testify on behalf of a new gas plant. “The fees for the gas plant have all been borne by the people of New Orleans,” Morris said.

In its application to build new gas plants and in public testimony, Entergy says the cost of Meta’s data center to customers will be minimal and has even suggested Meta’s presence will make their bills go down. But Meta’s commitments are temporary, many of Meta’s assurances are not binding, and crucial details about its deal with Entergy are shielded from public view, a structural issue with state energy regulators across the country.

AI data centers are being approved at a breakneck pace across the country, particularly in poorer regions where they are pitched as economic development projects to boost property tax receipts, bring in jobs and where they’re offered sizable tax breaks. Data centers typically don’t hire many people, though, with most jobs in security and janitorial work, along with temporary construction work. And the costs to the utility’s other customers can remain hidden because of a lack of scrutiny and the limited power of state energy regulators. Many data centers—like the one Meta is building in Holly Ridge—are being powered by fossil fuels. This has led to respiratory illness and other health risks and emitting greenhouse gasses that fuel climate change. In Memphis, a massive data center built to launch a chatbot for Elon Musks’ AI company is powered by smog-spewing methane turbines, in a region that leads the state for asthma rates.

“In terms of how big these new loads are, it's pretty astounding and kind of a new ball game,” said Paul Arbaje, an energy analyst with the Union of Concerned Scientists, which is opposing Entergy’s proposal to build three new gas-powered plants in Louisiana to power Meta’s data center.

Entergy Louisiana submitted a request to the state’s regulatory body to approve the construction of the new gas-powered plants that would create 2.3 gigawatts of power and cost $3.2 billion in the 1440 acre Franklin Farms megasite in Holly Ridge, an unincorporated community of Richland Parish. It is the first big data center announced since Louisiana passed large tax breaks for data centers last summer.

In its application to the public utility commission for gas plants, Entergy says that Meta has a planned investment of $5 billion in the region to build the gas plants in Richland Parish, Louisiana, where it claims in its application that the data center will employ 300-500 people with an average salary of $82,000 in what it points out is “a region of the state that has long struggled with a lack of economic development and high levels of poverty.” Meta’s official projection is that it will employ more than 500 people once the data center is operational. Entergy plans for the gas plants to be online by December 2028.

In testimony, Entergy officials refused to answer specific questions about job numbers, saying that the numbers are projections based on public statements from Meta.

A spokesperson for Louisiana’s Economic Development told 404 Media in an email that Meta “is contractually obligated to employ at least 500 full-time employees in order to receive incentive benefits.”

When asked about jobs, Meta pointed to a public facing list of its data centers, many of which the company says employ more than 300 people. A spokesperson said that the projections for the Richland Parish site are based on the scale of the 4 million square foot data center. The spokesperson said the jobs will include “engineering and other technical positions to operational roles and our onsite culinary staff.”

When asked if its job commitments are binding, the spokesperson declined to answer, saying, “We worked closely with Richland Parish and Louisiana Economic Development on mutually beneficial agreements that will support long-term growth in the area.”

Others are not as convinced. “Show me a data center that has that level of employment,” says Logan Burke, executive director of the Alliance for Affordable Energy in Louisiana.

Entergy has argued the new power plants are necessary to satiate the energy need from Meta’s massive hyperscale data center, which will be Meta’s largest data center and potentially the largest data center in the United States. It amounts to a 25 percent increase in Entergy Louisiana’s current load, according to the Alliance for Affordable Energy.

Entergy requested an exemption from a state law meant to ensure that it develops energy at the lowest cost by issuing a public request for proposals, claiming in its application and testimony that this would slow them down and cause them to lose their contracts with Meta.

Meta has agreed to subsidize the first 15 years of payments for construction of the gas plants, but the plant’s construction is being financed over 30 years. At the 15 year mark, its contract with Entergy ends. At that point, Meta may decide it doesn’t need three gas plants worth of energy because computing power has become more efficient or because its AI products are not profitable enough. Louisiana residents would be stuck with the remaining bill.

“It's not that they're paying the cost, they're just paying the mortgage for the time that they're under contract,” explained Devi Glick, an electric utility analyst with Synapse Energy.

When asked about the costs for the gas plants, a Meta spokesperson said, “Meta works with our utility partners to ensure we pay for the full costs of the energy service to our data centers.” The spokesperson said that any rate increases will be reviewed by the Louisiana Public Service Commission. These applications, called rate cases, are typically submitted by energy companies based on a broad projection of new infrastructure projects and energy needs.

Meta has technically not finalized its agreement with Entergy but Glick believes the company has already invested enough in the endeavor that it is unlikely to pull out now. Other companies have been reconsidering their gamble on AI data centers: Microsoft reversed course on centers requiring a combined 2 gigawatts of energy in the U.S. and Europe. Meta swept in to take on some of the leases, according to Bloomberg.

And in the short-term, Entergy is asking residential customers to help pay for a new transmission line for the gas plants at a cost of more than $500 million, according to Entergy’s application to Louisiana’s public utility board. In its application, the energy giant said customers’ bills will only rise by $1.66 a month to offset the costs of the transmission lines. Meta, for its part, said it will pay up to $1 million a year into a fund for low-income customers. When asked about the costs of the new transmission line, a Meta spokesperson said, “Like all other new customers joining the transmission system, one of the required transmission upgrades will provide significant benefits to the broader transmission system. This transmission upgrade is further in distance from the data center, so it was not wholly assigned to Meta.”

When Entergy was questioned in public testimony on whether the new transmission line would need to be built even without Meta’s massive data center, the company declined to answer, saying the question was hypothetical.

Some details of Meta’s contract with Entergy have been made available to groups legally intervening in Entergy’s application, meaning that they can submit testimony or request data from the company. These parties include the Alliance for Affordable Energy, the Sierra Club and the Union of Concerned Scientists.

But Meta—which will become Entergy’s largest customer by far and whose presence will impact the entire energy grid—is not required to answer questions or divulge any information to the energy board or any other parties. The Alliance for Affordable Energy and Union of Concerned Scientists attempted to make Meta a party to Entergy’s application—which would have required it to share information and submit to questioning—but a judge denied that motion on April 4.

The public utility commissions that approve energy infrastructure in most states are the main democratic lever to assure that data centers don’t negatively impact consumers. But they have no oversight over the tech companies running the data centers or the private companies that build the centers, leaving residential customers, consumer advocates and environmentalists in the dark. This is because they approve the power plants that fuel the data centers but do not have jurisdiction over the data centers themselves.

“This is kind of a relic of the past where there might be some energy service agreement between some large customer and the utility company, but it wouldn't require a whole new energy facility,” Arbaje said.

A research paper by Ari Peskoe and Eliza Martin published in March looked at 50 regulatory cases involving data centers, and found that tech companies were pushing some of the costs onto utility customers through secret contracts with the utilities. The paper found that utilities were often parroting rhetoric from AI boosting politicians—including President Biden—to suggest that pushing through permitting for AI data center infrastructure is a matter of national importance.

“The implication is that there’s no time to act differently,” the authors wrote.

In written testimony sent to the public service commission, Entergy CEO Phillip May argued that the company had to bypass a legally required request for proposals and requirement to find the cheapest energy sources for the sake of winning over Meta.

“If a prospective customer is choosing between two locations, and if that customer believes that location A can more quickly bring the facility online than location B, that customer is more likely to choose to build at location A,” he wrote.

Entergy also argues that building new gas plants will in fact lower electricity bills because Meta, as the largest customer for the gas plants, will pay a disproportionate share of energy costs. Naturally, some are skeptical that Entergy would overcharge what will be by far their largest customer to subsidize their residential customers. “They haven't shown any numbers to show how that's possible,” Burke says of this claim. Meta didn’t have a response to this specific claim when asked by 404 Media.

Some details, like how much energy Meta will really need, the details of its hiring in the area and its commitment to renewables are still cloaked in mystery.

“We can't ask discovery. We can't depose. There's no way for us to understand the agreement between them without [Meta] being at the table,” Burke said.

It’s not just Entergy. Big energy companies in other states are also pushing out costly fossil fuel infrastructure to court data centers and pushing costs onto captive residents. In Kentucky, the energy company that serves the Louisville area is proposing 2 new gas plants for hypothetical data centers that have yet to be contracted by any tech company. The company, PPL Electric Utilities, is also planning to offload the cost of new energy supply onto its residential customers just to become more competitive for data centers.

“It's one thing if rates go up so that customers can get increased reliability or better service, but customers shouldn't be on the hook to pay for new power plants to power data centers,” Cara Cooper, a coordinator with Kentuckians for Energy Democracy, which has intervened on an application for new gas plants there.

These rate increases don’t take into account the downstream effects on energy; as the supply of materials and fuel are inevitably usurped by large data center load, the cost of energy goes up to compensate, with everyday customers footing the bill, according to Glick with Synapse.

Glick says Entergy’s gas plants may not even be enough to satisfy the energy needs of Meta’s massive data center. In written testimony, Glick said that Entergy will have to either contract with a third party for more energy or build even more plants down the line to fuel Meta’s massive data center.

To fill the gap, Entergy has not ruled out lengthening the life of some of its coal plants, which it had planned to close in the next few years. The company already pushed back the deactivation date of one of its coal plants from 2028 to 2030.

The increased demand for gas power for data centers has already created a widely-reported bottleneck for gas turbines, the majority of which are built by 3 companies. One of those companies, Siemens Energy, told Politico that turbines are “selling faster than they can increase manufacturing capacity,” which the company attributed to data centers.

Most of the organizations concerned about the situation in Louisiana view Meta’s massive data center as inevitable and are trying to soften its impact by getting Entergy to utilize more renewables and make more concrete economic development promises.

Andreanecia Morris, with Housing Louisiana, believes the lack of transparency from public utility commissions is a bigger problem than just Meta. “Simply making Meta go away, isn't the point,” Morris says. “The point has to be that the Public Service Commission is held accountable.”

Burke says Entergy owns less than 200 megawatts of renewable energy in Louisiana, a fraction of the fossil fuels it is proposing to fuel Meta’s center. Entergy was approved by Louisiana’s public utility commission to build out three gigawatts of solar energy last year , but has yet to build any of it.

“They're saying one thing, but they're really putting all of their energy into the other,” Burke says.

New gas plants are hugely troubling for the climate. But ironically, advocates for affordable energy are equally concerned that the plants will lie around disused - with Louisiana residents stuck with the financing for their construction and upkeep. Generative AI has yet to prove its profitability and the computing heavy strategy of American tech companies may prove unnecessary given less resource intensive alternatives coming out of China.

“There's such a real threat in such a nascent industry that what is being built is not what is going to be needed in the long run,” said Burke. “The challenge remains that residential rate payers in the long run are being asked to finance the risk, and obviously that benefits the utilities, and it really benefits some of the most wealthy companies in the world, But it sure is risky for the folks who are living right next door.”

The Alliance for Affordable Energy expects the commission to make a decision on the plants this fall.",https://www.404media.co/content/images/size/w1200/2025/06/CleanShot-2025-06-22-at-12.34.22@2x.png,N,,2025-06-23 11:22:37.782593

1. Clean energy progress speeds up

After several years of slow momentum, the energy transition has accelerated, according to the World Economic Forum's Fostering Effective Energy Transition 2025 report.

The Energy Transition Index (ETI), which benchmarks 118 countries on their current energy system performance and the readiness of their enabling environment, shows the fastest progress since before the pandemic.

In 2025, 65% of countries improved their ETI scores and 28% advanced across all core dimensions – security, sustainability and equity.

Here are some more key findings from the report:

Sweden, Finland, Denmark, Norway and Switzerland top the index, driven by strong policy commitment, infrastructure and clean-energy diversification.

Emerging Europe posted the biggest gains, while emerging Asia outpaced the global average.

Despite $2 trillion in clean-energy investment in 2024, energy security stalled and emissions hit record highs, underscoring the need for resilient grids, digital infrastructure and targeted capital flows.

Energy systems are evolving at varying speeds, and staying on track with the transition to renewables demands urgent investment in fast-growing emerging economies. Read the new report here.

2. 5 strategies for a resilient and competitive energy system

The Forum's latest Energy Transition Index report may show a global annual improvement, but it also highlights how vulnerable energy systems are to external forces, such as demand pressures, geopolitical shifts and bottlenecks in infrastructure.

It's clear that resilient and inclusive energy systems are not just a climate imperative, but will be foundational for future economic competitiveness and security.

In a recent blog, we outlined five strategies needed to create such systems:

Adopt stable, adaptive policy frameworks that drive long-term investment and support cooperation.

Modernize energy infrastructure, especially grids and storage.

Invest in skilled talent to help boost innovation and execution capacity.

Accelerate clean-tech commercialization, especially in hard-to-abate sectors.

Enhance capital investment in developing economies.

Recent developments in the Middle East have heightened attention on the Strait of Hormuz, a key maritime route that carries around 20% of the world’s oil supply, prompting concerns about potential impacts on global energy flows and price stability.

Global energy companies are ramping up gas investments in South-East Asia as they seek to meet surging power demand fueled by the region’s growing AI sector. The move reflects a broader shift towards securing energy supplies for data centres and digital infrastructure.

Tightening supplies of critical minerals such as lithium and copper could threaten global energy security, International Energy Agency (IEA) chief Fatih Birol has written in the Financial Times. He urged governments and industry to accelerate innovation and investment as demand for these minerals rises with the energy transition.

What's the World Economic Forum doing about the transition to clean energy?

Moving to clean energy is key to combating climate change, yet in the past five years, the energy transition has stagnated.

Energy consumption and production contribute to two-thirds of global emissions, and 81% of the global energy system is still based on fossil fuels, the same percentage as 30 years ago. Plus, improvements in the energy intensity of the global economy (the amount of energy used per unit of economic activity) are slowing. In 2018 energy intensity improved by 1.2%, the slowest rate since 2010.

Effective policies, private-sector action and public-private cooperation are needed to create a more inclusive, sustainable, affordable and secure global energy system.

Benchmarking progress is essential to a successful transition. The World Economic Forum’s Energy Transition Index, which ranks 115 economies on how well they balance energy security and access with environmental sustainability and affordability, shows that the biggest challenge facing energy transition is the lack of readiness among the world’s largest emitters, including US, China, India and Russia. The 10 countries that score the highest in terms of readiness account for only 2.6% of global annual emissions.

To future-proof the global energy system, the Forum’s Centre for Energy & Materials is working on initiatives including Clean Power and Electrification, Energy and Industry Transition Intelligence, Industrial Ecosystems Transformation, and Transition Enablers to encourage and enable innovative energy investments, technologies and solutions.

Additionally, the Mission Possible Partnership (MPP) is working to assemble public and private partners to further the industry transition to set heavy industry and mobility sectors on the pathway towards net-zero emissions. MPP is an initiative created by the World Economic Forum and the Energy Transitions Commission.

The new plant has an annual production capacity of 1GW The plant adopts TOPCon technology and produces modules with a peak power of 720W for a single set, with a potential efficiency of 26%.

The plant, operated by Trina Solar Indonesia (TMAI) and located in the Kendal Special Economic Zone (SEZ), is a joint venture between China's Trina Solar, Cotai Group's Dian Swastatika Sentosa, state-owned utilities PLN Indonesia Power Renewable and Agra Surya Energy. Energy to jointly build it, TMAI will fulfill its commitment to absorb the local workforce, saying that about 60 percent of its 640 employees are residents of Kendall and surrounding areas.

As of June 2024, Indonesia's domestic solar module production capacity grew by 2.3%, according to Indonesia's Ministry of Industry. Currently, local solar panels are 30-45% more expensive than imported alternatives, largely due to the lack of key certifications that limit financing.TMAI is the first domestic manufacturer to receive KIR1 (Local Content) certification, simplifying access to financing through financial institutions.

Indonesia's Minister of Industry for its inauguration emphasized that the synergistic layout of solar cell and module production, to create an integrated ecology of Indonesia's renewable energy industry has a core value, pointing out that this type of plant is of great significance to Indonesia's clean energy roadmap to reduce import dependence, cultivate the local green manufacturing capacity, and to promote the local module products to be more competitive than imports, so as to achieve the long-term vision of independent and controllable energy technology! The government hopes that the solar module industry will break through the positioning of technology suppliers and become a driving force in building economic sovereignty and job creation in the clean energy sector.

In order to support the renewable energy target, Indonesia has set a target of obtaining 52.8GW of electricity from renewable energy sources (of which 17.1GW is expected to come from solar energy) from 2025-2034, and TMAI's new factory will directly contribute to this target by boosting the local production capacity and reducing the reliance on overseas imports.

Solar manufacturing alone accounted for announced investments of $45.8 billion, according to the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA), since federal manufacturing policies were enacted in 2022. SEIA reports that $9.1 billion of these are operational, $15.6 billion are under active construction, and another $21.1 billion manufacturing investments are under development.

In May alone, $1.4 billion in new factories and clean energy projects were canceled or in jeopardy of being canceled, according to the latest monthly analysis of clean energy projects tracked by E2 and Clean Economy Tracker. Among the recent factory cancellations are REC Silicon, Kore Power and Meyer Burger. The projects that E2 reported were cancelled in May were expected to create at least 1,000 new jobs. In addition, 600 workers were laid off across five closures announced in May.

In the first five months of 2025, E2 reports that the cancellations, which include solar module as well as battery and electric vehicle facilities, total $15.5 billion and were expected to create 12,000 new jobs.

The 45X Advanced Manufacturing Tax Credit was extended through 2034 by the federal legislation in 2022, but that may change if the Senate proposed bill passes as it ends 45X one year earlier and brings uncertainty due to restrictions on sourcing from Foreign Entities of Concern (FEOC). The draft proposal goes to the full Senate for a vote and then back to the House.

Republican congressional districts have fared well since passage of the 2022 legislations with clean energy manufacturing facilities as well as solar and wind energy installations. E2 reports that through May of this year, 62% of all clean energy projects announced, along with 71% of all jobs and 82% of all investments, are in congressional districts represented by Republicans.

The E2 report notes, however, that these districts are losing the most with more than $9 billion in investments and almost 10,000 jobs already cancelled, delayed or closed in Republican districts so far in 2025.

“The consequences of continued policy uncertainty and the expectation of higher taxes on clean energy businesses are becoming painfully clear. Businesses are reacting to the Senate’s proposal—like the House’s— that would drastically scale back the very tax credits that had been driving an American energy and manufacturing boom,” said Michael Timberlake, E2 communications director. “These cancellations are just the first shoe to drop. With renewable energy supplying more than 90 percent of new electricity in America last year, canceled projects will likely mean less available energy and higher electricity prices for consumers and business alike.”

While cancellations abound, businesses also announced in May nearly $450 million in investments for new solar, EV and grid and transmission equipment factories across five states, the report states. This includes Rivian’s $120 million investment to build 1.2 million-square-foot EV supplier park in Illinois that is expected to create 100 new jobs.

Among independents, support declined from 49% in 2022 to 28%.
The poll found three-quarters of Democrats support providing consumer rebates for efficient home appliances, compared with 6 in 10 Republicans.","Americans’ support for green energy tax credits and renewable energies like wind and solar power has decreased in recent years, according to a new poll, driven by a softening in support from Democrats and independents.

The poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research finds that U.S. adults’ support for tax credits for electric vehicles and solar panels has weakened, as well as their enthusiasm for offshore wind farm expansion. While Democrats remain the strongest supporters of these initiatives, the poll reveals signs of growing cynicism within their ranks.

The poll results coincide with sweeping changes President Donald Trump’s Republican administration is making to regulations related to energy and climate change, including slashing the federal workforce in these departments. And although Democrats and independents have weakened their support for some green energy initiatives, there has not been an increase in support for Trump’s energy policies.

The poll found only about 4 in 10 U.S. adults — including only 1 in 10 Democrats and about 2 in 10 independents, along with three-quarters of Republicans — approve of the way Trump is handling climate change, which largely tracks with his overall approval rating.

Democrats and independents drive decline in support for renewable energy credits

About 6 in 10 Democrats, 58%, favor tax credits for purchasing an electric vehicle, down from about 7 in 10 in 2022. Among independents, support declined from 49% in 2022 to 28%. Only one-quarter of Republicans supported this policy in 2022, and that hasn’t changed measurably.

“As far as the pollution goes … the vehicles nowadays put out very little emissions to the air,” said JD Johnson, a 62-year-old Democrat from Meadowview, Virginia, who somewhat opposes tax credits to purchase an electric vehicle. That’s partly because he sees the electric vehicle manufacturing process as energy intensive and believes gasoline-powered vehicles have made improvements with the pollutants they emit.

The decline in favoring solar panel tax credits was across the board rather than being concentrated among Democrats.

“For solar panels, in all honesty, I don’t think they’re that efficient yet,” said Glenn Savage, 78, a left-leaning independent from Rock Hill, South Carolina. “I’d rather see them pour money into research and try to get the solar panels more efficient before they start giving tax breaks to the public. I may be wrong on that, but that’s just my thought.”

Scientists say transitioning to renewable energies and ditching fossil fuels that release planet-warming emissions are essential to protect the planet. Billions of dollars in project grants for clean technologies awarded during President Joe Biden’s Democratic administration have been canceled by the Trump administration, and the offshore wind sector has been stunted by Trump’s executive order that paused approvals, permits and loans for wind energy projects.

Fewer than half of U.S. adults, 44%, now say that offshore wind farms should be expanded in the U.S., down from 59% in 2022. About half favor expanding solar panel farms, while about two-thirds were in support in 2022.

When people are concerned about the economy and their personal finances, environmental issues are sometimes prioritized less, said Talbot Andrews, an assistant professor in the department of government at Cornell University who was not involved in the poll.

“I think it makes people anxious to think about increased taxes or increased spending on environmental issues when the cost of eggs are going through the roof,” Andrews said.

Low support for Trump’s efforts to expand offshore drilling and coal mining

Trump has championed the expansion of offshore oil drilling, as well as domestic coal production.

Despite a decline in support for expanded renewable energies, the new poll shows that only about one-third of U.S. adults think offshore drilling for oil and natural gas should be expanded in the U.S., and only about one-quarter say this about coal mining.

In both cases, Republicans are much more likely than Democrats to support expanding these energy sources.

Trump has sought to open up national monuments for oil drilling, but more U.S. adults oppose than support auctioning off more public space for oil drilling. Only about one-quarter of U.S. adults favor this, while 4 in 10 are opposed. Republicans are much more likely than independents or Democrats to be in support.

Bipartisan support for consumerrebates and home appliance ratings

The Energy Star program that certifies appliances, such as dishwashers and refrigerators, as energy efficient recently appeared in headlines when the EPA made plans to scrap the program. The blue and white logo is well recognized, and experts say the program has long had bipartisan support until recently.

The poll found three-quarters of Democrats support providing consumer rebates for efficient home appliances, compared with 6 in 10 Republicans.

Patrick Buck, 54, from Chicago, describes himself as a liberal Republican and is a fan of the consumer rebates for energy-efficient appliances. “It seems to work in terms of transforming what people have in their houses, because a lot of people have a lot of old appliances and just can’t afford new ones,” he said.

Safe air, water, meat and produce

The poll found only about 2 in 10 U.S. adults are “extremely” or “very” confident in the federal government’s ability to ensure the safety of their drinking water, the air they breathe and the meat, poultry, fruits and vegetables they buy in grocery stores.

About 4 in 10 U.S. adults are “somewhat” confident in the federal government’s ability to ensure the safety of each of these, and about 4 in 10 are “not very” or “not at all” confident.

The Trump administration has announced plans to roll back rules and policies related to limiting pollution and greenhouse gas emissions, such as rules that limit pollution from power plants and blocking California’s efforts to phase out cars that run on gas. The federal government has also cut staff at the Food and Drug Administration, the federal agency tasked with protecting public health and ensuring food supply safety.

CATL, the world's largest battery manufacturer, alongside its subsidiary Brunp Recycling (Brunp), is pioneering a circular approach to battery and battery material management that transforms this challenge into an opportunity.

Company background

Contemporary Amperex Technology Co., Limited, known as ‘CATL’, is a global leader in battery manufacturing committed to increasing the proportion of recycled materials in its batteries. Founded in 2011, the company sells batteries to major automotive manufacturers, including BMW, Tesla, Toyota, and Volkswagen. Headquartered in Ningde, Fujian province, CATL operates 11 plants across China and one in Europe and employs over 100,000 workers globally, including nearly 20,000 R&D engineers.

CATL has invested heavily in expanding recycling processing capacity throughout China, and in 2015 it acquired Brunp, the world’s largest battery recycling company. Brunp produces cathode precursor materials using multiple feedstock sources, including a growing proportion of critical minerals recovered from used EV batteries. The majority of Brunp’s output feeds directly back into CATL's battery manufacturing processes.

Together, CATL and Brunp are building a circular battery value chain that, if scaled across the industry, could create new forms of value while reducing exposure to supply disruptions and the risks of material price volatility.

As a leader in battery production, CATL recognises the need to apply circular economycircular economyA systems solution framework that tackles global challenges like climate change, biodiversity loss, waste, and pollution. It is based on three principles, driven by design: eliminate waste and pollution, circulate products and materials (at their highest value), and regenerate nature. principles across its activities to reduce supply chain emissions and environmental impact. CATL’s commitment to circularity has been formalised through its Strategic Partnership with the Ellen MacArthur Foundation, making it the first renewable technology leader in the Foundation's Network.

From design to recycling: building circularity across the whole battery lifecycle

CATL is implementing multiple complementary circular strategies in its production to increase use of materials and the efficiency of recycling:

Designing batteries with long life and easy disassembly

Monitoring and optimising performance throughout use to maximise service life

Promoting battery swapping which can optimise charging and maintenance regime, extending the useful life of batteries

Implementing ‘cascade utilisation’ by repurposing batteries for less intensive applications

Recycling to recover valuable materials for reincorporation into new battery production

These circular strategies can be examined at product and material level:

1. Product level

Extending life-span and maximising value through reuse and innovative service models.

When batteries no longer meet the demanding performance requirements of EVs, many can still provide years of productive service in less intensive applications. Through reusereuseThe repeated use of a product or component for its intended purpose without significant modification. applications and circular business models like rental, buy-back, and upgrade services, CATL ensures batteries remain in productive use for significantly longer periods.

Reuse applications

When batteries are no longer suitable for EVs but maintain functional capacity, CATL assesses their remaining health and redirects them to less demanding applications. Referred to as ‘cascade utilisation’, this can extend battery useful life by 5-10 years beyond its original automotive lifespan, through deployment in stationary energy storage systems, backup power systems, grid stabilisation applications, and logistics vehicles with lower performance requirements. Cascade utilisation maximises the value gained from the original manufacturing investment and embedded resources.

Circular business models

CATL has diversified its battery offerings to embrace circular business models that transform how citizens can access EV technology. Given that batteries represent 30-40% of an EV’s total cost, CATL's Rent or Buy Back models could help address the cost barrier to EV adoption, making EVs more accessible to a much broader demographic while also ensuring batteries return to CATL for proper circular management at end of life. Chinese car manufacturer Nio, which uses CATL batteries, reports that 70% of its customers choose ‘battery-as-a-service’, reducing the barrier to entry by at least 70,000 Yuan (USD 9,870).

CATL’s Swap or Upgrade service-oriented models offer an alternative to charging, giving flexibility to customers while facilitating material circularity. The upgrade option is particularly valuable, allowing customers to benefit from rapid advances in battery technology while retaining components and materials in the remainder of the vehicle, potentially reducing overall material and resource consumption. These models allow CATL to retain relationships with customers throughout the battery lifecycle while ensuring battery materials are kept in controlled loops.

2. Material level

Scaling up the quantity and quality of material recovery and recycling.

When batteries reach the end of their useful life, many of the metals and materials contained within can be recovered, processed, and refined into high-quality materials for new battery production. To recover these valuable minerals, CATL relies on the infrastructure and processes provided by Brunp, which has recycling facilities strategically distributed around China.

“We recycle batteries not only because it’s environmentally responsible, but because it creates long-term economic value and supports the development of a resilient, circular global supply chain.”

Dr. Robin Zeng, Founder and Chairman of CATL

Speaking at the One World Summit, Hong Kong, May 2024

The three-stage recycling process

Brunp's operational process involves three critical stages to recover key minerals that can be used in new batteries.

Physical Disassembly: Batteries are safely dismantled to separate key components.

Hydrometallurgy: Chemical processes extract valuable metals from battery components.

Precursor Synthesis: Recovered materials are processed into cathode precursors that can be blended with virgin minerals to create high-quality cathode materials for new batteries.

Brunp three stage recycling system

Flexible feedstock approach

Brunp relies on four potential types of feedstock to produce its battery precursor materials: virgin minerals mainly from the Global South, production scrap from CATL factories, used EV batteries, and black mass (used batteries that have undergone primary processing).

While the company currently relies on virgin minerals for the majority of its battery material production, its infrastructure enables it to dynamically adjust the volume of incoming feedstock from used EV batteries as supply increases. Within 10 years, Brunp aims for its predominant feedstock to be recovered materials, moving CATL towards a decoupling of battery production from virgin minerals.",https://images.ctfassets.net/isq5xwjfoz2m/7Dcf4Xuitvhh5b6iJ7LvJN/dfa07acbca0245db08ca6448c084d83d/MP_-_CATL_Case_Study.png,N,,2025-06-23 13:16:55.950630

The Republican Party’s “One Big Beautiful Bill” passed the U.S. House of Representatives on May 22nd, marking an early but significant step in the legislative process. On June 16th, the Senate Finance Committee released its draft legislative text, offering a clearer picture of how the bill may evolve as it moves through the Senate. While the legislation is likely to undergo revisions as it moves through the process, the Senate draft highlights key differences from the House-passed bill, such as permanent extensions on many corporate tax provisions, modifications to international rules, and a limited expansion of the SALT deduction.

Republican lawmakers remain committed to an expedited timeline, aiming to pass the bill by July 4th. As such, understanding the most notable proposed changes is essential for anticipating the potential impact of sweeping tax law reforms.

Business Provisions

Bonus Depreciation (Section 168(k))

The Senate Finance Committee’s draft legislation would permanently extend the 100% bonus depreciation for property placed in service on or after January 19, 2025. This a departure from the House-passed bill which proposed a temporary reinstatement of 100% bonus depreciation through 2029.

The permanent extension eliminates the previously scheduled phase-down, which had reduced bonus depreciation to 80% in 2023 and was set to phase out entirely by 2027. This proposal offers some long-term certainty for businesses planning capital investments.

Research & Development (“R&D”) Expensing (Section 174)

The Senate Finance Committee’s draft legislation proposes a permanent repeal of the TCJA’s requirement to amortize domestic R&D expenses, allowing for immediate expensing of such costs starting in tax year 2025. This again goes further than the House-passed bill, which would have allowed expensing of those domestic R&D costs only through 2029.

In addition, the Senate draft includes a retroactive provision, permitting taxpayers to accelerate remaining deductions for domestic R&D expenses incurred between January 1, 2022, and December 31, 2024, over a one or two-year period. This retroactivity would be welcome relief for businesses that have already been impacted by the amortization rules and offers a planning opportunity for amended returns or accounting method changes.

This rollback of TCJA’s amortization requirements, both permanently in the Senate text and temporarily in the House text, would reduce taxable income in years with heavy R&D spending, easing financial strain on startups and innovation-focused businesses.

Interest Expense Deductions (Section 163(j))

The TCJA reduced the amount of interest expense a company can deduct, shifting from 30% of Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization (EBITDA) to 30% of Earnings Before Interest and Taxes (EBIT). The Senate Finance Committee’s draft legislation would reinstate EBITDA-based limitation for business interest expense deductions under 163(j) for tax year 2025 onward. Unlike the House-passed bill, which would sunset the provision after 2029, the Senate draft does not propose an end date, leaving the change permanent subject to further negotiations.

This add back of depreciation for interest expense deductions would be particularly beneficial for capital-intensive businesses or those relying on debt to fund growth, as it increases the amount of deductible interest under the more generous pre-2022 calculation method.

Pass-Through Entity Provisions

Qualified Business Interest (“QBI”) Deduction (Section 199A)

The TCJA currently allows pass-through entities to deduct up to 20% of their qualified business income. The Senate draft legislation would make that current 20% QBI deduction for pass-through entities permanent without increasing it to the 23% that was proposed in the House-passed bill. This more conservative approach on the Senate side would also exclude certain entities, such as Business Development Companies (BDCs), from eligibility.

Pass-Through Entity Tax Deduction Limits

Unlike the House-passed bill, which proposed narrowing the availability of the state and local tax (SALT) deduction for partners and shareholders and excluding Specified Service Trades or Businesses (SSTBs), the Senate draft does not include the same SSTB exclusion. Instead, it applies a general limitation on pass-through entity SALT deductions, but with fewer restrictions on eligible business types.

Excess Business Losses (Section 461(I))

Section 461(I) currently limits the amount of business losses that non-corporate taxpayers can deduct against non-business income. The Senate legislative text would make the excess business loss limitation permanent. This aligns with the House version and means that non-corporate taxpayers would continue to face limits on the amount of business losses they would be able to deduct against non-business income. The Senate bill also retains the provision that disallowed losses re-enter the calculation in subsequent years, impacting future deductions.

Individual Provisions

SALT Cap Changes

The SALT deduction allows taxpayers to deduct state and local income, sales and property taxes on their federal tax returns. The Senate’s text proposes to retain the $10,000 SALT cap whereas the House-passed bill would have increased that limit to $40,000. This provision was a huge sticking point on the House side, and this potential decrease proposed by the Senate may threaten the fragile agreement that the House reached, given the extremely narrow majority that the Republican’s hold there. This was, and remains, a provision to closely monitor.

Rates and Deductions

The Senate Finance Committee’s draft legislative text includes a partial tax exemption for tips and overtime pay, allowing individuals to exclude up to $25,000 in tips and $12,500 in overtime income from taxable income, with a combined cap of $25,000 per person or $50,000 per couple. These benefits begin to phase out at $150,000 of income, with income thresholds structured differently from the House version.

There is also a potential senior deduction increase (from $4,000 to $6,000), providing additional relief for older taxpayers. The Child Tax Credit would be permanently raised to $2,200 (slightly lower than the House’s proposed $2,500) starting in 2025.

IRA and Energy Credits

The Senate Finance Committee’s draft legislation proposes rollbacks to clean energy incentives included in the Inflation Reduction Act, enacted during the Biden administration.

The Senate language proposes a phased elimination of the Clean Electricity Production and Investment Tax Credits under Sections 45Y and 48E, respectively: Wind and solar projects would see their credit reduced to 60% in 2026, 20% in 2027, and fully eliminated by 2028. Other technologies like hydropower, nuclear, and geothermal would follow a slower phase-out, retaining full credit through 2032, then gradually declining down to zero by 2036. While the bill maintains transferability of these credits until their proposed expiration dates, it also eliminates the up to $7,500 consumer tax credit for electric vehicles, both personal and commercial, new and used. On the manufacturing side, the Section 48D Advanced Manufacturing Investment Credit would be 30% for property placed in service after December 31, 2025.

The Senate text also proposes changes to the Employee Retention Credit (ERC) by retroactively denying claims for Q3 and Q4 of 2021 if filed after January 31, 2024, while leaving earlier claims unaffected. It would also extend the statute of limitations to six years for those quarters and imposes new due diligence requirements on ERC promoters. These provisions reflect a significant shift in clean energy policy as well as ongoing increased scrutiny of the pandemic-era tax credit program.

Remember, the provisions outlined above are only a small fraction of the multitude of changes in the over 1,000 pages of legislative text. They are currently proposals and no changes to current tax law have yet been made. As the bill moves through Congress, via reconciliation, lawmakers will have to grapple with the costs of these potential changes, ensuring compliance with the reconciliation process’s Byrd Rule cost requirements and therefore provisions may be revised or removed. Keeping abreast of the latest updates and working closely with a tax advisor will be key to optimizing strategies under these evolving provisions.

June 23, 2025

The White House

1600 Pennsylvania Avenue NW

Washington, DC 20500

Dear President Trump:

As part of your commitment to achieving American energy dominance, you promised to eliminate burdensome regulations and put an end to the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), which you aptly identified as the “Green New Scam.” While your administration has made significant progress toward this goal, much of the work necessary to fulfill your campaign promise involves eliminating ALL of the Biden-era energy subsidies in the One Big Beautiful Bill.

The House of Representatives has gone a long way. While not completely phasing out the entire IRA, the recently passed H.R. 1 significantly amends most of the credits by accelerating the phase-outs to completely expire before you leave office, places tighter restrictions on prohibited foreign entities, and repeals the transferability of many of the credits.

Unfortunately, the working draft of the Senate bill falls considerably short. While the overall structure aligns with the House, several energy-related provisions represent notable setbacks. Unlike the House version – which imposed strict deadlines for green energy projects – the Senate draft extends eligibility. Projects that commence construction by 2027 now benefit from a four-year “safe harbor,” making them eligible for tax credits through 2031. Because the Production Tax Credit (PTC) lasts for 10 years, wind and solar projects could receive federal subsidies through 2040 – well beyond your term in office. It also alters the House’s strong definition of prohibited foreign entities, essentially allowing for more foreign ownership by those involved in projects. Finally, it retains the electric vehicle tax credit for certain manufacturers.

More troublesome, we have seen reports that some senators would like to weaken the House provisions even further than what is already in the working draft.

History shows long phase-outs are really extensions of bad policies that raise electricity prices and threaten to destabilize the grid. Take the wind production tax credit (PTC), for example. Originally set to expire in 1999, it has been extended repeatedly—in 1999, 2002, 2004, 2005, 2006, 2008, 2009, 2012, 2014, 2015, 2016, 2019, and again in 2021. A phase-down was introduced in 2016, reducing the credit’s value gradually over five years, yet the IRA revived and expanded the PTC once more. This clearly demonstrates that phasing down subsidies often leads to repeated extensions rather than true elimination.

We urge you to call on your Republican colleagues in Congress, particularly in the Senate, to repeal all of the IRA’s energy tax credits immediately—not rely on slow and uncertain phase-outs that history shows are unlikely to succeed. At the very least, the Senate should not weaken the strong language that has already passed the House of Representatives. It’s time for Congress to pass the One Big Beautiful bill to create jobs and grow the economy for American families and deliver on your promise to end former President Biden’s Green New Scam.

A bill passed by the U.S. House, the ""One Big Beautiful Bill Act,"" would repeal key clean energy tax credits, driving up household energy bills and threatening job growth in the state. The legislation is under Senate review and could unwind many incentives, including the Inflation Reduction Act, which helped attract more than $11 billion in private investment to Ohio.

Molly Bryden, climate and sustainability researcher for Policy Matters Ohio, said the investments created quality union jobs and brought cost-saving clean energy projects to the state.

""The Inflation Reduction Act didn't just create jobs, it created good jobs with good working conditions,"" Bryden pointed out. ""Also, the apprenticeship requirements for the bonus tax credit allows workers without formal training in a certain sector to develop equitable pathways to good union jobs in the trades.""

According to a Policy Matters Ohio report and Energy Innovation modeling, the bill would increase annual household energy spending in Ohio by nearly $180 in 2030 and more than $400 by 2035, totaling at $11 billion in higher costs by 2035.

Robbie Orvis, senior director of modeling and analysis for the nonpartisan think tank Energy Innovation, said the bill's effects go beyond households, risking industrial development and energy affordability across the board.

""When those tax credits are removed, a lot less of that clean electricity gets built and our electricity gets a lot more expensive,"" Orvis stressed. ""It would push out developers and manufacturing facilities that are helping to bring industries to the U.S.""

If passed, analysts said the legislation could cost Ohio nearly 38,000 jobs and shrink the state's GDP by $53 billion through 2034. The Senate is expected to make its revisions in the coming weeks.

Federal data show roughly 75,000 South Dakota households rely on SNAP benefits to put food on the table and hunger-fighting groups paint a troubling picture if Congress goes through with big program cuts.

The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, once known as food stamps, faces a possible downsizing in the budget reconciliation bill now in the Senate. It has already cleared the House. Relief organizations say cuts proposed along the way could take away enough food for more than 9 billion meals on average every year.

Lori Dykstra, CEO of Feeding South Dakota, said it would be harder for her network to pick up the slack with donations on the decline.

""At a time when resources are the lowest, need is the highest,"" Dykstra pointed out. ""We're in this challenging space to be able to fill that gap as a food bank.""

Because of economic uncertainty, she noted businesses that normally donate excess food are being careful not to overstock. Dykstra emphasized SNAP benefits give struggling households more healthy food choices during times like these. A key GOP Senator said even though legislative rules have cast doubt over some provisions, they will still seek reforms to preserve SNAP for those who need it, while saving taxpayer dollars.

The Senate version still has nearly $100 billion in proposed cuts as Republicans look to offset proposed tax cut extensions. Poverty researchers said misinformation continues to spread about the integrity of SNAP, noting payment errors are often unintentional and fraud is only a small portion of program activity.

Vince Hall, chief government relations officer for Feeding America, a nonprofit network of 200 food banks, said the current approach targets the wrong people.

""Instead of addressing fraud in a thoughtful and effective way, it's using fraud as an excuse to hurt people who are honest, hardworking; seniors, who are in their golden years; people with disabilities; active-duty military,"" Hall outlined. ""It is harming all of those families.""

Feeding America added losing access to SNAP benefits would hurt recipients in other ways, too. For example, adults who get SNAP benefits spend about $1,400 less on average per year for medical care than adults who do not. The organization worries people would have to make tougher choices, like whether to pay for health care needs or food.

The budget reconciliation bill being considered by the U.S. Senate proposes $863 billion in Medicaid reductions over a decade, with 10.9 million Americans projected to lose coverage by 2034, according to a June 4 Congressional Budget Office report.

In Florida, where 760,000 Medicaid enrollees rely on community health centers, advocates say the cuts would destabilize preventive care and overwhelm hospitals.

Austin Helton, CEO of Brevard Health Alliance, said the cuts would dismantle primary-care access, rupturing what he called Florida's ""health-care ecosystem.""

""If you cut spending on Medicaid and ACA, which primarily pays for access to primary-care health services at community health centers, that access is gone,"" he said. ""The patients are still going to need that care. They're just going to end up sicker and they're going to end up going to more costly and more complex environments like the emergency room at the hospital.""

Helton said the cuts would hit hardest at health-care facilities such as those under Brevard, where 60% to 70% of patients use Medicaid or ACA plans.

While the Florida Policy Institute warns of clinic closures and reduced hours, supporters say the changes target inefficiencies, with House leaders claiming they'll reduce wasteful spending while protecting vulnerable patients.

Florida's community health centers, which serve one in eight Medicaid patients statewide, face what advocates call an impossible math problem: more patients but fewer resources.

""As the population in Florida increases, the number of our patients increase, the number of Medicaid enrollees decreases,"" said Jonathan Chapman, CEO of the Florida Association of Community Health Centers. ""Therefore, by process of elimination, you're going to see more uninsured people on our doorstep.""

The Congressional Budget Office projects Florida would lose $7.3 billion in federal Medicaid funds by 2030 under the House plan, with rural counties such as Gadsden and DeSoto facing severe strain. The bill remains stalled in the Senate, where Republicans are divided over many issues, including rural hospital protections.

After the Department of Government Efficiency cut AmeriCorps funding earlier this year, a federal judge last week granted a temporary halt to the cuts on behalf of a group of states that filed a lawsuit against the move. Montana is not on the list.

AmeriCorps is a national service program which has been running for three decades. In the year before the cuts, about 2,800 members, called VISTAs, served at 300 Montana host sites including food banks, schools, youth centers and more.

Rochelle Hesford, executive director of Southwest Montana Youth Partners, relied on AmeriCorps service in the group's five-year plan. But its VISTA member was on board for less than four months before funding was cut.

""We're in kind of that early critical stage where we really need to get that public support and get our name out there and build capacity for the organization,"" Hesford observed. ""We're losing, like, a year's worth of work, I would say.""

Two dozen states plus Washington, D.C., filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration arguing it did not provide sufficient notice or comment period according to law but because Montana was not a plaintiff, its AmeriCorps funding remains cut.

Groups hosting VISTA members pay about one-third of their income and AmeriCorps funding covers the rest.

Erin Switalski, senior program director for the Headwaters Foundation, which provides grants for groups across the state, said it is a big leg up for many Montana groups.

""We're a resource-scarce state in many ways, and AmeriCorps VISTAs can really come in and help organizations build new systems and find efficiencies,"" Switalski explained. ""Losing that support is really critical.""

Montana's population is one of the least dense in the country but it has the most nonprofits per capita, nearly 10 per every 1,000 residents, according to the Tax Foundation.

Switalski noted she worries cuts to AmeriCorps signal something bigger.

""It's tied to this broader trend that we're seeing in really just a gutting of civic infrastructure that helps hold our communities together in Montana,"" Switalski added.

The agency said the original rule already reduced mercury pollution but advocates argued the earlier rule does not apply to all power plants.
Lynk pointed out the EPA is looking to prove power plants do not significantly contribute to harmful air pollution.
One way to cut down on port pollution, Frazier said, is the electrification of cargo ships.
He explained this would cut down on emissions, the acidification of marine ecosystems and the negative health effects on port communities.","As federal lawmakers move forward with proposed environmental protection rollbacks, advocates are sounding the alarm and requesting additional time for public feedback.

One proposal would repeal a Biden-era rule regulating greenhouse gas emissions from power plants. The Environmental Protection Agency previously found the rule would save thousands of lives and provide $20 billion per year in public health and environmental benefits.

Brian Lynk, senior attorney for the Environmental Law and Policy Center, emphasized regulation provides benefits on multiple levels.

""There are just so many things that flow from taking steps to reduce pollution and improve the air that in fact, benefit us economically as well,"" Lynk explained. ""We stand the risk of losing that.""

The EPA has also proposed reversing changes made to the regulation of mercury and other airborne toxins from power plants, potentially affecting coal-fired plants in Illinois. The agency said the original rule already reduced mercury pollution but advocates argued the earlier rule does not apply to all power plants.

Lynk pointed out the EPA is looking to prove power plants do not significantly contribute to harmful air pollution. He stressed it contradicts previous findings showing carbon emissions from power plants are equivalent to adding over 300 million new gas-powered cars to the road each year. Lynk added power plants account for about one quarter of all carbon emissions in the U.S.

""When we say 'not significant,' that's the magnitude of pollution that we're talking about,"" Lynk observed. ""It's pretty obvious that it is in fact very significant, and the proposal to simply leave that uncontrolled, bury our head in the sand and do nothing about it is a big problem.""

Lynk contended the EPA's proposals also set a dangerous precedent for not regulating pollution in other industries. The public has 45 days to provide comments on the proposed rules after they are published in the Federal Register. A virtual hearing is also scheduled for July 8. Lynk emphasized the public comment process is a critical component the agency must respond to or potentially face legal challenges.

""It's very important for people who are concerned to make their submissions to the EPA, to attend the virtual hearing,"" Lynk underscored. ""There will even be opportunities to speak at the hearing for those who registered to do so in advance. And I would encourage anyone with a stake in this to take advantage of that process.""

The deadline for the public to submit comments on the proposals to the EPA is Aug. 7 but at least 10 environmental groups, including Lynk's organization, have requested the deadline be extended to Aug. 29. The deadline to register to speak at the virtual hearing is June 29.

As Michigan aims to support 2 million electric vehicles by 2030, the new ""Equitable EV Action Plan Framework"" could help local leaders with the transition.

The framework was developed by the University of California-Berkeley's Center for Law, Energy and the Environment, and partners -- including the nonprofit advocacy group Michigan Clean Cities. The plan outlines steps local governments can take to build EV infrastructure and improve accessibility, particularly in underserved communities.

Jeffrey Hoang, communications and engagement associate for Michigan Clean Cities, shared insights about the plan in a recent Clean Fuels Michigan webinar.

""The focus of this framework is ensuring that community voice and impact is prioritized with these plans,"" Hoang explained. ""To actually receive public input on where EV charges, EVSC should be placed within the city. So, actually going out to residents and just asking.""

The framework recommends first identifying key agencies and staff involved, then those agencies can decide which action steps matter most for their community and how they should be prioritized. Still, many EV critics contend affordability is a big issue for everyday families, even with tax credits.

Backers said the plan helps cities plan for an EV future, not just for personal vehicles but rideshare services, e-bikes and e-scooters. It recommended outreach and funding strategies for transit projects along with examples of successful pilot programs.

Hoang added the framework can be viewed as a resource, connecting people to other helpful resources.

""There's so much knowledge and great experience and expertise throughout the industry,"" Hoang observed. ""It provides quick access, you know just a quick 'control-F,' search for whatever kind of resource that you might need.""

The framework highlighted the need for collaboration among local departments, such as planning, transportation and public works to ensure EV access is implemented effectively and equitably.

A critical decision now rests with Gov. Ron DeSantis, as Florida coastal communities and shellfish farmers urge him to sign a bill permanently banning oil drilling near the Apalachicola River. They see the river as a lifeline for the state's aquaculture industry - and a fragile ecosystem.

House Bill 1143, which passed the Legislature with a single ""no"" vote in the Senate, would block drilling within 10 miles of the Apalachicola National Estuarine Research Reserve.

Adrianne Johnson, executive director of the Florida Shellfish Aquaculture Association, warned that the region's economy and environment hang in the balance.

""That area is really unique; 75% of our oyster farmers operate across Franklin, Wakulla and Gulf counties, so those three counties that are downriver from the proposed oil drilling site,"" she said. ""So, protecting that water is absolutely critical to the livelihood of our farmers.""

Despite a court win stopping one drilling project in Calhoun County, she said unprotected sites still threaten Apalachicola's fragile recovery. Aquaculture in the area sustains an oyster industry that once supplied 90% of Florida's wild harvest before its collapse.

The Apalachicola River watershed supports Florida's emerging shellfish industry, which filters water, creates habitats and sustains rural coastal economies. Johnson said even the threat of oil contamination, such as what happened during the 2010 BP spill, could devastate the region.

""We are confident that the governor is supportive of our rural coastal communities,"" she said. ""Under his governorship, the state has invested millions of dollars into restoring Apalachicola Bay. So really, this bill aligns with those values.""

Under Florida's ""7-Day Rule,"" DeSantis must decide on the Apalachicola drilling ban by next Wednesday. The bill automatically becomes law if he chooses not to either sign or veto it.

June is World Oceans Month, and advocates are warning that industrial shipping pollution hurts both oceans and port communities.

At least 31 million people live within three miles of a port, according to the Environmental Protection Agency. That includes thousands of New Jerseyans. Industrial shipping frequently relies on heavy fuel oil, which releases carbon dioxide, sulfur oxides and black carbon into the atmosphere, causing harm to marine ecosystems and port communities.

Altorice Frazier, northeast port campaigner with Pacific Environment, said if the global shipping industry was its own country, it would be one of the largest polluters in the world.

""Global shipping burns some of the dirtiest fossil fuels, like heavy oil, producing toxic air pollutions and greenhouse gases,"" he explained.

Those toxic pollutants often affect the communities closest to ports, frequently working-class neighborhoods made up primarily of people of color. Shipping pollution causes $265,000 premature deaths and six million childhood asthma cases globally each year, according to the Ocean Conservancy.

One way to cut down on port pollution, Frazier said, is the electrification of cargo ships. Much like electric cars, cargo ships can be electrically powered and charged while at a port. He explained this would cut down on emissions, the acidification of marine ecosystems and the negative health effects on port communities.

""We really want to show where there's funding, there's possible job opportunities,"" Frazier continued. ""There's a gain in this. It might not be in the short term, but in the long term, there is definitely opportunity. And we want to see industry and port authorities work alongside communities and government to really strategize how this is possible.""

Frazier added shore power can create jobs and sustain economic growth for communities, while cutting down on pollution and noise.

Making the case for power plant emissions standards I should start by saying that these Biden-era GHG standards aren’t perfect.
To investigate how these estimates change under alternative model assumptions, this recent paper uses nine different power sector models to project impacts of these power plant emissions standards.
Health impacts?
This power plant rule repeal is a bad deal (unless you’re a power plant)","The EPA case for regulatory repeal hinges on private sector cost reductions. Health and environmental impacts are not accounted for.

EPA administrator Lee Zeldin has a long list of environmental regulations he wants to get rid of. Topping that list are a suite of rules that would force coal plants to retire– or significantly reduce their GHG emissions intensity– if they want to keep operating past 2038. Starting in 2032, new source GHG standards would also apply to new natural‐gas plants.

In principle, the EPA administrator can’t just toss a regulation because he finds it annoying. The Agency has to give a reasoned explanation and follow public-comment protocols. Last week, the EPA published their proposal to repeal the Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Standards for Power Plants in the Federal Register. We the people have until August 7 to respond.

Given all that is going on right now, you might not have had the time to dive into this weedy regulatory docket. So here’s a quick rundown of what’s at stake. If successful, the repeal would roll back federal GHG regulations in the power sector, lay the groundwork for broader regulatory rollbacks at EPA, and set a concerning precedent for how the agency weighs costs and benefits in public policy decisions. In other words, three red flags in one deregulation proposal.

Making the case for power plant emissions standards

I should start by saying that these Biden-era GHG standards aren’t perfect. I am certain that readers of this blog could imagine a more elegant and efficient way to drive down GHG emissions in the power sector. But given the nature of our political quagmire, and the limits of EPA’s legal authority, these rules represent a serious, good-faith attempt to cut power-sector emissions in a way that’s both legally defensible and cost effective. So the question we should be focused on: Should we move forward with implementing these rules?

Back in 2023, the Biden-era EPA argued for yes. This 400+ page regulatory impact analysis assesses the costs and benefits of these GHG standards. Key results are summarized in Table 10 of the 2023 proposed regulation which I have pasted below. Key take-away: Over a 2024-2042 time frame, projected climate and health benefits exceed projected compliance costs by a factor of 7 .

We should be somewhat skeptical of these cost-benefit numbers because predicting the future impacts of a regulation is really hard. To investigate how these estimates change under alternative model assumptions, this recent paper uses nine different power sector models to project impacts of these power plant emissions standards. Across all the models considered, monetized health and environmental benefits significantly exceed estimated compliance costs. GHG reductions, which come primarily from accelerated retirements of coal plants, are estimated to cost $6–$44 per t-CO₂ GHG avoided.

The Case for Repeal

To repeal an existing regulation, the EPA has to argue convincingly that the prior rationale for the rule was misguided or no longer applicable. By my read, this EPA is making two key arguments:

The legal argument: Under Section 111 of the Clean Air Act, the EPA is obliged to regulate stationary sources that “contribute significantly to dangerous air pollution.” Today’s EPA is proposing to re-interpret this wonky-but-critical phrase:

“[EPA proposes] to determine, in a change from the 2015 NSPS and CPS, that GHG emissions from fossil fuel-fired power plants do not contribute significantly to dangerous air pollution as required for the promulgation of new and existing source standards.”

This EPA goes on to argue that, because the global share of GHG emissions from the U.S. power sector is small and declining, and because “only extraordinary reductions on a global scale would have impact on the potential endangerment of public health and welfare”, U.S. power plants do not clear the “significantly contributes” threshold. If successful, this would absolve the EPA of its responsibility to regulate power sector emissions (and other industrial sectors, which contribute even less).

I’m no legal scholar, so I’m not going to expound on why this argument seems misguided. My most excellent law school colleague, Dan Farber, promises me he will blog about this issue soon. When he does, I will include a link here.

The cost-based argument: The EPA is asserting that the costs of complying with these GHG regulations would be “unreasonable”. To support this claim, this Trump-era EPA uses the numbers from the aforementioned Biden-era analysis. The one (and only) table in the Trump-era repeal proposal reports these compliance cost estimates with minor modifications:

If you’re going to axe a regulation on the grounds that it is unreasonably costly, you should consider not only the costs of complying with the regulation, but also the benefits. Climate and health impacts are conspicuously absent from this repeal argument. Readers who care about emissions- and I am one- are redirected to this RIA. Buried in this document are all of the Biden-era estimates of health and climate-related benefits, along with some explanation for why these impacts have been wiped off the Trump-era cost-benefit board:

Climate change impacts? A recent memo instructs the EPA to eliminate the consideration of the costs imposed by climate change from regulatory reviews whenever possible.

Health impacts? This EPA is arguing that a regulatory impact assessment should only consider health impacts associated with the pollutant that is directly targeted by a rule.

So, just like that, the economically significant health and environmental impacts of these power plant rules are dropped from consideration.

Existing lithium-ion projects, flow batteries, compressed air energy storage and other forms of long-duration energy storage have all drawn attention.
Yet it's not yet clear whether any specific energy storage technology will win over the majority of data centers.
Like Abiecunas, the interest he has seen is primarily driven by specific use-cases — and the cost of owning and operating an energy storage project decreases when you cycle that energy storage system more frequently.
And most data center operators do not want to be the first to deploy an unproven technology at scale.","Flow batteries are not, strictly speaking, a new technology. Yet even with improvements to decrease the cost, the flow batteries have never really caught on — until, perhaps, recently.

Energy storage developer XL Batteries said in May that it had penned a contract to pilot a 333-kW organic flow battery at a data center owned by Wyoming-based Prometheus Hyperscale. And other energy storage companies, focused on other types of batteries, have made similar announcements in recent months. Eos Energy Enterprises, which produces zinc-based batteries, has entered talks with an unnamed, large-scale developer of data centers.

While data center operators remain interested in renewable energy — a strategy that will likely require some form of energy storage — that wasn't the primary reason why Prometheus decided to green-light XL Batteries' flow battery pilot, according to XL Batteries CEO Tom Sisto. Rather, the company was looking for a non-flammable technology that could react quickly to large shifts in power demand, and XL's organic flow batteries fit the bill.

Other industry leaders agree with Sisto: as a growing number of data centers look to acquire massive power supplies on short timelines, it could be opening a door for mature, but as-yet under-utilized energy storage technologies.

Most projects remain relatively small-scale pilots as data center operators and developers test new solutions, but XL Batteries already has ample buyers waiting in the wings should the Prometheus project — which is slated for completion in 2027 — perform as expected. Prometheus itself has already contracted to buy up to two 12.5 MW purchases, one each in 2028 and 2029, pending the pilot.

“Once this is shown to be working, we're probably already sold out,” Sisto said.

An appetite for innovation

Data centers have multiple, unique power needs that could lead them to new and underused forms of energy storage, according to Sam Allen, mission critical director for technical innovation in the global facilities group at Burns & McDonnell, an engineering and construction firm that has taken on several data center projects. While traditional, cloud-type data centers have more steady, predictable loads, AI-focused data centers can be subject to sudden, often significant load fluctuations that lead to more complicated power needs, Allen said.

Data centers, like other large infrastructure projects, have also run into permitting and interconnection barriers, which has prompted their operators to look for independent sources of power that are flexible and reliable in the face of inconsistent power needs, said Tisha Scroggin-Wicker, decarbonization director in the power group at Burns & McDonnell.

Lithium-ion batteries remain the most widely discussed solution in conversations between Burns & McDonnell and their data center clients, Scroggin-Wicker said. But alternatives like flow batteries are getting more attention, because they can support a high number of charge-discharge cycles with minimal performance degradation over time. This makes them particularly well-suited to applications where long-term durability and cycling capability are critical, and to sites that experience frequent and rapid load fluctuations, she said.

Nickel-zinc batteries are also attracting attention from data centers on account of their high power density, improved safety profile and environmental benefits. And supercapacitors could prove interesting given their ability to provide a very large amount of power, but for a short period of time, Scroggin-Wicker said.

“Ultimately, the industry is focused on solutions that balance speed to market, operational reliability and sustainability,” Allen said. “There's a clear appetite for innovation and for moving beyond any single technology when it helps future-proof their infrastructure and support broader energy goals.”

Use-case based decisions

While there is interest among data centers in behind-the-meter energy storage that could connect to the grid and participate in virtual power plant programs and the like, for the most part the data centers being built haven't gone this direction, Scroggin-Wicker said. Most of Burns & McDonnell's clients that have built onsite energy storage have opted to eschew the grid entirely, pairing storage with dedicated generation in a bid to bring the data center online faster than is possible if a utility is involved, she said.

Burns & McDonnell has also seen data centers express an interest in buying and operating existing energy storage projects, regardless of the storage technology involved. Existing lithium-ion projects, flow batteries, compressed air energy storage and other forms of long-duration energy storage have all drawn attention. These technologies could give data center operators a greater ability to manage higher power densities, integrate more renewable energy and provide reliable, flexible power supply — all on a comparatively short timetable relative to connecting to the grid, Scroggin-Wicker said.

Yet it's not yet clear whether any specific energy storage technology will win over the majority of data centers.

Jason Abiecunas, executive vice president of business development at FlexGen, a software provider that supports energy storage systems, said that data centers have expressed interest in a wide range of storage technologies. That's not surprising given the data centers' unique operational needs, but that does require a company like FlexGen to adapt to a potentially more technology-agnostic energy storage landscape, he said.

But when it comes time to deploy an energy storage system, Abiecunas said, only a handful of new technologies have won out.

“What’s becoming more clear is that battery chemistry decisions are increasingly use-case driven,” he said. “For example, when energy storage is deployed to displace traditional generators or extend backup capabilities, we’re seeing a growing interest in long-duration chemistries.”

Sisto doubts that data centers have any real need for what the utility sector would consider long-duration energy storage. Like Abiecunas, the interest he has seen is primarily driven by specific use-cases — and the cost of owning and operating an energy storage project decreases when you cycle that energy storage system more frequently. Storage technologies with a 36-48 hour range are, in his opinion, most likely to win out with data center operators; seasonal or ultra-long energy storage technologies will not.

The challenge at the moment, Sisto said, is that many of the options currently of interest to data centers remain relatively unproven in the real world — even if, like flow batteries, they rely on technologies that have existed at least in the lab for decades. And most data center operators do not want to be the first to deploy an unproven technology at scale. That has the majority of prospective customers hanging back, waiting to see how the current raft of pilot-scale projects pan out before they sign anything binding — which could prompt a rush on the relatively limited manufacturing capacity that exists for some of these technologies the minute one of them proves solid, according to Sisto.

“That's the natural tension,” Sisto said. “Everyone would love to wait and see, but at that point you have missed the boat.”",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/Zd-mgLoFZTRQkvoierESs7y_t2SYFrDmqmKpyaTsgAE/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9HZXR0eUltYWdlcy0yMTk1Njg0OTQ0LmpwZw==.webp,N,,2025-06-23 11:18:10.028574

The poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research finds that U.S. adults’ support for tax credits for electric vehicles and solar panels has weakened, as well as their enthusiasm for offshore wind farm expansion. While Democrats remain the strongest supporters of these initiatives, the poll reveals signs of growing cynicism within their ranks.

The poll results coincide with sweeping changes President Donald Trump’s Republican administration is making to regulations related to energy and climate change, including slashing the federal workforce in these departments. And although Democrats and independents have weakened their support for some green energy initiatives, there has not been an increase in support for Trump’s energy policies.

The poll found only about four in 10 U.S. adults — including only one in 10 Democrats and about two in 10 independents, along with three-quarters of Republicans — approve of the way Trump is handling climate change, which largely tracks with his overall approval rating.

Democrats and Independents Drive Decline in Support for Renewable Energy Credits

About six in 10 Democrats, 58%, favor tax credits for purchasing an electric vehicle, down from about seven in 10 in 2022. Among independents, support declined from 49% in 2022 to 28%. Only one-quarter of Republicans supported this policy in 2022, and that hasn’t changed measurably.

“As far as the pollution goes … the vehicles nowadays put out very little emissions to the air,” said JD Johnson, a 62-year-old Democrat from Meadowview, Virginia, who somewhat opposes tax credits to purchase an electric vehicle. That’s partly because he sees the electric vehicle manufacturing process as energy intensive and believes gasoline-powered vehicles have made improvements with the pollutants they emit.

The decline in favoring solar panel tax credits was across the board rather than being concentrated among Democrats.

“For solar panels, in all honesty, I don’t think they’re that efficient yet,” said Glenn Savage, 78, a left-leaning independent from Rock Hill, South Carolina. “I’d rather see them pour money into research and try to get the solar panels more efficient before they start giving tax breaks to the public. I may be wrong on that, but that’s just my thought.”

Scientists say transitioning to renewable energies and ditching fossil fuels that release planet-warming emissions are essential to protect the planet. Billions of dollars in project grants for clean technologies awarded during President Joe Biden’s Democratic administration have been canceled by the Trump administration, and the offshore wind sector has been stunted by Trump’s executive order that paused approvals, permits and loans for wind energy projects.

Fewer than half of U.S. adults, 44%, now say that offshore wind farms should be expanded in the U.S., down from 59% in 2022. About half favor expanding solar panel farms, while about two-thirds were in support in 2022.

When people are concerned about the economy and their personal finances, environmental issues are sometimes prioritized less, said Talbot Andrews, an assistant professor in the department of government at Cornell University who was not involved in the poll.

“I think it makes people anxious to think about increased taxes or increased spending on environmental issues when the cost of eggs are going through the roof,” Andrews said.

Low Support for Trump’s Efforts to Expand Offshore Drilling and Coal Mining

Trump has championed the expansion of offshore oil drilling, as well as domestic coal production.

Despite a decline in support for expanded renewable energies, the new poll shows that only about one-third of U.S. adults think offshore drilling for oil and natural gas should be expanded in the U.S., and only about one-quarter say this about coal mining.

In both cases, Republicans are much more likely than Democrats to support expanding these energy sources.

Trump has sought to open up national monuments for oil drilling, but more U.S. adults oppose than support auctioning off more public space for oil drilling. Only about one-quarter of U.S. adults favor this, while four in 10 are opposed. Republicans are much more likely than independents or Democrats to be in support.

Bipartisan Support for Consumer Rebates and Home Appliance Ratings

The Energy Star program that certifies appliances, such as dishwashers and refrigerators, as energy efficient recently appeared in headlines when the EPA made plans to scrap the program. The blue and white logo is well recognized, and experts say the program has long had bipartisan support until recently.

The poll found three-quarters of Democrats support providing consumer rebates for efficient home appliances, compared with six in 10 Republicans.

Patrick Buck, 54, from Chicago, describes himself as a liberal Republican and is a fan of the consumer rebates for energy-efficient appliances. “It seems to work in terms of transforming what people have in their houses, because a lot of people have a lot of old appliances and just can’t afford new ones,” he said.

Safe Air, Water, Meat and Produce

The poll found only about two in 10 U.S. adults are “extremely” or “very” confident in the federal government’s ability to ensure the safety of their drinking water, the air they breathe and the meat, poultry, fruits and vegetables they buy in grocery stores.

About four in 10 U.S. adults are “somewhat” confident in the federal government’s ability to ensure the safety of each of these, and about four in 10 are “not very” or “not at all” confident.

The Trump administration has announced plans to roll back rules and policies related to limiting pollution and greenhouse gas emissions, such as rules that limit pollution from power plants and blocking California’s efforts to phase out cars that run on gas. The federal government has also cut staff at the Food and Drug Administration, the federal agency tasked with protecting public health and ensuring food supply safety.

The Biden-era program limits leaks and flaring from oil and gas sites. That's important in Pennsylvania, where over 1 million tons of methane escape each year.

David Jenkins, president of Conservatives for Responsible Stewardship, said many of the larger companies capture and sell methane - but research shows smaller operators often skip repairs, wasting gas and polluting the air.

He said he supports laws to curb emissions, but is concerned this bill could roll back the rules.

""The problem is now with the reconciliation bill in Congress, there's language in there that would put off something called the methane waste fee,"" said Jenkins, ""which is the incentive basically for these companies that don't use best practices to come into compliance.""

The U.S. ranked second worldwide last year in methane pollution from energy production - just behind China, and ahead of Russia.

And Pennsylvania is the country's second-largest gas producer, with more than 221,000 wells drilled or proposed.

The International Energy Agency's Global Methane Tracker sheds light on energy-sector emissions and where cuts can be made.

Jenkins described methane as a ""super pollutant"" - much more powerful than carbon dioxide, and a major driver of climate change.

He added that a recent survey shows the Biden-era rule has the support of the American people.

""There's been polling done about the Methane Emissions Reduction Program,"" said Jenkins, ""and it showed that seven in 10 people in the U.S. support charging a fee on methane, to hold polluters accountable for methane leaks.""

The IEA tracker found in 2024, the U.S. had nearly 4 million abandoned oil and gas wells, which released almost 3 million metric tons of methane into the atmosphere.

Workers and families in Indiana could feel the impact of the ""One Big Beautiful Bill Act"" moving through the U.S. Senate. The legislation would roll back clean-energy tax credits and investments passed in the Inflation Reduction Act.

Jim Clarida, business manager for the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers in northwest Indiana, said those investments have helped create jobs and attract nearly $8 billion in private energy development to the state.

""Since the IRA was passed,"" he said, ""$7.8 billion in private clean-energy investments have flown into my home state here in Indiana, fueling the construction and manufacturing of EV battery plants, expanding solar and wind developments.""

Clarida said Indiana has about two gigabytes of utility-scale solar projects under its belt and has another gigawatt in the pipeline.

Supporters of the big budget bill have argued that the changes are necessary to cut federal spending and reduce the national deficit by eliminating costly subsidies, although it also includes an extension of tax cuts that benefit mostly wealthy Americans.

U.S. Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., warned that the bill could drive up household electricity costs by hundreds of dollars and eliminate clean-energy job growth across the Midwest.

""This could create a recession if we lose them all,"" he said. ""And so first, our union members - not just electricians, but everyone - should know that jobs are at stake in their union, either for themselves or their brothers and sisters who are in the union.""

Indiana ranks among the top 10 states for clean-energy job growth since the Inflation Reduction Act passed. Schumer urged Hoosiers to weigh in on what he calls ""critical energy investments"" as the Senate debates the bill.

A federal proposal moving through Congress could stall Michigan's booming rooftop solar industry by ending key tax credits that have fueled clean energy growth, nationwide.

What is being called the ""One Big Beautiful Bill Act"" would eliminate the 30% credit for rooftop solar and other home energy systems, including those leased by companies.

Michigan leads the nation in Inflation Reduction Act-funded projects, attracting more than $27 billion in investment and creating more than 26,000 jobs.

Allan O'Shea, founder and CEO of 50-year-old CBS Solar in Copemish, said about 90% of his family-owned business is residential rooftop solar.

""That 90% would lose one of the benefits that go with solar and that's a 30% tax credit,"" O'Shea pointed out. ""The other 10% of our business is commercial and it would survive but the damage would be done. We're talking 25+ employees here.""

O'Shea sent a heartfelt letter to most senators, expressing concerns about the bill's effects on his livelihood and others'. Supporters of the big tax-cut and spending bill argued it would boost the economy and strengthen national security.

Backers also said the bill delivers the biggest tax cut in U.S. history for those earning $30,000 to $80,000 a year, with 15% off their taxes. O'Shea emphasized he and his customers are money-smart and value long-term investments, adding the issue is not the goal, but how the bill is being pushed through.

""I just hope for the saner minds, the senators and the Congress people that we have in Michigan, to step up and slow the pace down,"" O'Shea urged. ""You can sunset it.""

In 2023, solar power jumped 51% nationwide, with solar making up more than half of all the new electricity added to the grid.

A new analysis of what Congressional lawmakers have dubbed the One Big Beautiful Bill Act found it would eliminate thousands of jobs in South Dakota and slow economic growth.

The bill's current language repeals multiple federal policies, funding programs and tax credits meant to boost American clean energy and manufacturing.

Daniel O'Brien, senior modeling analyst for the nonpartisan think tank Energy Innovation, said South Dakota could lose as many as 1,600 jobs by 2030 as funding is diverted to jobs in the coal, oil and gas industries.

""Those are but a fraction of the number of jobs that are being lost in manufacturing, construction, utilities, farming and agriculture,"" O'Brien explained.

O'Brien noted up to 840,000 jobs nationwide could be eliminated over the next five years if the current bill remains intact. It repeals more than $500 billion in Inflation Reduction Act investments, which some House Republicans have dubbed a ""green new scam.""

South Dakota households currently benefit from low energy prices, partly due to the growth of renewable energy. The industry has drawn more manufacturing to the state, along with data centers in need of large amounts of cheap power. But the analysis showed a shift toward fossil fuels will increase annual statewide energy bills by more than $180 million by 2035.

O'Brien stressed industries looking to reduce costs may choose to operate elsewhere.

""When you repeal these tax credits, you lose the incentivization of companies to build out cheap renewables in South Dakota,"" O'Brien pointed out. ""For that reason, companies that are relying on their cheap power might go to other states or they might move outside of the U.S.""

He added gas prices are also expected to rise with the repeal of EPA rules on vehicle tailpipe emissions and fuel economy standards. Zero-emission vehicle sales in South Dakota are expected to fall from more than 50% in 2030 to around 30% over the next five years.

Laura Kate Bender, assistant vice president of nationwide healthy air for the American Lung Association, said climate change is contributing to the counties' poor air quality.","As Congress debates the GOP's sweeping budget reconciliation bill, some lawmakers are working to include a provision which would delay a methane polluter fee.

The Waste Emissions Charge was meant to be an incentive for oil and gas operators to minimize leaks and flaring that send methane into the atmosphere by capturing it, and bringing it to market. Methane, the primary component of natural gas, is more than 80 times more potent at trapping heat in the atmosphere than CO2.

Randy Willard, president of the nonprofit Save the Aurora Reservoir, said reining in pollution is important on a number of levels, including climate change.

""Also from an air standpoint, here in Colorado, we have some of the worst air in the country,"" Willard pointed out. ""We know that 60% of that, at least, comes from oil and gas production in our space. And a big chunk of that is methane.""

Colorado has failed to meet Environmental Protection Agency air quality standards for decades, coinciding with a boom in fracking operations. Some smaller oil and gas operators have complained about the costs associated with capturing methane. Delaying the pollution fee would be in sync with President Donald Trump's campaign promises to remove regulations on the fossil fuel industry in order to achieve energy dominance.

The International Energy Agency estimates at least 50% of oil and gas methane emissions can be avoided at no net cost to operators.

David Jenkins, president of Conservatives for Responsible Stewardship, believes the fee is critical for holding oil and gas companies accountable.

""They can spend the money necessary to reduce waste and capture and sell that methane and natural gas, or they can pay a fee for the pollution that they're emitting,"" Jenkins noted.

Americans largely support requiring oil and gas companies to pay pollution fees, according to a recent poll.

Jenkins added some operators are already deploying methane capture technologies, many of which were pioneered in Colorado.

""It just seems to make no sense why politicians, and some bad apples in the oil and gas industry, are pushing against something so basic,"" Jenkins observed. ""And it does so much good for so little investment.""

Indiana residents now have a new way to track pollution from coal plants across the state.

The Sierra Club's new online national dashboard shows how rollbacks of federal pollution rules could increase harmful emissions from Indiana's dozen coal plants.

Robyn Skuya-Boss, director of the Hoosier Chapter of the Sierra Club, said the data highlights risks for both rural and urban communities.

""Whether you're living in a larger city or in a small community, you could be being impacted,"" Skuya-Boss pointed out. ""Some of the worst air quality in the nation is located in southern Indiana because there's such a high concentration of super-polluting coal plants.""

The dashboard allows users to zoom in on specific plants and track pollutants like mercury, sulfur dioxide and nitrous oxide. Utilities and state officials said they follow current environmental laws and balancing energy needs and emissions limits can be complex.

Skuya-Boss stressed Indiana families deserve to know when air pollution may threaten their health.

""I think when people are tuned into those bad air quality days, what you start to see is that you can kind of get a sense of how impacted your community is by air pollution issues,"" Skuya-Boss observed.

Environmental groups said the dashboard also gives Hoosiers a tool to demand stronger action from state regulators and lawmakers.

Air pollution in Washington is getting worse, according to a new report citing transportation emissions as the primary culprit.

Eight of the 12 Washington counties surveyed received an ""F"" grade for particle pollution, including King and Pierce counties. Yakima and Seattle ranked the eighth- and ninth-worst cities in the country.

Transportation emissions account for nearly a quarter of total air pollution and about 40% of Washington's greenhouse gas emissions.

Laura Kate Bender, assistant vice president of nationwide healthy air for the American Lung Association, said more Americans live in polluted areas now than any time within the last 10 years.

""After decades of progress to clean up the air from policies under the Clean Air Act, we're now starting to see an uptick in pollution levels once again,"" Bender pointed out. ""It shows that we really need to double down on protections that are limiting emissions from vehicles, not roll them back.""

Congressional Republicans just voted to rescind the federal waivers that allow California to set emissions standards for vehicles that are stricter than national ones, arguing the rules hurt consumers and the trucking industry.

The report marked the seventh straight year of an increasing health threat from particle pollution nationwide. Particulate matter is a mixture of tiny solids or liquid droplets suspended in air. Small particles can lodge deep in the lungs and cause health problems, including cancer and asthma attacks. Bender added smoke from wildfires, driven by climate change, adds to the problem.

""Those conditions are being made worse by changing temperatures,"" Bender noted. ""Climate change means more extreme heat, and more extreme heat can lead to more ozone pollution, and those are both results that show up in this year's report.""

Congressional Republicans are considering revoking the federal tax credit of up to $7,500 for new electric vehicle purchases. The House infrastructure committee is also debating new registration fees which would charge people who drive electric cars more than those who drive gas-powered vehicles.

California has some of the dirtiest air in the nation, according to the American Lung Association's new State of the Air report.

Researchers looked at ozone pollution and both short and long-term particle pollution. Thirteen counties got an ""F"" grade in all three categories. Pollution in the counties mainly came from vehicle emissions and smoke from wildfires.

Laura Kate Bender, assistant vice president of nationwide healthy air for the American Lung Association, said climate change is contributing to the counties' poor air quality.

""Those conditions are being made worse by changing temperatures,"" Bender pointed out. ""Climate change means more extreme heat, and more extreme heat can lead to more ozone pollution, and those are both results that show up in this year's report.""

Five of the seven counties with the most yearly air pollution in the nation are in California. The three most polluting counties are in the Central Valley, with Los Angeles County and the Bay Area not far behind. Republicans in the U.S. House of Representatives just voted to rescind the federal waivers allowing California to set strict emissions standards for vehicles, arguing the rules hurt consumers and the trucking industry.

The report also found 46% of Americans live in places getting failing grades for unhealthy levels of ozone or particle pollution. Bender stressed more Americans live in polluted areas now than any time within the last 10 years.

""After decades of progress to clean up the air from policies under the Clean Air Act, we're now starting to see an uptick in pollution levels once again, and it shows that we really need to double down on protections that are limiting emissions from vehicles, not roll them back.""

Select Outstanding Proposed Amendments to Clean Economy Tax Credits 2025 is likely to bring additional milestones with respect to the clean economy tax credits.","The past year included significant milestones for Canada's clean economy tax credits before a period of turbulence and uncertainty caused by the prorogation of Parliament and the recent federal election.

On June 20, 2024, Bill C-59 and Bill C-69 received royal assent and enacted legislation implementing the carbon capture, utilization and storage investment tax credit (""CCUS ITC""), clean technology investment tax credit (""CT ITC""), clean hydrogen investment tax credit (""CH ITC""), and clean technology manufacturing investment tax credit (""CTM ITC""), and the prevailing wage and apprenticeship requirements (""Labour Requirements"") that a taxpayer must elect to satisfy in order to maximize the applicable rate for a CCUS ITC, CT ITC, CH ITC or the proposed clean electricity investment tax credit (""CE ITC""). Draft legislation for the clean electricity investment tax credit (""CE ITC"") was released on August 12, 2024.

Progress with respect to the CE ITC, the proposed EV supply chain investment tax credit (""EV ITC"") and outstanding proposals to update the enacted clean economy tax credits was stalled by the prorogation of Parliament on January 6, 2025. The then proposed draft legislation became caught in Parliamentary limbo, and taxpayers were left with the uncertainty as to whether those proposals would ever be passed into law.

Now that the federal election concluded and the new session of Parliament has commenced, taxpayers may soon gain greater certainty regarding the future of Canada's clean economy tax credits.

As in many other contexts, one remaining source of uncertainty with respect to clean energy tax credits is the status of renewable energy tax incentives in the United States. On May 22, 2025, the House of Representatives passed the Trump administration's Bill making significant cuts to many of the United States clean energy tax credits introduced by the Inflation Reduction Act. The Canadian clean economy tax credits were largely introduced in response to the Inflation Reduction Act, it will be interesting to follow the ongoing developments in the United States. Of particular interest will be whether the proposed cuts to the United States clean energy tax credits are passed by the Senate and become law.

Current Status of Clean Economy Tax Credits under New Government

With the Prime Minister Mark Carney led Government now in place, taxpayers may take some degree of comfort in the fact that the Liberal Party's election platform included major initiatives aimed at continuing to build a clean economy and tackle climate change. Among other things, the Liberal Party's platform included commitments to:

Kickstart the clean energy supply chain by investing in critical minerals, attracting investment in critical minerals to get them from ""rock to road"" faster, supporting early stage mining companies, and supporting thousands of jobs across the supply chain.

Expand Canada's EV charging network by supporting the building of thousands of new stations by 2027.

Move forward on Canada's six major investment tax credits that support clean energy and technology (i.e., the CCUS ITC, CT ITC, CE ITC, CH ITC, CTM ITC and EV ITC.

Speed up approval of clean energy projects.

A similar sentiment was raised in the Prime Minister's mandate letter dated May 21, 2025 in which the Prime Minister emphasized that Canada must ""build an enormous amount of new infrastructure at speeds not seen in generations"" including infrastructure to ""become an energy superpower in both clean and conventional energies"".

Further, according to its campaign materials, the Government also expects Canada's clean economy tax credits to support $200 billion of private capital investment in Canada over five years.

The current government's campaign promises, coupled with the previous government's statement in Budget 2024 that it sees tax credits as its cornerstone incentive to attract private investment, grow Canada's economy, and create high paying jobs, indicate that Canada's clean economy tax credits should not be expected to go away anytime soon.

Select Outstanding Proposed Amendments to Clean Economy Tax Credits

2025 is likely to bring additional milestones with respect to the clean economy tax credits. It is also likely that the Government will bring forward legislative proposals to amend the existing clean economy tax credits that were not enacted before the end of the previous session of Parliament. The following summarizes some of the key outstanding proposed amendments that may be renewed and enacted in 2025.

Polymetallic Projects

Budget 2024 proposed to modify the CTM ITC to expand eligibility for the credit to businesses engaged in polymetallic projects. The August 12 Proposals included draft legislation effecting that proposal by modifying the ""CTM use"" definition in subsection 127.49(1) by replacing the ""producing all or substantially all qualifying materials"" requirement (generally regarded as 90% or more) with an ""expected to produce primarily qualifying materials"" test which will be measured in terms of the fair market value of all commercial outputs relevant to the taxpayer's CTM ITC. Budget 2024 indicated that the ""primarily"" test is generally regarded as 50% or more; however, the explanatory notes accompanying the August 12 Proposals do not comment on the meaning of the term ""primarily.""

To support a claim for the CTM ITC in respect of a polymetallic project, a taxpayer must submit to the CRA an attestation from an arm's length qualified engineer or geoscientist for each relevant mine or well site. If a taxpayer does not submit such attestation then its CTM ITC in respect of a polymetallic project is deemed to be nil.

These changes are proposed to apply retroactively to the original effective date for the CTM ITC (January 1, 2024).

Eligibility for Waste Biomass

The August 12 Proposals included draft legislation reflecting the 2023 Fall Economic Statement proposals to expand the property eligible for the CT ITC to support the generation of electricity, heat, or both electricity and heat from waste biomass comprising ""specified waste materials"" as defined in subsection 1104(13) of the Regulations. Eligible systems under this expanded eligibility for the CT ITC must:

use feedstock which derives all or substantially all of its energy content (expressed as the higher heating value of the feedstock) from specified waste materials, as determined on an annual basis;

not use fuel that is not produced as an integrated part of the system (even if produced from specified waste material); and

not exceed a heat rate threshold of 11,000 British thermal units per kilowatt-hour.

The August 12 Proposals also include the 2023 Fall Economic Statement proposal to amend subsection 1104(17) of the Regulations to clarify that properties that would otherwise be eligible for inclusion in Class 43.1 or 43.2 will only be deemed not to be eligible if there is substantial non-compliance by the taxpayer with environmental laws, bylaws and regulations at the time the property first becomes available for use.

The August 12 Proposals expanding eligibility of the CT ITC for waste biomass are proposed to apply retroactively to November 21, 2023.

Preliminary Work Activity

The August 12 Proposals introduce a new reduction to the capital cost of clean technology property for any amount that is in respect of an expenditure incurred for a preliminary work activity (""Preliminary Work Activity Reduction""). An equivalent adjustment to the capital cost of clean electricity property for the purpose of the definition of ""clean electricity investment tax credit"" in subsection 127.491(1) is also proposed.

The proposed preliminary work activity definition defines a preliminary work activity to mean any activity that is preliminary to the acquisition, construction, fabrication or installation by or on behalf of a taxpayer of property including, but not limited to, a preliminary activity that is any of the following:

obtaining a right of access to a project site or obtaining permits or regulatory approvals (including conducting environmental assessments);

performing front-end design or engineering work, including front-end engineering design studies, or process engineering work for the project, including (i) collecting and analyzing of site data, (ii) calculating energy, mass, water or air balances, (iii) simulating and analyzing the performance and cost of process design options, (iv) selecting the optimum process design, and (v) conducting feasibility studies or pre-feasibility studies;

clearing or excavating land;

constructing a temporary access road to the project site; or

drilling of a well.

Although an analog of the Preliminary Work Activity Reduction was proposed to apply to the CCUS ITC and the CH ITC since the original draft legislation for those credits was released by Finance, such a reduction to the capital cost of property eligible for the CT ITC and CE ITC was not proposed until the August 12 Proposals. Despite this, the Preliminary Work Activity Reduction definition is proposed to apply retroactively to the original effective date for both CT ITC and CE ITC. It should therefore be considered in determining the capital cost of clean technology property for any project in respect of which a CT ITC or CE ITC will be claimed regardless of the timing of the claim.

Expanded Eligibility of CH ITC for Methane Pyrolysis Projects

The CH ITC is currently available in respect of hydrogen produced from electrolysis of water or from the reforming or partial oxidation of natural gas or other eligible hydrocarbons (where emissions are abated using a carbon capture, utilization and storage process).

The Fall Economic Statement proposes to expand the eligibility for the CH ITC to include projects that produce hydrogen from the pyrolysis of natural gas and other eligible hydrocarbons. The existing legislation regarding the CH ITC would generally apply in respect of such projects subject to certain modifications. The Fall Economic Statement indicates that the Government will continue to review eligibility for other low-carbon hydrogen production pathways.

This expansion of the CH ITC is proposed to apply in respect of property that is acquired and becomes available for use in an eligible project on or after December 16, 2024.

EV ITC Update

To support investments in Canada's electric vehicle industry, Budget 2024 announced the EV ITC as a 10% investment tax credit in respect of the cost of buildings used in the three qualifying segments of the Canadian electric vehicle supply chain: (1) electric vehicle assembly; (2) electric vehicle battery production; and (3) cathode active material production.

The 2024 Fall Economic Statement included additional design and implementation details for the EV ITC and indicated that other design elements would generally be based on those of the CTM ITC under section 127.49. The Government also indicated in the 2024 Fall Economic Statement that draft legislation for the EV ITC would be published ""soon"".

On February 21, 2025, the Department of Finance released draft of legislation for the EV ITC (""February 21 Proposals""). Assuming the legislation is adopted in its current form, the EV ITC would be available as of January 1, 2024 in respect of property that is acquired and becomes available for use on or after January 1, 2024.

Qualifying Taxpayers

Only a ""qualifying taxpayer"" will be entitled to claim the EV ITC. A qualifying taxpayer is a taxable Canadian corporation that, at the relevant time, meets one of the following conditions:

holds (i) a qualifying investment for use in EV assembly, (ii) a qualifying investment for use in EV battery production, and (iii) a qualifying investment for use in the production of cathode active materials to be used as inputs to the manufacturing of battery cells used in the powertrain of electric vehicles, other than production that is a qualifying mineral activity as defined in subsection 127.49(1) (""CAM production"");

is a member of a qualifying group and one or more members of the group holds qualifying investments in each of the sectors described above;

holds qualifying investments described in any two of the sectors described above and a qualifying minority interest in an unrelated taxable Canadian corporation that holds a qualifying investment described in the remaining sector described above;

is a member of a qualifying group, and one or more of the members in the group holds qualifying investments described in any two of the sectors described above and a qualifying minority interest in an unrelated taxable Canadian corporation that holds a qualifying investment described in the remaining sector described above; or

is the unrelated corporation that holds a qualifying investment described in the remaining sector in relation to another taxpayer that either (a) holds qualifying investments described in any two of the sectors described above and a qualifying minority interest in the taxpayer or (b) is a member of a qualifying group, and one or more of the members in the group holds qualifying investments described in any two of the sectors described above and a qualifying minority interest in the taxpayer.

EV Building Property

The EV ITC is available in respect of the capital cost of ""EV building property"". Essentially, EV building property is a building or other structure substantially used to house clean technology manufacturing property that is used in EV assembly, EV battery production, of cathode active materials production. Specifically, EV building property is defined as property that is:

situated in Canada and intended for use exclusively in Canada;

a building or other structure included in paragraph (q) of Class 1 in Schedule II to the regulations under the Tax Act for capital cost allowance purposes;

that is used, or to be used, all or substantially all to house CTM property (as defined by subsection 127.49(1)) that is used in EV assembly, EV battery production or CAM production; and

that has not been used, or acquired for use or lease, for any purpose whatever before it was acquired by the taxpayer.

Amount of the EV ITC

The EV ITC is calculated as the specified percentage of the capital cost to the taxpayer of EV building property acquired by the taxpayer in the year.

The specified percentage for all EV building property acquired after December 31, 2023 and before January 1, 2033 is 10%. Thereafter, the specified percentage is reduced to 5% in respect of EV building property that is acquired after December 31, 2032 and before January 1, 2035.

Labour Requirements

No amendments to the Labour Requirements were included in the February 21 Proposals. Therefore, like the CTM-ITC, it appears the Labour Requirements will not apply to the EV ITC.

Additional Features of the EV ITC

The February 21 Proposals outline many other features of the EV ITC that are similar to the existing clean economy tax credits, including:

If an EV building property in respect of which the taxpayer is otherwise eligible to claim the EV ITC, or an interest in a person or partnership with a direct or indirect interest in such property, is a ""tax shelter investment"" for the purpose of section 143.2, the EV ITC is denied in respect of the property.

Rules providing for certain adjustments in determining the capital cost of EV building property to a taxpayer for the purpose of claiming the EV ITC.

Rules regarding the recovery of additional cost upon the repayment of any amount of government assistance or non-government assistance that was applied to reduce the cost of a particular property for a preceding taxation year.

The EV ITC will be subject to recapture if, within 10 calendar years of acquiring the EV building property: (a) the EV building property (or another property that incorporates the property) ceases to be situated and used exclusively in Canada or no longer houses clean technology manufacturing property that is used in EV assembly, EV batter production, of cathode active materials production, (b) the taxpayer disposes of the EV building property, or (c) the taxpayer ceases to be a qualifying.

An exception to the recapture rules for certain non-arm's length transfers of the EV building property.

As I write this, much of the United States is awash in a record-breaking heat wave that's very likely driven by human-made greenhouse gas emissions. Here in Detroit, where I'm on location for some work-related goings-on, it feels more like my native Texas with temperatures rising to the mid-90s.

But for some automakers, it's as fine a time as any to advocate for an end to the fuel economy rules that have led to cleaner and more fuel-efficient vehicles over the past 50 years.

That kicks off today's edition of Critical Materials, our morning roundup of industry and technology news. Also on deck today: Western automakers will probably never regain ground in China, and Tesla's Robotaxis are rolling out. Let's dig in.

30%: Who Benefits Most If Fuel Economy Penalties Get Axed?

As InsideEVs reported earlier this month, a provision in the U.S. Senate's version of President Donald Trump's budget bill would make penalties for violating the Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) standards a mere $0. That would effectively de-fang the entire program and remove any incentives automakers have to make more fuel-efficient (and thus, less polluting) cars, save for the vague notion of keeping up with competitors via vague ""market"" forces.

The Wall Street Journal reports that two companies in particular that live and die by big truck sales are thrilled about the potential move:

Automakers including General Motors and Jeep-parent Stellantis support the measure, while some of their rivals don’t. Consumer advocacy groups warn that the move could result in dated technology remaining on the road and further dependence on foreign oil sources.

“The combination of high penalties with the nearly impossible CAFE standards finalized during the previous administration is a major problem,” said John Bozzella, president and CEO of the Alliance for Automotive Innovation, which represents most major carmakers.

GM and Stellantis say they are continuing to develop fuel-efficient technology, including on their new V-8s, but that current CAFE rules are unrealistic.

The proposed changes are splitting the auto industry. GM and Stellantis said they support eliminating the fines altogether. Several major automakers, including Toyota and Hyundai, support revisiting the standards but are opposed to wholesale elimination of CAFE penalties, people familiar with the matter say. Ford declined to disclose its position.

In recent years, GM and Stellantis have faced the heftiest fines. Since 2022, GM has paid $128 million for CAFE violations, while Stellantis has paid more than $425 million. Ford has never been fined, according to federal data. Automakers can buy regulatory credits from competitors to offset fines.

The latter is not surprising about Stellantis, which in America relies heavily on its Ram trucks and Dodge vehicles for profits; the odd plug-in hybrid or Fiat 500 sold here and there clearly aren't helping it to keep up with regulations. Meanwhile, Ford has long been a significant player in the hybrid market and today makes several popular electric vehicles.

As that story notes, CAFE rules have transformed the American car landscape since they were signed into law by Republican President Gerald Ford in 1975. They have led to smaller and more efficient engines and, combined with California's strict emissions rules (also in the crosshairs of the Trump administration) were driving a much more all-electric future under President Joe Biden's policies.

But if you're the sort of automaker that isn't very good at making those kinds of cars, or has never had much interest in doing so, these rules have always been untenable and potentially even expensive.

GM, at least, says it's committed to an all-electric future and not only has an expansive EV lineup but is now the largest automaker producer of battery cells in North America. Stellantis... well, it's bringing back the Hemi, folks. Neither has any immediate desire to give up the large-engined, gas-powered vehicles they know how to make and can make very profitably. Longtime American automotive executive Bob Lutz is given space to grouse about CAFE rules at the end of that story:

Bob Lutz, who had senior roles at GM, Ford and Chrysler over a nearly 50-year career, said the inception of fuel-economy rules placed U.S. automakers at a disadvantage to Asian-based rivals that, at the time, were already making smaller cars. It took the domestic industry decades to recover, he said.

“We might have gone off the big V-8 beasts ourselves,” he said. “Market forces could have taken us in the same direction but with less turmoil.”

Which leads nicely to my next point.

60%: Western Automakers Keep Losing In China, As Chinese Brands Expand Abroad

The auto industry has always chased two things: performance and efficiency. Sometimes it has to be dragged kicking and screaming to do the latter, but that's the march of powertrain technology, like it or not.

And it's where China's automakers now have a commanding lead, both in their home country as local buyers opt for native brands, and increasingly abroad. Expect that trend to continue unabated, Bloomberg reports:

The picture for foreign automakers in China doesn’t get any rosier with new research from consultant AlixPartners showing local brands’ dominance will climb to as high as 76% by 2030 as the market share of Japanese, European and U.S. companies dwindles.

China’s automotive industry, once reliant on foreign joint ventures, has undergone a rapid transformation driven in part by significant government support and investment in new energy vehicles. As local brands have grown, foreign automakers have been pushed sideways.

In recent years, confronted with slowing domestic growth and persistent overcapacity issues, China’s carmakers have prioritized global expansion. In Europe, Chinese automotive brands are now on track to capture a 10% share of the market by 2030, adding an estimated 800,000 in unit sales that could fundamentally reshape the continent’s car industry, AlixPartners said.

I suppose the American automakers cheering the end of CAFE rules are banking on the idea that China's brands can be somehow kept out of this country forever, fencing them off from having to compete with a raft of more efficient competitors that could make Toyota look like Mitsubishi. But I find that difficult to believe.

90%: Tesla's Robotaxi Era Has Arrived, Albeit Tepidly

Tesla Robotaxi Ride

The Tesla Robotaxis are here. If by ""here,"" you mean ""a small, geofenced area of Austin,"" anyway. But every driverless taxi operation starts small in some way, even the ones like Tesla that are now up against what Waymo has been doing for years.

But as Reuters reports, it's seen by investors and AV-watchers alike as the start of something much bigger:

The event marked the first time Tesla cars without human drivers have carried paying riders, a business that Musk sees as crucial to the electric car maker's financial future.

He called the moment the ""culmination of a decade of hard work"" in a post on his social-media platform X and noted that ""the AI chip and software teams were built from scratch within Tesla."" In recent days, the automaker sent invites to a select group of influencers for a carefully monitored robotaxi trial in a limited zone. The rides are being offered for a flat fee of $4.20, Musk said on X.

It could take years or decades for Tesla and self-driving rivals, such as Alphabet's Waymo, to fully develop a robotaxi industry, said Philip Koopman, a Carnegie Mellon University computer-engineering professor with expertise in autonomous-vehicle technology.

A successful Austin trial for Tesla, he said, would be ""the end of the beginning - not the beginning of the end.""

We'll have more on this today. If you've had any experiences with the Robotaxi service in Austin thus far, get in touch.

100%: What Happens If Fuel Economy Penalties Get Axed Entirely?

Prediction time. Let's say the U.S. government does, in fact, get rid of penalties for violating CAFE standards. What do you see happening to the climate, the market as a whole and the EV race? It's bad news for Tesla and Rivian, for one, as they get a sizable amount of revenue from selling carbon offset credits.

But what happens to the other car companies? Do they double-down on V8 engines and big trucks, only to be left with few defenses if BYD and the like ever break into the U.S.?

Additionally, it conducts assessments to maintain compliance with these standards while also working with other organisations to tackle emergencies or threats to the power system.

The agency should not be mistaken for the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), an independent agency of the United States government that mainly oversees the interstate transmission of electricity, natural gas, and oil.

FERC oversees the wholesale electricity market, ensuring that electricity transmission and sale rates are fair and reasonable. It also holds the power to investigate and settle disputes among utilities and other entities.

NERC analysis of frequency response

The State of Reliability report from NERC is an analysis of the performance of the bulk power system, identifying performance trends, emerging reliability risks and reporting on the relative health of the interconnected system.

The report notes that BESS in the Texas and Western interconnections “are contributing to improvements in frequency control and frequency response.”

North America’s bulk electric system (BES) operates at a nominal frequency of 60Hz. Sudden imbalances cause the frequency to change, and if it changes too much, it can damage equipment or trigger blackouts.

In Texas, an increasing number of BESS are being installed, and NERC notes that BESS installations are becoming a key part of ERCOT’s ancillary service market, providing frequency regulation services among other benefits.

The agency notes that in 2024, there were multiple instances of batteries providing 100% of the total capacity for frequency regulation services in ERCOT.

The report continues: “There was an upward trend in frequency responsive capacity for the total generation fleet from 2021 to 2024, as more generators had extra capacity to respond to a frequency event. Conversely, over the same period, this extra capacity decreased for conventional generation with the difference primarily being BESS.”

Further, NERC says that when analysing individual frequency disturbances, BESS have provided more than 70% of the overall MW response.

Severe weather findings

NERC also found that in 2024, the bulk power system (BPS) remained reliable, but the most severe outages were caused by severe weather.

“Based on the severity risk index (SRI), transmission and generation measures, and external sources, severe weather continued to represent the greatest threat to the BPS. In 2024, 27 events occurred in the United States and 3 in Canada, with losses exceeding US$1 billion within the BPS footprint; 10 of these events had notable impacts on the BES, based on the SRI.”

The agency acknowledged that although severe storms were the primary events affecting the BPS, they did not result in any operator-initiated load shedding. The sole occurrence of operator-initiated load shedding in 2024 was due to a failed dispatch after an unexpected generator outage in Wisconsin.

Data centre challenges

From the NERC report, “The size and speed at which data centres are being connected to and operated on the BES is creating one of the greatest near-term reliability challenges.”

The agency notes that in 2024, approximately 1,500 MW of data centres disconnected simultaneously and unexpectedly from the BES due to a transmission line fault.

A load loss of this magnitude is similar to a large nuclear power plant suddenly starting up, which causes an imbalance because of excess generation in the system.

Additionally, data centres create challenges because of the speed at which they are being built. Rather than planning for gradual load increases, more rapid adjustments must be made to adapt load forecasting, system planning and interconnection procedures.

The agency recommends implementing more protection for possible system impacts to the BPS and that grid operators and planners collect more data to understand better the risks of connecting such a large load to a system.",https://www.energy-storage.news/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Screenshot-45.png,N,,2025-06-23 11:18:17.376492

The chancellors of each campus and the president of the University of Colorado wrote letters to the state’s U.S. senators and representatives in Congress to express concerns about several aspects of the bill which they say will harm CU students and families.

“On behalf of the University of Colorado (CU), we write to express our concerns with several provisions contained in the House-passed One Big Beautiful Bill Act (H.R. 1), which will harm our students and families,” the letter read. “We hope to partner with you in the coming weeks as the Senate considers its own approach, including substantive changes, to budget reconciliation legislation.”

The U.S. House of Representatives passed the One Big Beautiful Bill Act on May 22, and the bill will move to the Senate next for consideration.

The bill “reduces taxes, reduces or increases spending for various federal programs, increases the statutory debt limit, and otherwise addresses agencies and programs throughout the federal government,” according to the bill summary. Senate Republicans are now considering changes to the bill regarding topics like Medicaid and clean energy tax credits, according to NPR.

The bill, if passed as-is, would include about $350 billion in federal education program reductions. It would also increase the number of credit hours required to be considered full-time for Pell Grant eligibility from 12 to 15 credit hours per semester, while eliminating Pell Grants for students enrolled less than half-time.

The Pell Grant is a type of federal financial aid awarded to students from low-income households to help pay for college.

“We are concerned by provisions in H.R. 1 that will reduce federal aid to low and middle-income students in Colorado and impose onerous financial penalties on colleges and universities,” the letter read. “…The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates more than half of Pell recipients will receive smaller grants and 10 percent will lose their grants altogether because of these changes.”

There are more than 69,000 students in Colorado currently receiving Pell Grants, including more than 10,700 at CU.

The bill would end subsidized loans for undergraduate students, the Grad PLUS loan program and restricts Parent PLUS loans to a $50,000 aggregate limit per parent borrower.

There are more than 50,000 undergraduate recipients of federal subsidized loans in Colorado, including more than 11,000 at CU. More than 6,500 Colorado students rely on Grad PLUS loans to obtain advanced degrees, including nearly 2,300 at CU.

“Eliminating the in-school interest subsidy on these loans will cost each student an average of $1,250 in additional interest upon graduation,” the letter read. “That’s an extra $62.5 million in student debt for current Colorado undergraduates.”

The bill would also repeal income-contingent repayment plans, including the Pay-As-You-Earn (PAYE) and Saving on a Valuable Education (SAVE) plans. It would instead establish two repayment options, which the letter said “will limit flexibility and increase the likelihood of default.”

The bill would limit graduate and professional student loan borrowing to $150,000 and limit the maximum amount a student can borrow over their lifetime to $200,000.

The $150,000 limit “would be particularly harmful to students who pursue professional degrees in law and medicine; and restricting medical and dental residencies from counting towards Public Service Loan Forgiveness,” the letter read. “We are concerned the latter will discourage our best-in-the-world doctors and dentists from pursuing careers in rural areas or at non-profit entities in Colorado.”

CU System spokesperson Michele Ames said CU is working hard to make sure that every student can find a path to their educational success that is affordable and limits debt.

“Unfortunately, some of the limits being contemplated don’t take into account the actual cost of many advanced degrees. Limiting graduate student borrowing to $120,000 (20,500 per year) for master’s degrees and $200,000 (50,000 per year) for professional degrees will create a gap between what a student can borrow from the government and the cost of attendance,” Ames wrote in an email. “This would push students into the private market to finance their education. While CU understands the need to limit student debt, a one-size-fits all approach simply doesn’t consider the real differences in educational cost for many degrees.”

The bill would also implement a risk-sharing model that would require colleges and universities to pay for student loan defaults. The risk-sharing model would require colleges and universities to pay an annual penalty to the U.S. Department of Education calculated based on a share of their students’ unpaid loans.

“Overall, the new risk-sharing program would decrease funding for students and institutions in Colorado, redirecting federal resources outside our state,” the letter read. “Colorado colleges and universities stand to lose nearly $63 million per year, including more than $8 million at CU were this program to be implemented, according to the Association of Public and Land-grant Universities. Colorado is already 41st in state support for higher education. Redistributing essential federal resources away from our public colleges and universities will make postsecondary education more costly to Colorado students and more difficult to retain our top talent in the state.”",https://www.dailycamera.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/DCC-L-CUfirstDay-F9A6027.jpg.jpg?w=1024&h=683,N,,2025-06-23 12:23:32.206605

Framed as a vehicle for advancing ""American energy dominance,"" the Senate proposal repeals several Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) programs and rescinds billions in unspent U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) funding, as well as redirects resources toward fossil fuel development, liquified natural gas (LNG) exports and a new loan authority aimed at repowering and redeveloping legacy energy infrastructure.

The legislation's most consequential energy finance provisions would repeal and rescind nearly all of the IRA's supplemental support for DOE's Loan Programs Office (LPO) and simultaneously establish a new energy dominance financing authority under Title 17.

Key Takeaways for DOE Loan Programs

Repeal and Rescind IRA Loan Authorities

The Senate proposal repeals and rescinds all remaining authority and unobligated balances from the following IRA-backed loan and financing programs:

$3.6 billion in credit subsidy and $40 billion in additional commitment authority for LPO's Title 17 Energy Financing Program

$3 billion in new credit subsidy for the Advanced Technology Vehicles Manufacturing (ATVM) Loan Program, along with limitations that reserved loans for low- or zero-emission vehicles

$5 billion in credit subsidy and $250 billion in commitment authority for the Energy Infrastructure Reinvestment (EIR) Financing Program (Section 1706)

$75 million in credit subsidy for the Tribal Energy Loan Guarantee Program (TELGP)

Collectively, these actions would roll back the largest expansion of LPO loan and loan guarantee authority since the Obama Administration – disrupting momentum for electricity transmission, critical mineral supply chains and industrial manufacturing.

New Energy Dominance Financing Authority

At the same time, the Senate bill creates a new Section 1706 Energy Dominance Financing Program, capitalized with more than $660 million. Unlike the Section 1706 authority established under the IRA, which tied eligibility to decarbonization measures, the new program would be narrowly focused on:

repowering, repurposing or replacing decommissioned energy infrastructure

extending the life of infrastructure used to produce, transport or process energy and critical minerals

projects that may include environmental remediation but would be ineligible for federal grants, incentives or other nontaxpayer forms of support

The new Section 1706 program contains the same restrictions already applied to Title 17 loan guarantees under the IRA. Notably, it preserves the presidential certification and ""no double dipping"" requirements included in the original IRA statute.

Structural Changes Could Limit Future Lending

The Senate bill would also repeal key statutory language affirming that DOE can guarantee loans made by the Federal Financing Bank (FFB). This change may signal congressional intent to limit future guarantees to nonfederal lenders – an outcome that would require a fundamental overhaul of LPO operations. To date, nearly all loans guaranteed by LPO (aside from a handful of American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA)-era Federal Investment Partnership Program (FIPP) projects) have been issued by the FFB.

In addition, rescinding unobligated credit subsidy without changing DOE's regulations would dramatically lower the risk profile of projects DOE can lend to, undermining first-of-its-kind technology deployment. For many project sponsors – particularly those with less than investment-grade credit ratings – this could threaten deal viability by impairing expected returns. DOE could respond by reverting to pre-IRA regulations that allowed conditional commitments to be revoked at the DOE secretary's discretion, effectively delaying subsidy collection until the project closes.

Broader Provisions Reflect Shift in Energy Policy Priorities

Beyond LPO, the Senate reconciliation package advances several policies intended to expand fossil fuel production and LNG exports while scaling back Biden-era investments in clean energy deployment:

restores quarterly lease sales and expands drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR), National Petroleum Reserve in Alaska (NPR-A) and offshore Alaska

lowers federal royalty rates to boost U.S. competitiveness in oil, gas and coal

appropriates more than $660 million to refill the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR)

authorizes a $1 million fee for LNG export applications to non-Free Trade Agreement (FTA) countries and deeming such exports automatically in the public interest

rescinds remaining funds for DOE's Industrial Demonstrations Program (IDP), which awarded projects aimed at reducing emissions from steel, cement, chemicals and other hard-to-abate sectors

rescinds transmission siting grants and programs intended to modernize grid planning for interregional and offshore wind infrastructure

What Comes Next

Compared to its counterpart in the U.S. House of Representatives, the Senate package adopts a far more aggressive posture toward repealing IRA energy provisions. While House Republicans have proposed rescinding unspent credit subsidy for LPO, they've so far preserved the office's core statutory authority. (See Holland & Knight's previous blog post, ""What the House Reconciliation Bill Means for DOE's Loan Programs Office,"" May 23, 2025.) The Senate bill goes much further – repealing the IRA's supplemental lending authorities and proposing a narrower loan program aligned with President Donald Trump's energy dominance agenda.

This approach by Congress does not fully align with the White House. Just weeks ago, the administration released its full fiscal year (FY) 2026 budget request, which maintains full lending authority for LPO, seeks $750 million in new credit subsidy for Title 17 and anticipates issuing more than $50 billion in new loans for projects spanning advanced nuclear, critical minerals and grid infrastructure. (See Holland & Knight's previous blog post, ""Full FY 2026 Budget Reorients DOE Around Nuclear and Hard Infrastructure,"" June 3, 2025.) The proposal affirms LPO's central role in delivering on the administration's energy priorities – even as congressional Republicans move to pare back the office's authority.

As the reconciliation process moves forward, House and Senate Republicans will need to reconcile their divergent approaches in bicameral negotiations. With a slim Senate and House majority and reconciliation rules limiting what can be included in the final bill, the path forward remains fluid. Still, industry stakeholders – especially those with pending or expected LPO applications – should closely monitor developments as the Senate package moves toward floor consideration.

The poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research finds that U.S. adults’ support for tax credits for electric vehicles and solar panels has weakened, as well as their enthusiasm for offshore wind farm expansion. While Democrats remain the strongest supporters of these initiatives, the poll reveals signs of growing cynicism within their ranks.

The poll results coincide with sweeping changes President Donald Trump's Republican administration is making to regulations related to energy and climate change, including slashing the federal workforce in these departments. And although Democrats and independents have weakened their support for some green energy initiatives, there has not been an increase in support for Trump's energy policies.

The poll found only about 4 in 10 U.S. adults — including only 1 in 10 Democrats and about 2 in 10 independents, along with three-quarters of Republicans — approve of the way Trump is handling climate change, which largely tracks with his overall approval rating.

Democrats and independents drive decline in support for renewable energy credits

About 6 in 10 Democrats, 58%, favor tax credits for purchasing an electric vehicle, down from about 7 in 10 in 2022. Among independents, support declined from 49% in 2022 to 28%. Only one-quarter of Republicans supported this policy in 2022, and that hasn’t changed measurably.

“As far as the pollution goes … the vehicles nowadays put out very little emissions to the air,” said JD Johnson, a 62-year-old Democrat from Meadowview, Virginia, who somewhat opposes tax credits to purchase an electric vehicle. That's partly because he sees the electric vehicle manufacturing process as energy intensive and believes gasoline-powered vehicles have made improvements with the pollutants they emit.

The decline in favoring solar panel tax credits was across the board rather than being concentrated among Democrats.

“For solar panels, in all honesty, I don’t think they’re that efficient yet,” said Glenn Savage, 78, a left-leaning independent from Rock Hill, South Carolina. “I’d rather see them pour money into research and try to get the solar panels more efficient before they start giving tax breaks to the public. I may be wrong on that, but that’s just my thought.”

Scientists say transitioning to renewable energies and ditching fossil fuels that release planet-warming emissions are essential to protect the planet. Billions of dollars in project grants for clean technologies awarded during President Joe Biden's Democratic administration have been canceled by the Trump administration, and the offshore wind sector has been stunted by Trump’s executive order that paused approvals, permits and loans for wind energy projects.

Fewer than half of U.S. adults, 44%, now say that offshore wind farms should be expanded in the U.S., down from 59% in 2022. About half favor expanding solar panel farms, while about two-thirds were in support in 2022.

When people are concerned about the economy and their personal finances, environmental issues are sometimes prioritized less, said Talbot Andrews, an assistant professor in the department of government at Cornell University who was not involved in the poll.

“I think it makes people anxious to think about increased taxes or increased spending on environmental issues when the cost of eggs are going through the roof,” Andrews said.

Low support for Trump's efforts to expand offshore drilling and coal mining

Trump has championed the expansion of offshore oil drilling, as well as domestic coal production.

Despite a decline in support for expanded renewable energies, the new poll shows that only about one-third of U.S. adults think offshore drilling for oil and natural gas should be expanded in the U.S., and only about one-quarter say this about coal mining.

In both cases, Republicans are much more likely than Democrats to support expanding these energy sources.

Trump has sought to open up national monuments for oil drilling, but more U.S. adults oppose than support auctioning off more public space for oil drilling. Only about one-quarter of U.S. adults favor this, while 4 in 10 are opposed. Republicans are much more likely than independents or Democrats to be in support.

Bipartisan support for consumer rebates and home appliance ratings

The Energy Star program that certifies appliances, such as dishwashers and refrigerators, as energy efficient recently appeared in headlines when the EPA made plans to scrap the program. The blue and white logo is well recognized, and experts say the program has long had bipartisan support until recently.

The poll found three-quarters of Democrats support providing consumer rebates for efficient home appliances, compared with 6 in 10 Republicans.

Patrick Buck, 54, from Chicago, describes himself as a liberal Republican and is a fan of the consumer rebates for energy-efficient appliances. “It seems to work in terms of transforming what people have in their houses, because a lot of people have a lot of old appliances and just can’t afford new ones,” he said.

Safe air, water, meat and produce

The poll found only about 2 in 10 U.S. adults are “extremely” or “very” confident in the federal government’s ability to ensure the safety of their drinking water, the air they breathe and the meat, poultry, fruits and vegetables they buy in grocery stores

About 4 in 10 U.S. adults are “somewhat” confident in the federal government’s ability to ensure the safety of each of these, and about 4 in 10 are “not very” or “not at all” confident.

The Trump administration has announced plans to roll back rules and policies related to limiting pollution and greenhouse gas emissions, such as rules that limit pollution from power plants and blocking California’s efforts to phase out cars that run on gas. The federal government has also cut staff at the Food and Drug Administration, the federal agency tasked with protecting public health and ensuring food supply safety.

The AP-NORC poll of 1,158 adults was conducted June 5-9, using a sample drawn from NORC’s probability-based AmeriSpeak Panel, which is designed to be representative of the U.S. population. The margin of sampling error for adults overall is plus or minus 4 percentage points.","https://www.detroitnews.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2024/11/11/PDTN/76199734007-ap-24311669353467.jpg?crop=5442,3060,x0,y415&width=3200&height=1800&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-06-23 10:17:43.580190

The Trump administration’s pullback of carbon capture and storage grants now removes some of these artificial supports.
Industrial heat pumps provide another pathway by amplifying waste heat to reach the high temperatures manufacturing requires, without using as much fossil fuel.","The U.S. Department of Energy’s decision to claw back US$3.7 billion in grants from industrial demonstration projects may create an unexpected opening for American manufacturing.

Many of the grant recipients were deploying carbon capture and storage – technologies that are designed to prevent industrial carbon pollution from entering the atmosphere by capturing it and injecting it deep underground. The approach has long been considered critical for reducing the contributions chemicals, cement production and other heavy industries make to climate change.

However, the U.S. policy reversal could paradoxically accelerate emissions cuts from the industrial sector.

An emissions reality check

Heavy industry is widely viewed as the toughest part of the economy to clean up.

The U.S. power sector has made progress, cutting emissions 35% since 2005 as coal-fired power plants were replaced with cheaper natural gas, solar and wind energy. More than 93% of new grid capacity installed in the U.S. in 2025 was forecast to be solar, wind and batteries. In transportation, electric vehicles are the fastest-growing segment of the U.S. automotive market and will lead to meaningful reductions in pollution.

But U.S. industrial emissions have been mostly unchanged, in part because of the massive amount of coal, gas and oil required to make steel, concrete, aluminum, glass and chemicals. Together these materials account for about 22% of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions.

The global industrial landscape is changing, though, and U.S. industries cannot, in isolation, expect that yesterday’s means of production will be able to compete in a global marketplace.

Even without domestic mandates to reduce their emissions, U.S. industries face powerful economic pressures. The EU’s new Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism imposes a tax on the emissions associated with imported steel, chemicals, cement and aluminum entering European markets. Similar policies are being considered by Canada, Japan, Singapore, South Korea and the United Kingdom, and were even floated in the United States.

The false promise of carbon capture

The appeal of carbon capture and storage, in theory, was that it could be bolted on to an existing factory with minimal changes to the core process and the carbon pollution would go away.

Government incentives for carbon capture allow producers to keep using polluting technologies and prop up gas-powered chemical production or coal-powered concrete production.

The Trump administration’s pullback of carbon capture and storage grants now removes some of these artificial supports.

Without the expectation that carbon capture will help them meet regulations, this may create space to focus on materials breakthroughs that could revolutionize manufacturing while solving industries’ emissions problems.

The materials innovation opportunity

So, what might emissions-lowering innovation look like for industries such as cement, steel and chemicals? As a civil and environmental engineer who has worked on federal industrial policy, I study the ways these industries intersect with U.S. economic competitiveness and our built environment.

There are many examples of U.S. innovation to be excited about. Consider just a few industries:

Cement: Cement is one of the most widely used materials on Earth, but the technology has changed little over the past 150 years. Today, its production generates roughly 8% of total global carbon pollution. If cement production were a country, it would rank third globally after China and the United States.

Researchers are looking at ways to make concrete that can shed heat or be lighter in weight to significantly reduce the cost of building and cooling a home. Sublime Systems developed a way to produce cement with electricity instead of coal or gas. The company lost its IDP grant in May 2025, but it has a new agreement with Microsoft.

Making concrete do more could accelerate the transition. Researchers at Stanford and separately at MIT are developing concrete that can act as a capacitor and store over 10 kilowatt-hours of energy per cubic meter. Such materials could potentially store electricity from your solar roof or allow for roadways that can charge cars in motion.

Technologies like these could give U.S. companies a competitive advantage while lowering emissions. Heat-shedding concrete cuts air conditioning demand, lighter formulations require less material per structure, and energy-storing concrete could potentially replace carbon-intensive battery manufacturing.

Steel and iron: Steel and iron production generate about 7% of global emissions with centuries-old blast furnace processes that use intense heat to melt iron ore and burn off impurities. A hydrogen-based steelmaking alternative exists today that emits only water vapor, but it requires new supply chains, infrastructure and production techniques.

U.S. Steel has been developing techniques to create stronger microstructures within steel for constructing structures with 50% less material and more strength than conventional designs. When a skyscraper needs that much less steel to achieve the same structural integrity, that eliminates millions of tons of iron ore mining, coal-fired blast furnace operations and transportation emissions.

Chemicals: Chemical manufacturing has created simultaneous crises over the past 50 years: PFAS “forever chemicals” and microplastics have been showing up in human blood and across ecosystems, and the industry generates a large share of U.S. industrial emissions.

Companies are developing ways to produce chemicals using engineered enzymes instead of traditional petrochemical processes, achieving 90% lower emissions in a way that could reduce production costs. These bio-based chemicals can naturally biodegrade, and the chemical processes operate at room temperature instead of requiring high heat that uses a lot of energy.

Is there a silver bullet without carbon capture?

While carbon capture and storage might not be the silver bullet for reducing emissions that many people thought it would be, new technologies for managing industrial heat might turn out to be the closest thing to one.

Most industrial processes require temperatures between 300 and 1830 degrees Fahrenheit (150 and 1000 degrees Celsisus for everything from food processing to steel production. Currently, industries burn fossil fuels directly to generate this heat, creating emissions that electric alternatives cannot easily replace. Heat batteries may offer a breakthrough solution by storing renewable electricity as thermal energy, then releasing that heat on demand for industrial processes.

Companies such as Rondo Energy are developing systems that store wind and solar power in bricklike materials heated to extreme temperatures. Essentially, they convert electricity into heat during times when electricity is abundant, usually at night. A manufacturing facility can later use that heat, which allows it to reduce energy costs and improve grid reliability by not drawing power at the busiest times. The Trump administration cut funding for projects working with Rondo’s technology, but the company’s products are being tested in other countries.

Industrial heat pumps provide another pathway by amplifying waste heat to reach the high temperatures manufacturing requires, without using as much fossil fuel.

The path forward

The Department of Energy’s decision forces industrial America into a defining moment. One path leads backward toward pollution-intensive business as usual propping up obsolete processes. The other path drives forward through innovation.

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has issued an Administrative Order on Consent to Radius Recycling Inc. for violations of the Clean Water Act at its metal recycling facility in Oakland. The order addresses unlawful discharges of pollutants into the Oakland Inner Harbor and San Francisco Bay.

The EPA found that wastewater from the facility exceeded federal permit limits for zinc, copper, and acute water toxicity under the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES).

“This order requires Radius Recycling to improve the quality of water discharges leaving the facility, which will help reduce the flow of pollutants into San Francisco Bay,” said Amy Miller, EPA Pacific Southwest Region director for enforcement and compliance assurance. “In addition, this agreement will improve the general cleanliness of the site and address local community health and safety concerns.”

To comply with the order, Radius Recycling will install a granular activated carbon treatment unit designed to reduce metal levels below discharge limits. The company is also required to develop and implement a Water Pollution Prevention Plan, which includes increased site inspections, as well as enhanced cleaning and maintenance protocols.

San Francisco Bay, home to more than 7.5 million residents in the Bay Area, has long been impacted by elevated metal levels that pose risks to aquatic life and human health. Metals such as copper and zinc can accumulate in fish, leading to health risks for individuals who consume them.

In January 2025, the EPA signed a memorandum of understanding with Radius Recycling, the California Environmental Protection Agency, state regulators, and a community organization in West Oakland. The MOU established a collaborative framework to address concerns related to the company’s metal shredding operations and their impact on nearby neighborhoods.

“I’m proud to support companies that choose to invest and grow right here in Lycoming County.” “I’m proud to celebrate the expansion of Prysmian’s Williamsport facility,” said Mayor Derek Slaughter.
It is also a forward movement in the future of energy transmission.
“With this expansion, Prysmian is significantly increasing the production of advanced power transmission cable,” Slaughter said.
“Our expanded Williamsport facility enhances our manufacturing capacity and is another step to strengthening the grid and granting energy independence throughout the United States.”","Expansion of a cable transmission plant in Williamsport is expected to help to keep the lights on and power going for millions of Americans.

Officials with Prysmian, a world leader in energy expansion and digital transformation, recently held a ribbon-cutting ceremony of its expansion and demonstrated the innovative equipment and machinery used inside its plant at 409 Reighard Ave.

“This is the grand opening of the 51,000 square feet addition,” said David Horton, Williamsport plant manager for Prysmian North America. He said there will be 27 additional permanent jobs at the city facility.

The expansion was possible as a result of a supply and manufacturing agreement with Invenergy, which claims the title of America’s largest privately-held, independent power producer, he said.

The expanded city facility will support the nation’s largest private sector-led transmission investment, Grain Belt Express, which runs from Kansas to Indiana, with its first order under the agreement to exclusively use U.S. steel and aluminum. Not only does it represent investment in domestic energy supply chains, but supports 430-plus jobs across the state, with more than 270 at the city facility, said Patrick Whitty, Invenergy’s senior vice president, public affairs, transmission.

With the agreement, Prysmian anticipates doubling national manufacturing capacity for certain advanced transmission conductors, he said.

The investment also highlights Prysmian’s commitment to Pennsylvania in establishing a global center of excellence in Williamsport, he said.

As one of the largest employers in the region, the plant has 277 employees and has been continuously operating since 1965.

“We are proud to manufacture the industry’s most advanced overhead conductors right here in Williamsport,” Horton said. “Every day, every shift, our workers are producing these products, and it gives us a great sense of pride to play a part in helping the country achieve energy independence.”

“Prysmian’s expansion here in Williamsport is great news for our community,” said state Sen. Gene Yaw, R-Loyalsock Township, who is chairman of the state Senate Environmental Resources and Energy Committee, and discussed how the investment will improve grid reliability and electricity affordability.

Pennsylvania will need power from reliable sources. The investment by Prysmian means “good-paying jobs, better critical infrastructure needed to power our electric grid and a solid commitment to our region’s future,” Yaw said. “I’m proud to support companies that choose to invest and grow right here in Lycoming County.”

“I’m proud to celebrate the expansion of Prysmian’s Williamsport facility,” said Mayor Derek Slaughter. “This investment not only strengthens our local economy – it establishes Williamsport as a national leader in advanced cable manufacturing. It’s exciting to see this kind of growth happening right here in our community.”

Slaughter, also one of the guest speakers, said it was a pleasure to be at the plant to celebrate what he considered a “major milestone, not just for Prysmian, but for Williamsport and all of Lycoming County.”

“This $22.5 million expansion is a tremendous investment in our community, and one that firmly establishes this site as a center for excellence for Prysmian’s operations here in the United States,” he said, echoing a statement by Yaw, who addressed the team and visitors.

The 51,000 square foot addition expands manufacturing space and there is an added retention pond to help manage stormwater and support the city’s environmental infrastructure.

“But more than square footage and infrastructure, this expansion is about people and progress,” Slaughter observed.

“It’s created 27 new jobs here in Lycoming County, adding to the 250 living-wage jobs already supporting families in Williamsport and the region,” he added.

“It is a clear sign of confidence in our workforce,” he said. Slaughter recognized the skill and dedication of the men and women who make that possible, those in the audience, many in blue and gray work shirts and corporate executives and team members.

It is also a forward movement in the future of energy transmission.

“With this expansion, Prysmian is significantly increasing the production of advanced power transmission cable,” Slaughter said. “This facility will now double the nation’s capacity to manufacture cables using the E3X Technology, helping power our homes, businesses and critical infrastructure more efficiently and reliably.”

Horton said two years ago the company kicked off a large construction project and, now, the equipment is ready to run.

“We will be producing the electrical conductors that our country needs,” Horton said.

Keeping the nation’s power grid going is essential to the nation’s energy independence, he noted.

“We are proud to have a part in this transformative project supplying our most innovative technology for overhead power transmission in the market, E3X®,” said Andrea Pirondini, Prysmian North America President and CEO. “Our expanded Williamsport facility enhances our manufacturing capacity and is another step to strengthening the grid and granting energy independence throughout the United States.”",https://ogden_images.s3.amazonaws.com/www.sungazette.com/images/2025/06/22190906/23prysmian003-635x500.jpg,N,,2025-06-23 11:21:26.559412

It is also focused on turning the country into a global clean energy and climate champion, driving the energy transition and opening up markets for British clean energy and low-carbon goods and services.
Part of its role is to identify critical changes needed to diversify clean energy supply chains, including driving investment and addressing bottlenecks.
These are just a selection of a wider range of measures to be introduced under the strategy to further support UK clean energy growth.
“After years of delay, the government has stepped up with a serious industrial strategy that backs clean energy and our industrial heartlands.","The government believes that electric technologies can be much more efficient than fossil fuels, while also reducing the need for fossil fuel imports, which in turn will also make the country more resilient to supply and price volatility on international energy markets. The government’s Invest 2035 consultation found that energy prices and grid connection delays are competitive industrial activity and increased electrification, while the prevalence of gas in the energy mix makes it harder for businesses to plan and invest.

To resolve this situation, the government is offering price relief through its British Industry Supercharger for the most energy intensive businesses and resolving grid connection challenges for energy generation and demand projects.

The Clean Energy Superpower Mission entails a long-term plan to increase energy security and reduce electricity bills by investing in clean energy and improving UK connections to the EU energy market.

Sector Plans will set out how sectors can work in partnership with the government to exploit growth opportunities, for example by scaling net zero transport through battery innovation and EV manufacturing, production of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), embedding sustainability across the economy by supporting Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG), investing in creative industries that are investing in net zero – such as Liverpool’s innovative MusicFutures R&D Cluster and introducing smart data reforms to enable data-driven innovation.

The government is planning to use smart technology to boost grid flexibility thus further adapting the grid to the influx of more renewable energy, while also making the grid more resilient and driving down costs. It is also focused on turning the country into a global clean energy and climate champion, driving the energy transition and opening up markets for British clean energy and low-carbon goods and services.

The UK is leading the Global Clean Power Alliance, a forum that aims to address supply chain challenges. Part of its role is to identify critical changes needed to diversify clean energy supply chains, including driving investment and addressing bottlenecks.

The UK is already working with Japan, since March this year, in an Industrial Strategy Partnership focused on collaboration in offshore wind.

Great British Energy (GBE) will work with the National Wealth Fund to provide strong development and finance support as developer and bank, with an initial £300 million already identified for investment into domestic offshore wind supply.

A new Workforce Strategy will be published by the Office for Clean Energy Jobs this year, utilising Britain’s existing energy workforce to create more good jobs across the country. A new regional skills pilot in Clean Energy Industries in Aberdeen will fund skills support.

The strategy is particularly focused on onshore wind and fixed bottom and floating offshore wind, carbon capture usage and storage, hydrogen and heat pumps. The government’s interventions, to this end, will include a new £1 billion Clean Energy Supply Chain Fund, under the direction of Great British Energy (GBE), particularly focused on offshore wind supply chains, and a £544 million Clean Industry Bonus for offshore wind developers. The government has also confirmed £13.2 billion of funding for its Warm Homes Plan and it will shortly launch a further round of the Heat Pump Investment Accelerator Competition, which provides grants to manufacturers investing in new heat pump capacity.

These are just a selection of a wider range of measures to be introduced under the strategy to further support UK clean energy growth. You can view the full Industrial Strategy document here.

“This is a landmark moment” said Laith Whitwham, Senior Policy Advisor at the climate think tank E3G. “After years of delay, the government has stepped up with a serious industrial strategy that backs clean energy and our industrial heartlands. This strategy cuts the sky-high electricity prices driven by gas dependency and gives British industry the shot in the arm it needs to lead the charge to a clean economy.”

“As a UK manufacturer at the heart of the electricity supply chain, it’s a huge confidence boost to see a firm commitment to strengthening the sector that keeps the country powered” added Jon Hiscock, CEO of UK electrical equipment manufacturer Fundamentals. “This is a vital industry, central to economic growth, energy security and decarbonisation. We’re encouraged by the roll out of the Connections Accelerator Service. Speeding up grid access for strategically important projects is exactly what our industry needs to drive innovation and modernise the grid. However the UK's ageing electricity network was never designed to handle the kind of power flows that come from decarbonisation. Turning ambition into delivery will be the real test. We’re also optimistic about the direction of wider electricity‑market reforms, including a final decision on zonal pricing. This could be a promising step toward smarter, fairer power markets. And the Growth & Skills Levy is a smart move. It’s how we turn ambition into the practical skills industry desperately needs. What will make this a success is ensuring these opportunities reach every young person and help fill critical gaps in engineering and the clean energy economy.”

The congress served as a global platform for universities to forge partnerships, exchange knowledge, and advance the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). DUT’s delegation, led by Deputy Vice-Chancellor: Research, Innovation and Engagement, Professor Fulufhelo Nemavhola, included Acting Director: Research and Post Graduate Support, Dr Nomcebo Mthombeni; Director: Data Analytics: IT Support Services, Alex Mngenge; International Education and Partnerships Director, Dr Lavern Samuels; and International Education and Partnerships Manager, Dr Divinia Jithoo.

The GSDC provided DUT with a unique opportunity to strengthen collaborations with universities in Turkey and to expand south-south cooperation by networking with institutions from the Philippines, Morocco, China, Australia, India, Central Asia and the Middle East. These engagements are central to DUT’s ENVISION2030 strategy, which emphasises international engagement, research and curricular excellence through innovation, sustainable development and green ecosystems.

A significant outcome of DUT’s participation was the formalisation of new partnerships through the signing of Memoranda of Understanding (MOUs) with five leading universities:

Ibn Tofail University, Morocco

Universidad Tecnológica Empresarial de Guayaquil, Ecuador

Karadeniz Technical University, Turkey

Gedik Universitesi, Turkey

Gebze Teknik Universitesi, Turkey

These agreements will enable academic and research cooperation and will include staff and student mobility programmes, collaborative online international learning (COIL), research seminars, lecture series, and the internationalisation of DUT’s programme advisory boards. The MOUs also open the door for postgraduate joint degrees, further enhancing DUT’s global academic influence.

In addition to the agreements signed in Istanbul, DUT has initiated partnership engagements with 42 other universities. Notably, MOUs with institutions such as Kayseri University and Ondokuz Mayis University (Turkey), Visayas State University, Cavite State University, Central Philippine University and Marioano Marcos State University (Philippines), as well as Binus University (Indonesia), which will be formalised through online forums in the coming months. Specifically, DUT will foster cooperation with at least five universities in the Philippines.

During the congress, the DUT delegation also conducted strategic visits to KOC University, Gedik Universitesi, and Gebze Teknik Universitesi, all located in Istanbul. These on-site engagements provided an invaluable opportunity to move beyond initial discussions and begin activating tangible collaborations between DUT and its Turkish counterparts. The face-to-face meetings allowed for deeper exploration of mutual interests, the identification of specific areas for joint research, and the planning of staff and student mobility initiatives. By visiting these leading Istanbul-based universities, DUT has laid a strong foundation for ongoing academic exchange, collaborative projects, and the implementation of the newly signed MOUs, ensuring that partnerships move swiftly from agreement to action.

While DUT’s international footprint continues to expand, the university remains deeply committed to advancing intra-African academic collaboration. During the conference, DUT and the Namibia University of Science and Technology (NUST) had discussions to advance an already strong partnership, while identifying new specific areas of collaboration.

Building on this momentum, DUT and NUST have planned a series of upcoming visits. DUT will send a delegation to NUST for the opening of their Luderitz campus and NUST will reciprocate with a visit to DUT in July 2025, for the DUT International Week. These exchanges are set to further strengthen the strategic partnership. This intra-African cooperation is a key pillar of DUT’s internationalisation strategy, which prioritises African-led collaboration, innovation and research excellence.

At the GSDC, DUT also took the opportunity to promote the African Partnership Universities Alliance (APUA), a collaborative initiative that brings together leading African universities to advance Africa-centred internationalisation and strengthen research and innovation networks. APUA, which is led by DUT, is driving the development of sustainable, mutually beneficial partnerships that prioritise African knowledge systes and address local, continental and global challenges.

Clean energy is the economic opportunity of the twenty-first century, and thanks to the government’s clean energy mission, investment is booming in the UK, with over £40 billion of private investment in clean energy announced since July.

This landmark plan, developed with industry, trade unions, and workers across all regions of the country, sets the UK on a path to unleash the tidal wave of jobs and investment that clean energy can bring, with the government targeting at least a doubling of current investment levels across our frontier Clean Energy Industries to over £30 billion per year by 2035.

It comes after the Spending Review confirmed the biggest programme of investment in homegrown energy in UK history – from launching a golden age of nuclear with funding to build Sizewell C nuclear power station on the Suffolk coast and small modular reactors, to £9.4 billion for carbon capture industries.

Energy Secretary Ed Miliband said:

This government is doubling down on Britain’s clean power strengths as we build this new era of clean energy abundance, helping deliver good jobs, energy security and lower household bills.

The UK’s pitch is clear – build it in Britain. Power the world.

Great British Energy Chief Executive Dan McGrail said:

Great British Energy will help the UK win the global race for clean energy jobs and growth by investing in homegrown supply chains and ensuring key infrastructure parts are made here in Britain.

We are working closely with businesses across the clean energy sector to invest in areas of strategic need and will get funding out as fast as possible to get new projects off the ground.

As part of this plan, Great British Energy will have an additional £700 million to help build manufacturing facilities here at home for key components for the clean power revolution like floating offshore platforms, electric cables, and cutting-edge hydrogen infrastructure. This builds on Great British Energy’s initial £300 million for offshore wind supply chains, which the Energy Secretary confirmed last week has already catalysed a further £700 million from industry and The Crown Estate. With today’s additional funding, this brings total public and private funding in clean energy supply chains to £1.7 billion. This investment will unlock thousands of jobs, kickstarting growth in coastal communities and industrial towns, and secure a cleaner, more independent energy future for Britain.

Lucy Yu, CEO and founder of the Centre for Net Zero, has also been announced as the government’s Clean Energy AI Champion – helping to drive the adoption of AI across the UK’s clean energy sector and accelerate the net zero transition.

The Clean Industry Bonus – the financial reward scheme for offshore wind developers to invest in homegrown, cleaner supply chains – could also be expanded to more sectors, such as hydrogen and onshore wind. This will ensure clean energy investment is directed to regions that need it most, including traditional oil and gas communities, ex-industrial areas and coastal communities.

The Industrial Strategy sets out how Britain’s strengths make it the natural home for clean power industries: as a coastal nation, a scientific and innovation superpower, with strengths in high-value manufacturing and a skilled energy workforce to match.

Stakeholders

Martin Pibworth, Chief Executive designate at SSE plc, said:

The government’s industrial strategy is a welcome signal of long-term thinking and ambition – doubling down on homegrown energy is the right thing for security, resilience and affordability, making the most of the UK’s competitive geographical and technical advantages in renewables in particular.

It’s exactly the kind of commitment that gives industry the confidence to deliver at pace and scale, and with important decisions on energy policy expected in the weeks ahead, we hope to see a continued focus on unlocking investment that drives growth.

As the UK’s clean energy champion, SSE is investing £17.5 billion over 5 years to 2027 - building the infrastructure, creating high-quality jobs, supporting the supply chain and driving the innovation needed to deliver a net zero economy.

Jon Butterworth, CEO of National Gas, said:

The Industrial Strategy makes clear the scale of economic opportunity within the clean energy sector. As an essential enabler for all growth sectors, we warmly welcome the Clean Energy Industries Sector Plan which will position Britain as a world leader in technologies like hydrogen and carbon capture.

As Britain’s national gas network, we believe technologies like hydrogen and carbon capture will attract major investment, creating highly-skilled jobs across the country, as well as decarbonising our existing industries and bolstering energy security.

We welcome the recent commitments and recognition shown by the government on the role of green gases and Britain’s national gas network and look forward to working in partnership to deliver the clean energy economy of the future.

Steve Foxley, Chief Executive of the Offshore Renewable Energy Catapult, said:

Wind energy is not only a critical enabler of Net Zero as the foundation of our future clean energy system but also a once-in-a-generation industrial growth opportunity. Through clear pathways from research and development to commercialisation and deployment, the UK’s Modern Industrial Strategy will capitalise on our long history of innovation to not only attract critical manufacturing investment, creating thousands of highly skilled jobs the length and breadth of the country, but also ensure our energy security in an otherwise increasingly uncertain world.

Chris Norbury, Chief Executive of E.ON UK

We welcome the government’s bold ambition to put clean energy at the centre of the UK’s industrial strategy. This is a once-in-a-generation opportunity to grow the economy, strengthen energy security and create skilled, secure jobs across the country.

Our £2 billion UK investment plan is already driving forward decarbonisation, digitalisation and green skills, including through our Net Zero Academy and over 1,300 apprenticeships since 2018.

This strategy is a chance to accelerate that progress with the right clarity, long-term investment signals and genuine partnership between government, cities and industry. If we get this right, Britain can lead the world in clean energy and deliver real meaningful benefits to every household and business.

Paul Nowak, General Secretary of the Trades Union Congress (TUC) said:

We welcome the government’s Clean Energy Sector Plan and its clear commitment to creating high-quality, secure jobs - not just any jobs.

The explicit pledge to a new generation of good industrial jobs will strike a chord with workers from Teesside to Merseyside, many of whom felt left abandoned by the last government’s failure to act.

We strongly support the launch of the UK’s first-ever Clean Energy Workforce Strategy - a vital recognition that workers are central to both our economy and the clean energy transition.

By prioritising sectors like nuclear fusion, nuclear fission, and offshore wind, the government is showing a serious commitment to a balanced, resilient energy mix.

The TUC backs the ambition to ‘Build it in Britain. Power the World’ and stands ready to help make it a reality.

Charlotte Brumpton-Childs, National Officer at GMB:

This strategy is a welcome shift, recognising that Britain’s clean energy future must be built here, by skilled workers in secure, union jobs. For too long, energy policy has meant offshoring opportunity and hollowing out industry.

If delivered properly, this plan could help turn that tide. GMB will work to make sure these promises translate into real investment, real jobs, and a just transition that puts working people at the heart of our industrial future.

Sue Ferns, Senior Deputy General Secretary at Prospect union said:

Boosting clean energy is not only an important mission in its own right, it is central to the success of every other sector. It is welcome to see the government doubling down on this mission, focusing investment on key technologies like renewables and nuclear energy, and recognising the key role that trade unions play as partners in this strategy.

Securing the investment is important, but perhaps the biggest challenge in this area is around the workforce. The energy workforce is undergoing an unprecedented transition, which creates opportunities for many but also serious challenges that need to be addressed.

Delivering on this strategy in a way which creates prosperity and supports jobs will require the government’s forthcoming energy workforce plan to be as ambitious as possible and fully backed by all parts of government.

David Hall, VP, Power Systems, Schneider Electric, said:

The Clean Energy Industries Sector Plan will help to provide much needed certainty for businesses and investors. We welcome the recognition of electricity networks as a ‘foundational sector’ and look forward to working with the Government to develop an electricity networks growth plan.

We also welcome the commitment to phasing out SF6 gas - a potent greenhouse gas - from switchgear. Regulatory certainty on this issue is key for manufacturers like Schneider Electric who are committed to invest in our domestic capabilities and support the decarbonisation of the grid.

Schneider Electric is a key supplier of the electrical infrastructure powering the UK’s electricity networks. Over the past two years we have invested almost £50 million to further boost the UK’s domestic supply chain, including investing £42 million to build a brand new factory in Scarborough, North Yorkshire.

Vattenfall’s UK Country Manager, Claus Wattendrup, said:

The government is right to back clean energy as a growth engine for UK jobs and skills. Offshore wind already supports over 50,000 UK jobs and is scaling up fast through initiatives like the Offshore Wind Industrial Growth Plan, and we now await the government’s Onshore Wind strategy to help unlock even more investment, jobs, and energy security.

We must avoid own-goals along the way, however: the benefits of district heating must not be overlooked, whereas zonal pricing in Great Britain risks future investments without cutting bills.

Dhara Vyas, CEO of Energy UK, said:

Energy UK welcomes the government’s new Industrial Strategy and Clean Energy Industries sector plan, which rightly recognise the pivotal role energy will play across the whole economy, powering growth through digitalisation and electrification, boosting regional prosperity and delivering economic security and resilience.

Stable, affordable energy prices will help ensure that the UK remains a competitive place to do business, and in an increasingly uncertain global operating environment, clean power will deliver energy security. Focussing on priority technologies where the UK has global expertise will deliver a strong competitive advantage for our businesses and economy.

We know the investment necessary to decarbonise the economy will mostly be funded by the private sector. Clarity on government policy, removal of the barriers to investment and targeted support are all essential to meet this ambition.

Jane Cooper, Deputy CEO of RenewableUK, said:

Today’s industrial strategy identifies clean energy as one of the sectors with the highest growth opportunity, and we are going to see tens of billions of pounds of new investment in wind energy, grid and hydrogen in the coming years. With that new infrastructure comes a golden opportunity to secure new jobs, manufacturing, innovation and exports, in the growing industrial clusters across the UK, in areas like the Humber, Scotland, South Wales, the South West and Teesside.

There are already nearly 2,000 companies in the UK who have benefitted from contracts to deliver work in the wind energy sector. Collectively, wind energy currently employs 55,000 people, a figure which has risen by a quarter from two years ago. By keeping a laser focus, as this Industrial Strategy does, on unlocking investment, remaining competitive, and supporting UK companies to innovate and grow, the offshore wind supply chain alone could boost the UK economy by £25 billion over the next decade.

The opportunity and vision is there, now government needs to ensure they deliver on the critical aspects of this industrial strategy. Most notably for renewables, that means ensuring the next two contract for difference allocation round are as successful as possible, clearing large volumes of projects in a stable market framework to reduce costs. This is essential if we want to attract investment in the UK’s supply chain, skills and capabilities.

Claire Mack OBE, Chief Executive of Scottish Renewables, said:

Placing clean energy at the heart of the new industrial strategy is a vote of confidence in the enormous economic growth potential of Scotland’s renewable energy industry and supply chain. The scale of opportunity is clear with sectors like offshore wind expected to generate £35 billion for the economy, helping to deliver good jobs and energy security.

Scottish Renewables has been urging the UK government to be bold in removing barriers to investment and we’re pleased to see the ambition outlined in this strategy, including measures to build a grid fit for the future, drive competitive supply chains and grow exports.

In the years ahead, success will be seen in the delivery of new clean energy infrastructure, thriving supply chains and skilled jobs across Scotland. Our industry stands ready to continue meeting that challenge head on.

Olivia Powis, CEO of the Carbon Capture and Storage Association (CCSA), said:

We are delighted to see the Government’s continued commitment to Carbon Capture, Utilisation & Storage (CCUS), including Greenhouse Gas Removals (GGRs), as a frontier industry. This rightly positions CCUS and GGRs as a core pillar in delivering on three vital national objectives: reaching net zero, driving regional growth, and strengthening economic security.

The UK’s CCUS industry stands ready to deliver and is pleased to see government’s prioritisation of cross-border CO₂ transport and storage networks in the North Sea, recognising the significant economic benefits for both UK and EU CCUS projects. This builds on the positive momentum from the recent UK-EU Summit – alongside the support confirmed in the Spending Review.

Following these government commitments, a clear timetable for deployment is essential to secure investment, as well as investment in scaling up supply chains and growing the workforce needed to deliver at pace. With continued partnership between government and industry, CCUS can anchor a new era of sustainable industrial growth - one that revitalises communities, boosts energy resilience and ensures the UK leads in tackling climate change.

Charlotte Lee, Chief Executive of the Heat Pump Association said:

It is great to see heat pumps, and by association heating systems, being listed as a frontier industry within the plan and identified as one of six areas with the highest growth potential.

With a new Heat Pump Investment Accelerator Competition confirmed, £13.2 billion recently announced for the Warm Homes Plan alongside a clear timeline for the introduction of the Future Homes Standard and a pledge to expand heat networks, it is clear the government are committed to enhancing the UK’s energy security by decarbonising heat from buildings.

Whilst we await the detail within the Warm Homes Plan, this strategy sets clear intentions for the sector, and the HPA will continue to work closely with government to support their missions to break down barriers to investment and deliver nationwide growth.

Clare Jackson, CEO at Hydrogen UK, said

The UK can, and should, lead the world in hydrogen, creating jobs and skills, driving economic growth, and lowering emissions. With hydrogen as a key pillar, the Industrial Strategy and Clean Energy Industries Sector Plan are welcome, positive steps forward to achieving that goal, with strong policy signals and funding to match.

The Clean Energy Industries Sector Plan in particular acknowledges hydrogen’s economic and export potential, and we look forward to working with the government as it puts these strategies into practice.

Dr Emma Guthrie, CEO of the Hydrogen Energy Association (HEA) said:

We welcome the publication of the Clean Energy Industries Sector Plan and the clear recognition of hydrogen as a central pillar in the UK’s clean industrial future.

The commitment to a dedicated hydrogen sector plan - 1 of 8 outlined across key growth industries - provides the clarity and direction that hydrogen investors, innovators and infrastructure providers urgently need.

The extension of the Clean Industry Bonus to hydrogen is a particularly positive step, signalling that government recognises the role hydrogen can play in decarbonising heavy industry and strengthening energy resilience.

The wider Industrial Strategy’s focus on reducing energy costs, accelerating grid connections and supporting frontier technologies reflects many of the priorities the hydrogen industry has long been calling for.

We now look forward to working closely with government and industry to ensure this strategy delivers tangible outcomes - unlocking investment, creating skilled green jobs, and accelerating the transition to a low-carbon economy.

Yselkla Farmer, CEO at BEAMA said:

BEAMA’s members are pleased that our calls for improvements to industrial conditions have been recognised. This long term strategy distinguishes electricity networks and electric heat – uniquely, both represented by BEAMA – as critical sectors for the UK’s economic prosperity. They have the potential to deliver significant benefits to consumers and those seeking excellent employment opportunities in our domestic supply chains.

We are well aligned with the government’s overall vision and objectives for our sector. We are looking forward to keeping the momentum up over the ten years of this strategy, working with government to bring tangible change and hugely increase investment in our members’ markets, with specific benefit to British manufacturing. In addition to some further measures from upcoming policy announcements, this strategy has the potential to build on our existing strengths for an exciting future.

We are especially pleased to see the level of financial support being targeted for BEAMA sectors through GB Energy, the National Wealth Fund and the British Business Bank and our hope is this can help bring forward investment in UK manufacturing to supply the UK’s electrification needs across the grid and in homes. The decision to reduce electricity costs for the IS-8 manufacturing sectors is an incredibly welcome step as we strive to ensure we can compete for investment globally.

Stuart Dossett, Senior Policy Adviser at Green Alliance, said:

As international events threaten to drive up the price of oil and send bills soaring once again, it is vital the government look at how to make the UK energy secure. If we’re successful in doubling the amount of investment in clean energy over the next ten years, as the government proposes today, this will provide the cheap, secure power we need for the rest of the economy to grow. The government is also right to focus on making sure more homegrown renewable energy results in cheaper electricity costs for businesses.

Darren Davidson, Head of UK, Siemens Energy said:

Today’s Industrial Strategy announcement, a 10-year UK government plan focused on partnership with business, is welcome news. As one of the world’s leading energy technology companies Siemens Energy has invested significantly in the UK, and we already employ over 6,500 people working on energy projects across the regions.

The new plan is a significant step forward in helping to create a coherent, strategic policy framework - including funding support - to help strengthen the UK’s industrial base, encourage job creation and deliver the energy transition.",https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/68593d08ae75d34a918611c1/s960_3M28xNBw.png,N,,2025-06-23 09:08:24.144773

Lammy: government 'working around the clock' to secure more evacuation flights from Israel

An RAF flight for vulnerable British nationals and their families left Tel Aviv for Cyprus earlier on Monday, PA Media reports the Foreign Office said.

Further flights will be arranged based on “demand and the latest security situation”.

Foreign secretary David Lammy said: “Throughout the crisis, the safety of British Nationals in the region has been our top priority. That is why the UK Government is working with the Israeli authorities to arrange RAF and charter flights to help those wanting to leave.”

“Today’s flight will bring British nationals and their dependents safely back to the UK. While the situation in the Middle East remains volatile, we are working around the clock to secure more flights and bring more people home.”

The Government used an RAF A-400M aircraft for the flight from Tel Aviv to Cyprus – with passengers due to transfer on to a civilian charter aircraft for the onwards journey to the UK this afternoon.

British nationals still in Israel are being urged to register their presence with the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office.

The UK and Ukraine will work together more closely on industrial military production, Keir Starmer said after meeting with Volodymyr Zelensky.

Starmer and Ukraine’s president met with troops from Operation Interflex on Monday afternoon in Downing Street’s garden.

The operation sees the UK and other allies train Ukrainian soldiers for frontline fighting.

Starmer also announced plans for a new agreement with Ukraine.

“We’ve discussed the issues across the conflict, what more we can do to support.

“I’m really proud that this afternoon we are able to announce an industrial military co-production agreement, the first of its kind so far as Ukraine and the UK are concerned, which will be a massive step forward now in the contribution that we can continue to make, and is really a symbol of not only our joint work in this conflict, but the 100-year agreement that we’ve put in place.”

David Lammy has warned that if Iran were to develop a nuclear arsenal, other states in the Middle East “would seek to follow”.

Conservative shadow foreign secretary Dame Priti Patel told the Commons: “The Government has not taken a clear position on the actions that the US and Israel have taken, but we have seen reports of the apparent legal advice from the Attorney General (Lord Hermer) cautioning against UK involvement, and while I appreciate that the Foreign Secretary cannot comment on any legal advice, does the Government have a position on the lawfulness of these strikes?

“And does he welcome the ends as well as the means to achieve this? Does he share my cynicism about Iran’s attempt to cloak itself in the UN Charter – that’s the same UN Charter it has undermined with its brutality for decades?”

Foreign secretary Lammy replied: “We are in agreement that Iran and the regime in Iran can never have a nuclear weapon, and all of our efforts are designed to ensure that that is the case, and the whole House will understand that this is not just about Iran, the region and global security – it is because we have to remain steadfast in our commitment to not see nuclear proliferation.

“And if Iran got a nuclear weapon, clearly, there would be others in the region that would seek to follow.”

Referring to the legal advice, Lammy told MPs “that must rightly be a matter for the US government in relation to their action” and added: “This was not our action. We have been clear that we were not involved.”

He said UK ministers were “notified before the action took place”.

The assisted dying bill has had its first reading in the House of Lords on Monday, after passing the Commons on Friday.

The first reading does not include any debate - the name of the bill is read out in the Chamber and it will be at the bill’s second reading that peers get a chance to debate the bill for the first time.

Oppponents of the bill have vowed to attempt to use procedural devices to block it. If it does not pass through the Lords by next May, it will likely fall as the end of the parliamentary session.

The Labour peer Charlie Falconer, who is expected to take the lead on the legislation in the House of Lords has said he expects the bill to pass. He introduced a similar bill in 2014 for which the Lords voted in favour, though there have been many new peers created as well as departures.

More than 4,000 British nationals have “registered their interests” following a UK Government appeal, David Lammy said.

Conservative shadow foreign secretary Dame Priti Patel told the Commons: “British nationals and dual-nationals continue to be stranded in Israel and the Middle East due to airspace closures. Now, I’ve written to the Foreign Secretary about this matter and note the progress with today’s flight, and I do want to thank the Foreign Office for the work they’ve been doing with many families who I’ve been in touch with as well, who have been able to get on that flight today.

“So, can the Foreign Secretary tell us how many British nationals may need to be repatriated?”

Dame Priti later added: “Why does it seem that the US and other European countries were ahead of us in their operational planning to bring back their citizens?”

Responding, the foreign secretary said: “There are just over 4,000 British nationals that have registered their interests following our appeal last week, and we would estimate that somewhere between 15-25% of them indicate – this is following a pattern in previous crises in Israel and in the region – take up the offer of British assistance to leave.

“As she knows, the airspace has been closed and so that offer up until this point was about getting them to the border, but I’m very pleased that that flight has landed and taken off. We hope to work with the Israeli government on further flights in the area.”

Force protection in the Middle East “is at its highest levels”, David Lammy told the Commons.

He said: “My message for Tehran was clear, take the off ramp, dial this thing down, and negotiate with the United States seriously and immediately.

“The alternative is an even more destructive and far-reaching conflict, which could have unpredictable consequences.

“The situation presents serious risk to British interests in the region, having moved in additional assets on a precautionary basis, force protection is at its highest levels. Be in no doubt, we are prepared to defend our personnel, our assets and those of our allies and partners.

“We are closely monitoring how energy markets are responding to the conflict, and we have been extremely clear with the Iranians, any action to blockade the Strait of Hormuz would be a monumental act of economic self-harm, making a diplomatic solution even harder.”

The foreign secretary also said the government recommends “that British nationals in Qatar shelter in place until further notice”.

The poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research finds that U.S. adults’ support for tax credits for electric vehicles and solar panels has weakened, as well as their enthusiasm for offshore wind farm expansion. While Democrats remain the strongest supporters of these initiatives, the poll reveals signs of growing cynicism within their ranks.

The poll results coincide with sweeping changes President Donald Trump’s Republican administration is making to regulations related to energy and climate change, including slashing the federal workforce in these departments. And although Democrats and independents have weakened their support for some green energy initiatives, there has not been an increase in support for Trump’s energy policies.

The poll found only about 4 in 10 U.S. adults — including only 1 in 10 Democrats and about 2 in 10 independents, along with three-quarters of Republicans — approve of the way Trump is handling climate change, which largely tracks with his overall approval rating.

Democrats and independents drive decline in support for renewable energy credits

About 6 in 10 Democrats, 58%, favor tax credits for purchasing an electric vehicle, down from about 7 in 10 in 2022. Among independents, support declined from 49% in 2022 to 28%. Only one-quarter of Republicans supported this policy in 2022, and that hasn’t changed measurably.

“As far as the pollution goes … the vehicles nowadays put out very little emissions to the air,” said JD Johnson, a 62-year-old Democrat from Meadowview, Virginia, who somewhat opposes tax credits to purchase an electric vehicle. That’s partly because he sees the electric vehicle manufacturing process as energy intensive and believes gasoline-powered vehicles have made improvements with the pollutants they emit.

The decline in favoring solar panel tax credits was across the board rather than being concentrated among Democrats.

“For solar panels, in all honesty, I don’t think they’re that efficient yet,” said Glenn Savage, 78, a left-leaning independent from Rock Hill, South Carolina. “I’d rather see them pour money into research and try to get the solar panels more efficient before they start giving tax breaks to the public. I may be wrong on that, but that’s just my thought.”

Scientists say transitioning to renewable energies and ditching fossil fuels that release planet-warming emissions are essential to protect the planet. Billions of dollars in project grants for clean technologies awarded during President Joe Biden’s Democratic administration have been canceled by the Trump administration, and the offshore wind sector has been stunted by Trump’s executive order that paused approvals, permits and loans for wind energy projects.

Fewer than half of U.S. adults, 44%, now say that offshore wind farms should be expanded in the U.S., down from 59% in 2022. About half favor expanding solar panel farms, while about two-thirds were in support in 2022.

When people are concerned about the economy and their personal finances, environmental issues are sometimes prioritized less, said Talbot Andrews, an assistant professor in the department of government at Cornell University who was not involved in the poll.

“I think it makes people anxious to think about increased taxes or increased spending on environmental issues when the cost of eggs are going through the roof,” Andrews said.

Low support for Trump’s efforts to expand offshore drilling and coal mining

Trump has championed the expansion of offshore oil drilling, as well as domestic coal production.

Despite a decline in support for expanded renewable energies, the new poll shows that only about one-third of U.S. adults think offshore drilling for oil and natural gas should be expanded in the U.S., and only about one-quarter say this about coal mining.

In both cases, Republicans are much more likely than Democrats to support expanding these energy sources.

Trump has sought to open up national monuments for oil drilling, but more U.S. adults oppose than support auctioning off more public space for oil drilling. Only about one-quarter of U.S. adults favor this, while 4 in 10 are opposed. Republicans are much more likely than independents or Democrats to be in support.

Bipartisan support for consumer

rebates and home appliance ratings

The Energy Star program that certifies appliances, such as dishwashers and refrigerators, as energy efficient recently appeared in headlines when the EPA made plans to scrap the program. The blue and white logo is well recognized, and experts say the program has long had bipartisan support until recently.

The poll found three-quarters of Democrats support providing consumer rebates for efficient home appliances, compared with 6 in 10 Republicans.

Patrick Buck, 54, from Chicago, describes himself as a liberal Republican and is a fan of the consumer rebates for energy-efficient appliances. “It seems to work in terms of transforming what people have in their houses, because a lot of people have a lot of old appliances and just can’t afford new ones,” he said.

Safe air, water, meat and produce

The poll found only about 2 in 10 U.S. adults are “extremely” or “very” confident in the federal government’s ability to ensure the safety of their drinking water, the air they breathe and the meat, poultry, fruits and vegetables they buy in grocery stores.

About 4 in 10 U.S. adults are “somewhat” confident in the federal government’s ability to ensure the safety of each of these, and about 4 in 10 are “not very” or “not at all” confident.

The Trump administration has announced plans to roll back rules and policies related to limiting pollution and greenhouse gas emissions, such as rules that limit pollution from power plants and blocking California’s efforts to phase out cars that run on gas. The federal government has also cut staff at the Food and Drug Administration, the federal agency tasked with protecting public health and ensuring food supply safety.

Topline:

California is falling behind other states in building data centers that power artificial intelligence supercomputers, as well as putting guardrails around their environmental impact. Democratic state lawmakers are now exploring rules for data centers aimed at protecting sustainability and energy affordability.

What’s on the table: Democrats are considering new special electricity rates for data centers aimed at controlling costs for other customers, similar to policies in Indiana, Ohio and West Virginia. They’re also weighing new energy reporting standards to better understand the supercomputers’ impacts on California’s electric grid.

Why now: Electrical utilities are embracing data centers as a catalyst for increasing electrical demand (and padding their bottom line) following an era of energy efficiency. PG&E anticipates new data centers coming to Northern California will require power equivalent to 6.5 million new homes in the next 10 years.

Walk the tightrope: Environmentalists and ratepayers argue an influx of new data centers could, if not managed properly, leave ratepayers with costly stranded assets, or even outpace the growth of renewable energy on the grid. Big Tech-backed lobby groups, however, fear aggressive new rules will make California a less attractive option for building advanced tech infrastructure.

The kicker: if lawmakers don’t find a way forward soon, they risk losing a critical sector of the booming AI industry to other states, while simultaneously failing to align data centers already in California with the state’s ambitious climate goals.

We asked Walker what might happen if residential solar incentives are eliminated.
That means many local companies will go out of business that are tied to the solar industry.
An estimated 100,000 people are employed in the residential solar industry.","Experts warn that an abrupt cut to residential solar tax incentives — as is proposed in the latest version of the ""Big Beautiful Bill"" — could have serious implications for people's utility bills, the future of local companies, and the stability of the overall power grid going forward.

Their message to lawmakers: The solar tax credit doesn't need to stay forever, but don't pull the plug immediately.

Their message to homeowners: Make your voice heard by reaching out to your senators to tell them that solar incentives are important to you — before it's too late.

(Additionally, if you're considering going solar, now is the best time to take advantage of the existing incentives to save an estimated $9,000 on a solar system before the risk of the benefits going away.)

This past week, a group of industry leaders — from manufacturers to installers, financers, and distributors — traveled to Washington, D.C., to educate and lobby congressmen about why residential solar tax credits are vital to supporting American energy dominance, growing local jobs and businesses, and lowering Americans' energy bills.

Among them was Emily Walker, Director of Content and Insights at EnergySage, an independent clean energy marketplace and frequent partner of The Cool Down, who spoke to TCD about the future of residential solar and what homeowners should know.

Bottom line: ""Now is the time to affect change, and your senators and your representatives need to hear from you,"" Walker told The Cool Down.

""You really can make a difference by telling your story and explaining how solar benefited you and why you think it's important to keep electricity prices low for everyone in your community,"" she said.

And it's not too late to affect the outcome of the bill, Walker told us. ""We're hearing directly from senators that they're not getting enough calls from their local constituents, so now is the time to act.""

What's happening in Washington?

When the so-called ""Big, Beautiful Bill"" was debated and passed through the House of Representatives in May, many of the clean energy tax credits and incentives from the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) were eliminated from the proposal, including the tax credit for residential solar.

Now the Senate is refining the bill — and while the latest version from the Senate Finance Committee protects some clean energy benefits, it still does not provide for residential solar tax credits past the end of 2025.

""It did have some improvements for solar and clean energy in general, but when it comes to residential solar, it really didn't make that much of an impact,"" Walker explained.

That's why industry leaders have come to Washington, collaborating across companies to lobby senators to change the bill before it moves to the floor for a vote in the coming weeks.

""Everyone there [is] advocating for cleaner energy, advocating for faster energy, and advocating for their jobs, because at the end of the day, if this demand dries up, their jobs will too, and it's going to really hurt local economies and a lot of the United States,"" Walker said.

What will happen if the residential solar tax credits go away?

We asked Walker what might happen if residential solar incentives are eliminated.

First, she said, ""We're going to see a huge exodus of people from the industry who won't be around to support a stronger grid when it's realized that this was a mistake."" A new report from market research firm Ohm Analytics predicts a 60% drop in installed residential solar in 2026 if the bill is passed in its proposed form, according to Canary Media.

That means many local companies will go out of business that are tied to the solar industry. An estimated 100,000 people are employed in the residential solar industry.

And while some states with high electricity prices — where solar consequently makes the most economic sense — will continue to see fairly strong solar markets, Walker says, ""I think what will happen is pretty soon after that people's electricity bills will start to skyrocket across the entire country.""

That might then drive people to consider solar panels, but by that point solar will be more expensive and harder to get without infrastructure in place.

""It's kind of going to hit people twice, or they're going to be feeling the effects of higher electricity bills because the grid is unstable. They're going to be experiencing more blackouts, and unless they're wealthy, they're not going to have a way to combat that,"" Walker predicted.

What actions can people take?

If you care about protecting clean energy tax credits, now's the time to reach out to your senators to let them know how you feel, Walker said, adding that the Senate is actively making revisions and considering several amendments to the bill. One of the best things anyone can do to fight unnecessary pollution is to use your voice, which in this case can be visiting the Senate's website to send an email or get phone numbers to contact your senators' offices.

""I don't expect this to be the final bill text,"" Walker said. ""I'm hopeful that some of those amendments that they're considering do include more of a 'glide path' for residential solar, even if it's just another year extension, that gives businesses some more breathing room in order to adapt their models to survive in a post-tax credit era.""

And if you're interested in getting solar panels for your home, which can bring your cost of energy down to at or near $0, according to EnergySage's calculations, the company provides a free service that makes it easy to compare quotes from vetted local installers and save money on solar installations.

""We're going to keep fighting, but if [tax incentives are] cut at the end of this year, that means you're going to lose out on pretty significant savings,"" Walker said. ""So there's no better time than right now — especially as more people are trying to get in under the gun here, the more difficult it is to be able to get your system installed by the end of this year. … So act now.""

But should consumers be concerned about solar installers going out of business if the industry gets hit? While Walker said that's ""a very valid concern,"" she also shared a survey among installers that showed many of them will likely pivot into operations and maintenance of solar panels if their industry business dries up.

""There's going to be a growing number of installers who are moving into that field in order to support these systems,"" she said, adding, ""EnergySage will continue to be here as a resource, and we'll be able to help put people in touch with those companies if they need them.""

Tackling solar misconceptions

Since Walker is in D.C. helping educate our members of Congress, we wanted to get her take for TCD readers as well. So we asked her to help unpack some of the biggest misconceptions about solar and set the record straight, starting with a fact many people don't understand.

""As our energy demand is growing as a country, at the end of the day, residential solar provides the fastest electrons to the grid,"" Walker said. ""It's the easiest way to get more energy, more electricity on the grid quickly.""

That's particularly important as energy demands are rising across the world due to increasing electrification and the exponential growth of artificial intelligence, which requires significant power.

What about the idea that solar is just for wealthy people?

""That's factually inaccurate,"" she said, citing a 2024 study from the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory that analyzed over 4 million solar installations and found that most people installing solar panels are actually considered low- to moderate-income households.

""It's something that can benefit everyone because at the end of the day, if you're taking out a loan or you're signing a lease, you should be seeing those savings on Day One,"" she said.

What about the ""intermittency"" aspect of solar? ""We hear a lot that it's unstable, that it doesn't provide power when you need it,"" Walker said. But that's just wrong, she explained.

""Solar, when it is producing [energy], is providing much more electricity than we actually need at that given moment. So if you have a battery paired with it, you're able to store that excess electricity for use later on, and then you're going to be supporting a very stable grid where they can pull from your battery when the grid is strained in order to avoid having to turn on really costly peaking power plants that end up raising everyone's electric bills.""

""I wish people knew that residential solar, especially when paired with batteries, helps lower electricity prices for everyone, not just those who have it on their roof,"" she said.

What about the argument that the government shouldn't be subsidizing the clean energy industry? To that, Walker said EnergySage doesn't believe the tax credits should be around forever.

""Solar isn't a very mature market, and that's why these incentives have continued to be very beneficial,"" she said. ""We understand they can't stay around forever, and we're not asking for them to. We're asking for a reasonable glide path that gives businesses and the industry time to adapt so that we can continue to deploy reliable, clean energy to the grid.""

In other words, as solar costs come down, incentives will be less important to scale adoption.

What happens next?

Experts are expecting the bill to be voted on in the coming weeks, and once it's approved by the Senate and the House, it will go to President Donald Trump for a vote.

There's still hope, Walker said, because the bill can continue to be changed — in the House, for example, changes were made in the middle of the night during the last hours of negotiation.

""My hope really comes from conversations with Senate offices who get it,"" she said. ""They don't want to see electricity prices rise in their state. They don't want to see thousands of jobs lost in their state, and they understand that an abrupt cut to this tax credit at the end of this year is going to do that.""

""Solar is an investment in the economy and there's a way to phase out these tax credits without disrupting solar growth and jobs in the way it would if it were this abrupt,"" Walker said.

Actions like these reduce the need for the fossil fuels that have contributed to climate change.
Still, when it comes to climate solutions, Wagner says, “the fundamental trends all point in one and only one direction”—forward.
Onshore and offshore wind power costs are falling as well, having dropped 56% and 48%, respectively, between 2010 and 2020.
More of Us Will “Get It” Surveys by the Yale Program on Climate Change Communication have shown a 24% jump in Americans who believe climate change is happening—73% now agree.","If you nearly keeled over from extreme heat last summer or watched in shock as the California wildfires destroyed more than 16,000 structures in January, you know that climate change is already wreaking havoc. The United Nations calls the crisis “the single biggest health threat facing humanity.” Weather disasters, the spread of temperature-sensitive diseases like malaria, and carbon emissions from burning fossil fuels already sicken and kill many Americans each year. Meeting the climate goals set out in the 2016 multinational Paris Agreement would save about a million lives per year across the world by 2050, according to the U.N.—but Donald Trump pulled the U.S. out of that agreement the day he took office. With a new administration that has vowed to roll back even more climate-protection measures, many of us are anxious and scared. Will progress toward solving the climate crisis stall or even reverse, with devastating implications for our health?

While there’s certainly reason to worry, there’s also reason to remain cautiously hopeful. Yes, movement toward solutions will inevitably slow without continued federal support, but the momentum from smart moves we’re already making, along with future technological advances, makes progress inevitable if not sufficient. The big reason: money. “There are these unstoppable market forces whereby clean technology will only get better and cheaper over time,” says Gernot Wagner, Ph.D., a climate economist at Columbia Business School, who notes that returning to a fully coal- and fuel-based world not only is morally wrong but also no longer makes economic sense.

How Money Talks

There’s already a good deal of investment in climate progress in the U.S. thanks to three bills that passed in 2021 and 2022—the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), and the CHIPS and Science Act. Each of these doled out federal grants, loans, tax credits, and other monies aimed at climate solutions. The IRA alone led to hundreds of billions of dollars of investments in clean energy and climate-friendlier manufacturing.

Investment has already jump-started green transformations on a local level, some of them specifically in economically distressed counties. These projects financially benefit regular people and local businesses in those areas in very noticeable ways. Throughout the country, “a lot of solar went up on municipal buildings, and grants helped people with things like replacing home insulation to make it more energy-efficient,” says Susannah Randolph, director of the Florida chapter of the Sierra Club. Actions like these reduce the need for the fossil fuels that have contributed to climate change.

Bigger companies—which got tax breaks for green investments—have also made major strides. For example, Florida Power & Light, the state’s major energy producer, shifted significantly away from coal and deployed millions of solar panels on several dozen solar farms. Renewable energy is so popular that some states, including Iowa and South Dakota, now produce more than half their energy from sources like wind, hydroelectric dams, and the sun, while other states get more than a third of their power this way. Oil-rich Texas has some of the highest growth in solar and wind of any state, according to the nonprofit Climate Central.

Then there are the giant investments auto companies have made in producing electric vehicles (EVs), which require half as much energy to run per mile as traditional vehicles and don’t produce tailpipe emissions. Six years ago, there were just six EV models to choose from; now there are close to 50. And people are buying them—spurred in part by the federal clean vehicle tax credit, 9% of all new vehicles sold in the U.S. now are EVs. While the new administration says it plans to end this tax credit, driving an EV is nonetheless easier than ever now that there are more than 200,000 public charging ports across the nation, with more being added weekly. Several huge U.S. factories that once churned out internal combustion cars have fully converted to production of EVs, an expensive process for the car manufacturers that won’t be reversed, says Anna Stefanopoulou, Ph.D., a professor of mechanical engineering at the University of Michigan.

What to Expect Next

With federal support being pulled back, experts expect some slowing of progress. Still, when it comes to climate solutions, Wagner says, “the fundamental trends all point in one and only one direction”—forward. Some of those trends:

Technology Will Advance

Recent technologies that make our climate healthier include cool roofs, made from materials that reflect rather than absorb sunlight; an insulating gel that makes windows more energy-efficient; and tastier plant-based “meats” (livestock accounts for 15% of the world’s greenhouse gas emissions). Some new tech is more affordable now as well. Induction stoves are one example, says Wagner: They heat food more precisely than gas stoves but are up to three times as energy-efficient (and don’t cause asthma and other respiratory problems). “Five years ago, an induction stove would have cost you $1,500. Now IKEA sells induction plates for $60,” Wagner adds.

Renewable Energy Will Cost You Less

The least expensive option for generating power in many communities is no longer fossil fuels but renewables, according to the International Renewable Energy Agency. “Solar panels were 100 times as expensive when Jimmy Carter put them on the White House as they are today,” Wagner says. This is thanks to economies of scale, improved manufacturing techniques, and lower labor costs as more workers gain experience. Reductions in tax credits or grants could slow further price declines but won’t reverse the trend. “Economics are very powerful and can win the day when it comes to clean energy,” Randolph says.

Solar Tech Will Save Power Companies Money

When energy is generated closer to where people need it, especially from rooftop solar, power companies don’t need as many expensive distribution lines, says Ben Delman, communications director for Solar United Neighbors, an education and advocacy group. Onshore and offshore wind power costs are falling as well, having dropped 56% and 48%, respectively, between 2010 and 2020. Texas landowners wanting to get rich might previously have drilled for oil on their property, but “in the new world, you put wind turbines and solar panels there,” Wagner says.

Batteries Will Have Even Greater Capacity

Renewable energy and EVs need strong batteries to store power for times when the sun doesn’t shine, the wind doesn’t blow, or you’re miles from a charging station. Battery costs have fallen a whopping 90% on average since 2010, according to the International Energy Agency, and batteries hold massively more wattage than five years ago. Meanwhile, car companies, which have greatly increased the distance their vehicles can go between charges, are working on boosting efficiency even further. At some point soon, charging an EV will be as easy as hitting a gas station.

More of Us Will “Get It”

Surveys by the Yale Program on Climate Change Communication have shown a 24% jump in Americans who believe climate change is happening—73% now agree. And two-thirds understand that prioritizing climate solutions is critical, per a recent survey by the Pew Research Center. This will create more political pressure, along with moves to keep up with the Joneses. “People are much more likely to go solar if they have a friend or neighbor who’s done it. A really great virtuous cycle is created,” Delman says.

The Pressure of Time

This is all encouraging—but nowhere near enough. Worldwide greenhouse gas emissions are projected to rise 3% between 2015 and 2030, according to a 2023 report published by the U.N. By 2030—five years from now!—emissions must fall by 28% to keep global warming below the 2°C (3.6°F) target that would prevent the most dangerous outcomes. If we go past that point, the world will experience longer and hotter heat waves, droughts that reduce food supplies, and more frequent and intense wildfires. To protect our climate from the worst outcomes, we must make an exponential leap. But while not every government recognizes the importance of taking giant steps toward a greener future (keep urging your elected representatives to do so!), even small steps will get us closer. In the meantime, the economics of more efficient energy should keep us moving in the right direction.

What Climate Therapists Want You to Know

If you’ve been feeling anxious, depressed, or angry, you’ve got company. More than half the adult respondents in a poll by the American Psychological Association reported being anxious about climate change, and Google searches for “climate anxiety” are at an all-time high. In response, a rapidly expanding field of “climate-aware” psychotherapy has developed in recent years, spawning organizations like the Climate Psychiatry Alliance and the Climate Psychology Alliance. We asked two experts in the field for their advice on coping with feelings of helplessness.

Talk it Out

Working with a climate-aware therapist (look for one at climatepsychiatry.org) can help you identify, validate, process, and channel complicated eco-related emotions. “Cognitive restructuring” may allow you to look at the problem in a different way, which can create hope rather than pessimism and distress, says Robert Feder, M.D., a psychiatrist on the steering committee for the Climate Psychiatry Alliance. For things to improve, Dr. Feder says, “it’s extremely important for people to have a hopeful outlook about the climate crisis.”

Do Something

The best remedy for anxiety is action. “The fear that you feel is something to be listened to and harnessed,” says Margaret Klein Salamon, Ph.D., author of Facing the Climate Emergency: How to Transform Yourself With Climate Truth. Participating in a protest march or joining a local advocacy organization can help you be part of the solution while cultivating resilience, agency, empowerment, and hope.

Find a Community

Processing complicated emotions with regard to the climate crisis shouldn’t be done in isolation. “The number one emotional experience people report to me about climate is alienation. They say, ‘I don’t have anyone to talk to about this,’ ” says Salamon. Seek out support groups designed to create connection around climate distress: Try the Good Grief Network or look for Climate Cafés, which are led by facilitators trained by the Climate Psychology Alliance.

Put Your $$ Where Your Values Are

Update appliances, cars, and other home items with climate-friendly options.

When your furnace breaks, look into replacing it with a greener heat pump. Need a new water heater? Tankless ones use up to 34% less energy than conventional varieties. Make your next car an EV.

Buy less.

Greenhouse gases are created in the production of every piece of clothing and household item. When you need something, consider pre-owned items from thrift shops or Facebook Marketplace.

It’s also threatening to take away millions of acres of public land.

Nearly 150 groups, including the Natural Resources Defense Council, the Center for Biological Diversity, and local organizations like Alaska Wilderness League and New Mexico Wild, have urged Senate members to reconsider this “unprecedented” sell-off of public lands.

The Senate budget bill would be a “fire sale” of America’s public lands and waters, Bobby McEnaney, director of land conservation at the Natural Resources Defense Council, said in a statement. The bill would force the sale of between 2 million and 3 million acres of public lands from the Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management, acres that span 11 Western states. (The state of Connecticut is about 3.1 million acres, for comparison).

The bill also makes even more public land eligible for sale—more than 250 million acres, including hiking trails, ski resorts, wilderness study areas, national monuments, and critical wildlife migration corridors. New areas would also be opened for oil leasing and offshore drilling under the bill, including in the Gulf of Alaska.

If passed, the bill would likely be “largest single sale of national public lands in modern history,” according to the Wilderness Society. It’s a move Senate Republicans are making, multiple groups note, in order to pay for billionaire tax breaks. The bill “trades ordinary Americans’ access to outdoor recreation for a short-term payoff that disproportionately benefits the privileged and well-connected,” the Wilderness Society says.

Senator Mike Lee, a Republican from Utah and chairman of the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, has also said the bill would create opportunities for housing. But nature organizations say it would do no such thing—and that it would bring more harm to the public.

“There is no provision to prevent lands sold under Lee’s bill from being developed into high-end vacation homes, Airbnbs, or luxury housing projects,” the letter signed by dozens of organizations reads. Selling these lands, they add, “threatens public access, undermines responsible land management, puts environmental values, cultural resources, and endangered species at risk along with clean drinking water for 60 million Americans and betrays the public’s trust.”

That 250 million acres of public lands are at risk can be hard to visualize. The Wilderness Society made an interactive map, showing both the Bureau of Land Management and U.S. Forest Service lands the bill makes eligible for sale.

The map illustrates how those 250 million acres span 119 congressional districts, reaching all the way from Alaska down through the Western United States, and over past the Rocky Mountains.

“This bill would lead to a wave of irreversible extraction that will rob future generations of public access to lands and waters that belong to all of us—just to bankroll tax cuts for the superrich,” McEnaney said in his statement. “As currently proposed, Americans will soon lose permanent access to the public lands close to home, their favorite trails, their parks, and their favorite recreation areas. Once these lands are sold, and the no trespassing signs go up, there will be no going back.”","https://images.fastcompany.com/image/upload/f_webp,q_auto,c_fit/wp-cms-2/2025/06/p-1-91354978-public-lands-for-sale.jpg",N,,2025-06-23 11:18:44.379235

This edition of Projects Weekly is heavy on new from the Golden State. To start with California regulators have approved a milestone solar + storage project in Fresno County, plus Cadiz has entered into an agreement with Hoku Energy to develop a hydrogen + solar renewable energy campus at Cadiz Ranch in California’s Mojave Desert, and San José Clean Energy is expanding its Solar Access Program with a new solar plant. Meanwhile, Invenergy has started construction on the Pleasant Prairie Solar Energy Center in Ohio, and Terrasmart has teamed up with ESA to complete a solar canopy project for AdventHealth in Florida. Read on for all the sunny details.

The California Energy Commission (CEC) has approved the Darden Clean Energy Project (DCEP), the first to be permitted under the state’s Opt-In Certification program. The project owner is IP Darden I, LLC, a subsidiary of Intersect Power.

Authorized under Assembly Bill 205, the Opt-In Certification program provides a consolidated state permitting option for eligible clean energy projects, supporting California’s transition to 100 percent zero-carbon retail electric sales by 2045, as required by Senate Bill 100. Under statute, the environmental review for a project must be completed within 270 days from the point the project application is deemed complete, unless significant project changes arise that require more time to review.

“California is moving faster than ever before to build the clean energy we need, now with the world’s largest solar and battery project,” said Governor Gavin Newsom. “With a record amount of clean energy capacity added last year, we’re creating jobs and supporting local communities, all while building a cleaner, more reliable power grid.”

Cool factor: Once built, the project will be the largest battery energy storage system in the world. DCEP will be built on 9,500 acres of land in western Fresno County that is no longer able to support agricultural production. The project includes a 1,150 MW solar facility with approximately 3.1 million panels and up to 1,150 MW / 4,600 MWh of battery storage.

Projects seeking approval through the Opt-In Certification program are required to provide community and economic benefits. The DCEP includes:

$2 million in community investments over the next decade starting with a $320,000 commitment to Centro La Familia Advocacy Services, a nonprofit supporting crime victims, family wellness, and civic engagement in rural communities.

More than 2,000 prevailing-wage construction jobs to support the local workforce throughout the construction period, which will last from 1.5 to 3 years.

An estimated $169 million in economic benefits to the local area over the project’s lifetime, estimated at 35 years.

“Today’s clean energy projects must do more than just deliver megawatts. They should create value in the communities where they’re built,” said CEC Commissioner Noemí Gallardo. “This project exemplifies a community-focused approach that advances the state’s energy goals while creating benefits for local workers and residents.”

Cadiz signs second MOU for hydrogen + solar development in California

Cadiz Inc. has entered into a memorandum of understanding (MOU) with UK-based Hoku Energy Ltd. and its affiliates to develop a major clean energy campus at Cadiz Ranch in California’s Mojave Desert. The agreement with Hoku represents the second prospective land lease for clean energy development that the Cadiz has entered within the past year and furthers the company’s commitment to sustainable development of its land and water assets.

The MOU provides Hoku Energy with a three-year exclusive option to develop the project on more than 10,000 acres at Cadiz Ranch. The Hoku project could include green hydrogen production facilities, large-scale renewable and low-carbon power generation, large-scale battery storage facilities, and integrated digital infrastructure, such as data centers, on the leased property or integrated with facilities off the leased property.

Cool factor: With this agreement and other planned developments on the property, Cadiz Ranch is positioned to be one of the largest renewable energy campuses and green hydrogen production hubs in North America. The Cadiz property’s extensive infrastructure — including access to rail lines, water resources, and pipelines and pipeline corridors — makes it well suited for large-scale, integrated renewable energy and data center development. The agreement with Hoku complements Cadiz’s development of its flagship water supply and storage project, the Mojave Groundwater Bank, and follows Cadiz’s 2024 agreement with RIC Energy to develop up to 3,000 acres for green hydrogen production.

“This agreement with Hoku Energy is the capstone of our long-term land use strategy,” said Susan Kennedy, chair of Cadiz Inc. “Hoku Energy’s vision aligns with our mission to support sustainable, scaled development of critical energy and water infrastructure in California and the Southwest.”

Invenergy’s Pleasant Prairie Solar Energy Center to start construction in Ohio

Invenergy has begun construction on the 240 MW Pleasant Prairie Solar Energy Center in Franklin County, Ohio. Located in Galloway, Ohio, just outside Columbus, the project represents an expected $230 million investment in the county over the life of the project, through new tax revenue and lease payments. Pleasant Prairie has also partnered with Ohio State University’s Battelle Center for Science, Engineering and Public Policy to contribute to the education of the next generation of energy leaders.

Construction on the facility will continue through early 2027 when Pleasant Prairie Solar is expected to begin commercial operations. Invenergy has partnered with Blattner, the country’s leader in renewable energy engineering, procurement and construction, on the project’s construction. The project is expected to create up to 300 jobs during peak construction and employ three permanent staff once operational.

Invenergy celebrated this milestone with a groundbreaking event at the project site on June 10. The event included remarks from Invenergy’s Mick Baird, project landowner Squire Galbreath, and Brittany Rogers from Illuminate USA. A reception was held after the groundbreaking at the Darby House, located on the historical Darby Dan Farm, near the Pleasant Prairie project site.

Cool factor: Pleasant Prairie will be powered by U.S.-made solar panels produced at Illuminate USA, an advanced solar panel manufacturing company majority-owned by Invenergy, located in Pataskala, Ohio. Illuminate USA panels are also being used at other Invenergy solar facilities in Ohio, including Hardin III Solar, already in operation, and Cadence Solar, currently under construction.

“High-quality solar manufacturing is thriving in Ohio, thanks to our team in Pataskala and projects like Pleasant Prairie which put our panels to work across the region,” said Brittany Rogers, chief human resources office at Illuminate USA.

San José Clean Energy expands Solar Access Program

San José Clean Energy (SJCE) is expanding its award-winning Solar Access Program the construction of a new 2 MW, 8.5-acre solar power plant. SJCE celebrated the ribbon-cutting of West Tambo Clean Power II with developer Renewable America LLC and owner/operator Radial Power in Livingston, California.

“Every San José resident deserves access to affordable, renewable energy regardless of income or the type of home they live in,” said Mayor Matt Mahan. “Thanks to this new solar power plant and the leadership of San José Clean Energy, we’re not only reducing emissions, but we’re also lowering bills for families who need it most. This is exactly the kind of smart, equitable investment that moves San José forward.”

West Tambo Clean Power II features solar tracking technology that increases energy output by following the sun throughout the day. This boost in efficiency allows the program to serve an additional 150 customers.

Cool factor: The SJCE Solar Access Program provides 100% renewable energy to pollution-burdened, lower-income residents across San José at a 20% discount. While serving more than 800 customers since its launch in 2021, the program is set to expand to more than 1,000 customers over the next year thanks to the new solar power plant in Merced County and increased energy capacity, funded by the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC). The program expansion was made possible in part because of the CPUC’s recent decision in the proceeding for the Disadvantaged Communities – Green Tariff, Community Solar Green Tariff, and Green Tariff Shared Renewables Programs, supporting clean energy programs in disadvantaged communities.

The Solar Access Program was awarded the Beacon Leadership & Innovation Award from the Institute for Local Government for its collaborative and equitable climate resilience initiatives and received a commendation from the San José City Council.

Terrasmart, ESA complete solar canopy for AdventHealth in Florida

Terrasmart has partnered with ESA to complete a canopy solar project for AdventHealth’s campus in Altamonte Springs, Florida. The 3 MW photovoltaic system is now powering approximately a third of the corporate campus’s electricity needs with solar energy. AdventHealth is projected to save more than $4.6 million in energy costs over the life of the system. The canopy project will produce an estimated 4,200 MWh of clean energy each year, aiding AdventHealth’s goals to cut carbon emissions in half by 2030 and achieve net zero emissions by 2050.

Cool factor: As one of the largest privately owned solar arrays in Florida, the installation included 7,500 solar panels across the rooftops of four buildings, two multistory garages, covered walkways, and parking canopies. The project required Terrasmart to produce three separate designs — two for canopies on parking garages and one for a surface lot. The project also added 62 electric vehicle charging ports and incorporated shaded parking for hundreds of surface parking spots for staff and visitors.

“Installing a multi-canopy system in a populated area instead of an open field exemplifies the adaptability of photovoltaic design, and the continued growth potential of solar energy,” said Yury Reznikov, chief sales officer at Terrasmart.

Unlike wide-open fields where many solar projects are built, AdventHealth’s campus is in a populated area with limited access points, narrow roads, and a laydown yard three-quarters of a mile away from the primary worksite. Both Hurricane Milton and Hurricane Helene impacted the construction schedule and flooded the laydown yard, but the project was completed on a favorable revised schedule.

The world’s second largest steelmaker, ArcelorMittal, last week dropped plans to convert two plants in Germany to climate-friendly production, citing high energy costs and turning down 1.3 billion euros of subsidies. The cancellation dealt a blow to Germany’s ambitions to decarbonise steelmaking and to its strategy to use green hydrogen on a large scale to clean up industry in general.

“The focus now must be on identifying prospects for ‘green steel’ in Germany,” Klingbeil said. “We want Germany to have a strong industry. This includes ‘green steel’ for future viability.” He called for reviewing how long subsidy programmes run and how they are designed.

“We are fighting for every industry job in Germany,” Klingbeil told a party conference. “Let’s find solutions.” Labour unions warned last week that the cancellation of the projects put the future of the affected steelworks at risk. Klingbeil’s Social Democrats (SPD) traditionally have strong links to unions, and are the junior partner in Germany’s new government led by chancellor Friedrich Merz from the conservative Christian Democrats (CDU). Economy minister Katherina Reiche is also a CDU member.

Luxembourg-based ArcelorMittal said it would drop its plans for converting two plants in the country, in Bremen and Eisenhüttenstadt, to carbon-neutral production, arguing that energy costs in Germany were too high to allow for profitable operations. “Meanwhile, the European steel market is under unprecedented pressure due to weak demand and high imports,” the company said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -U.S. President Donald Trump and his allies in the Senate face a political free-for-all over passage of his sweeping tax-cut and spending legislation, which Republican congressional leaders hope to enact in coming days despite growing resistance from different party factions.

Senate Majority Leader John Thune, House Speaker Mike Johnson and administration officials are pressing Republican lawmakers to pass the One Big Beautiful Bill Act so Trump can sign it into law before the July 4 U.S. Independence Day holiday.

But hardline Republicans have redoubled their push for additional spending cuts after an official forecast that the bill would add at least $2.8 trillion to the $36.2 trillion U.S. debt. Other lawmakers, looking to minimize the impact of cuts on social programs including Medicaid, have also voiced adamant opposition to the bill’s language.

Republicans control the Senate by a 53-47 majority and the House by 220-212. One Republican from each chamber has opposed the legislation from the beginning due to the debt.

Thune aims to begin Senate action by the middle of this week and complete passage by the weekend, sending the bill back to the House for final approval.

Trump is expected to turn up the heat on senators this week, according to Republican lawmakers who view him as “the closer.”

“Great unity in the Republican Party, perhaps unity like we have never seen before. Now let’s get the Great, Big, Beautiful Bill done,” Trump said in a social media post on Sunday.

Lawmakers are still waiting for the Senate parliamentarian, the chamber’s nonpartisan gatekeeper, to decide whether the legislation qualifies for the privileged status needed to circumvent Democrats and the 60-vote Senate filibuster and pass it with only 51 votes.

“The Senate Republican bill is, simply put, bigger cuts, bigger betrayal,” Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said.

“It makes even deeper cuts to healthcare. It destroys American clean energy. It raises costs on working and middle-class families. And it rewards those at the very top,” he said.

PUSHBACK

Some Republicans are pushing back on Thune’s schedule in hopes of gaining more time to negotiate bigger savings.

“There’s no way. There’s no way,” Senator Ron Johnson, a leading fiscal hawk who wants to cut federal spending back to pre-COVID pandemic levels, said when asked if he could support the bill this week.

The Wisconsin Republican said he is coordinating with fellow hardline Senators Mike Lee and Rick Scott, who want to glean additional savings from green tax credits and the Medicaid healthcare program for lower-income Americans, respectively.

“If we had all the money in the world, why would you make a change? We don’t. We’re running $2 trillion deficits,” Scott told reporters.

The legislation has yet to pass muster with the Senate parliamentarian, a nonpartisan referee who has said Republican efforts to restrict food assistance, curtail the ability of judges to block government policies, slash funding for financial watchdogs and reverse Biden vehicle policy, violate budgetary rules.

The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office said last week the House version of the bill could lead to a $2.8 trillion increase in the federal deficit over the next decade.

The deficit hike would reach a total of $3.4 trillion, if the cost of rising interest payments due to increased borrowing needs were included, according to the agency, which took into account the bill’s potential impact on economic activity.

The report contradicted Republican claims that tax cuts would lead to buoyant economic growth and pay for themselves by generating higher revenues from increased business activity.

In a Senate floor speech last week, Thune cited a White House Council of Economic Advisers projection the legislation would increase federal revenue by $4.1 trillion, saying it would more than offset the CBO’s deficit estimate.

MEDICAID HIT

A revised Senate version of the legislation would reduce Medicaid provider taxes from 6% to 3.5% by 2031 in states that expanded the program to able-bodied recipients under the Affordable Care Act. That provision is opposed by several Senate Republicans who say it would undercut funding for rural hospitals.

“They cannot defund rural hospitals,” said Senator Josh Hawley, a Missouri Republican who has positioned himself in the debate as a champion of Medicaid.

But Republicans signaled the time for negotiations would soon come to an end and predicted that wavering members would ultimately support the legislation.

“Some people are going to have to settle for a ham and egg sandwich without the ham. That’s just the way it is,” said Senator John Kennedy of Louisiana.

Analyzed watersheds were selected based on data quality criteria, meaning sites lacking access and infrastructure for water quality monitoring were less represented in results.","Forested watersheds provide high-quality water to nearly two-thirds of municipalities in the United States1, making water treatment plants vulnerable to source water disturbances from wildfires2. Key contaminants important in water treatment process design—turbidity, sediment, dissolved organic matter (DOM), and nutrients3—are frequently reported to experience dramatic increases after wildfire events4,5,6,7,8,9,10. Increased sediment transportation and turbidity levels following wildfires are common due to the combined effects of burned vegetation and loss of root structure11,12,13, as well as increased water repellency in burned soils producing higher runoff rates13,14,15. Post-fire DOM and nutrient concentrations are often elevated due to constituents released from burned soils, as well as leaching from increased stream sediment10,16,17,18,19,20. While recovery and return to pre-fire conditions often occur within a few months or years9,21, lasting effects have been observed for decades following wildfires in several cases10,22. Numerous publications have observed these effects in in situ data on hillslope and watershed scales7,9,18,23,24,25,26. However, high natural variability between sites limits the transferability of watershed-scale findings to broad, regional trends. Scarcity of post-wildfire water quality data additionally hinders efforts to isolate wildfire effects from highly variable background drivers22. As wildfires have increased in both size and severity in the western United States in the past several decades27,28,29, identification of trends in the magnitude and duration of post-burn water quality responses are necessary to inform water treatment plant preparedness and mitigation strategies.

Physical- and process-based models have been commonly used to assess post-wildfire water quality response30. However, these models require high temporal- and spatial-resolution datasets22, limiting analyses to smaller domains with abundant data. As post-fire sedimentation rates have historically been more highly studied and monitored than DOM and nutrient responses9,31, these models have also tended to focus on sediment and debris flows30,32,33,34,35,36,37. Data-driven approaches offer an alternative to physical models, with lower data requirements and a greater ability to capture multi-variate relationships with high adaptability. These features are well-suited for analyzing a wide range of complex post-wildfire responses22, such as the runoff rates, landslide hazards, sedimentation, nutrients, and trace elements assessed in previous data-driven studies4,38,39,40,41,42,43,44. Additionally, as data-driven analyses are not limited to individual watersheds or systems, these techniques have allowed for post-fire assessments across entire regions39,44,45 and countries41.

Using similar data-driven techniques, the goal of this study is to determine broad, long-term trends in post-fire water quality responses across the western United States. By focusing on both magnitude and duration of water quality changes, this study aims to inform water treatment plant planning and resilience efforts. We analyze a comprehensive set of sediment, DOM, and nutrient contaminants critical in water treatment process design over a large sample of watersheds to understand regional variability. Rust et al.45 is the only post-fire study to previously analyze a similar set of contaminants over the western United States, using statistical tests to determine significant responses up to 5 years post-fire. However, our study uniquely incorporates a regression-based approach to isolate wildfire effects from background hydroclimatic drivers up to 8 years post-fire, following similar methods used in Williams et al.44 and Beyene et al.39 for analyzing post-fire runoff and trace elements, respectively. Additionally, to allow for this more robust analysis for a traditionally data-limited application, we used a custom-created dataset of 538 watersheds to maximize data availability—significantly more numerous than the 65 to 179 basins used in previous studies39,44,45. Using this framework, we quantified the duration and magnitude of impacts and identified predictors of inter-watershed variability.

Unifying data across the western United States

In situ water quality data across the western United States were first collected and assessed across 245 burned basins, totaling 107,310 wildfire-affected water quality datapoints on a daily timestep. These were analyzed and compared to a set of 104,031 datapoints from 293 unburned basins. Data comprised measurements of carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus, sediment, and turbidity levels. As shown in Fig. 1, total suspended solids (TSS), total dissolved solids (TDS), and turbidity (TURB) had the largest sample sizes, with each making up roughly 17% of the total dataset. Dissolved organic carbon (DOC), total inorganic nitrogen (TIN), nitrate (NO3−), and total dissolved phosphorus (TDP) had the least availability, each comprising 3% or less of the total available water quality data. The rest of the constituents—total organic carbon (TOC), dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN), total phosphorus (TP), suspended sediment concentration (SSC), and suspended sediment discharge (SSD)—had moderate sample sizes, with each comprising 5–10% of the total dataset. Data collection, watershed delineation, and basin screening processes are described in Methods and further information on constituent data is in Supplementary Table 1.

Taken in aggregate across the entire western United States, post-wildfire water quality constituent levels generally increased, despite varying rates of significant changes within individual basins. When comparing constituent levels from eight years leading up to wildfire events in all burned basins to levels from two years after fire events (Supplementary Fig. 1), post-fire means were greater than pre-fire means for all constituents except SSD and TDS, which exhibited −16% and −3% changes in mean rates and concentrations, respectively. Mean levels of aggregated carbon characteristics showed up to a 462% increase post-fire, nitrogen and phosphorus characteristics showed up to a 224% increase, sediment characteristics showed up to a 254% increase, and turbidity showed up to a 4420% increase. Data from individual basins exhibited similar post-fire changes overall, though often lacking in statistical significance based on the Mann-Whitney U-tests. The percent of basins where post-fire changes were statistically significant ranged from 17% for TSS to 45% for DOC, with ~20–30% significance rates typical for most of the other constituents.

Broad changes in post-wildfire water quality

Linear models were built for each constituent in each basin to control for hydroclimatic variability across basins and through time, as described in Methods. Model covariates included total daily precipitation, potential evapotranspiration, maximum temperature, and estimated runoff, as these are prominent drivers of background water quality levels in streamflow24,42,43. Using these variables and water quality measurements for each basin, models were trained on pre-fire data to isolate burn impacts, characterized by residuals in post-fire periods. The framework used for these models is shown in the following equation (Eq. 1):

$$C={\sum }_{i=1}^{n}{\beta }_{i}{X}_{i}+{\beta }_{0}$$

(1)

where C is mean daily levels of a specific constituent, related to n hydroclimatic covariates specified by X. The coefficients β were calibrated over the pre-fire data before applying models to the entire period of record. Model performance metrics, tested using leave-one-out-cross-validation across pre-burn periods, generally indicated acceptable model accuracy for water quality modeling standards39,46. For each constituent, most models (i.e., greater than ~50%) had ratio of root mean squared error to standard deviation values less than 0.9, percent bias values in the range of −10% to 10%, and Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency values greater than 0.2. Models with extremely poor performance metrics were discarded to ensure accuracy of the analysis (discussed further in Methods).

Sharp, extended responses were observed after wildfire events for all 12 constituents (four of which are shown in Fig. 2)—consistent with post-fire trends observed on smaller scales4,9. Responses, or residuals, in each post-fire year were compared to constituents’ natural variability, characterized by residuals from pre-burn periods and unburned basins. Significant (p ≤ 0.05) increases in each post-fire year were determined when the means of residuals across all burned basins were above the upper 90% confidence bounds of both unburned basins’ residuals for that same year, as well as burned basins’ residuals from 8 years preceding wildfire events. Response magnitudes in each post-fire year were additionally determined by the difference in mean residuals from average pre-fire residuals.

Following this method, significant increases were observed in the first year post-fire for all constituents except TIN and TDP. Responses of TOC, DOC, TP, TSS, and TURB all peaked in the first post-fire year as well, with mean residuals increasing by 3213–28,570% compared with average pre-fire residuals. TIN, DIN, NO3−, TDP, and TDS had slightly delayed responses, peaking in the second- or third-year post-fire with residual increases of 253–27,852% compared with pre-fire residuals. These responses were all significant except for TDP, where mean residuals were significantly elevated compared to pre-fire data, but not compared to unburned basin responses. This confirms previous reports of the highest post-wildfire water quality responses within the first three years after a wildfire event9,22,23,47. However, SSC and SSD responses showed a longer delay, peaking in the fourth year post-fire with residual increases of 9829% and 1935%, respectively, compared with pre-fire residuals. Where TSS peaked in the first year post-fire, SSC and SSD responses are inversely proportional to streamflow and were likely smaller in the first few years due to elevated post-fire runoff rates9. Delayed spikes in sedimentation may have additionally been driven by shallow landslides which can occur in the years following wildfire events due to decaying roots from burned vegetation14,21,40. For nitrogen and phosphorus constituents, delays may have been due to variable vegetation recovery timelines influencing stream nutrient concentrations43,48.

Responses of DOC, TIN, DIN, NO3−, TSS, TDS, and TURB were sustained for 5–8 years post-fire. Though these extended responses were not significant as compared with unburned basin responses in several cases, concentrations of DIN and NO3− were continually significantly elevated for 5 and 8 years, respectively. Long vegetation recovery periods4,22,48 may have contributed to extended responses in nitrogen constituents, which are highly influenced by plant regrowth, as well as sediment constituents due to erosional effects from sparse vegetation9,12,13.

Inter-basin variability

The selected covariates in the model-building process provided insight into drivers for each water quality constituent, which varied regionally as seen in Fig. 3. Water-related covariates (i.e., precipitation and runoff) were dominant for all constituents in all regions. However, the prevalence of temperature-related covariates (i.e., temperature and potential evaporation) and seasonal indicators (day of water year of the water quality measurement) varied across regions. For sediment, nitrogen, and phosphorus characteristics, temperature-related covariates had a greater influence in mountainous and plains regions as compared with coastal areas. This may be due to the effects of seasonal temperature fluctuations on vegetation regrowth in these regions—shown to have a strong influence on post-fire sediment and nutrient levels14,48. For carbon characteristics in a regional context, temperature covariates had slightly greater influence in coastal regions, with almost none in plains and deserts—potentially due to water being the limiting factor for constituent transport in these dryer regions. The day of water year when water quality measurements were taken was most explanatory in the Southwest for carbon, nitrogen, and sediment characteristics, and in mountainous regions for phosphorus. Similar to temperature covariates, this may be due to seasonal variations in vegetation growth in these regions. The spatial distribution of covariate influence across the western United States is shown in Supplementary Fig. 3.

Basin and fire characteristics influence

The relative forested and developed areas for each basin, as well as the distance of burn scars from basin outlets, showed strong correlations with post-fire responses for several constituents. Pearson’s correlations between each constituent’s residuals from the first two years post-fire and each physical variable are shown in Fig. 4, with significant values (p ≤ 0.05) bolded. The forest coverage in each basin had significant, positive relationships (correlation > ~0.2) with TOC, DOC, NO3−, and SSC responses, explaining 14%, 31%, 13%, and 18% of their variance, respectively. This may be due to higher post-burn runoff rates as reported in more heavily forested watersheds in previous studies44, resulting in increased constituent transport.

Developed area had significant, positive relationships with DOC and TDP, explaining 7% and 33% of their variability, respectively. This aligns with previous reports that showed proximity to urban locations strongly affects post-fire nutrient concentrations, likely due to the deposition of fossil fuel emissions43. The distances between fires and basins’ outlets was significantly negatively correlated with TDP and SSC, explaining 9% and 15% of their variability, respectively. This may be due to diluting effects of additional unburned tributaries introduced downstream from burned areas.

By leveraging several decades of water quality data aggregated from 538 burned and unburned basins across the western United States, this study provided evidence of distinct, wildfire-driven DOM, nutrient, and sedimentation increases lasting up to 8 years post-fire. In past research, the magnitude and duration of observed post-wildfire changes vary widely between studies and are often not significant within individual basins9—limiting the transferability of findings to other areas. Through maximizing data availability, a regional scope, and control of climatic factors’ effects on water quality, this study’s framework revealed significant signals in water quality in the western United States for multiple years post-fire. While previous studies have attempted more narrowly focused regional-scale analyses, incorporation of 245 burned basins here along with 293 unburned basins and over 200,000 combined datapoints was considerably more numerous than the 65 to 179 watersheds used in other studies39,44,45.

Our findings provide strong evidence of multi-year persistence in significant water quality degradation driven by wildfires across the domain. While most previous wildfire studies have focused on short-term (~2–3 years) effects9, our study is consistent with findings from the few studies which have analyzed long-term implications of wildfires on water quality22,23,48,49. This suggests that long-term post-wildfire water quality degradation is a common outcome. Here, we found that average post-fire organic carbon concentrations were elevated for 2–8 years, inorganic nitrogen concentrations were elevated for 5–8 years, phosphorus concentrations were elevated for 2–3 years, sedimentation was elevated for 4–8 years, and TDS and turbidity were elevated for 5–8 years, as compared with pre-fire levels. For most constituents, these trends were significantly greater than unburned basin responses in most years as well, though post-burn responses tended to lower in magnitude and fall below the level of significance after 2–5 years post-fire.

These longer-term effects suggest that wildfires on average impact deeper layers of soil, burn larger vegetative structures, and disrupt nutrient cycles to a greater extent than previously suspected. The slow return of nitrogen concentrations to pre-fire conditions was likely due to nutrients releasing from deep soil layers through combustion, then subsequently getting washed away through elevated runoff rates—resulting in long vegetation recovery periods following wildfires48. Similarly, DOM, sediment, and turbidity responses were likely elevated long-term due to lingering erosional forces from loss of tree canopies and root structure14, resulting in soil instability which took years to recover through vegetative regrowth. This soil instability may have also driven the delayed responses observed in SSC and SSD, which likely peaked in the fourth year post-fire due to shallow landslides occurring years after runoff rates returned to pre-fire conditions. These years-long elevated concentrations and delays in responses support the importance of vigilant water quality monitoring for years following wildfire events.

Watersheds with higher forest coverage and larger developed areas tended to be associated with greater post-fire response magnitudes. Carbon, nitrogen, and sediment responses had strong correlations to basins’ forested areas, potentially due to greater deposition of organic matter, nutrients, and ash from larger fuel sources, as well as increased transportation from higher post-fire runoff rates reported in more heavily forested watersheds44. These constituents were also correlated with larger developed areas in basins, potentially due to increased atmospheric deposition from burning fossil fuels43. Though the proximities of fires to sampling locations were negatively correlated with phosphorus and sediment, land cover characteristics overall had a greater influence on constituents than burn extent and proximity. This emphasizes the importance of the types of fuel available, versus area burned, in post-fire water quality response43.

Though a high number of sites and datapoints were used in these analyses, results were still limited by spatial and temporal data scarcity. Analyzed watersheds were selected based on data quality criteria, meaning sites lacking access and infrastructure for water quality monitoring were less represented in results. Within the sites selected, irregular and infrequent water quality measurements resulted in a wide range of goodness-of-fit in linear models built. Due to limited data timespans, only 8 post-fire years were analyzed, whereas previous studies have suggested that wildfire effects may persist for decades9,22. Additionally, attribution of response magnitudes to basin and fire characteristics was limited for many constituents (e.g., sediment characteristics) due to low numbers of datapoints and high variability across sites. Future research may explore alternate modeling methods to increase model skill, examine longer response durations as additional years of data become available for recent wildfires, and incorporate additional covariates in assessment of inter-basin response variability. Normalized differenced vegetation index, soil information, and wildfire severity (i.e., burn extent represented by soil and vegetation characteristics) and intensity (i.e., burn temperature and duration), for example, have previously been shown to affect post-wildfire water quality42,43,50 and may be more closely correlated with constituent response magnitudes.

Findings from this study may help inform wildfire planning and resilience efforts in the face of increasing wildfire threats27,51. In particular, water utilities may consider the longevity and magnitude of the post-fire responses identified in this study as possible benchmarks—preparing for 1–8 years of elevated constituent loads following a wildfire event, with the potential for dramatic increases in magnitude up to 300 times pre-fire levels. Additional mitigation, such as sedimentation basins, may be required to manage 8+ years of post-fire sediment, while shorter-term solutions such as increased coagulant dosages may be considered for DOM responses3. Another key finding is that variability in post-fire responses are partially explained by physiographic watershed features, which highlights the importance of localized assessments, depending on watersheds’ local characteristics3. For example, more heavily forested watersheds may require expanded treatment capacity for DOM, nutrients, and sediment. Such planning efforts are expected to become increasingly important in the western United States in the coming decades, as wildfire hazards are projected to proliferate27,51 with water resources already stressed by increasing drought driven by climate change52.

Site selection

Beginning with a set of 51,101 custom-delineated basins with in situ stream water quality information from 1974–2022, burned and unburned basin subsets were filtered by burn extent, data availability, and land cover criteria. Initial data mining and basin delineation processes, including data sources, are discussed further in the Supplementary Methods and displayed in Supplementary Fig. 2. Using wildfire data from 1984–2021, basins were designated as burned when the perimeter from at least one individual fire overlapped with at least 5% of their total areas and unburned when no fires intersected with more than 0.5% of their areas—similar to criteria in previous studies39,44,45. Wildfires which affected an individual basin within the same water year were merged and considered as an individual fire event, with the date of ignition designated as the start date of the first fire. Where multiple fires affected the same basin outside of a single water year, events which occurred less than six years after a previous fire were discarded.

Basin subsets were then screened for data availability and land cover criteria. In an individual basin, each monitored constituent was required to have at least 20 days of pre-fire data and 10 days of post-fire data, as well as a period of record spanning more than 3 years before and after the date of fire ignition. Basins where these criteria were not met for any of their measured constituents were discarded. For each of the unburned basins, the ignition dates referenced for this filtering step were from fires affecting the closest burned basins. Though these sample sizes are low for model-building processes in individual basins, similar criteria were used by previous studies which aggregated water quality data in basins across the western United States39,45. Basins were further screened for those with greater than 25% forest coverage and less than 5% developed area (i.e., cities and residential areas) to maximize consistency in basins’ geophysical characteristics—similar to thresholds used in Williams et al.44, and Beyene et al.39, respectively. As shown in Table 1, the attributes of the final 245 and 293 burned and unburned basins selected for analysis were similar between the two subsets.

Regression-based response analysis

Broad changes in water quality constituents were assessed for each post-fire year using a regression-based modeling approach, following similar methods as Beyene et al.39 and Williams et al.44. Multivariate linear regression models were built for each basin to control for the influence of hydroclimatic variables on water quality levels, with the goal of isolating post-fire changes driven by wildfire activity. Natural variability in water quality was characterized by responses in pre-fire data, as well as unburned basins—compared to post-fire responses to assess their significance and magnitude outside of expected trends22,44,53.

Hydroclimatic variables of precipitation, potential evapotranspiration, maximum temperature, and runoff were selected as candidate covariates for the modeling process due to their known impacts on background water quality levels in streamflow24,42,43. Precipitation, surface runoff, and streamflow are the primary driving mechanisms of sedimentation and turbidity, influencing erosional processes and heightened transportation rates11,54. Temperature and potential evapotranspiration are correlated with vegetation growth and stream temperatures, which control plant nutrient uptake and deposition and oxygen solubility, respectively—influencing nutrient and DOM concentrations55,56. A day of water year variable was additionally tested as a candidate covariate for each model to capture potential impacts of seasonality. While direct measurements of streamflow and stream temperature would have been ideal candidate covariates, these were only available for a small subset of the total basins. In an effort to maximize the number of candidate study locations, we elected to use reanalysis-based estimate for these quantities. While these lack in situ-level detail, they are observationally-driven and were continuous in both space and time.

As shown in Table 2, 49 candidate hydroclimatic covariates were prepared for building each model: Four variables at daily timesteps, additionally calculated for three moving average window widths and two transformations, plus the day of water year variable. First, gridded daily hydroclimatic variables were averaged across each basin, creating a singular time series for each. For each of these variables, 7-, 30-, and 90-day trailing moving average windows were then calculated for each day. These lag-times were evaluated to capture the time required for transport of constituents to basins’ outlets, as well as the effects of longer-term shifts in hydroclimatic variables, e.g., a rainy season to a dry season, on constituent response41. Additional square- and log-transformations were calculated for each moving window size for each covariate, as variable distributions were mostly non-normal (assessed using density distributions and Q-Q plots). Sources and preprocessing steps for these covariates are discussed further in the Supplementary Methods.

Multivariate linear regression models were built for each constituent in each burned and unburned basin using key hydroclimatic covariates. These models were trained on pre-fire data to isolate the effects of hydroclimatic variables from burn effects. To improve inter-basin comparability, z-score normalization was first applied to water quality data for each basin using its pre-fire records. A correlation analysis was then completed for candidate covariates in each model-building process to reduce potential collinearity. The absolute maximum Pearson’s correlation was calculated between all covariates, then those with a > 0.8 correlation with another covariate were removed, keeping the one more highly correlated with the water quality variable57.

To build each model, covariates were selected using a forward step-wise approach, reducing potential overfitting due to high numbers of potential covariates and low sample sizes39,44. The covariate with the highest absolute Pearson’s correlation with the response variable, i.e., pre-fire constituent data, was first used to condition a single-variable linear model. This initial model was evaluated using the Akaike information criterion with a bias correction for small sample sizes (AICc)58, which penalizes complexity and is recommended when the ratio of sample datapoints to covariates is less than 4059. The model was then applied over the pre-fire training dataset, calculating residuals from the difference between observed and estimated constituent levels. From the remaining candidate covariates, the one most highly correlated to the previous model’s residuals was then added to create a new model, calculating a new AICc. The additional covariate was retained if it lowered the AICc value by more than 2. This process was repeated until the addition of a new covariate did not satisfy the delta AICc requirement.

Performance metrics were calculated for each model using a leave-one-out cross-validation method applied to pre-fire data, similar to methods used by Beyene et al.39, and McManus et al.60. Leave-one-out cross-validation involves first assigning one day of covariate and predictand variables as testing data, calibrating a model with data from the remaining days, then using that model to predict the response on the testing day. This process was repeated for each available day, then model performance metrics calculated from the full observed and predicted datasets. Metrics commonly used in water quality modeling were selected to evaluate each model46: the Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency61, percent bias, and the ratio of the root mean squared error to standard deviation. These metrics describe, respectively, the model error relative to the total variation, the tendency of the model to overpredict or underpredict, and the goodness-of-fit of the model39,62. Models with low skill—or ratio of root mean squared error to standard deviation scores greater than 1—were discarded to ensure accuracy of results. An analysis exploring the influence of more strict filtering criteria is analyzed and discussed in Supplementary Fig. 4, Supplementary Fig. 5, and the Supplementary Discussion.

For each constituent, the mean and 90% confidence interval bounds were calculated for basins in the burned and unburned subsets for each pre- and post-fire year. Overall confidence bounds from all years of pre-fire residuals in burned basins were also calculated. Fire-related change in a post-fire year was then considered significant (p ≤ 0.05) if the residual mean was outside both the confidence bounds for all pre-fire residuals in burned basins, as well as the bounds of the unburned basins’ confidence interval for that year. Response magnitudes driven by burn effects were calculated as the percent difference between average pre-fire residuals and mean residuals for each post-fire year.

Inter-basin variability attribution

A correlation analysis was used to attribute differences in post-fire constituent responses to geophysical watershed and wildfire characteristics. Evaluated characteristics include percent forested, developed, shrubland, and grassland areas in each basin, as well as basins’ areas, percent burn extent, and the distance of wildfire burn scars from their outlets—factors shown to be influential on water quality response in previous studies39,42,43,44. Similar to methods used in Williams et al.44, model residuals averaged across the first two years post-fire in each burned basin were first plotted against each watershed and fire characteristic to visually assess their linear relationships. A best-fit linear model was applied to each combination, with an R2 calculated to assess the strength of relationships. Correlations were then assessed by calculating Pearson’s correlation coefficients between every response and factor combination, additionally calculating which were significant (p ≤ 0.05).",https://media.springernature.com/m685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs43247-025-02427-6/MediaObjects/43247_2025_2427_Fig1_HTML.png,N,,2025-06-23 10:16:28.177331

Among the matters up for discussion are whether to mandate the sale of public lands across several states and the fate of energy tax credits from the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act.

President Donald Trump weighed in on that dispute over the weekend, but his continued hostility to incentives for wind, solar, hydrogen and other sources is unlikely to deter lawmakers in both the House and Senate pushing for more leniency.

“I HATE ‘GREEN TAX CREDITS’ IN THE GREAT, BIG, BEAUTIFUL BILL. They are largely a giant SCAM. I would much prefer that this money be used somewhere else, including reductions. ‘Anywhere’ would be preferable!” the president wrote on Truth Social.

“Windmills, and the rest of this ‘JUNK,’ are the most expensive and inefficient energy in the world, is destroying the beauty of the environment, and is 10 times more costly than any other energy. None of it works without massive government subsidy (energy should NOT NEED SUBSIDY!). Also, it is almost exclusively made in China!!! It is time to break away, finally, from this craziness!!!”

Shortly after that post, longtime wind backer Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) wrote on X, “Iowans get 60% of their electricity from wind energy. It’s an important tool for America’s energy independence &2 keep Iowans’ utility bills low.”

As deliberations continue ahead of an expected full Senate vote — including another amendment vote-a-rama — groups and companies are continuing their lobbying blitz.

The Geothermal Exchange Organization urged Senate Finance Chair Mike Crapo (R-Idaho) in a new letter to extend the residential energy saving tax credit for geothermal heat pumps.

“This credit supports energy infrastructure that strengthens grid reliability, reinforces domestic supply chains, and sustains a skilled U.S. workforce (including drillers and heavy equipment operators) while ensuring the United States, not China, leads in data center expansion and AI deployment,” wrote the group’s president, Ryan Dougherty.

More senators against land sales

Senate Energy and Natural Resources Chair Mike Lee (R-Utah) has been adamant about including public land sales in the budget reconciliation package over vocal opposition from members of the Montana delegation.

Lee may have left Montana out of the latest language, but that may not be enough to secure victory. The Idaho Statesman and Lewiston Tribune reported over the weekend that both Crapo and GOP Sen. Jim Risch of Idaho were against public land sales in the megabill.

“After a careful and thorough review of the legislative text in the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee reconciliation title, Senator Crapo does not support the proposed language to sell public lands,” communications director Melanie Lawhorn wrote in a statement to the newspapers.

Lee’s proposal calls for the sale of up to 1.5 percent of the federal estate across 11 states. Protected areas would be exempt, and local leaders would be able to propose plots.

A new draft obtained by POLITICO’s E&E News last week said land owned by the Bureau of Land Management and Forest Service would be sold only for “the development of housing or to address associated infrastructure to support local housing needs.” Environmental groups have alleged that other changes in the latest draft would open up even more lands for sale.

Responding to criticism, Lee has noted that the bill exempts national parks, national monuments, wilderness areas, national recreation areas and 11 other categories of federally protected land.

Lee also told conservative podcaster Glenn Beck last week that objections to the land sales were “falsehoods being circulated by the left.” He called the sales “a commonsense solution to a national problem.”

Yet on Sunday evening, Lee suggested even more changes were coming, writing on X: “Hunter Nation: You spoke, and I’m listening. I’ll be making changes in the coming days.”

Flurry of parliamentarian rulings

The Senate parliamentarian — the referee of the budget reconciliation process, increasingly used by both parties to approve legislation without a filibuster-proof majority — has made numerous rulings both for and against megabill provisions.

Parliamentarian Elizabeth MacDonough ruled against language that would make it harder for groups and individuals to sue the administration. She also disqualified a provision against government settlement agreements with money going to third parties, according to a release from Democrats over the weekend.

The parliamentarian, according to information release late Sunday night, ruled against language to fund federal reorganization plans and to prohibit agencies from enforcing rules with spending impacts that are not explicitly called for in law. The language was part of a push by conservatives to limit federal rulemaking powers through reconciliation.

She also said a provision to mandate the sale of Postal Service electric vehicles and associated infrastructure did not meet budget reconciliation requirements.

Last week, MacDonough said language against EPA tailpipe emissions standards for passenger vehicle model years 2027 or later did not have enough of a budgetary nexus.

She also ruled against a provision allowing companies to get faster National Environmental Policy Act permits if they pay a certain amount. Other similar permitting provisions appear to remain in play.

MacDonough cleared Republicans clawing back spending from the Inflation Reduction Act but said repealing the underlying law would not conform with budget reconciliation.

The parliamentarian also approved contentious language that would enact a 10-year moratorium on state regulation of artificial intelligence. States that defy the federal government stand to lose aid.

Other loose ends

It’s unclear whether the Senate will move forward with a House fee on electric vehicles and hybrids. Last week Ohio Republican Sen. Bernie Moreno, who supports the idea, said lawmakers were having trouble making it work.

“There is no mechanism today for the federal government to collect an annual fee. Doesn’t exist,” he said.

Senate Majority Leader John Thune (R-S.D.) is looking to craft a final bill that can pass both chambers with tight Republican majorities. Not doing so would make it all but impossible for Trump to sign it by July 4.

The House approved its version of the megabill, the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act,” in May after limited floor debate. But the budget reconciliation process — meant to bypass the filibuster — requires the Senate to go through days of debate and amendment votes before a bill can pass.

Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) last week warned that Senate language related to Medicaid would lead to protracted negotiations between the chambers.

“I don’t know why we would pass something that the House can’t pass and will force us into [a] conference,” Hawley said.",https://static.politico.com/dims4/default/55a1666/2147483647/resize/1200/quality/100/?url=https://static.politico.com/b1/14/71ac927d447e90bcd25964392709/congress-clean-energy-98091.jpg,N,,2025-06-23 10:18:41.482025

The poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research finds that U.S. adults’ support for tax credits for electric vehicles and solar panels has weakened, as well as their enthusiasm for offshore wind farm expansion. While Democrats remain the strongest supporters of these initiatives, the poll reveals signs of growing cynicism within their ranks.

The poll results coincide with sweeping changes President Donald Trump’s Republican administration is making to regulations related to energy and climate change, including slashing the federal workforce in these departments. And although Democrats and independents have weakened their support for some green energy initiatives, there has not been an increase in support for Trump’s energy policies.

The poll found only about 4 in 10 U.S. adults — including only 1 in 10 Democrats and about 2 in 10 independents, along with three-quarters of Republicans — approve of the way Trump is handling climate change, which largely tracks with his overall approval rating.

Democrats and independents drive decline in support for renewable energy credits

About 6 in 10 Democrats, 58%, favor tax credits for purchasing an electric vehicle, down from about 7 in 10 in 2022. Among independents, support declined from 49% in 2022 to 28%. Only one-quarter of Republicans supported this policy in 2022, and that hasn’t changed measurably.

“As far as the pollution goes ... the vehicles nowadays put out very little emissions to the air,” said JD Johnson, a 62-year-old Democrat from Meadowview, Virginia, who somewhat opposes tax credits to purchase an electric vehicle. That’s partly because he sees the electric vehicle manufacturing process as energy intensive and believes gasoline-powered vehicles have made improvements with the pollutants they emit.

The decline in favoring solar panel tax credits was across the board rather than being concentrated among Democrats.

“For solar panels, in all honesty, I don’t think they’re that efficient yet,” said Glenn Savage, 78, a left-leaning independent from Rock Hill, South Carolina. “I’d rather see them pour money into research and try to get the solar panels more efficient before they start giving tax breaks to the public. I may be wrong on that, but that’s just my thought.”

Scientists say transitioning to renewable energies and ditching fossil fuels that release planet-warming emissions are essential to protect the planet. Billions of dollars in project grants for clean technologies awarded during President Joe Biden’s Democratic administration have been canceled by the Trump administration, and the offshore wind sector has been stunted by Trump’s executive order that paused approvals, permits and loans for wind energy projects.

Fewer than half of U.S. adults, 44%, now say that offshore wind farms should be expanded in the U.S., down from 59% in 2022. About half favor expanding solar panel farms, while about two-thirds were in support in 2022.

When people are concerned about the economy and their personal finances, environmental issues are sometimes prioritized less, said Talbot Andrews, an assistant professor in the department of government at Cornell University who was not involved in the poll.

“I think it makes people anxious to think about increased taxes or increased spending on environmental issues when the cost of eggs are going through the roof,” Andrews said.

Low support for Trump’s efforts to expand offshore drilling and coal mining

Trump has championed the expansion of offshore oil drilling, as well as domestic coal production.

Despite a decline in support for expanded renewable energies, the new poll shows that only about one-third of U.S. adults think offshore drilling for oil and natural gas should be expanded in the U.S., and only about one-quarter say this about coal mining.

In both cases, Republicans are much more likely than Democrats to support expanding these energy sources.

Trump has sought to open up national monuments for oil drilling, but more U.S. adults oppose than support auctioning off more public space for oil drilling. Only about one-quarter of U.S. adults favor this, while 4 in 10 are opposed. Republicans are much more likely than independents or Democrats to be in support.

Bipartisan support for consumer

rebates and home appliance ratings

The Energy Star program that certifies appliances, such as dishwashers and refrigerators, as energy efficient recently appeared in headlines when the EPA made plans to scrap the program. The blue and white logo is well recognized, and experts say the program has long had bipartisan support until recently.

The poll found three-quarters of Democrats support providing consumer rebates for efficient home appliances, compared with 6 in 10 Republicans.

Patrick Buck, 54, from Chicago, describes himself as a liberal Republican and is a fan of the consumer rebates for energy-efficient appliances. “It seems to work in terms of transforming what people have in their houses, because a lot of people have a lot of old appliances and just can’t afford new ones,” he said.

Safe air, water, meat and produce

The poll found only about 2 in 10 U.S. adults are “extremely” or “very” confident in the federal government’s ability to ensure the safety of their drinking water, the air they breathe and the meat, poultry, fruits and vegetables they buy in grocery stores.

About 4 in 10 U.S. adults are “somewhat” confident in the federal government’s ability to ensure the safety of each of these, and about 4 in 10 are “not very” or “not at all” confident.

The Trump administration has announced plans to roll back rules and policies related to limiting pollution and greenhouse gas emissions, such as rules that limit pollution from power plants and blocking California’s efforts to phase out cars that run on gas. The federal government has also cut staff at the Food and Drug Administration, the federal agency tasked with protecting public health and ensuring food supply safety.

From 2027, the new British Industrial Competitiveness Scheme will aim to reduce electricity costs for over 7,000 energy-intensive manufacturing businesses by up to £40 per megawatt hour. Sectors such as automotive, aerospace and chemicals are among the intended beneficiaries. Additional support will be provided through the British Industry Supercharger, which will increase electricity network charge discounts for the most energy-intensive industries — such as steel, chemicals and glass — from 60% to 90% starting in 2026.

These measures are designed to improve competitiveness, safeguard jobs, and support reinvestment, while also contributing to the UK’s broader aim of transitioning to clean energy and reducing reliance on fossil fuel markets. A new Connections Accelerator Service will streamline grid access for investment projects, prioritising those with strong economic and employment impacts.

The Industrial Strategy targets eight high-growth sectors: Advanced Manufacturing, Clean Energy Industries, Creative Industries, Defence, Digital and Technologies, Financial Services, Life Sciences, and Professional and Business Services. Each will be supported by a tailored 10-year growth plan.

In the clean energy sector, the UK aims to double investment by 2035. Great British Energy, based in Aberdeen, will play a central role, with a further £700 million allocated to clean energy supply chains, bringing the total for the Great British Energy Supply Chain Fund to £1 billion. In Scotland, £200 million will support the Acorn carbon capture and storage project, building on regional expertise in oil and gas.

Up to £185 million has also been allocated to Scotland through the Clean Industry Bonus, intended to unlock up to £3.5 billion in private investment for ports and high-tech components for both fixed and floating offshore wind. Aberdeen’s Energy Transition Zone is attracting investment in hydrogen and clean technologies, supporting its development as a global energy hub.

Oil prices jumped to a five-month high Monday following U.S. airstrikes on Iranian nuclear facilities, sparking concerns that prices could climb higher in the coming days and weeks.

While the full economic impact remains uncertain, much depends on how Iran responds, particularly whether it attempts to shut down the Strait of Hormuz.

Iran threatens to close Hormuz Strait

On Sunday, the Iranian Parliament approved a measure to close the waterway.

About 20 million barrels of crude oil pass through the strait daily, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Located between Iran and Oman, the waterway is one of the world’s most critical oil chokepoints.

If Iran shuts it down, oil prices would likely spike globally, with serious implications for the U.S. economy.

“The important thing to know is that the Strait of Hormuz ships 20% of global oil production,” said Patrick De Haan, head of petroleum analysis at GasBuddy. “While we are not a beneficiary — we are not a buyer of crude oil from Iran — the U.S. cannot detach itself from the global economy.”

US warns Iran against closing Hormuz Strait

The White House has not confirmed whether it anticipates further retaliation, but top officials have warned Iran against taking steps that could further escalate tensions.

Secretary of State Marco Rubio, in an interview with Fox News’ “Sunday Morning Futures,” warned closing the strait would be a “massive escalation that would merit a response from the U.S. and others.”

Vice President JD Vance went further, calling such a move “economic suicide” for Iran.

“Their entire economy runs through the Strait of Hormuz,” Vance told NBC’s “Meet the Press.” “If they want to destroy their own economy, it can cause disruption in the world. I think that would be their decision, but why would they do that?”

Instead, he urged Iran to return to the negotiating table and abandon its nuclear weapons program.

“If they are willing to do that, they are going to find a willing partner in the United States of America,” Vance said.

Despite rising prices, De Haan said there’s no immediate reason to fear what he described as “apocalyptic” gas costs. Still, he warned the national average could increase by 10 to 25 cents per gallon within the next week or two.",https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/06/AP25173345229488-3.jpg?w=1280,N,,2025-06-23 11:20:10.513729

Unlike BMW, Mercedes-Benz and Volkswagen, Audi does not have a factory in the US. But with President Trump introducing additional 25 per cent tariffs on vehicles imported from Germany and Mexico – where Audi’s main plants are located – the carmaker faces a serious challenge. Although tariffs on vehicles from Mexico have since been reduced to 15 per cent, it remains a significant burden.

The current situation is economically unsustainable for Audi. Just absorbing the tariffs would severely impact its bottom line, while passing the additional cost on to customers would be difficult to justify. This has created mounting pressure in Ingolstadt – and the German brand may now regret not setting up a dedicated US facility sooner. In early May, it emerged that Audi is looking into launching local production.

Now, faced with Trump’s revived tariff policy, Audi is ready to make a swift decision about a US-based manufacturing strategy. According to German magazine Der Spiegel, an all-new factory currently appears more likely than earlier options, including shared production at VW’s existing Chattanooga plant in Tennessee, where the all-electric ID.4 is already built, or at the Scout Motors facility under construction in Blythewood, South Carolina, where the foundation stone was laid in February 2024.

Der Spiegel says that if Audi decides to build its own factory, it would most likely be in the south, allowing the company to leverage the existing supplier network of the VW Group. Such a factory would reportedly employ between 3,000 and 4,000 workers. Series production could begin in late 2027 or early 2028.

However, before the Audi board makes a final decision on US production, the company plans to await the outcome of ongoing trade talks between the US and the EU. Final tariff terms may yet be reduced. On the other hand, the early months of Donald Trump’s second term have underlined his unpredictability – and whether any future agreement would provide lasting certainty remains unclear.

Regardless of the outcome, establishing a local production footprint would bring more than just tariff-free status for US-built and sold vehicles. Audi could also benefit from credit mechanisms for cars manufactured domestically but exported abroad – with those credits potentially offsetting duties on imports from Germany or Mexico. Such a model would be especially advantageous for larger vehicles like the Q8.",https://www.electrive.com/media/2024/03/audi-q6-e-tron-produktion-production-2024-02-min.jpg,N,,2025-06-23 10:19:22.916278

The second stage of Western Power’s Clean Energy Link – North transmission project is set to receive a $584 million boost, alongside major decarbonisation and household battery investments.

Driving the energy transition

Under its Made in WA plan, the State Government has pledged to fast-track clean energy projects and support local manufacturing of the components needed to deliver this renewable energy infrastructure.

This includes a $584 million investment in Clean Energy Link – North and Regans Ford terminal to unlock wind generation north of Perth, thereby to expanding renewable generation and enabling the shutdown coal-fired power stations by 2030.

The 2025–26 Budget also outlines more than $2.7 billion of new investment for made in economic infrastructure to unlock new and expand established industries. This includes a further $500 million boost to the Strategic Industries Fund – taking the total to $1 billion – which will support provision of further common-user infrastructure at Strategic Industrial Areas around the State including in Kwinana, the Pilbara and Kemerton.

The Western Australian Government has also pledged $50 million to support local battery manufacturing; $83 million to produce electric buses and ferries in the state; and $30 million will go towards a further round of funding for new energies industries through the Investment Attraction Fund to support critical minerals, hydrogen and carbon capture and storage projects.

A $25 million investment has also been announced to help diversify Western Australia’s economy and secure the poles and wires needed to deliver the state’s energy transition.

This includes $10 million to help deliver an advanced manufacturing facility in Forrestfield, which will supply Western Power with the thousands of kilometres of transmission lines it will require to deliver the state’s energy transition.

Western Power will also become a foundational customer of a new a new Advanced Manufacturing and Technology Hub (AMTECH) in Picton, and has been allocated via the Strategic Industries Fund to support the planning for this facility.

A further $10 million has been allocated in the State Budget for a Local Industry Development Fund, helping Western Power achieve the highest level of commercially viable local content in delivering the energy transition.

The Budget also includes:

$30 million towards the Collie Industrial Transition Fund (allocated beyond the forward estimates) to further support the transition of Collie’s economy to new and emerging industries

$13.5 million to undertake network connection works required for a new 50 per cent renewable power generation station

$5.3 million for the new Blackstone Power Station and Solar Farm (partially funded by $1 million in Commonwealth funding)

$4.5 million to finalise the replacement of a transformer at the Murdoch Drive Zone substation in the Pilbara

$2 million to undertake a study into establishing a space launch facility

$1.6 million towards the Pilbara Energy Transition Plan

$3.5 million to progress detailed design for Berth 8 and 9 at the Port of Geraldton, providing capacity to support renewable energy projects such as wind turbine blades

Batteries

The Western Australian Government also said that its 2025–26 Budget will help local businesses benefit from a surge in demand for household batteries to harness solar energy, with the $337 million WA Residential Battery Scheme.

The Residential Battery Scheme includes no-interest loans, ensures tens of thousands of households can store the renewable power they generate at home, receive ongoing cost-of-living relief and help secure the state’s clean energy future.

This is complemented by the Federal Government’s $2.3 billion Cheaper Home Batteries Program and aims to will ensure around five times as many households can seamlessly access the complementary schemes than originally proposed under the state scheme.

According to the State Government, an estimated 100,000 households are set to benefit from a combination of the state and federal election commitments to assist with the cost of installing batteries.

Synergy customers are eligible to receive up to $5000 and Horizon Power customers eligible for up to $7500. Households are expected to save up to $1500 per year through installing a battery and solar panels.

The State Government has also rolled out a $50 million Local Battery Manufacturing Program, which enables eligible Western Australian battery manufacturers to access a $30 million grants program to grow their capacity to provide competitive residential battery products to local and international markets.

Grants will be up to $10 million and must be matched dollar for dollar by the proponent.

The package also includes $20 million for low-interest loans or provision of State Government land to encourage industry to make major new investments in technology and expanded production facilities.

Western Australian Premier, Roger Cook, said that building batteries in Western Australia was a key part of the State Government’s Made in WA plan.

“It will support our nation-leading battery rebates, which in turn will secure our clean energy future and provide long-term, sustainable cost-of-living relief to tens of thousands of households throughout Wester Australia,” Mr Cook said

“These programs are part of a Budget that will secure our state’s economic future and deliver a future that’s Made in Western Australia.”

Western Australian Energy and Decarbonisation and Manufacturing Minister, Amber-Jade Sanderson, said the Residential Battery Scheme and the Local Battery Manufacturing Program are clear examples of the State Government ensuring that Western Australians benefit from the energy transition.

“Direct grants and low-interest loans will provide support for local companies to expand to take advantage of the surge in demand for batteries from households wanting to store more of their solar energy for when they really need it,” Ms Sanderson said.

“The Residential Battery Scheme helps households with ongoing cost-of-living relief while creating the right environment for increased business investment and growth.”

Western Australian Treasurer, Rita Saffioti, said this this investment is good for business, good for households and good for the state’s economy.

“It’s about supporting local businesses to grow their capacity, ultimately creating more jobs for Western Australians while also keeping power bills lower for households,” Ms Saffioti said.

“The Local Battery Manufacturing Program is all part of our Made in WA plan, building on the success of returning railcar manufacturing to Western Australia to continue diversifying our economy, supporting jobs and propelling our State forward.”

Empowering the next generation

The 2025–26 Western Australian State Budget also includes several key investment to build tomorrow’s workforce and develop the next generation of skilled energy professionals. This includes a $331 million investment in training initiatives and a $122 million extension of popular Fee-Free TAFE initiative and additional provision of construction courses.

Other key training initiatives outlined in the 2025–26 Budget are:

$100 million investment to support Fee-Free TAFE

$33.9 million uplift in funding for the TAFE Modern Equipment program

$429,000 to undertake planning for the $17.1 million expansion of South Metropolitan TAFE’s Munster campus to include renewable industries training facilities

The Western Australian Government said that the expansion of South Metropolitan TAFE’s Munster Campus will provide state-of-the-art facilities to deliver future workforce skills for the renewables industry, including wind energy, battery technology, green hydrogen, electrification, automation and robotics.

The project is expected to include instrumentation and battery laboratories, an automation classroom and control room, specialist classrooms for wind energy training, computer laboratories, general classrooms and other facilities.

Mr Cook said that building a skilled workforce helps keep Western Australia’s economy the strongest in the nation, powers the transformation to renewable energy and delivers on the State Government’s commitment to make more things in Western Australia.

“This Budget continues to reflect my government’s support for fee-free TAFE and securing a future that’s Made in WA,” he said.

“We know training is vital to delivering the workforce of tomorrow.

“That’s why my government is building Western Australia’s construction workforce, training our clean energy workforce, and providing the funding to make sure our students are trained with the best and most appropriate equipment.

“At the same time, we’re attracting skilled building and construction workers from overseas and interstate to meet the industry’s current demands.”",https://www.energymagazine.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/AdobeStock_785069344-Large.jpeg,N,,2025-06-23 09:08:52.345707

As Congress debates the GOP's sweeping budget reconciliation bill, some lawmakers are working to include a provision which would delay a methane polluter fee.

The Waste Emissions Charge was meant to be an incentive for oil and gas operators to minimize leaks and flaring that send methane into the atmosphere by capturing it, and bringing it to market. Methane, the primary component of natural gas, is more than 80 times more potent at trapping heat in the atmosphere than CO2.

Randy Willard, president of the nonprofit Save the Aurora Reservoir, said reining in pollution is important on a number of levels, including climate change.

""Also from an air standpoint, here in Colorado, we have some of the worst air in the country,"" Willard pointed out. ""We know that 60 percent of that, at least, comes from oil and gas production in our space. And a big chunk of that is methane.""

Colorado has failed to meet Environmental Protection Agency air quality standards for decades, coinciding with a boom in fracking operations. Some smaller oil and gas operators have complained about the costs associated with capturing methane. Delaying the pollution fee would be in sync with President Donald Trump's campaign promises to remove regulations on the fossil fuel industry in order to achieve energy dominance.

The International Energy Agency estimates at least 50 percent of oil and gas methane emissions can be avoided at no net cost to operators.

David Jenkins, president of Conservatives for Responsible Stewardship, believes the fee is critical for holding oil and gas companies accountable.

""They can spend the money necessary to reduce waste and capture and sell that methane and natural gas, or they can pay a fee for the pollution that they're emitting,"" Jenkins noted.

Americans largely support requiring oil and gas companies to pay pollution fees, according to a recent poll.

Jenkins added some operators are already deploying methane capture technologies, many of which were pioneered in Colorado.

""It just seems to make no sense why politicians, and some bad apples in the oil and gas industry, are pushing against something so basic,"" Jenkins observed. ""And it does so much good for so little investment.""",http://kiowacountypress.net/sites/default/files/favicon-512.png,N,,2025-06-23 11:18:33.262662

Industry: Solar

Link: https://www.zacks.com/commentary/2519515/3-solar-stocks-to-watch-amid-ira-funding-uncertainty

The U.S. solar industry is poised for growth, supported by record installations and strong projections for 2025. However, challenges remain in the form of the temporary freeze on Inflation Reduction Act funding in early 2025, which disrupted solar project timelines. Also, high interest rates and economic uncertainty continue to weaken residential demand.

China’s dominance in low-cost solar module manufacturing is pressuring U.S. producers. Nevertheless, utility-scale projects are thriving, with solar generation expected to rise 33% this summer. A few prominent forerunners in this industry that solar investors may keep in their portfolio are Nextracker,Array Technologies and Tigo Energy Inc.

About the Industry

The Zacks Solar industry can be fundamentally categorized into two groups of companies. While one is involved in designing and producing high-efficiency solar modules, panels and cells, the other is engaged in installing grids and, in some cases, entire solar power systems. The industry also includes a handful of companies that manufacture inverters for solar power systems, which convert solar power from modules into electricity required by electric grids.

Per a report by the Solar Energy Industries Association (“SEIA”), published in June 2025, photovoltaic (PV) solar accounted for 69% of the new electricity-generating capacity added to the U.S. grid in the first quarter of 2025. Hence, it remains the nation's dominant form of new generating capacity.

3 Trends Shaping the Future of the Solar Industry

Record Solar Installations Boost Prospects: The U.S. solar industry has been witnessing a solid installation trend lately. As reported by SEIA, the industry installed approximately 10.8 gigawatts-direct current (GWdc) of new solar capacity during the first quarter of 2025, marking the fourth-largest quarterly installation on record.

We expect to witness a similar robust solar installation trend in the United States in the near term as well. To this end, the U.S. Energy Information Administration (“EIA”) expects U.S. solar generation to grow 33% this summer and 32.5 GW of new utility-scale solar capacity to be added to the U.S. grid by the end of 2025. Such impressive projections are indicative of a bright outlook for U.S. solar stocks.

Freezing Inflation Reduction Act Dealt an Initial Blow: Following the Inflation Reduction Act's (“IRA”) enactment in August 2022, actual investment in clean energy technologies and infrastructure improved a solid 71% to $493 billion (as per the Clean Investment Monitor Report) during the second half of 2022 to the first half of 2024.

However, in January 2025, current U.S. President Trump suspended all IRA funding disbursements. This freeze caused momentary delays and widespread uncertainty for various solar projects across the nation.

This decision by the U.S. administration invited widespread criticism, particularly from climate scientists and advocates, and the majority of the funds freeze was revoked following a court order in April. The initial freeze created significant hesitancy and disrupted planning for many solar initiatives, which might result in a significant delay in the completion of projects, thereby hurting U.S. solar stocks’ growth trajectory in the near term.

Macroeconomic Challenges Might Hurt: Recent macroeconomic challenges in the U.S. economy have also negatively impacted the solar industry. In particular, the residential solar space has been reflecting signs of continued struggles over the past couple of quarters. In the first quarter of 2025, residential solar installations in the United States tanked 13% year over year, as high interest rates and economic uncertainty continued to suppress demand. Looking ahead, SEIA projects growth in the residential solar segment to remain flat in the next five years due to multiple issues like broader power sector challenges, a lack of labor availability, high voltage equipment constraints and interconnection delays.

China’s dominance in solar module manufacturing is another major headwind for U.S. solar stocks. With China accounting for 80% of global module capacity, the country's oversupply of solar panels has been putting significant downward pressure on module pricing in the United States.

As a result, U.S. module manufacturers are facing a cost competitiveness challenge, with solar PV manufacturing costs in China being 20% lower than in the United States (as per a report by the International Energy Agency). While America is making efforts to support its domestic solar module industry, it faces difficulty competing against cheaper modules offered by China. This might have some adverse impact on the profitability of the U.S. solar industry in the near future.

Zacks Industry Rank Reflects Grim Outlook

The Zacks Solar industry is housed within the broader Zacks Oils-Energy sector. It currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #181, which places it in the bottom 26% of more than 245 Zacks industries.

The group’sZacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates bleak near-term prospects. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.

The industry’s position in the bottom 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries is due to a negative earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate.

Looking at the aggregate earnings estimate revisions, it appears that analysts have lost confidence in this group’s earnings growth potential over the past few months. The industry’s bottom-line estimate for the current fiscal year has moved down 43.7% to 94 cents since March 31.

Before we present a few solar stocks that you may want to consider for your portfolio, let’s take a look at the industry’s recent stock-market performance and valuation picture.

Industry Lags Sector & S&P 500

The solar industry has underperformed both its sector and the Zacks S&P 500 composite over the past year. The stocks in this industry have collectively lost 46% in the past year, while the Oils-Energy sector gained 1.3%. The Zacks S&P 500 composite has surged 9.4% in the same time frame.

Industry's Current Valuation

On the basis of a trailing 12-month EV/EBITDA, which is commonly used for valuing solar stocks, the industry is currently trading at 4.69X compared with the S&P 500’s 16.87X and the sector’s 4.87X.

Over the past five years, the industry has traded as high as 50.91X, as low as 4.22X and at the median of 24.09X.

Regular checks of electrical protection, battery condition, and charging ports are crucial. Protecting the underbody with anti-rust coating, maintaining tire health, and ensuring electrical safety at home are also vital for safe and efficient EV operation during the rainy season.

How to keep your EVs safe this monsoon.

With the monsoon set to begin across many parts of India, electric vehicle owners have more than just potholes and traffic jams to worry about. In India, where EV adoption is steadily rising, knowing how to maintain your EV during monsoon months is becoming increasingly important. Whether it’s your daily commute or a long weekend ride, following a few precautionary measures can help keep your electric scooter or car running safely and efficiently.Here are some key tips to keep your EV in top shape during this wet season.

How to keep your EVs protected in monsoon: Key things to note

One of the first things to check is the vehicle’s electrical protection. Even though most EVs come with IP67-rated components, including the battery and connectors, it’s important to inspect rubber seals on doors, windows, and charging ports regularly. Water seepage can affect sensitive electronics, so it's best to play it safe. The battery is the core of an electric vehicle, and it needs special attention during the rains. Make it a habit to inspect the battery area for any signs of corrosion or dampness. If you spot cracks in the casing or feel any moisture buildup, it's essential to get it checked at a service center without delay. Batteries are sealed well, but over time, wear and tear can make them vulnerable.

Charging your EV during heavy rains also requires some care. Make sure to plug in your vehicle only when the port is completely dry. It's best to charge indoors or under a shelter. If you have a home charging station, ensure it’s well-insulated and shielded from rain. Using waterproof covers for charging cables and sockets is an added layer of protection. The underbody of your EV also takes a beating during monsoon drives. Water, slush, and road salt can corrode metal parts over time. To prevent this, consider getting an anti-rust coating done at a service center. Washing the underbody regularly will also help get rid of debris and reduce long-term damage. Tyre health becomes even more critical in wet conditions. Worn-out treads can lead to slipping and poor grip, especially on muddy or waterlogged roads. Make sure your tyres are properly inflated and have enough tread depth. This helps ensure better handling and braking. Damp interiors are another common concern. Using rubber or waterproof mats helps prevent water from soaking into the carpet. After every ride, check for wet patches inside the cabin and dry them promptly to avoid foul smells. Electrical safety at home shouldn’t be ignored either. Make sure your charging socket is earthed properly. Unplug the charger during lightning storms and consider installing a safety switch to prevent damage during voltage surges.

Economists warn that the future of America’s battery plants—and the EV transition in general—depends on three things: consistent policy, stronger EV demand, and global competitiveness.
And if Chinese batteries stay cheaper, the U.S. will need to compete smartly or risk being priced out.","The 2022 Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) initiated a wave of clean energy investment, especially in electric vehicle (EV) battery plants across Southern and Midwestern states referred to as the “Battery Belt.”

Companies rushed to take advantage of the generous tax credits and growing EV demand. However, according to the Rhodium Group’s Global Clean Investment Monitor report dated June 18, 2025, the momentum is now sagging.

Waning Investment

By 2024, $11 billion per quarter was pouring into EV battery manufacturing, but by early 2025, $6 billion worth of projects were shelved or scrapped as battery production began outpacing EV sales.

Consumers are still hesitant to adopt EVs due to their high cost, range anxiety, and limited charging infrastructure. EVs make up just 10% of new car sales in the U.S., lagging behind China (where more than half of all new vehicles are electric) and Europe.

Political Uncertainty

Another reason for this hesitance is that some lawmakers are pushing to repeal key IRA incentives, like the $35/kWh battery credit and the $7,500 EV buyer credit, as well as rolling back emissions rules.

Without these incentives and rules, U.S.-made batteries would become a lot more expensive, and automakers may scale back domestic production and/or turn to cheaper Chinese alternatives—a major setback for domestic clean energy leadership. Geopolitical tensions and shifting tariffs are further complicating things.

Stranded Assets?

Investment in EV supply chains soared more than sixfold between 2021 and 2024, with over $200 billion announced since 2018—roughly three-quarters of it for battery production. But in the first quarter of 2025, EV investment fell 4.5%, and battery investment dropped 11.4% compared to the previous quarter.

Only about 25% of all projects launched since 2018 are up and running, and just 7% since the IRA passed. In response to the market shift, car makers are rethinking their battery needs. With 70% of battery projects still in development, there’s growing concern that some newly built or half-finished plants could become “stranded assets”—built in expectation of an EV boom that never happens.

The U.S.’s EV Future

If more plants stall, it could slow clean energy progress and put thousands of jobs at risk—especially in states that welcomed these projects with big tax breaks. Economists warn that the future of America’s battery plants—and the EV transition in general—depends on three things: consistent policy, stronger EV demand, and global competitiveness.

Long-term tax credits and strong emissions rules give car companies and investors confidence, but more people need to be buying EVs so that plants stay busy. And if Chinese batteries stay cheaper, the U.S. will need to compete smartly or risk being priced out.

At its heart is a promise to create hundreds of thousands of skilled jobs, unlock tens of billions in private investment, and deliver more secure, affordable energy to British households and businesses.

The Clean Energy Industries Sector Plan, published alongside the new Industrial Strategy, outlines how clean power can be the engine of national renewal.

It sets out clear goals: doubling annual investment in the clean energy sector by 2035, building grid infrastructure at speed, and supporting a new generation of workers in high-skilled, well-paid roles across the country.

In his foreword, Secretary of State for Energy Security and Net Zero Ed Miliband spells out the stakes. “There is now a route to more stable energy bills for households and businesses, as they increasingly go electric. We have also experienced the harsh repercussions of Britain’s over-reliance on fossil fuels,” he writes.

The plan covers everything from offshore wind and solar to carbon capture, heat pumps, fusion and the long-awaited grid upgrade.

It calls for a massive acceleration in grid investment, with an additional £10 billion a year in transmission spending between 2025 and 2030. It also promises reforms to the connection queue and faster planning decisions for new infrastructure.

Jobs bonanza

A key part of the plan is the creation of a new Clean Energy Workforce Strategy.

With more than 450,000 people already employed in low-carbon roles, the government wants to expand this significantly, with an emphasis on strong wages, trade union representation, and opportunities across every region.

The investment push will be led by Great British Energy, with a new £1 billion Clean Energy Supply Chain Fund and support from the £27.8 billion National Wealth Fund.

The goal is not just to build turbines or capture carbon — it’s to ensure UK-based supply chains and workers benefit as the world races to decarbonise.

Exports are also in focus. The strategy pledges to ramp up clean energy exports, open trade opportunities, and provide clear long-term market signals to attract global investment. The UK, the plan argues, is well positioned to become a global leader in green technology and infrastructure.

The government says the strategy will make clean power not only central to climate goals, but the foundation of industrial strength.

It reflects a post-crisis shift — shaped by the energy shock of the Ukraine war and the need for energy independence.

With delivery plans now being developed with industry, the strategy is pitched as a mission — not just a policy.

The long-term drying of the American Southwest poses a gathering and measurable threat to hydropower generation in the Colorado River basin.

Should Lake Mead, the reservoir formed by Hoover Dam, continue to shrink, a substantial drop in the dam’s hydropower output is on the horizon.

The diminished state of the lake and the potential severe drop in electricity supply illustrate the consequences of a warming climate for the region. Built in the throes of the Great Depression, Hoover was the signature project of a country displaying its grit and engineering prowess to tame the West’s mightiest rivers to irrigate farmland and build cities. Today the dam is an aging asset buffeted by hydrological change and generating half the power that it did just a generation ago.

According to the Bureau of Reclamation, the federal agency that manages the basin’s large dams, if Lake Mead falls another 20 feet, Hoover Dam’s capacity to generate electricity would be slashed by 70 percent from its current level.

If there is a reason not to be especially alarmed it’s this: Hoover is just a small piece of the region’s electric power infrastructure. Federal dams along the Colorado River account for just over 4 percent of Arizona’s generating capacity, for instance.

Still, the cheap electricity is a lifeline for tribes and small rural electric providers. And the dam’s ability to be quickly turned on and off helps regulate the peaks and troughs of electricity demand. Curtailing this source of inexpensive electricity would raise the cost of power in the region while also challenging the integration of renewable energy into the electric grid.

A hydropower shortfall will be “bad news for us,” said Ed Gerak, executive director of the Irrigation and Electrical Districts Association of Arizona, which represents power providers that receive federal hydropower from Colorado River dams.

Lake Mead now sits at an elevation of 1,055 feet. The break point for hydropower is 1,035 feet. At that level, 12 older turbines at Hoover that are not designed for low reservoir levels would be shut down, Reclamation said. Five newer turbines installed a decade ago would continue to generate power.

The threat is real, especially as this year’s runoff forecast for the basin continues to worsen. Every month, Reclamation updates its projection of reservoir levels over the next two years. The June update shows a 10 percent chance that Lake Mead breaches 1,035 feet in spring 2027.

In a worst-case scenario, the breach would happen at the end of 2026, just when current operating rules for Lake Mead and Lake Powell expire. The modeling indicates a similar chance that Lake Powell drops low enough in 2027 that Glen Canyon Dam, another key hydropower asset in the basin, stops producing electricity.

The probability that Lake Mead drops that far is small and laden with uncertainties about weather and water use. But it is large enough that Hoover’s power customers are signaling their concern.

Reclamation, for its part, acknowledges the problem at Hoover and is evaluating its options. The agency estimates that replacing the 12 turbines would cost $156 million.

“Reclamation is assessing the cost-benefit analysis of replacing some of the older style turbines and the timeline for installation,” the agency wrote in a statement to Circle of Blue. “Ordering new turbines is a lengthy process as they have to be designed, model tested, built and ultimately installed.”

The dozen older turbines are not designed to operate at low reservoir levels. Dams like Hoover, which was completed in 1936, function based on the principle of hydraulic head, which is the difference in elevation between the top of the reservoir and the intake pipes for the dam’s powerhouse. When the hydraulic head drops, so does the water pressure. That can trigger the formation of air bubbles in the water, which can gouge and damage the turbines in a process called cavitation.

The five turbines that would not be shut down are low-head units that can accommodate lower reservoir levels. Installed a decade ago at a cost of $42 million in response to a previous rapid decline in Lake Mead, they can operate down to 950 feet. (One of those five turbines is currently offline, and Reclamation does not have an estimate for when it will resume operating.)

Hoover is already hobbled by low water. Power generation in 2023 was roughly half the output of 2000, the last year that Lake Mead was effectively full.

When Lake Mead is full, Hoover has a generating capacity of 2,080 megawatts, equivalent to a large coal-fired or nuclear power plant. Today its capacity is 1,304 MW. If the dozen older turbines go offline, it will drop again, to 382 MW.

These declines in hydropower generation have been felt by the customers who buy Hoover Dam’s electricity, Gerak said. In a shortfall, they have to buy market-rate electricity. Depending on the season and power demand, market rates can be considerably more expensive.

Eric Witkoski is the executive director of the Colorado River Commission of Nevada, which manages the state’s allocation of Hoover’s power. Witkoski said that rural electric companies in his state have a higher share of their electricity coming from the dams and would be most affected by a shortfall.

The value of Hoover’s electricity is measured not just in raw megawatts and dollars. It is a flexible power source that can be ramped up and down to match the region’s daily and seasonal rhythms. Energy use rises in summer afternoons when air conditioning units are blasting and electricity-consuming household chores are at hand. It falls at night when cooler air prevails and washing machines are silent.

“The beauty of hydropower is that it’s great for helping to stabilize and regulate the grid,” Gerak said.

IEDA and other interest groups are pursuing a number of fixes. They are encouraging Reclamation and its parent agency the Interior Department to use federal infrastructure funds to install new low-head turbines or to request appropriations from Congress.

They are writing their congressional representatives in support of the Help Hoover Dam Act, a bill that would unlock some $50 million in ratepayer funds that had been set aside for pension benefits for federal employees. The trade groups claim that Congress funds the pension benefits through other means and that the funds could be spent on dam upgrades if Reclamation was given the authority to do so.

They also want to set up an organization modeled after the National Parks Foundation that can accept donations for dam operations and maintenance, including the visitor center, which is supported by power sales.

These fixes will take time. But as Lake Mead declines, the urgency to achieve them will intensify.",https://i0.wp.com/www.circleofblue.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/2012-10-03-Nevada-Colorado-River-JCGanter_G3_1143-Edit-2500.jpg?fit=2500%2C1667&ssl=1,N,,2025-06-23 07:10:01.044606

This initiative marks a move towards zero tailpipe emissions in heavy-duty logistics vehicles.

The partnership has already seen the deployment of four additional fuel cell trucks, following an initial demonstration vehicle.

These trucks are now operational across key logistics routes in Belgium, France, Germany, and the Netherlands.

Toyota is working with logistics providers Vos Transport Group, CEVA Logistics, Groupe CAT, and Yusen Logistics to integrate these zero-emission vehicles into the daily operations of Toyota Parts Centre Europe.

The Toyota Parts Centre Europe is a hub of activity, handling over 500,000 parts and accessories each day. The performance of the 40-tonne fuel cell trucks will be closely monitored here.

The company said, these trucks offer a comparable performance to diesel counterparts but produce no tailpipe emissions.

They are powered by electricity generated from hydrogen and oxygen, with a range of up to 400km on a single refuel under real-world conditions.

In addition to environmental benefits, the fuel cell trucks provide a smoother ride with their vibration-free electric motors, enhancing driving comfort and reducing community disturbance.

Linde will operate the largest air separation unit on the Mississippi River, adding to the company’s extensive industrial gases infrastructure in Louisiana.

The facility is expected to start up in 2029.

DONALDSONVILLE, La. – Linde, a global industrial gases and engineering company, announced it is investing more than $400 million to build the largest air separation unit (ASU) in the Mississippi River corridor on the West Bank of Ascension Parish. The unit will supply oxygen and nitrogen essential to low-carbon ammonia production at Blue Point Number One, a joint venture between CF Industries, JERA and Mitsui & Co.

Linde’s new project is expected to create 15 direct new jobs at the new facility with an average annual salary more than 45% above the parish average wage, while also retaining over 100 current positions across the state. Louisiana Economic Development estimates the project will also result in an additional 50 indirect new jobs, for a total of 65 potential new jobs in the Capital Region.

“This announcement is yet another win for the West Bank as we build out the industrial base and bring high-wage job opportunities to the area,” LED Secretary Susan B. Bourgeois said. “For more than half a century, Linde has helped make Louisiana a global energy leader. Their latest investment reflects our shared commitment to optimizing our legacy sectors while driving our entire business ecosystem toward growth, innovation and global impact.”

The ASU will enable Linde to supply both nitrogen and oxygen for the production of low-carbon ammonia at the Blue Point Number One complex— a $4 billion world-scale facility currently under development and projected to become the world’s largest low-carbon ammonia plant upon completion.

Linde has supported Louisiana’s industrial growth for decades, with facilities in Geismar, St. Charles Parish, Vidalia, Lake Charles and Sulphur, as well as an extensive pipeline network across south Louisiana. This latest investment in Donaldsonville builds on the 2020 launch of a state-of-the-art syngas processing plant in Geismar, further strengthening the region’s role in large-scale energy projects.

“This project is another application of Linde’s world-scale air separation technology and we are honored to contribute to Blue Point’s vision for a low carbon ammonia supply chain,” Linde Executive Vice President North America Sean Durbin said. “We appreciate the support from Louisiana Economic Development, which enables us to strengthen our industrial gas infrastructure and increase U.S. manufacturing capacity.”

This project marks a major milestone in the ongoing development of the RiverPlex MegaPark. The addition of Linde’s advanced ASU alongside Blue Point Number One and Hyundai’s nearly $6 billion steel mill signals growing momentum for the 17,000-acre site, reinforcing Louisiana’s position as a hub for next-generation energy and manufacturing investments.

“This latest investment marks a powerful affirmation of the RiverPlex MegaPark’s industrial future,” Ascension Parish President Clint Cointment said. “With three major announcements in just four months, we’re witnessing a commitment to revitalize a rural area that’s long been overlooked. The Westbank is rising — this is just the beginning.”

The facility is anticipated to begin construction in 2026 and start up in 2029.

“Industrial growth like this doesn’t happen by accident. It’s the result of smart planning, long-term vision, and people working together to create opportunity where it’s needed most,” Ascension Economic Development Corp President and CEO Kate MacArthur said. “We are looking forward to Linde’s new location in west Ascension and appreciate their continued investment in our parish.”

To win the project in Ascension Parish, LED offered a competitive incentive package, including the comprehensive workforce development solutions of LED FastStart. The company is also expected to participate in the state’s Industrial Tax Exemption and Quality Jobs programs.

,Clean Energy ,2025-06-23 10:02:31+00:00,Chicago Tribune,Clean energy job training offers hope to hundreds: 'It's changed my life' - Chicago Tribune,Nara Schoenberg,,,,,https://www.chicagotribune.com/2025/06/23/clean-energy-job-training-illinois/,"“It’s changed my life,” Foley said of the training program.
Republicans in the U.S. Senate are currently working on a tax bill that would slash clean energy tax credits for businesses, homeowners and consumers.
Hope and fear Foley was basically homeless when a friend who works at the 548 Foundation told him about the solar job training program.
“I thanked RW just, like, a million times,” Alston said of Revolution Workshop, the nonprofit that ran his training program.
When he started his solar training program, talking to graduates gave him hope that this wasn’t just another career dead end.","Jordan Foley ticks off what he didn’t have when he started an intensive 13-week solar job training program on the West Side: money, a bed, clothes, food.

The fear that the program wouldn’t be able to help him was intense, but Foley, 31, pressed on, learning the math, science and construction skills needed to wire and install rooftop solar panels.

He took tests, drew up blueprints and did daily physical training: pushups, jumping jacks and solar-panel carrying exercises.

And in April, his hard work paid off. He landed a job as a project administrator for a clean energy company.

“It’s changed my life,” Foley said of the training program. “It’s definitely changed my life for the better.”

Foley is part of the first big wave of state residents to benefit from a long-awaited network of clean energy job training hubs established under Illinois’ ambitious 2021 climate law, the Climate and Equitable Jobs Act. The inclusion of job training was a major demand of environmentalists and their allies, who were determined to see Black and Latino communities share in the benefits of the clean energy economy.

Eleven of 16 major training hubs statewide are now up and running, training hundreds of people.

“This moment is massive,” said Juliana Pino, interim co-executive director at the Little Village Environmental Justice Organization. “It’s really significant because before the Climate and Equitable Jobs Act, communities had to fight very hard to even have (access to job training) be respected and understood.”

There were 541 students enrolled in the workforce hub training classes in mid-May, and 94 who had already graduated, according to the Illinois Department of Commerce and Economic Opportunity.

The program is state-funded, so it’s not directly affected by President Donald Trump’s attacks on renewable energy, but if opportunities in the field diminish, that could hurt graduates’ job prospects, advocates said.

Republicans in the U.S. Senate are currently working on a tax bill that would slash clean energy tax credits for businesses, homeowners and consumers. The House passed a similar measure last month.

Among those eligible for the free training, which comes with a stipend and support services, are energy workers who have lost their jobs, people who have been in the foster care system, people who live in communities disproportionately burdened by pollution, and those who live in communities with high crime and incarceration rates.

“You’re bringing in hundreds — and thousands — of people into the middle class,” said A.J. Patton Sr., CEO and managing partner of 548 Enterprise, the parent group to the nonprofit 548 Foundation, which runs the workforce hub where Foley trained.

“This is not just a workforce program. This is a public safety program. If I can take somebody off the corner and hand them a solar panel, I’ve changed their life,” Patton said.

‘It’s game on’

Under a sky hazy with Canadian wildfire smoke, 30 men and women in hard hats and neon construction vests pored over solar panels mounted on mock roofs they had built themselves.

The students were considering wiring configurations, screwing in cables and responding to questions from solar master trainer Sam Garrard.

In about a week, when the course at the 548 Foundation’s West Side workforce hub at St. Agatha Catholic Church will conclude, the students will be able to install a solar array for a house, a car or a shop, Garrard said.

“Now they’re just (taking) all their book knowledge and their hands-on knowledge that they’ve acquired and using it,” he said.

The atmosphere was intense but supportive, with trainees calling craft-instructor manager Keith Lightfoot “coach” and responding instantly on the one occasion when he sternly uttered a single word — “Language!” — in response to an expletive.

Among the challenges: Students have to do the math for solar arrays and learn the details of electrical wiring, according to graduate Cortez Heard, now a solar installer for a local clean energy company.

“It definitely did get challenging, but as a young man, you’ve got to understand it’s going to be tough, and if you are ready for what you want to do, it’s game on,” said Heard, 27, of Chicago.

Such job training opportunities are the product of a long, hard fight in Illinois — one that can be traced back to the state’s previous climate law, the Future Energy Jobs Act of 2016.

The 2016 law was, in many ways ahead of its time, but it delivered some tough lessons to community organizers trying to make sure that Black and brown residents got their fair share of new jobs.

“We got our tails kicked by labor,” with many jobs and opportunities going to the relatively white construction trades, said Tony Pierce, co-pastor of Heaven’s View Christian Fellowship church in Peoria and board president of Illinois People’s Action, a multi-issue faith and community organization in Bloomington.

The next climate bill, environmentalists and organizers vowed, would be different.

They partnered with churches and social service organizations to hold community meetings across the state and hammer out a vision for what the clean energy economy should look like.

Again and again, organizers heard the same thing from communities, Pino said: “We don’t want (clean energy) to be just a replica of other new industries that show up in our neighborhoods, don’t give us meaningful access, and we ultimately don’t see the benefits.”

There was even a rallying cry: “No climate, no equity, no deal.”

In the end, Gov. JB Pritzker, a strong supporter of climate action, stepped in to help get the bill across the finish line, and the environmentalist coalition won big. The new law not only set a goal of 100% clean energy by 2050 but invested heavily in job training for people and communities that might otherwise be left behind.

There are multiple workforce training programs under the Illinois climate law, including ones for people seeking union apprenticeships and for people in prison, but the workforce hubs program is the largest, and its progress has been closely watched.

More than $30 million in climate-law funding has already been awarded to the workforce hubs, according to the state.

Hope and fear

Foley was basically homeless when a friend who works at the 548 Foundation told him about the solar job training program.

He received a stipend for attending, and within a few weeks his caseworker was able to find him a small room to rent and even a brand-new bed to sleep in.

“That was a blessing,” he said. “From there, I took full advantage of the program.”

There were challenges: A relative died; not long after, another relative also died suddenly and prematurely.

And then there was his fear of simply finishing the program.

“I didn’t understand what could come from it,” Foley said. “I was more afraid of, ‘What happens when you have to go back to being hungry? What happens when you put in all of this energy, all of these days, and there is no (one) that wants to hire you?’ I was very terrified of that.”

Foley said he almost didn’t take the final certification test, relenting only when Felicia Nixon-Gregory, the director of training and workforce development, sat down and talked with him.

And then, when he graduated, it was into a dark December for clean energy.

Winter, in general, isn’t a good time to get hired for solar installer jobs in Illinois, and after President Donald Trump was elected in November, some clean energy employers took a wait-and-see approach to hiring.

The 548 Foundation workforce hub solar training program initially had a job placement rate of 85%, which then dropped to about 50% and was inching back to 80% by mid-May, according to Patton.

After he graduated, Foley found himself struggling to get paid what he was owed for short-term jobs.

Still, he continued to work on issues he cared about, starting a youth ministry and volunteering at Prairie Guardians, an environmental nonprofit in Bloomington.

And then, when he’d almost given up on a career in solar, he got a text from a case manager at his training program about a job at Atlanta’s Dimension Energy with a $65,000 to $75,000 salary, a 10% sign-on bonus and unlimited PTO, or paid time off.

“I said, ‘What is PTO?’” Foley recalled with a laugh. He had never heard of that.

The company made him an offer, flew him to Atlanta to meet the team and put him up in a fancy hotel.

He was worried that somehow the job, which is based in Chicago, wouldn’t materialize, but then he got his company computer and corporate credit card.

People told him, “Don’t mess this up,” he said.

“I was like, ‘You’re crazy if you think I’m going to mess any of this up,’” Foley recalled.

A job at Rivian

There were high hopes for clean energy job training when the Illinois climate bill passed in 2021, and then there was frustration as year after year, the workforce hubs failed to materialize.

“This is one of the difficulties with having such nation-leading legislation,” said Francisco Lopez Zavala, an Illinois Environmental Council climate policy program associate.

“There was no other state in the U.S. to really model off in the efforts Illinois is leading in, with providing these trainings focused on the clean energy trade at such a scale, with the barrier reduction services that are offered,” he said.

Among the issues, some state agencies didn’t initially have enough staff, Lopez Zavala said, and even now, in some places “it’s still a struggle that we’re continuing to work (on).”

Pritzker’s office did not respond to a written question about workforce hub delays but issued a statement saying in part, “The idea for the CEJA workforce hubs originated with people from marginalized communities. The hubs are proof of the value of following environmental justice principles and ensuring impacted people have a seat at the table.”

The services available to reduce barriers for workforce hub students can include child care, bus and gas cards, and assistance with housing and food.

The idea is to give students the support they need to be productive and show up for class, said Crystal Overton, the 548 Foundation’s director of student support services.

A recent day found her buying clothes for the students’ job interviews.

“I’m just thinking all the time, how are we preparing them for success?” Overton said. “It needs to be a holistic approach, and not just education. It needs to be like Maslow’s hierarchy of needs: Are they taken care of? Because if not, they’re not going to come in open and receptive to the lesson.”

The 11 regional workforce hubs that are already up and running include four in Chicago: the 548 Foundation hub with locations on the South and West sides, two Chicago Cook Workforce Partnership hubs on the South and West sides, and a Safer Foundation hub on the South Side.

Classes vary, with the Chicago Cook Workforce Partnership focusing on job readiness training with an emphasis on soft skills as well as an introduction to career pathways and occupations in the clean energy industry.

“Ideally, someone can walk in, not knowing anything about the different career pathways, and then make a choice: OK, do I want to be a solar panel installer or do I want to work in HVAC?” said Abram Garcia, the Chicago Cook Workforce Partnership’s interim associate director of program guidelines and budgets.

Students can also find out which jobs they can get most quickly, he said, and for some that may be the deciding factor.

Walter Alston, 35, of Chicago was drawn to construction, but at the end of his 12-week program at a Chicago Cook Workforce Partnership hub, he spread his net wider, interviewing with the electric vehicle company Rivian.

He asked the questions he’d learned in the program — including ones about benefits and safety — and liked what he heard.

Rivian offered him a job as a service technician, maintaining and repairing cars. He’ll do five weeks of training in California, Arizona, Texas or Florida, and then move to one of those states for a permanent position.

“I thanked RW just, like, a million times,” Alston said of Revolution Workshop, the nonprofit that ran his training program. “I thanked them, I thanked them, I thanked them.”

As for Foley, he has in a sense come full circle. When he started his solar training program, talking to graduates gave him hope that this wasn’t just another career dead end.

Now he’s the one with a job and a story to tell.

During a recent video interview, Foley spoke from work, where he was on the road with some colleagues, visiting Illinois project sites.

“I’m loving it,” he said of his job. “I’m very appreciative of where I’m at. They give me a lot of responsibility, so it’s been a true life-altering experience.”",https://www.chicagotribune.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/CTC-L-clean-energy-jobs003_230195268.jpg?w=1024&h=683,N,,2025-06-23 07:08:56.274053

Musk has said Tesla would be “super paranoid” about robotaxi safety in Austin, including operating in limited areas.
Tesla is also bucking the young industry’s standard practice of relying on multiple technologies to read the road, using only cameras.","AUSTIN, June 22 (Reuters) – Tesla TSLA.O deployed a small group of self-driving taxis picking up paying passengers on Sunday in Austin, Texas, with CEO Elon Musk announcing the “robotaxi launch” and social-media influencers posting videos of their first rides.

The event marked the first time Tesla cars without human drivers have carried paying riders, a business that Musk sees as crucial to the electric car maker’s financial future.

He called the moment the “culmination of a decade of hard work” in a post on his social-media platform X and noted that “the AI chip and software teams were built from scratch within Tesla.”

Teslas were spotted early Sunday in a neighborhood called South Congress with no one in the driver’s seat but one person in the passenger seat. The automaker planned a small trial with about 10 vehicles and front-seat riders acting as “safety monitors,” though it remained unclear how much control they had over the vehicles.

In recent days, the automaker sent invites to a select group of influencers for a carefully monitored robotaxi trial in a limited zone. The rides are being offered for a flat fee of $4.20, Musk said on X.

Tesla investor and social-media personality Sawyer Merritt posted videos on X Sunday afternoon showing him ordering,getting picked up and taking a ride to a nearby bar and restaurant, Frazier’s Long and Low, using a Tesla robotaxi app.

If Tesla succeeds with the small deployment, it still faces major challenges in delivering on Musk’s promises to scale up quickly in Austin and other cities, industry experts say.

It could take years or decades for Tesla and self-driving rivals, such as Alphabet’s GOOGL.O Waymo, to fully develop a robotaxi industry, said Philip Koopman, a Carnegie Mellon University computer-engineering professor with expertise in autonomous-vehicle technology.

A successful Austin trial for Tesla, he said, would be “the end of the beginning – not the beginning of the end.”

Most of Tesla’s sky-high stock value now rests on its ability to deliver robotaxis and humanoid robots, according to many industry analysts. Tesla is by far the world’s most valuable automaker.

As Tesla’s robotaxi-rollout date approached, Texas lawmakers moved to enact autonomous-vehicle rules. Texas Governor Greg Abbott, a Republican, on Friday signed legislation requiring a state permit to operate self-driving vehicles.

The law, which takes effect September 1, signals that state officials from both parties want the driverless-vehicle industry to proceed cautiously.

Tesla did not respond to requests for comment. The governor’s office declined to comment.

“EASY TO GET, EASY TO LOSE”

The law softens the state’s previous anti-regulation stance on autonomous vehicles. A 2017 Texas law specifically prohibited cities from regulating self-driving cars.

The new law requires autonomous-vehicle operators to get approval from the Texas Department of Motor Vehicles before operating on public streets without a human driver. It gives state authorities the power to revoke permits for operators they deem a public danger.

The law also requires firms to provide information on how first responders can deal with their driverless vehicles in emergency situations.

The law’s permit requirements for an “automated motor vehicle” are not onerous but require firms to attest their vehicles can operate legally and safely.

It defines an automated vehicle as having at least “Level 4” autonomous-driving capability under a recognized standard, meaning it can operate with no human driver under specified conditions. Level 5 autonomy is the top level and means a car can drive itself anywhere, under any conditions.

Compliance remains far easier than in some states, notably California, which requires submission of vehicle-testing data under state oversight.

Bryant Walker Smith, a University of South Carolina law professor who focuses on autonomous driving, said it appears any company that meets minimum application requirements will get a Texas permit – but could also lose it if problems arise.

“California permits are hard to get, easy to lose,” he said. “In Texas, the permit is easy to get and easy to lose.”

MUSK’S SAFETY PLEDGES

The Tesla robotaxi rollout comes after more than a decade of Musk’s unfulfilled promises to deliver self-driving Teslas.

Musk has said Tesla would be “super paranoid” about robotaxi safety in Austin, including operating in limited areas.

The service in Austin will have other restrictions as well. Tesla plans to avoid bad weather, difficult intersections, and will not carry anyone below age 18.

Commercializing autonomous vehicles has been risky and expensive. GM’s GM.N Cruise was shut down after a serious accident. Regulators are closely watching Tesla and its rivals, Waymo and Amazon’s AMZN.O Zoox.

Tesla is also bucking the young industry’s standard practice of relying on multiple technologies to read the road, using only cameras. That, Musk says, will be safe and much less expensive than lidar and radar systems added by rivals.",https://japannews.yomiuri.co.jp/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/2025-06-22T145208Z_1243287827_RC2Q7FARILAS_RTRMADP_3_TESLA-ROBOTAXI-TEXAS.jpg,N,,2025-06-23 10:19:31.977581

An additional $20 million in low-interest loans or provision of state government land to encourage investments in technology and production facilities.

“Our economy has been made strong through the hard work of generations of Western Australians,” Premier Roger Cook said. “We want to build on that record, make more things here, power WA on clean energy, supply the materials required for the world’s clean energy transition, and diversify our economy by leveraging our existing strengths.”

Cook said the budget investment will help put WA businesses in the box seat to benefit from a surge in demand for household batteries to harness solar energy driven by the rollout of the state’s Residential Battery Scheme.

The initiative, that has been funded with $337 million in this year’s budget, will work in combination with the federal government’s Cheaper Home Batteries program that kicks off on July 1 to offer rebates of up to $7,500 and no-interest loans to make renewable energy storage accessible.

The state government expects about 100,000 households are set to benefit from the combined state and federal schemes.

Cook said the grid-scale renewable energy effort will enhance energy stability and support the state’s goal of phasing out coal by the end of the decade.

“By 2030, coal will represent 0% of our energy mix,” he said. “Household solar and batteries, alongside wind and large-scale battery projects like those in Kwinana and Collie, will play a critical role in achieving a stable, renewable-powered grid.”

The funding for the rollout and local manufacturing of residential batteries is among a suite of power sector and electrification initiatives included in the latest state budget.

The measures include a $584 million investment to expand WA’s main power grid, the South-West Interconnected System (SWIS), through the Clean Energy Link – North and Regans Ford terminal projects.

In Budget papers, the state government said these projects will go some way to unlocking renewable generation resources in the north of the grid, helping offset the retirement of 1 GW of state-owned coal plant by 2030.

Other funding commitments include $83 million to produce electric buses and ferries in WA, and $30 million for a further round of funding for new energies industries through the Investment Attraction Fund to support critical minerals, hydrogen and carbon capture and storage projects.

Another $25 million has been committed to drive the local manufacture and supply of transmission towers and components required to deliver the state’s renewable energy transition, and establish a Local Industry Development Fund.

“We are working with local industry to maximise the opportunities provided by the energy transition, ensuring the creation of skilled local jobs to support the expansion of manufacturing capabilities,” WA Energy Minister Amber-Jade Sanderson said.

The world’s remaining carbon budget to limit warming to 1.5C will be exhausted by 2027 if current CO₂ emissions levels persist, according to a new study by 60 leading climate scientists.

Sea levels are rising twice as fast as they were from 1971 to 2018, driven by warming oceans and glacial melt, threatening massive coastal migration and damage to marine ecosystems.

Global emissions hit a record high in 2024, and while renewable energy is expanding, energy demand is rising even faster, fueling further climate instability.

Key quote:

“The remaining carbon budgets are declining rapidly and the main reason is the world’s failure to curb global CO₂ emissions.”

— Prof Joeri Rogelj, Imperial College London

Why this matters:

Passing the 1.5C warming threshold marks a tipping point that accelerates heatwaves, floods, fires, crop failures, and sea-level rise. Each fraction of a degree worsens global conditions, especially for the poorest communities least responsible for emissions. The ocean is absorbing much of this excess heat, expanding in volume and disrupting marine ecosystems that feed millions. Rising seas already displace people and damage infrastructure, but future warming threatens far worse: catastrophic inland migration, freshwater loss, and collapsing food chains. The pace of change — faster than models predicted — makes it harder for societies and natural systems to adapt. Meanwhile, fossil fuel use climbs, undercutting promises to transition to cleaner energy.

In short:

A new Nature study finds that global yields of six staple crops — including maize, wheat, and soybeans — could drop 11.2% by 2100 under a moderate warming scenario.

These losses are expected to hit major agricultural regions the hardest, including rich farmlands in the U.S., not just poorer countries with marginal growing conditions.

Climate change is already disrupting harvests through extreme weather, and while farmers are adapting, these efforts are unlikely to fully offset the damage.

Key quote:

“Looking at that 3 degrees centigrade warmer [than the year 2000] future corresponds to about a 13 percent loss in daily recommended per capita caloric consumption. That’s like everyone giving up breakfast … about 360 calories for each person, for each day.”

— Andrew Hultgren, agriculture researcher at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign

Why this matters:

Climate change is coming for the world’s food. And it’s not poor soil or weak farming practices that are most at risk, but the very breadbaskets that feed the world. With global crop exports concentrated in a few regions, disruptions in places like the U.S. Midwest or Ukraine ripple out to consumers and communities everywhere. Higher temperatures and erratic rainfall can stunt growth, shrink harvests, and alter nutritional content. Food production already contributes a third of the planet’s greenhouse gases, and rising prices hit the poor hardest. The same fields that gave the world cheap calories may now become a battleground in the climate crisis.

In short:

The Packaging Reduction & Recycling Infrastructure Act passed the state Senate but stalled in the Assembly for the second year in a row, this time without a clear last-minute disruption.

The bill would have required large corporations to pay fees based on the waste their packaging generates and reduce packaging volume by 30% over 12 years.

Business groups opposed the bill, saying it would be expensive and burdensome; advocates criticized Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie for failing to prioritize it.

Why this matters:

Plastic waste is a growing environmental and public health threat, especially in states like New York that serve as major distribution hubs. Most single-use packaging ends up in landfills or as litter, where it breaks down into microplastics that contaminate water, soil, and the air we breathe. These particles have been found in human blood and lungs, raising concerns about long-term health effects. Meanwhile, the fossil fuels used to produce plastic continue to drive climate change. Extended producer responsibility laws shift the financial burden of managing waste away from taxpayers and onto the corporations that create it. Without such measures, states struggle to fund recycling infrastructure or curb the flood of plastic into communities, waterways, and ecosystems.

In short:

The Trump administration’s EPA is encouraging states like Indiana to take over regulation of coal ash, a toxic byproduct of coal-fired power, through “primacy” arrangements that can lock in weaker enforcement even under future administrations.

Indiana lawmakers have already passed laws requiring the state to seek primacy, despite widespread groundwater contamination from more than 73 million cubic yards of coal ash stored in unlined ponds.

Environmental advocates warn that once states gain primacy, it becomes difficult for federal authorities to reassert control, even if national rules are later strengthened.

Key quote:

“The Trump administration is a four-year term, and managing coal ash is going to be decades into the future. This is a long-term issue that requires federal oversight for the duration; it’s absolutely critical the federal government keep that ability.”

— Ben Inskeep, program director, Citizens Action Coalition

Why this matters:

Coal ash is one of the largest sources of industrial waste in the U.S., and it contains hazardous substances like arsenic, mercury, and lead. When stored in unlined ponds — as is common in states like Indiana — it can seep into groundwater and contaminate drinking supplies. Many of the worst sites are located near low-income or rural communities that have limited access to clean water and face greater barriers to holding polluters accountable. Allowing states with weak environmental records to self-regulate coal ash increases the risk that toxic waste will go unmonitored and unremedied for decades.

In short:

The Bureau of Land Management released a draft plan to open over 18.5 million acres — 82% of the National Petroleum Reserve in Alaska — to oil leasing, reversing Obama-era protections.

The plan would eliminate safeguards for ecologically significant areas, including Teshekpuk Lake and the Colville River, key habitats for migratory birds, caribou, and nesting raptors.

The proposal follows Trump’s executive order to dismantle Biden-era environmental rules and is open for a 14-day public review period.

Key quote:

“This is another step in the Trump administration’s reckless effort to sell out our most valuable national public lands to the oil industry in the midst of the climate crisis.”

— Matt Jackson, senior manager for Alaska at The Wilderness Society

Why this matters:

The National Petroleum Reserve in Alaska covers a sprawling swath of Arctic tundra home to migratory birds, caribou herds, and Indigenous communities who rely on the land for subsistence. Opening up more than seven million additional acres to oil drilling threatens fragile ecosystems that have been shielded for decades. Teshekpuk Lake, in particular, is a biological hotspot critical for nesting waterfowl and calving caribou. Removing long-standing protections not only increases risks of habitat destruction and oil spills but also accelerates climate change in one of the planet’s fastest-warming regions. As the administration moves to revive fossil fuel extraction, scientists warn that Arctic development could lock in decades of carbon emissions and jeopardize traditional ways of life in Alaska’s remote communities.

In short:

A Department of Energy report projects U.S. data centers could consume up to 12% of the nation’s electricity by 2028 due to AI growth, up from 4.4% today, potentially increasing reliance on fossil fuels.

A new study analyzing 14 open-source large language models found that models with advanced reasoning abilities used much more energy per answer, but were not significantly more accurate than smaller models.

Because the energy source powering AI data centers varies by region, actual emissions differ widely depending on whether facilities rely on coal, natural gas, or renewables.

Key quote:

“We don’t always need the biggest, most heavily trained model, to answer simple questions. Smaller models are also capable of doing specific things well.”

— Maximilian Dauner, Ph.D. student, Munich University of Applied Sciences and lead author of the study

Why this matters:

AI systems are expanding rapidly, with tools like chatbots embedded in everything from classrooms to corporate offices. But the energy required to train and operate these models — especially the largest ones — is not trivial. Each user query adds to the growing electricity demands of data centers, which are often powered by fossil fuels. As AI usage scales, the emissions generated could hinder efforts to reduce global carbon output. And because performance gains taper off with larger models, the environmental cost may not always be justified. Understanding the energy and carbon footprint behind everyday AI interactions is essential as society weighs the convenience of intelligent systems against the climate crisis.

In short:

Reinsurer Swiss Re warns that rising temperatures, plastic pollution, and mold pose growing legal and financial risks to businesses, particularly in sectors like insurance, agriculture, and healthcare.

Heat-related damage — from wildfires to illness and power outages — is increasing property, health, and workers’ compensation claims, as insurers retreat from high-risk areas like California.

Plastics, made from fossil fuels, are raising liability concerns as microplastics show up in food and human bodies, prompting lawsuits and raising questions about long-term health effects.

Key quote:

“With a clear trend to longer, hotter heatwaves, it is important we shine a light on the true cost to human life, our economy, infrastructure, agriculture and healthcare system.”

— Jérôme Haegeli, group chief economist at Swiss Re

Why this matters:

Heatwaves are now the deadliest weather threat in the U.S., straining power grids, damaging crops, and spreading heat-loving molds that can sicken people and destroy buildings. Insurance markets are already shifting, with major providers retreating from fire-prone regions or hiking premiums. At the same time, plastics are flooding ecosystems and our bodies with micro-sized particles whose full range of health impacts remain poorly understood. As scientists track their spread, and courts weigh company responsibility, businesses face a new frontier of liability risk tied to pollution they once considered external. The costs of fossil fuels are increasingly difficult to ignore — in dollars, in public health, and in legal exposure.

The pace of change — faster than models predicted — makes it harder for societies and natural systems to adapt. Meanwhile, fossil fuel use climbs, undercutting promises to transition to cleaner energy.

In short:

A new Nature study finds that global yields of six staple crops — including maize, wheat, and soybeans — could drop 11.2% by 2100 under a moderate warming scenario.

These losses are expected to hit major agricultural regions the hardest, including rich farmlands in the U.S., not just poorer countries with marginal growing conditions.

Climate change is already disrupting harvests through extreme weather, and while farmers are adapting, these efforts are unlikely to fully offset the damage.

Key quote:

“Looking at that 3 degrees centigrade warmer [than the year 2000] future corresponds to about a 13 percent loss in daily recommended per capita caloric consumption. That’s like everyone giving up breakfast … about 360 calories for each person, for each day.”

— Andrew Hultgren, agriculture researcher at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign

Why this matters:

Climate change is coming for the world’s food. And it’s not poor soil or weak farming practices that are most at risk, but the very breadbaskets that feed the world. With global crop exports concentrated in a few regions, disruptions in places like the U.S. Midwest or Ukraine ripple out to consumers and communities everywhere. Higher temperatures and erratic rainfall can stunt growth, shrink harvests, and alter nutritional content. Food production already contributes a third of the planet’s greenhouse gases, and rising prices hit the poor hardest. The same fields that gave the world cheap calories may now become a battleground in the climate crisis.

In short:

The court’s 6-3 decision revives licenses granted by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) to two companies to store radioactive waste at sites in rural Texas and New Mexico for up to 40 years, with a possible extension.

The justices did not decide whether federal law ultimately permits such temporary storage but ruled that Texas and a local landowner forfeited their legal standing to block the NRC’s decision.

Governors from both states oppose the facilities, warning they may become de facto permanent dumps in the absence of a national plan for long-term disposal.

Key quote:

“Congress has repeatedly failed to secure a permanent location for disposing of nuclear waste, and now the federal government is trying to force de-facto permanent storage facilities onto New Mexico and Texas. It is a dangerous and irresponsible approach.”

— Michelle Lujan Grisham, governor of New Mexico

Why this matters:

The U.S. has accumulated more than 90,000 metric tons of spent nuclear fuel, some of it dating back to the 1980s, sitting at reactor sites across the country. Without a permanent disposal site like the long-stalled Yucca Mountain project in Nevada, pressure grows to find alternatives. But placing temporary facilities in largely rural, lower-income areas raises deep concerns about environmental justice and long-term public health risks. These materials remain radioactive for thousands of years, and even ""temporary"" sites could become permanent by default if national politics continue to stall permanent solutions.

In short:

The Packaging Reduction & Recycling Infrastructure Act passed the state Senate but stalled in the Assembly for the second year in a row, this time without a clear last-minute disruption.

The bill would have required large corporations to pay fees based on the waste their packaging generates and reduce packaging volume by 30% over 12 years.

Business groups opposed the bill, saying it would be expensive and burdensome; advocates criticized Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie for failing to prioritize it.

Why this matters:

Plastic waste is a growing environmental and public health threat, especially in states like New York that serve as major distribution hubs. Most single-use packaging ends up in landfills or as litter, where it breaks down into microplastics that contaminate water, soil, and the air we breathe. These particles have been found in human blood and lungs, raising concerns about long-term health effects. Meanwhile, the fossil fuels used to produce plastic continue to drive climate change. Extended producer responsibility laws shift the financial burden of managing waste away from taxpayers and onto the corporations that create it. Without such measures, states struggle to fund recycling infrastructure or curb the flood of plastic into communities, waterways, and ecosystems.

In short:

The Bureau of Land Management released a draft plan to open over 18.5 million acres — 82% of the National Petroleum Reserve in Alaska — to oil leasing, reversing Obama-era protections.

The plan would eliminate safeguards for ecologically significant areas, including Teshekpuk Lake and the Colville River, key habitats for migratory birds, caribou, and nesting raptors.

The proposal follows Trump’s executive order to dismantle Biden-era environmental rules and is open for a 14-day public review period.

Key quote:

“This is another step in the Trump administration’s reckless effort to sell out our most valuable national public lands to the oil industry in the midst of the climate crisis.”

— Matt Jackson, senior manager for Alaska at The Wilderness Society

Why this matters:

The National Petroleum Reserve in Alaska covers a sprawling swath of Arctic tundra home to migratory birds, caribou herds, and Indigenous communities who rely on the land for subsistence. Opening up more than seven million additional acres to oil drilling threatens fragile ecosystems that have been shielded for decades. Teshekpuk Lake, in particular, is a biological hotspot critical for nesting waterfowl and calving caribou. Removing long-standing protections not only increases risks of habitat destruction and oil spills but also accelerates climate change in one of the planet’s fastest-warming regions. As the administration moves to revive fossil fuel extraction, scientists warn that Arctic development could lock in decades of carbon emissions and jeopardize traditional ways of life in Alaska’s remote communities.

In short:

A Department of Energy report projects U.S. data centers could consume up to 12% of the nation’s electricity by 2028 due to AI growth, up from 4.4% today, potentially increasing reliance on fossil fuels.

A new study analyzing 14 open-source large language models found that models with advanced reasoning abilities used much more energy per answer, but were not significantly more accurate than smaller models.

Because the energy source powering AI data centers varies by region, actual emissions differ widely depending on whether facilities rely on coal, natural gas, or renewables.

Key quote:

“We don’t always need the biggest, most heavily trained model, to answer simple questions. Smaller models are also capable of doing specific things well.”

— Maximilian Dauner, Ph.D. student, Munich University of Applied Sciences and lead author of the study

Why this matters:

AI systems are expanding rapidly, with tools like chatbots embedded in everything from classrooms to corporate offices. But the energy required to train and operate these models — especially the largest ones — is not trivial. Each user query adds to the growing electricity demands of data centers, which are often powered by fossil fuels. As AI usage scales, the emissions generated could hinder efforts to reduce global carbon output. And because performance gains taper off with larger models, the environmental cost may not always be justified. Understanding the energy and carbon footprint behind everyday AI interactions is essential as society weighs the convenience of intelligent systems against the climate crisis.

In short:

Reinsurer Swiss Re warns that rising temperatures, plastic pollution, and mold pose growing legal and financial risks to businesses, particularly in sectors like insurance, agriculture, and healthcare.

Heat-related damage — from wildfires to illness and power outages — is increasing property, health, and workers’ compensation claims, as insurers retreat from high-risk areas like California.

Plastics, made from fossil fuels, are raising liability concerns as microplastics show up in food and human bodies, prompting lawsuits and raising questions about long-term health effects.

Key quote:

“With a clear trend to longer, hotter heatwaves, it is important we shine a light on the true cost to human life, our economy, infrastructure, agriculture and healthcare system.”

— Jérôme Haegeli, group chief economist at Swiss Re

Why this matters:

Heatwaves are now the deadliest weather threat in the U.S., straining power grids, damaging crops, and spreading heat-loving molds that can sicken people and destroy buildings. Insurance markets are already shifting, with major providers retreating from fire-prone regions or hiking premiums. At the same time, plastics are flooding ecosystems and our bodies with micro-sized particles whose full range of health impacts remain poorly understood. As scientists track their spread, and courts weigh company responsibility, businesses face a new frontier of liability risk tied to pollution they once considered external. The costs of fossil fuels are increasingly difficult to ignore — in dollars, in public health, and in legal exposure.

However, proactive planning can be a crucial tool that helps businesses to find stability within a challenging environment.

When considering future tax planning, two factors are fundamental to expectations about the state of play and the actions that might be taken along the way.

We’re in a period of continuous change

Electoral trends have created an environment where recent presidential election cycles led to unified government with narrow majorities. That was the experience over the past three cycles and will likely persist into the future. In recent years, unified government opportunities translated quickly into enacted legislation implementing the majority party’s stated policy objectives. Those changes to the Tax Code often involved temporary provisions due to the legislative procedures utilized in Congress.

For example, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA), enacted in 2017, provided broad-based tax cuts, but most provisions were scheduled to sunset at the end of 2025. Specific rules, such as required capitalization of research expenditures, the limitation on business interest expense deductions, and bonus depreciation all included earlier changes that limited deductions beginning in 2022. The looming expiration of the TCJA was an important issue during the 2024 campaign cycle and has spurred the legislative process during 2025.

The Tax Code has also been modified in significant ways in response to economic challenges. The congressional response to the COVID-19 pandemic illustrates this point. Specifically, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (CARES Act), leveraged the Tax Code to drive economic support to businesses in the form of employee retention tax credits, increased interest expense deductions, and net operating loss carryback rules, among others. When economic turbulence occurs, the Tax Code is often viewed as an expedient means of providing support to businesses and individuals.

What can a business do to plan for continually shifting tax rules?

Maximize the current tax rules based on the assumption that changes will occur in the future.

Implement a process for systematic tax planning on a quarterly basis, which takes existing rules, scheduled changes (e.g., expiration dates), and likely congressional action into account.

Engage with industry organizations and members of Congress on tax policy matters to stay better informed and understand what changes may be coming

Debt and deficit concerns will translate into tax policy

Balancing the benefits and burdens of the Tax Code is an age-old challenge. The focus on this topic has become magnified in recent years, as the net costs of tax changes are factored into budget deficits and increasing national debt. Fiscal concerns can drive cuts to spending programs, including recent efforts to decrease the scale of the federal government. Alternatively, net increases in taxes may be attractive to legislators when seeking to reduce debt.

These concerns have been integrated into tax proposals in various ways over the past decade. Concerns about the overall cost of the TCJA resulted in the imposition of a limitation on state and local tax deductions (the SALT cap), in addition to other cost management features. Furthermore, the legislative process during the Biden administration included proposals to increase taxes on capital gains for high-income taxpayers, modify carried interest rules, and impose a form of wealth tax. More recently, President Trump has signaled an openness to increasing the top tax bracket on ordinary income to offset the cost of tax cuts in the One, Big, Beautiful Bill.

What does this all mean?

Businesses should expect that fiscal concerns will translate into some form of higher taxes in the future.

However, the details will matter, as tax increases are typically not implemented on a uniform basis.

To plan for the future, businesses should utilize modeling to better understand the impact of potential tax increases. This is especially important for shining a spotlight on the true pain points that would alter decision making.

Rachel Frazin reports for The Hill.

In short:

The Supreme Court ruled that only EPA actions justified by nationwide implications must go through the D.C. Circuit, making it easier to file certain challenges in regional courts.

In one case, the court held that EPA rejections of refinery biofuel exemptions qualified for D.C. review; in another, it said state air pollution plan rejections could be contested locally.

Circuit has traditionally handled national policy questions, but this decision limits its reach, potentially shifting more cases to regional courts that may be more politically polarized. This could affect how clean air rules are enforced, how refinery exemptions are granted, and how states can push back against federal mandates.

South Dakota reports the lowest AI-related energy usage per business in the U.S. at 4,314 kWh annually.

North Carolina and Ohio also rank among the top three, with 4,952 kWh and 5,465 kWh per business respectively.

Each state keeps AI energy use low, unlike Maine, where consumption more than doubles South Dakota’s.

Not all digital expansion comes with higher energy costs.

Recent DesignRush data shows that some states use up to 40% less power than the U.S. average of 7,274 kWh.

This finding adds a new layer to the conversation on sustainable digital growth: it’s not just about how many companies use automation, but how they implement it.

In contrast to energy-intensive tech hubs, the states of South Dakota, North Carolina, and Ohio maintain relatively lean systems.

They’ve adopted automation carefully, keeping operational overhead low while still integrating modern tools across industries.

Top 3 Energy-Efficient AI States

1. South Dakota

AI Energy Consumption per Business: 4,314 kWh per business

AI Adoption: 3.55%

South Dakota leads the nation in AI energy efficiency.

With under 2,000 businesses using AI, the state’s total energy impact remains small.

Companies also tend to be smaller, with just 5.7 employees on average, allowing operations to run on lighter systems.

In a move that could reinforce this energy-conscious approach, the state recently approved over $3.3 million for the Big Stone Energy Storage Project, a thermal facility aimed at improving grid stability and energy efficiency.

2. North Carolina

AI Energy Consumption per Business: 4,952 kWh per business

AI Adoption: 8.75%

Despite higher adoption than South Dakota, North Carolina keeps energy usage low.

That’s likely due to workforce size, with AI-using businesses averaging just 6.6 employees, indicating streamlined processes and smaller infrastructure needs.

But the state is also being smart about energy planning.

A study from Duke University found that North Carolina could add 1.3 GW of data center capacity (that’s a lot of computing power) without building new gas plants just by using its existing power grid more efficiently.

Also, some data centers in the state are powered entirely by wind energy, like the 208 MW Amazon Wind Farm in eastern North Carolina.

That helps reduce the environmental impact of all that computing.

Combined with business-friendly energy pricing and low utility rates, North Carolina offers a model of how to scale AI adoption while minimizing environmental impact and grid stress.

3. Ohio

AI Energy Consumption per Business: 5,465 kWh

AI Adoption: 8.15%

Ohio stands out for its scale. It supports nearly 50,000 AI-active businesses and over 362,000 workers in this space.

Even with those large numbers, energy use per business remains well-controlled, signaling efficient use of shared or virtual computing resources.

Part of this efficiency stems from Ohio’s investment in next-generation infrastructure.

The state is piloting on-site microgrids for data centers, combining renewables, gas, and battery storage.

These systems help mitigate demand spikes and even repurpose waste heat to support greenhouse agriculture, demonstrating a circular approach to tech energy use.

Additionally, utilities like AEP Ohio are reshaping how power costs are distributed.

A proposed structure would require data centers to pay in advance for 75–90% of their projected capacity, helping ensure that grid upgrades don’t fall on regular consumers.

While controversial, this signals a strong focus on grid equity and long-term planning.

Why This Matters

The energy conversation around automation is overdue.

While most headlines focus on growth rates or tech breakthroughs, cost and infrastructure deserve equal attention.

States that keep energy use in check are building tech maturity without overstretching resources.

For leaders, that means lower costs and more predictable operations.

For governments, it’s a sign of an economy that adapts without overloading the grid.

These findings should inform how companies scale and where they choose to expand.

Over 100,000 EVs, representing more than $5 billion in inventory, currently sit unsold on dealer lots. A sudden elimination of EV tax credits would severely impact retailers and consumers alike. NADA continues to advocate for a phased rollback that gives dealers time to sell through inventory and allows OEMs to recalibrate pricing strategies. The goal is to avoid a cliff-edge disruption while maintaining momentum toward cleaner transportation.

Attention now turns to the Environmental Protection Agency, where new emissions standards remain a concern. Though less aggressive than California’s, the EPA rules are still viewed as unworkable in their current form. NADA is pressing for revisions and maintains regular communication with the administration, the EPA, and the Department of Transportation to ensure that dealer voices are heard.

Dealers nationwide have already made significant investments in EV infrastructure, including vehicles, charging equipment, and training. While these investments remain valuable, the pressure from overly ambitious rollout plans has tested relationships. OEMs are now working more closely with retailers to strike a better balance between ambition and reality.

Stanton also highlights concerns about proposed tariffs that could affect vehicle affordability and lead to job losses, particularly for small and medium-sized businesses. NADA is engaging with Congress and federal agencies to monitor and respond to any developments that could harm dealers or their customers.

The industry continues to show resilience, with many dealers reporting performance levels still ahead of pre-pandemic benchmarks.

Without explaining why, or first considering the researchers’ appeals, the EPA notified teams led by the Mi’kmaq Nation and the University of Maine that their grants have been reinstated this month, however the agency has yet to notify the Passamaquoddy Tribe about whether their grant will be restored.

After Maine Morning Star reporting revealed conflicting agency stances on the terminations, Democratic U.S. Rep. Chellie Pingree of Maine requested EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin address the inconsistencies by May 30. Pingree has yet to receive a response.

Pingree told Maine Morning Star she was pleased to see the grants restored but that they shouldn’t have been terminated in the first place.

“Unfortunately, this is just one example of a much broader problem,” Pingree said.

Pingree pointed to other proposed cuts to environmental programs, such as a 55% funding cut to the EPA budget and the elimination of other PFAS grants that support cleanup and prevention efforts in vulnerable communities. “While I’m glad funding for this project was reinstated, we’re still fighting to protect the many others that remain on the chopping block,” she said.

The researchers also expressed cautious optimism as they plan to forge ahead.

Despite saying PFAS contamination is a priority, EPA cut millions in funding for research in Maine

“Because of this whole situation, I don’t feel as totally sure about [the funding] as I did when we first got the grant,” said Chelli Stanley, co-founder of an organization committed to cleaning contaminated land, Upland Grassroots, which is part of the research team headed by the Mi’kmaq Nation. “But of course, we are just going to go forward and do all of our work, I’m sure maybe at an accelerated pace in some ways, just to do as much testing as we can.”

In May, the EPA terminated all of the four-year grants it had awarded in September for research into reducing per-and polyfluoroalkyl substances, otherwise known as PFAS, in the food supply, including to the three Maine-based teams. The three grants for Maine projects amount to almost $5 million.

The termination notices read, “The objectives of the award are no longer consistent with EPA funding priorities.”

However, the agency later gave conflicting responses about why it terminated the grants.

In a statement to Maine Morning Star, the EPA Press Office equated the grants to Diversity, Equity and Inclusion measures.

“As with any change in administration, the EPA has been reviewing all of its grant programs and awarded grants to ensure each is an appropriate use of taxpayer dollars and to understand how those programs align with administration priorities,” the EPA Press Office wrote. “Maybe the Biden-Harris administration shouldn’t have forced their radical agenda of wasteful DEI programs and ‘environmental justice’ preferencing on the EPA’s core mission of protecting human health and the environment treating tribes and Alaska Natives as such.”

However, Zeldin publicly stated the grants were important and already congressionally appropriated. In the weeks leading up to the terminations, the agency also named combating PFAS contamination as a priority.

All three of the Maine-based research teams appealed their grant terminations. However, in the emails the EPA sent the UMaine and Mi’kmaq Nation teams, the agency said the reinstatement decisions were made by agency leadership unrelated to their appeals.

UMaine had formally appealed the termination on June 5, but the EPA wrote in a June 6 email, “The reinstatement was directed by agency leadership on June 4, 2025, prior to the issuance of a decision on a dispute filed by the University of Maine on June 5, 2025.”

The Mi’kmaq Nation filed their appeal earlier and received an email on June 5 acknowledging receipt. On June 18, the team received another email notifying them that their grant had been reinstated. But that email stated that the restoration was directed by agency leadership prior to the issuance of a decision on the dispute, and that the dispute was now moot.

While acknowledging receipt, the EPA did not respond to requests for comment regarding why agency leadership reinstated these two grants, or whether the agency intends to reinstate the Passamaquoddy Tribe’s grant.

Citing Maine Morning Star reporting, Pingree presses EPA on PFAS grant terminations

For Stanley, the reinstatement underscored the power elected leaders can yield to push back on cuts, noting Pingree’s letter to Zeldin.

“I do feel like in this case, the representatives and senators can play a big role,” Stanley said.

Bryan Berger, associate professor of chemical engineering at the University of Virginia, which is working in partnership with the Mi’kmaq Nation on its grant, said for him the termination and subsequent reinstatement illustrated the convoluted political fault lines within federal research funding.

“I was shocked when it happened just because of how it’s a topic that I think really is very non-political,” Berger said. “I have friends who are very conservative to very liberal and everybody agrees that nobody wants perfluorinated chemicals in their food and water.”

Berger said he was heartened that Zeldin seemed to want to prioritize PFAS research when Pingree had questioned him on the terminations during an appropriations subcommittee hearing on May 15. But at the same time, Berger said, “What he was saying seemed to be the antithesis of what was happening.”

However, Berger added, “I think to be a scientist, you have to be relentlessly optimistic.”

A scientist’s work constantly grapples with struggle and failure, he explained, “so if you’re not an optimist, you can’t do this job.”",https://mainemorningstar.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/collecting-samples-1.jpg-2048x1536.webp,N,,2025-06-23 10:16:41.131869

This plant was estimated to create and support 2,800 good union jobs with two facilities, with one on hold now because of the current policy uncertainty.
This misguided legislation would gut the very tax credits that are benefiting our workers and bringing manufacturing back to America.
The clean vehicle tax credit would be essentially eliminated, and the advanced manufacturing tax credit would be severely restricted.
The choice is clear: support policies that create good union jobs, or let other countries take the lead in building the industries of the future.","In 2019, GM closed the Lordstown Complex, where I worked for 30 years. Donald Trump, president at the time, promised revival but delivered nothing.

With the rise of EVs, Lordstown got a glimmer of hope. Lordstown Assembly stayed closed, but GM formed a new company, Ultium, which opened a massive EV battery facility right around the corner, buoyed by federal subsidies for the emerging industry.

As the U.S. Senate debates Trump’s “One Big Beautiful Bill,” the people of Lordstown, Ohio, have a simple message: don’t shut us down again. I am the proud leader for the United Auto Workers in Region 2B, which covers Ohio and Indiana, and I hope the U.S. Senators representing our states will hear that message.

It is time for the Senate to stand up for our members and the working class. America must preserve clean energy and manufacturing tax credits that have given communities like Lordstown a lifeline.

These credits helped make it possible for the UAW to organize the first union battery cell manufacturing facility in the country at Ultium. There is also a new StarPlus Energy Gigafactory in Kokomo, Indiana, a joint venture between Samsung and Stellantis.

This plant was estimated to create and support 2,800 good union jobs with two facilities, with one on hold now because of the current policy uncertainty.

Just recently, workers at the StarPlus battery facility also voted to be recognized by the UAW, following in the footsteps of the workers at Ultium Cells in Lordstown.

GM is planning on building another battery plant in northern Indiana, and the companies, workers, and communities need to have stability moving forward.

Our contracts at these facilities have helped set a new standard for wages, benefits, and health and safety in EV battery manufacturing for workers everywhere. And we’re just getting started.

These targeted energy and manufacturing tax incentives have enabled billions in private investment, and hundreds of thousands of jobs are at stake. The advanced manufacturing tax credit is driving major growth in the battery supply chain, and we are organizing across the country to create tens of thousands of union battery jobs.

Meanwhile, the consumer electric vehicle tax credit has boosted demand for the batteries our members produce in Kokomo, Lordstown, and across our nation.

We’re witnessing a domestic manufacturing renaissance, and when these new jobs have the benefits that come with collective bargaining—better wages, safer working conditions, health care, retirement security, and a voice on the job — they lead to the kind of family-supporting careers that built the American Dream.

Unfortunately, the U.S. House of Representatives passed a bill that would devastate this progress and harm workers, and the Senate has so far failed to fix the bill.

This misguided legislation would gut the very tax credits that are benefiting our workers and bringing manufacturing back to America. The clean vehicle tax credit would be essentially eliminated, and the advanced manufacturing tax credit would be severely restricted.

Analysis suggests that repealing clean vehicle tax credits alone could reduce electric vehicle (EV) sales by as much as 40% by 2030, and could result in the idling of existing assembly plants and the cancellation of many planned EV battery manufacturing facilities.

The irony is stark and painful: thousands of battery workers have just voted to unionize, ensuring their jobs are high-quality and family-supporting. Now congressional Republicans are voting to kill those very same jobs.

They’re choosing to undermine American manufacturing in favor of what exactly? Tax cuts for billionaires and corporations?

This isn’t about party politics — it’s about our economic future. And the UAW has long said there is room for improvement in the design of these credits.

Too many companies taking the money are guilty of paying substandard wages and benefits, illegal union busting, and dangerous working conditions.

Subsidies like these need strings attached to protect workers; we can do better than corporate giveaways. But gutting the whole thing isn’t the answer.

Instead of kneecapping the credits, Congress should improve them: most importantly, by making wage and benefit standards a prerequisite for receiving the advanced manufacturing tax credit.

The choice is clear: support policies that create good union jobs, or let other countries take the lead in building the industries of the future.

The working class deserves leaders who will fight for our economic interests, not legislators who would rather slash taxes for the wealthy and greedy corporations while raising energy prices, sabotaging domestic manufacturing, and kicking millions off their health care to boot.

When our government invests in good, American jobs, workers, and communities win. Now it’s time for our Senators to decide if they’re on our side.",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/s3/files/styles/social_large/s3/articles/feeds-state-94/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/gettyimages-2178383065-1024x6831750667659.jpg?h=199d8c1f&itok=4RUIPAXE,N,,2025-06-23 07:10:28.585849

“This acquisition represents a strategic investment to support energy manufacturing and expand U.S.-based critical mineral supplies,” said Jeff Gustavson, president of Chevron New Energies.
“Establishing domestic and resilient lithium supply chains is essential not only to maintaining U.S. energy leadership but also to meeting the growing demand from customers.","Chevron U.S.A. Inc., a subsidiary of Chevron Corporation , announced the acquisition of two leasehold acreage positions. The first from TerraVolta Resources, whose investor is an affiliate of The Energy & Minerals Group , and the second from East Texas Natural Resources.

The estimated leasehold position includes ~125,000 net acres and is situated across regions where the Smackover Formation is present, specifically spanning Northeast Texas and Southwest Arkansas. This formation is of particular interest due to its notably high lithium content and marks Chevron’s first step toward establishing a commercial-scale, domestic lithium business.

Future development will aim to utilize the direct lithium extraction (DLE) process, a set of advanced technologies employed to extract lithium from brines produced from the subsurface. Chevron seeks to deploy this emerging technology, which allows for faster and more efficient production and is expected to have a smaller environmental footprint compared to traditional extraction methods.

“This acquisition represents a strategic investment to support energy manufacturing and expand U.S.-based critical mineral supplies,” said Jeff Gustavson, president of Chevron New Energies. “Establishing domestic and resilient lithium supply chains is essential not only to maintaining U.S. energy leadership but also to meeting the growing demand from customers.

Synthetic fuels have yet to catch on, and even if they do in the coming years, they’ll remain expensive until production scales up.
Porsche buyers likely won’t mind paying extra for synthetic fuel if it means keeping their combustion engines running.
Outside the Volkswagen Group, Ferrari has also shown interest in synthetic fuel.
With most automakers fully committed to global EV adoption, we're skeptical about whether enough financial resources remain to push synthetic fuels forward.","In an interview with Australian magazine CarExpert, Lamborghini’s Chief Technical Officer argued that synthetic fuel “could be the savior of the combustion engine.” Rouven Mohr added that the Temerario’s new engine can “deliver optimal efficiency and performance with both solutions [gas and e-fuel].” He also touched on the emotional aspect, claiming that EVs still can’t match the excitement of an ICE car.

“If you ask me the emotion side at the moment, like I said before, I don’t see the [electric] solution that is convincing now. Its time will come, trust me, because this kind of technology transformation needs longer.” But even when enthusiasts warm up to the idea of hot EVs, Mohr believes there will come a time when tomorrow’s youngsters will realize that “okay, the old combustion thing is cool.”

Lamborghini is pinning its hopes on synthetic fuel to extend the life of ICEs beyond 2035, when the European Union will ban sales of new cars that produce harmful emissions. The ruling doesn’t explicitly outlaw combustion engines, as it leaves room for e-fuels, provided they’re carbon neutral.

Synthetic fuels have yet to catch on, and even if they do in the coming years, they’ll remain expensive until production scales up. That, however, isn’t likely to deter Lamborghini buyers. The exotic Italian marque, headquartered in Sant’Agata Bolognese, is part of the Volkswagen Group, which also includes Porsche. That’s relevant because Porsche has been producing e-fuel in Chile since late 2022, when it filled a 911 with synthetic fuel made from water and carbon dioxide using wind energy.

Porsche claims its electric fuel is “produced from hydrogen obtained purely from renewable energy and CO₂ (carbon dioxide).” It’s being manufactured at an industrial scale in partnership with Chilean operator Highly Innovative Fuels (HIF) to make “combustion engines as near to net carbon neutral as possible.”

While a 911 costs less than half the price of a Temerario, it still starts at $129,950 in base Carrera form. Porsche buyers likely won’t mind paying extra for synthetic fuel if it means keeping their combustion engines running. Porsche has vowed that the last car it makes with a combustion engine will be the 911, and that a fully electric version won’t arrive this decade. However, a hybrid is already here.

Beyond Lamborghini and Porsche, Bentley and Bugatti are also pursuing e-fuels. Outside the Volkswagen Group, Ferrari has also shown interest in synthetic fuel. In the mainstream segment, Toyota, Mazda, and Subaru are collaborating to explore whether ICEs can survive without relying on fossil fuels. Toyota has even gone a step further, experimenting with hydrogen combustion engines.

Let's be real. Making e-fuels viable for widespread adoption won’t happen overnight, if it happens at all. Large-scale production and distribution will take years and require collective industry effort. With most automakers fully committed to global EV adoption, we're skeptical about whether enough financial resources remain to push synthetic fuels forward. Perhaps they'll become a niche for high-end buyers willing to pay the price, but the majority will have to look elsewhere.",https://images.inkl.com/s3/article/lead_image/22158278/lamborghini-temerario-monterey-car-week.jpg,N,,2025-06-23 06:06:43.592542

While traditional centralized generation and long-distance transmission remain essential, they are no longer sufficient because they can’t respond quickly enough to the rapid and distributed load growth driven by AI, electrification and evolving reliability demands.

Many recognize the need for flexible, resilient and low-emissions power that can be deployed quickly and operated with precision, especially as regulatory scrutiny increases and interconnection delays stretch for months or years.

Energy leaders are embracing the notion that fuel cell systems have become a strategic resource to expand their reach, enhance resilience and support large customers without burdening ratepayers or compromising decarbonization goals.

Among the available technologies, solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) stand out for their high efficiency, modular scalability, long operational life and competitive operating costs. These systems convert fuel — such as natural gas, bio gas and hydrogen — into electricity through a combustion-free high-temperature electrochemical process, making them uniquely suited to support both grid infrastructure and distributed energy applications.

Fuel cell systems offer utilities a flexible tool to future-proof their energy strategies in an era of electrification, data center expansion and escalating climate and capacity challenges.

Fuel cells are a hedge against market volatility

Because fuel cells are highly efficient, they require less fuel to generate each kilowatt-hour of electricity than traditional combustion-based power sources, reducing exposure to fuel price volatility. SOFCs can achieve electrical efficiencies of up to 65% and when integrated with combined heat and power (CHP) configurations, the total system efficiency can exceed 90%. These systems can also be powered by renewable fuels such as biogas or hydrogen, enhancing long-term sustainability.

By working with partners like Bloom Energy, a leading provider of onsite fuel cell-based power solutions, customers can access highly reliable energy at predictable prices, insulating them from volatile grid prices and capacity limitations.

Decentralized generation enhances resilience

Fuel cells facilitate a decentralized, modular architecture that allows power generation to be sited close to or directly at the point of use. This localized approach enhances reliability for high-demand facilities, such as data centers, without increasing costs for other ratepayers.

When deployed as part of a microgrid, fuel cell systems deliver always-on, on-site power, ensuring operational resilience and uptime — both as a standalone solution during transmission and distribution buildouts and as a backup power source during grid disruptions.

Future-proofing through CCUS-ready power platforms

SOFCs utilizing natural gas produce a highly concentrated CO2 exhaust stream, making them easier to pair with Carbon Capture, Utilization and Storage (CCUS) systems than gas turbines or internal combustion engines.

“It’s significantly easier with our systems to do carbon sequestration so customers can effectively achieve near-zero carbon power while still having a firm resource,” said Kris Kim, Vice President, Global Power & Utilities for Bloom Energy.

CCUS is expected to be a critical tool for utilities pursuing net-zero goals. Pairing it with high-efficiency, dispatchable technologies like fuel cells will allow them to decarbonize firm generation without compromising reliability or customer expectations.

Clean, combustion-free power that meets tomorrow’s standards

Because they do not burn fuel to generate electricity, fuel cells don’t produce nitrogen oxides (NOx) and sulfur dioxide (SO2), which are among the most harmful air pollutants, even when operating on natural gas. They also require no additional water during normal operation, further enhancing their sustainability.

These characteristics help future-proof utilities against tightening air quality and water-use regulations, supporting long-term compliance and environmental stewardship.

Real-time grid support for dynamic load profiles

AI data centers can experience rapidly shifting compute loads, high power density and strict low-latency requirements — demands that challenge traditional power infrastructure. Bloom Energy’s fuel cell systems are equipped with load-following technology that allows them to ramp power output up or down as energy needs fluctuate. This makes them well-suited for AI-intensive applications.

This flexibility allows fuel cells to seamlessly participate in demand-response programs, virtual power plants (VPP), and other smart grid strategies. With embedded distributed intelligence, these systems can automatically respond to changes in grid frequency and voltage, enabling them to support ancillary services like frequency regulation and spinning reserves.

Reliable power systems that are cost-effective, scalable and built to last

With a typical lifespan of five to eight years and consistently high uptime, fuel cell systems serve as a low-risk, dependable primary power source, eliminating the need for separate backup systems. Their modular design eliminates maintenance downtime and allows utilities to scale deployments with demand, supporting both incremental growth and large-scale applications.

Flexible fuel pathways support evolving portfolios

While today’s solid oxide fuel cells commonly run on natural gas, they don’t lock users into fossil fuel dependence. These systems are inherently fuel-flexible and can transition to cleaner alternatives, such as hydrogen, biogas and ammonia, as they become more widely available and economically viable. This built-in adaptability allows utilities to plan for decarbonization without compromising near-term reliability or performance.

Future-proofing with SOFC solutions

Fuel cells are a proven, flexible and scalable technology that empowers utilities to quickly deliver clean, resilient power where needed most. Bloom Energy’s Energy Server® fuel cell systems can be rapidly deployed in various configurations and contracting models behind or in front of the meter.

The exponential growth of data centers across the United States is transforming the energy landscape. Driven by artificial intelligence (AI), cloud computing, remote work and the expanding Internet of Things (IoT), data centers are consuming more power than ever. For utilities, this shift presents both a challenge and an opportunity: how to meet rising demand reliably and sustainably while modernizing the grid to support emerging technologies.

The surge in data center development

Data centers are no longer limited to tech hubs—they’re being developed across urban and rural areas alike. Their rapid expansion is being driven by:

Increasing cloud-based applications

Widespread 5G infrastructure

High-intensity AI computing loads

Greater need for virtual collaboration

Recent projections indicate the U.S. will require over 1,000 new large-scale data centers within the next decade. Virginia remains the global leader, with more than 500 facilities, while Texas, Ohio, Georgia and Arizona are gaining traction due to competitive land costs, favorable regulations and growing access to renewable energy.

Rising power demand—and the role of utilities

Currently, data centers account for approximately 4% of the nation’s total electricity usage, with that number expected to climb to as much as 12% by 2028, according to the U.S. Department of Energy. For utilities, this represents a sharp uptick in load growth—one not seen since the early 2000s. Ensuring a stable, scalable supply of electricity is essential to meet this demand without compromising reliability.

Utilities are at the center of this transformation. While fossil fuel generation has traditionally met large energy needs, the shift toward renewable energy is accelerating due to both cost competitiveness and corporate sustainability mandates. Many data center operators are committing to carbon neutrality and securing long-term PPAs with wind and solar farms to ensure predictable, clean energy.

Grid readiness and renewable integration

Utility-scale wind and solar are now among the most cost-effective forms of generation. However, the intermittency of these resources places new demands on the grid. Battery storage and grid modernization efforts are vital to balancing loads, managing peak demand and improving resiliency.

Utilities must invest in advanced transmission infrastructure, real-time grid management systems and storage technologies to support increased renewable integration. The evolution toward a smarter, more flexible grid will ensure that utilities can continue to deliver reliable service while enabling a low-carbon future.

Wire and cable: Enabling infrastructure

As utilities prepare to meet the rising demands of data centers and renewable energy integration, wire and cable infrastructure becomes a mission-critical element in ensuring system reliability, safety and scalability.

At the core of every data center and power delivery system is an extensive network of power and communication cables—each playing a specific role in keeping the grid operational and efficient. Utilities depend on a variety of cable types, including:

Medium- and high-voltage transmission cables for delivering bulk power from generation sources to substations and load centers.

Low-voltage distribution cables for safely and efficiently feeding data centers.

Fiber optic cables for real-time monitoring, smart grid control and data transmission.

With the expansion of undergrounding projects and renewable energy installations, demand for durable, high-capacity cables is accelerating. These cables must offer enhanced insulation, fire resistance and thermal stability to handle dense, high-load installations.

Wire and cable systems are no longer just passive components; they are the connective tissue of the digital energy era, and early collaboration with manufacturers is key to ensuring grid resilience and compliance as demands evolve.

Looking ahead

As energy demand shifts alongside digital transformation, utilities play a pivotal role in shaping the future of data and energy infrastructure. By embracing renewable energy, investing in grid resilience and strengthening transmission networks, utilities can lead the way in enabling sustainable growth in the digital economy.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/JFFcjvdQuo33wQhwoiHsw7O8YzHP5ta7jGlXbae2PnA/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9BV0dfVXRpbGl0eV9EaXZlXy1fU3RvcnlfQWRfMTA0MHg2MTZweF8tXzA2XzIwMjUucG5n.webp,N,,2025-06-23 07:09:17.217620

This energy transition can help unlock opportunities across Europe and the Mediterranean, addressing industrial competitiveness, energy security and climate risks while boosting job creation, regional stability and economic resilience. The key to achieving these benefits: delivering a well-managed transition that is mutually agreed and provides an innovative vision for regional cooperation.

It is crucial that the EU sets the right course in its upcoming strategies: the New Pact for the Mediterranean and the Trans-Mediterranean Energy and Clean Tech Cooperation Initiative.

Our briefing sets out recommendations for the EU as it undertakes its strategic refresh of Mediterranean policy. These recommendations were developed with input from the Mediterranean Alliance of Think Tanks on Climate Change and other experts/government representatives from civil society and industry in Europe and the MENA region.

A new Mediterranean energy landscape

The Mediterranean energy landscape is undergoing a major transformation. In Europe, the drive to decarbonise and reduce dependence on Russian fossil fuels is reshaping energy needs and partnerships. The 2021–23 gas crisis exposed the risks of volatile gas prices. Meanwhile, countries across the Mediterranean are increasingly tapping into the region’s vast clean energy potential.

Stronger EU–Mediterranean energy ties offer benefits beyond security of supply and export opportunities. Electricity interconnectors can boost regional energy security, while clean energy-powered industrial growth can create jobs and new trans-Mediterranean supply chains. As EU demand for fossil fuels falls, clean energy partnerships can help sustain long-term regional stability as fossil fuel-producing countries in the region are hit by declining EU demand.

The EU is currently developing a New Pact for the Mediterranean, expected by late 2025, as well as a Trans-Mediterranean Energy and Clean Tech Cooperation Initiative, planned for early 2026. Getting these strategies right can be an opportunity to kick-start a new, futureproofed era of Mediterranean energy cooperation.

What are the key components of the EU’s policy toolbox for more effective Mediterranean energy diplomacy? Our recommendations:

Just energy transition as a central principle. The EU’s approach should centre on the potential for a just energy transition to help deliver the EU’s geopolitical, security and economic goals in the Mediterranean. Achieving this requires full transparency on future EU energy demand, cooperation on boosting energy efficiency, and tailored support for countries shifting away from fossil fuels.

Support for a regional renewable energy target. The EU should back a Mediterranean-wide renewable energy target, like the TeraMed goal aiming for 1TW of renewable generation capacity by 2030. The EU can use this to drive large-scale public and private investment in renewables.

Energy interconnectedness for security. The EU should primarily think of energy interconnectedness as a way to boost security and flexibility, rather than as a means simply to extract renewable energy from partner countries. A more connected grid would improve resilience, lower costs and enhance energy security across the region.

Linking renewables to industry and jobs. Renewable deployment should support industrial growth and local value creation in Southern Mediterranean partner countries. This includes supporting clean industry to maximise local benefits and build competitive pan-Mediterranean supply chains.

Financing the transition. The EU needs to mobilise its full toolkit to bring in financing for Mediterranean energy transition. Beyond new financing, this can include raising the visibility of existing European funding to implementers and assisting partner countries to mobilise domestic financing.

Pan-Mediterranean vision. As well as strengthening bilateral partnerships, the EU should establish a region-wide vision for the Mediterranean, backed by a stronger multilateral dimension. This includes actively co-creating the New Pact with stakeholders from partner countries, reinforcing South-South cooperation and exploring EU trilateral cooperation with regional actors. At an EU level, the Council should empower the Commission through a Council Decision to lead EU-wide delivery by bringing coherence between EU and Member State visions and resources.

Climate at the heart of the strategy. Climate must be central to the EU’s approach, recognising it as key to long-term security, stability and development rather than as a sectoral issue. The strategy should include a component on climate adaptation and harness the economic and development potential of the energy transition – drawing on lessons from the EU Green Deal and the emerging Clean Industrial Deal.

The choice is clear: support policies that create good union jobs, or let other countries take the lead in building the industries of the future.
When our government invests in good, American jobs, workers, and communities win.","In 2019, GM closed the Lordstown Complex, where I worked for 30 years. Donald Trump, president at the time, promised revival but delivered nothing.

With the rise of EVs, Lordstown got a glimmer of hope. Lordstown Assembly stayed closed, but GM formed a new company, Ultium, which opened a massive EV battery facility right around the corner, buoyed by federal subsidies for the emerging industry.

As the U.S. Senate debates Trump’s “One Big Beautiful Bill,” the people of Lordstown, Ohio, have a simple message: don’t shut us down again. I am the proud leader for the United Auto Workers in Region 2B, which covers Ohio and Indiana, and I hope the U.S. Senators representing our states will hear that message.

It is time for the Senate to stand up for our members and the working class. America must preserve clean energy and manufacturing tax credits that have given communities like Lordstown a lifeline.

These credits helped make it possible for the UAW to organize the first union battery cell manufacturing facility in the country at Ultium. There is also a new StarPlus Energy Gigafactory in Kokomo, Indiana, a joint venture between Samsung and Stellantis.

This plant was estimated to create and support 2,800 good union jobs with two facilities, with one on hold now because of the current policy uncertainty.

Just recently, workers at the StarPlus battery facility also voted to be recognized by the UAW, following in the footsteps of the workers at Ultium Cells in Lordstown.

GM is planning on building another battery plant in northern Indiana, and the companies, workers, and communities need to have stability moving forward.

Our contracts at these facilities have helped set a new standard for wages, benefits, and health and safety in EV battery manufacturing for workers everywhere. And we’re just getting started.

These targeted energy and manufacturing tax incentives have enabled billions in private investment, and hundreds of thousands of jobs are at stake. The advanced manufacturing tax credit is driving major growth in the battery supply chain, and we are organizing across the country to create tens of thousands of union battery jobs.

Meanwhile, the consumer electric vehicle tax credit has boosted demand for the batteries our members produce in Kokomo, Lordstown, and across our nation.

We’re witnessing a domestic manufacturing renaissance, and when these new jobs have the benefits that come with collective bargaining—better wages, safer working conditions, health care, retirement security, and a voice on the job — they lead to the kind of family-supporting careers that built the American Dream.

Unfortunately, the U.S. House of Representatives passed a bill that would devastate this progress and harm workers, and the Senate has so far failed to fix the bill.

This misguided legislation would gut the very tax credits that are benefiting our workers and bringing manufacturing back to America. The clean vehicle tax credit would be essentially eliminated, and the advanced manufacturing tax credit would be severely restricted.

Analysis suggests that repealing clean vehicle tax credits alone could reduce electric vehicle (EV) sales by as much as 40% by 2030, and could result in the idling of existing assembly plants and the cancellation of many planned EV battery manufacturing facilities.

The irony is stark and painful: thousands of battery workers have just voted to unionize, ensuring their jobs are high-quality and family-supporting. Now congressional Republicans are voting to kill those very same jobs.

They’re choosing to undermine American manufacturing in favor of what exactly? Tax cuts for billionaires and corporations?

This isn’t about party politics — it’s about our economic future. And the UAW has long said there is room for improvement in the design of these credits.

Too many companies taking the money are guilty of paying substandard wages and benefits, illegal union busting, and dangerous working conditions.

Subsidies like these need strings attached to protect workers; we can do better than corporate giveaways. But gutting the whole thing isn’t the answer.

Instead of kneecapping the credits, Congress should improve them: most importantly, by making wage and benefit standards a prerequisite for receiving the advanced manufacturing tax credit.

The choice is clear: support policies that create good union jobs, or let other countries take the lead in building the industries of the future.

The working class deserves leaders who will fight for our economic interests, not legislators who would rather slash taxes for the wealthy and greedy corporations while raising energy prices, sabotaging domestic manufacturing, and kicking millions off their health care to boot.

Senate Bill 477 – DNCR Agency Bill: Advances administrative improvements for the Department of Natural and Cultural Resources.

House Bill 126 – Revise Voluntary Agricultural District Laws: Updates regulations governing voluntary agricultural districts to better support rural communities and farmland preservation.

Bills Vetoed

Governor Stein vetoed the following bills, citing concerns about safety and constitutional issues:

Senate Bill 50 – Freedom to Carry NC: Would have allowed permitless concealed carry of firearms.

Senate Bill 153 – North Carolina Border Protection Act: Raised civil liberties and enforcement concerns.

House Bill 318 – The Criminal Illegal Alien Enforcement Act: Criticized for targeting immigrant communities and placing undue burdens on local governments.

Advocacy for Clean Energy and Coastal Protection

In addition to legislative action, Governor Stein recently urged U.S. Senators Thom Tillis and Ted Budd to oppose a repeal of the Inflation Reduction Act’s energy and manufacturing tax credits. He emphasized that repealing these credits would threaten billions in clean energy investments and thousands of jobs in North Carolina.

Further underscoring his environmental commitment, Governor Stein joined South Carolina Governor Henry McMaster in urging the Trump administration to maintain the offshore drilling ban off the Carolinas’ coasts. The governors emphasized the need to protect the region’s coastal communities, which are home to more than 2.7 million people and numerous national wildlife refuges.

LONDON, June 23, 2025 – Countries with clear industrial policy, long-term certainty and affordable clean energy are attracting a transition dividend, identifies a major new report released today during London Climate Action Week.

The report challenges the perception that business is backing away from net-zero. Instead, it finds investments are increasingly shaped by the reliability of national policy environments, and governments are failing to capture the full dividend of business-led decarbonization investments by backsliding on commitments and policies.

The evidence becomes more conclusive each year: the overwhelming majority of businesses want clear and ambitious climate policies and national plans from their governments. That’s because they know that the global clean energy transition is now inevitable, and is a massive economic and commercial opportunity – worth USD2 trillion last year. It’s a clear reminder that strong national climate plans are vital to unleash even greater investment, driving jobs and prosperity. At the same time, faster decarbonization and more resilient economies are crucial, as climate impacts hammer supply chains harder each year, reducing supply of key commodities like food, and pushing up business costs, which is already starting to flow through to higher inflation pressures for households and governments.

Simon Emmanuel Kervin Stiell, Executive Secretary, United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC)

The Business Breakthrough Barometer 2025 report, based on insights from more than 300 business leaders in over 50 countries, finds 56% of surveyed leaders say the primary motivation for increased investment in net-zero is to secure long-term industrial competitiveness – not just as a response to regulatory obligations or to meet reporting requirements. Companies are focusing on technologies and markets that offer both

sustainability and commercial returns, and remain committed – with 91% saying they have maintained or increased investments in the net-zero transition over the past year.

The majority of executives (96%) also believe governments should stay committed to achieving net-zero emissions, yet 50% reported declining confidence in governments’ support over the past year. This is a risk to economic growth, as 92% of business leaders surveyed believe the cost of inaction on climate will outweigh the cost of the transition, and 61% expect climate-related disruptions to create costs to their business this year.

As companies assess climate costs, net-zero policies are shaping where and how they are deploying capital. Countries with enabling policy environments are attracting a transition

dividend and have been deemed ‘bright spots’: markets with long-term signals that are increasingly attractive for transition capital. The UK, China and India are the top cited bright spot countries, becoming more attractive for investment over the past year. Conversely, half of respondents cited the US as a less attractive destination for low-carbon investment than it was a year ago, with policy instability the main reason for businesses reducing investments.

Business continues to step up investment in the net-zero transition – but this leadership must be met with equally ambitious and supportive policy. By fostering the right enabling environments, governments can accelerate growth, enhance competitiveness, and drive shared success. The road ahead demands close collaboration.

Peter Bakker, President and CEO, World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD)

He added: “The Barometer is a must-read roadmap ahead of COP30 in November. Read it carefully and act decisively.”

The 2025 Barometer also highlights an increasing divide in which sectors receive

investments – mature industries like renewable energy infrastructure and electrified transport continue to grow, with 60% of business leaders assessing that the pace of transition has accelerated in the power sector.

In contrast, investment in more nascent technologies is stalling due to a lack of policy certainty and demand growth – and this has far-reaching consequences for the pace of decarbonization. For example, 62% of respondents said the clean hydrogen transition has decelerated as rising costs and uncertain offtake lead to widespread project delays, which also has a knock-on effect for low-carbon iron-making.

The Business Breakthrough Barometer was developed to help drive the shift from promises to progress by tracking the real-world conditions that enable businesses to move from ambition to implementation. Business has a critical role to play, but progress depends on whether the right systems are in place—policies, finance, and technology—that make delivery possible. The Barometer provides a clear picture of where implementation is gaining ground, where gaps persist, and where targeted interventions can unlock momentum. As we look toward COP30, we must move decisively from aspiration to execution. This is the moment to focus on credible, inclusive, and coordinated action that delivers for people, economies, and the planet.

Dan Ioschpe, UNFCCC High-Level Climate Champion for COP30

“The Barometer reinforces a clear theme in corporate climate investment: Companies invest in new technologies when they see an opportunity to create value for their stakeholders, including customers and shareholders. Durable policy takes some of the risk out of these new investments and enables them to scale, creating competitive advantage for companies that can ‘get in the door’ early to serve growing technology markets,” noted Cate Hight, Partner at Bain & Company.

To close the gap and make achieving net-zero by 2050 viable, businesses are calling for countries to stay committed to net-zero targets, whilst providing stronger policy support and financial mechanisms that foster competitiveness, especially in sectors where deployment is still nascent but essential.",https://www.wbcsd.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/An-aerial-view-of-a-mountainous-landscape-with-multiple-wind-turbines-along-a-winding-dirt-road.webp,N,,2025-06-23 07:09:37.407867

Darwin Baas surveys Kent County’s landfill from the cab of a county truck, watching the steady arrival of waste-hauling vehicles dumping drywall, sofas, home clean-outs, and bagged leftovers tumbling out by the ton. An average of 800 of these trucks arrive every day. The South Kent Landfill — just outside Grand Rapids — is now about 95% full.

“Everything up here is going to try to kill you,” he tells visitors, gesturing toward the trash compactors and bulldozers weaving between soft spots of shifting debris. But it’s not just the machinery that makes this place dangerous — it’s the system itself, designed to make waste disappear with maximum convenience and minimum cost.

Baas, director of Kent County’s Department of Public Works, has spent the last 11 years trying to bend that system in a new direction. Under his leadership, Kent County has voluntarily captured methane from its landfill, continued to operate Michigan’s only municipal waste-to-energy incinerator, and proposed an ambitious Sustainable Business Park to divert food and yard waste, recover recyclables, and incubate circular economy businesses.

But most of the county’s 600,000 tons of annual municipal solid waste still ends up here.

Kent County is among a minority of counties in Michigan managing waste through a publicly operated system. The vast majority of landfills statewide — 49 of 60 — are privately owned and profit-driven, further reinforcing the incentive to bury. Waste Management owns and operates dozens of landfills across Michigan. Baas sees this as a structural barrier to meaningful change.

“We need public-private partnerships,” he said. “The investments that need to be made are long-term — that’s not something the private sector is going to do on its own.”

The challenge Baas faces isn’t just operational — it’s systemic. As Michigan works to meet its climate goals, one of the most potent sources of greenhouse gas emissions is hiding in plain sight: landfills.

When food, yard waste, and other organic materials are buried, they decompose without oxygen and produce methane — a greenhouse gas that traps more than 80 times as much heat as carbon dioxide over a 20-year period. Though less visible than smokestacks or tailpipes, landfills are among the state’s largest sources of methane emissions, trailing only the fossil fuel sector.

Michigan recently overhauled its solid waste law, in part to address methane leaks. But even with new rules on the books, economic incentives still favor the cheapest option: burying waste.

Baas sees this as a core flaw in how Michigan manages its garbage — and a missed opportunity. In Kent County, he’s built an integrated system that prioritizes material recovery, energy generation, and composting over landfilling.

However, those systems are more expensive upfront and require initial and ongoing investment, which means aligning public infrastructure, private capital and long-term planning in ways Michigan’s current system doesn’t support.

At the heart of the issue is a tension between innovation and inertia — between new solutions and a regulatory and economic system still structured around cheap disposal. Michigan has the opportunity to lead on waste recovery, Baas argues, but doing so will require more than technical upgrades. It will demand a fundamental rethinking of how the state handles waste — and who bears the burden.

A new regulatory push

Michigan overhauled its solid waste law in 2022, in part to address methane leaks. The updated Part 115 requires all landfills — regardless of age or size — to self-monitor methane emissions and fix leaks through patching or installing gas collection systems if they exceed thresholds. New technologies, including satellite mapping and drones, offer more precise ways to detect emissions than traditional walkover surveys — but adoption remains slow.

Sniffer Robotics, an Ann Arbor-based company, developed the only EPA-approved drone for landfill methane detection. Its technology, already in use at Arbor Hills Landfill, can locate leaks faster and more accurately than older methods. Yet despite promising results, cost barriers and procurement hurdles have limited uptake across the state.

Michigan’s new rules also impose faster compliance timelines: sites must correct surface emissions within 90 days or begin designing a full gas collection system. Currently, Michigan landfills use a mix of active and passive gas systems — active systems vacuum methane to flares or energy generators. In contrast, passive systems may vent it directly into the air. Sites without active collection may eventually be forced to upgrade.

Tim Unseld, a solid waste engineer with the Department of Environment, Great Lakes, and Energy (EGLE), said two landfills without gas systems have already detected surface emissions and made repairs. But those fixes may not last. “Once enough landfill gas is generated, it will follow the path of least resistance to escape,” he said. Ongoing repairs can become costly — pushing operators toward installing full recovery systems, particularly if they can sell the captured methane as energy.

Environmental advocates argue the reforms don’t go far enough. “We’re the sixth-largest producer of landfill methane emissions, even though we’re only the 10th or 11th most populous state,” said Mike Garfield, executive director of the Ecology Center. “The basic reason is simple: We’ve made it too easy and too cheap to landfill waste.”

Garfield wants the state to adopt enforceable best practices across the board — including tighter flare controls, real-time monitoring, and mandatory adoption of tools like Sniffer’s — and points to the 2022 Arbor Hills consent judgment as a model.

Arbor Hills, owned by GFL Environmental, is the largest landfill in the state in terms of the amount of waste in place, according to EPA. It has faced years of complaints and violations tied to odor, gas migration, and leachate issues. So far, however, EGLE has not moved to apply those stricter terms statewide.

“The Part 115 amendments of 2023 include what EGLE considers best practices,” said agency spokesperson Josef Greenberg, adding that the state’s current focus is on implementation.

The economics of food waste disposal

Food waste is the largest single component of Michigan’s municipal waste stream by weight. Yet efforts to keep it out of landfills face a steep uphill climb — in large part because the system is built to reward the opposite.

Disposal fees are typically based on weight, creating a strong financial incentive for landfills owners to accept heavier materials like food waste. “This is really carbon-rich material — it generates methane, and they can use that methane to drive biogas-based processes,” Desirée Plata, an environmental engineer at MIT.

It’s a perverse incentive, she noted, especially as Michigan aims to reduce methane emissions. Instead of rewarding diversion, the current system reinforces disposal. “We’re paying for disposal by the ton, not by environmental outcome,” she said. According to EPA data, 35 out of 60 landfills in Michigan — nearly 60% — have landfill gas-to-energy projects.

That tension sits at the heart of Baas’s frustration. He’s spent years trying to reorient the local waste system around recovery. “I’ve been told I’m an oddity in the waste industry,” Baas said. “Most people don’t see the system this way.”

Waste recovery adds expense and faces adoption challenges, said Debora Johnston with Waste Management. “Capturing landfill gas generates revenue to help operators keep disposal costs down, helps protect our environment, and creates a renewable energy source for our local community,” she said.

“But separating out organics like food waste is expensive.” Indeed, the estimated cost for Kent County to meet the needs of a community of 640,000 to process 400,000 tons of mixed waste would exceed $400 million.

Plata said one of the most effective actions municipalities can take today is to fund composting. “Every municipality on the planet should be funding compost programs,” she said. “It’s one of the easiest things we can do to fight climate change — and it works.”

But Johnston points out the challenge of getting people to change their ways.

“Most communities are finding participation in recycling programs to have plateaued,” Johnston said. “And new organics collection and drop-off sites face many of the same challenges.”

That’s why Baas sees single-stream processing — separating out organics like food waste and recoverable items like recyclables and metals after pickup — as the path forward.

Despite setbacks, including the withdrawal of a private-sector partner, Kent County is moving forward with its Sustainable Business Park — a proposed 250-acre campus on county-owned farmland next to the nearly full South Kent Landfill.

The county has made a deliberate decision not to site a new landfill there and instead repurpose the land for recovery infrastructure that could process food and yard waste — which has been banned from landfills in Michigan since 1993.

“We’re past the point of building another landfill,” Baas said. “We’re trying to do something different.” Still, he acknowledges the economics won’t shift without public investment and new rules.

“We’ve determined that the highest, best use for these organics was mission critical,” he said. “But unless you change policy and infrastructure to make it go somewhere else, food waste will keep going to landfills — the lowest hanging fruit economically.”

When it comes to tackling climate change and industrial animal agriculture, a long-standing debate continues to divide advocates - is it better to focus on individual dietary shifts, or demand systemic change? Over the last decade or so, environmental and animal welfare organizations have grappled with how to combine individual behavior change with a broader push for collective action. Is it more effective to urge consumers to eat less meat, or to target meat and dairy companies to transition toward plant-based alternatives? Are individual shopping choices more impactful, or should we prioritize boycotts and pressure campaigns through grassroots activism?

A new report from the World Resource Institute reveals that both strategies can - and in fact must - work together. To combat climate change, the report finds, collective change and individual action require a joint effort.

""This research shows that people really can't do it alone,"" Mindy Hernandez, one of the authors of the WRI report, tells Sentient. ""They need help in order to realize the very significant emissions reductions that are possible."" Rather than getting caught up in the idea that ""'corporations need to do something, or nothing matters,' systems-level players, specifically policy and industry actors, have a massive role to play."" At the same time, Hernandez adds, ""that does not give individuals a free pass.""

The Surprising Origins of the 'Personal Carbon Footprint'

The idea of a ""personal carbon footprint"" didn't come from climate scientists or environmental advocates - it actually came from Big Oil, as a means of placing the onus on us. In 2004, British Petroleum (BP) introduced the carbon calculator, reframing the climate crisis as a matter of personal responsibility. The message was simple: Don't look at us. Look at yourself.

We're still grappling with the legacy of that messaging. A little more than 20 years later, global emissions continue to rise yet conversations around food and climate tend to be framed in terms of individual choices - both the effective ones like eating less meat and the not-so-effective ones for climate emissions, like buying local, ""climate-friendly,"" ""regenerative"" or organic.

Meanwhile, the beef industry continues to pump out emissions, with little political will to tackle these emissions in a meaningful way.

Impact of Diet on the Planet

Around a third of global greenhouse gas emissions come from food, and most of those food-related emissions are driven by meat, especially beef. Americans and other Global North countries must eat less meat and shift to more plant-forward diets, the research suggests. ""Plant-based foods - such as fruits and vegetables, whole grains, beans, peas, nuts, and lentils - generally use less energy, land, and water, and have lower greenhouse gas intensities than animal-based foods,"" according to the United Nations.

WRI's research also finds that ""pro-climate behavior changes"" are enough, potentially, to ""theoretically cancel out all the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions an average person produces each year - specifically among high-income, high-emitting populations."" One of those climate-crucial behaviors, the research reveals, is cutting back on meat and dairy - especially beef and lamb.

Organic or regenerative food have various merits, but these do not include a reduction in climate emissions for beef, because organic and regenerative cattle ranching requires more land, and land has a climate emissions cost. Ultimately, none of these personal actions come close to the environmental impact of shifting away from meat and other animal-sourced products. ""Full veganism can save nearly 1 ton of CO2 annually, about a sixth of the average global citizen's total emissions. But even reducing meat intake captures 40% of that impact,"" the report states.

Why Individual Change Is Not Enough

The WRI research also makes a larger point: focusing solely on individual behavior is not sufficient on its own. Without systemic change, we unlock just a fraction - about 10 percent - of our true climate action potential.

The other 90 percent, according to WRI, ""stays locked away, dependent on governments, businesses and our own collective action to make sustainable choices more accessible for everyone. (Case in point: It's much easier to go carless if your city has good public transit.)""

Consider a student working to decrease their individual climate impact by eating less meat, WRI's Hernandez suggests. A systemic action the student could take would be to advocate for the school to adopt Meat Free Mondays or WRI's Cool Food Pledge, a program that helps organizations reduce the climate impact of their food offerings by shifting to plant-rich menus.

""Suddenly it's really easy for that student to keep their commitment to eating less meat,"" says Hernandez, and the collective emissions of the larger student body also then decreases.

The key is to have climate action, at both individual and systemic levels, working in unison. ""Systemic pressure creates enabling conditions, but individuals need to complete the loop with our daily choices. It's a two-way street,"" the WRI researchers write. ""Bike lanes need cyclists, plant-based options need people to consume them."" And when more of us adopt these behaviors, ""we send critical market signals that businesses and governments respond to with more investment.""

Taking Action During Difficult Times

As the current administration continues to roll back environmental protections, it's a crucial time for both individual and collective action, Lauren Ornelas, founder of the nonprofit Food Empowerment Project, tells Sentient. ""We can't say 'I can rely on the government to pass regulations that are good for the environment or that are good for the welfare of animals,' or 'I can rely on my policymakers to do those things.' It's kind of up to us,"" she says, ""and this is the best time to acknowledge that in every aspect [where] we actually have power.""

For those who care about food system impacts, that power can be found in what we choose to eat. ""Food choices are always empowering,"" says Ornelas. So is taking part in a broader collective action, she adds, ""to make sure that we are joining our voices with others to demand change.""

And what could this look like? ""Focus on the one thing that you think you can do in your household,"" Hernandez says."" And then, think about what is the one systems-level thing you can do,"" like joining a local environmental or food justice group. Shifting diets away from meat and dairy may not solve the climate crisis alone, but eating less meat can be one empowering individual choice that can be made that much stronger by collective action.

Oil prices are expected to rise by about $5 per barrel when markets open Sunday night, according to experts.
Relatively tame oil prices have lowered gas prices to below $3 a gallon in many parts of the country, a major source of price relief for inflation-weary consumers.
It’s unclear if any major spike in oil prices will be sustained for a long period.
“It’s possible they will decide the only thing that can dissuade President Trump is the fear of an oil price spike,” he said.","The American economy faces the unwelcome prospect of reignited inflation after the United States launched strikes on three nuclear facilities in Iran.

High oil and gas prices are a near certainty, experts say. The big question now: How long will the fossil fuels price spike last?

Oil prices are expected to rise by about $5 per barrel when markets open Sunday night, according to experts.

“We are looking at $80 oil on the open,” said Andy Lipow of Lipow Oil Associates. US oil hasn’t closed above $80 a barrel since January and has largely hovered between $60 and $75 a barrel since August 2024.

Relatively tame oil prices have lowered gas prices to below $3 a gallon in many parts of the country, a major source of price relief for inflation-weary consumers.

It’s unclear if any major spike in oil prices will be sustained for a long period. Oil prices have risen about 10% since Israel’s surprise attack on June 13 and then fell on Friday after US President Donald Trump announced a two-week deadline on whether to strike Iran.

“One shouldn’t necessarily assume that just because the price of oil goes up, it’s going to stay there. It doesn’t,” said Joe Brusuelas, chief economist for the accounting firm RSM.

The direction oil prices take is likely to depend on whether Iran’s parliament decides to block the Strait of Hormuz, a key trade route that accounts for about 20% of the world’s crude oil.

On Sunday, Iran’s Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said his country has “a variety of options” when deciding how to respond to the US attacks and a prominent adviser to Iran’s supreme leader has already called for the closure of the Strait of Hormuz.

Bob McNally, president of consulting firm Rapidan Energy Group and former energy adviser to President George W. Bush, said that should Iran cut off the world’s oil supply by closing the strait it would risk more military force from the United States and its allies. Iran could also attack infrastructure in the Persian Gulf that treats and exports oil and gas.

“It’s possible they will decide the only thing that can dissuade President Trump is the fear of an oil price spike,” he said. “They have to actually create that fear.”

Appearing Sunday on Fox News, Secretary of State Marco Rubio called on China to prevent Iran from closing the Strait of Hormuz, adding that closing it would do more damage to other economies than the US economy. China buys a third of all oil that comes from the Persian Gulf, while the United States buys less than 3%.

“I encourage the Chinese government in Beijing to call them about that, because they heavily depend on the Straits of Hormuz for their oil,” Rubio said.

Rubio added that closing the strait would hurt other countries’ economies more than the US economy.

Meanwhile, American consumers may soon feel a price shock at the pump.

“It takes five days or so for stations to pass along the prices they see in one day. If oil markets do surge today and then tomorrow, it could start showing up at the pump in a matter of hours,” said Patrick De Haan, vice president of petroleum analysis at GasBuddy, a fuel tracking platform.

According to Lipow, should the Strait of Hormuz be affected, the price of oil could rise to $100 a barrel, which would raise gas and diesel prices by about 75 cents per gallon from recent levels.","https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/c-2025-06-04t160337z-1446922847-rc2rveaiwe2s-rtrmadp-3-saudi-oil-prices.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill",N,,2025-06-23 06:07:33.199206

While some rebates could be given back to you through direct deposit, usually they come as tax credits that you can write off on your annual tax returns.
One figure from the Biden administration last August suggested that, in 2023, 3.4 million Americans benefited from $8.4 billion in tax credits, ""significantly outpacing projections of the popularity of the tax credits in just the first year they were available.""
Ushering in financial savings also comes with the advantages of equipping homeowners with safe, clean energy kitchen appliances.","Have you ever wondered exactly how to earn your money back from rebates for switching to induction stoves? One recent Consumer Reports article reveals precisely what is needed to qualify so that you can collect up to $1,300 after buying a brand-new, high-tech kitchen appliance.

The Inflation Reduction Act helps you save money by rewarding you for purchasing energy-efficient products, from electric vehicles to induction ovens. While some rebates could be given back to you through direct deposit, usually they come as tax credits that you can write off on your annual tax returns.

Irene Nielson, the director of climate funding impact at the Natural Resources Defense Council, told Consumer Reports that ""each state will deliver rebate funds, so people should check their state's program for availability and details.""

While the incentives have supported the transition to clean energy, they have mostly been responsible for cultivating monetary savings for Americans. One figure from the Biden administration last August suggested that, in 2023, 3.4 million Americans benefited from $8.4 billion in tax credits, ""significantly outpacing projections of the popularity of the tax credits in just the first year they were available.""

Ushering in financial savings also comes with the advantages of equipping homeowners with safe, clean energy kitchen appliances. Gas ovens are known to produce harmful toxins within the home, damaging the air quality and putting homeowners at higher health risk. Meanwhile, induction ovens cook faster and are not reliant on gas, meaning you'll get your food quicker and save even more money through slices to your energy bill.

This all comes with about $840 off the cost of induction oven ranges, a figure that can be further boosted when accounting for an additional $500 in savings for converting gas or propane to an electric system.

Understandably, not everyone can afford to fully refurbish their kitchen. Still, rebates exist for cheaper, plug-in induction burners.

While the incentives were originally put in place to run through 2032, the Trump administration has mentioned eliminating the program. Thus, it's important to act now rather than later to reap the rewards.

“We made investments in the business to meet the demand that we’ve seen,” Zuckerman said in a phone interview.
Two years ago, Maine Solar Solutions began offering a state-certified apprenticeship program, which helps the company cover employees’ education.
“I wouldn’t know where else to go.” For Alma Lyons, working as a solar technician presented a doorway to the trades.
The 28-year-old started working at Maine Solar Solutions about three months ago, after years of searching for an apprenticeship program.","The future of Sam Zuckerman’s company felt much more certain six months ago.

Zuckerman, owner of Brunswick-based Maine Solar Solutions, said the business has grown steadily over the last few years, buoyed in part by federal income tax reductions that cover nearly a third of a new residential solar system. Home systems can cost more than $20,000, meaning reductions can be five-digit sums. Those credits have existed for years and, under current law, aren’t slated to expire until the 2030s.

But that could soon change with Congress’ budget reconciliation bill, which gives the incentives a new expiration date of about six months from now.

“We made investments in the business to meet the demand that we’ve seen,” Zuckerman said in a phone interview. “And now we’re going to be hitting the brakes.”

Like many in Maine’s solar industry, Zuckerman worries that losing the credits could drive down demand before business owners are able to adapt. Though some appreciate the environmental benefit, Zuckerman said his customers are primarily drawn to solar by the promise of lower — or nonexistent — electricity bills, so he expects to see a sharp decline. The company has no debt and relatively little overhead costs, he said, so the business itself would survive, but its capacity to hire crews and install panels would be significantly cut down.

“Frankly, if we see a significant reduction in the amount of solar electric customers, we’re going to be facing layoffs, which is really painful,” Zuckerman said. “These are employees that we brought up and brought them into the trade.”

Founded in 2013, the company now employs about 50 people, more than half of whom work in the field, with three crews dedicated to installations in a roughly two-hour radius surrounding Brunswick. Two years ago, Maine Solar Solutions began offering a state-certified apprenticeship program, which helps the company cover employees’ education. Zuckerman said that’s helped attract and retain new talent, including those who may be on the fence about a trade. These days, nearly half the company’s licensed electricians were trained in-house, he said.

ROOM TO GROW

At a worksite in Freeport Tuesday, several employees said those opportunities for professional development were part of what attracted them to the company, and the solar field in general.

Josh Herreid joined the team about a year and a half ago, and he decided to pursue a license about six months in. Herreid previously worked in carpentry, where he made about $20 an hour and lacked a clear path for advancement.

Installers at the company make between $26 and $32 per hour, while licensed electricians see $35 to $50 per hour, Zuckerman said.

“I liked the electrical aspect, but honestly it kind of lured me in with the pay to start,” Herreid said. “This is the first job where I feel like there’s an opportunity to move forward.”

The 25-year-old lives in New Gloucester with his mother, a traveling nurse, but he dreams of owning a home one day — and having the skills to maintain it.

Herreid has heard bits of news about the budget bill from social media and company-wide emails Zuckerman sends, but he has not been following the legislation closely. The constant flood of news is overwhelming, and it can be difficult to keep up with one issue without becoming “numb to the whole situation,” he said. But the uncertainty is worrisome.

“If I did lose this job, that would be seriously devastating to me, because I feel like I put all my cards into this,” Herreid said. “I wouldn’t know where else to go.”

For Alma Lyons, working as a solar technician presented a doorway to the trades. The 28-year-old started working at Maine Solar Solutions about three months ago, after years of searching for an apprenticeship program.

Lyons has a degree in illustration but said “that didn’t really click” as a career. Neither did food service, where she worked for years without finding any real chance for growth or professional development. Between her desire for hands-on work and her passion for the environment, working as a solar technician seemed like a perfect fit.

“When I got this position, I was like ‘This is literally my dream job,’ ” she said. “The potential for advancement is really important.”

She got the job and moved from New Hampshire to Portland — where her girlfriend already lived — in the same week.

“Everything fell into place, for sure,” she said.

Lyons plans to work as an installer for a few more years before transitioning to another role in the renewable industry. But, right now, she’s expecting a few more months of uncertainty.

“I hope to have a job for another eight months, worst case,” Lyons said. “All I can do is what I do each day. It’s not worth me biting my nails when I’m going to bed.”

NO TIME TO PLAN

The residential solar investment credit has existed, in some form, for nearly two decades, having been extended and retooled several times since, according to North Carolina State University’s NC Clean Energy Technology Center. It was last renewed as part of the Biden administration’s Inflation Reduction Act, which extended the 30% limit through 2032, after which it would step down to 26% in 2033 and 22% through 2034, when it would expire.

But the House of Representatives’ budget reconciliation bill includes provisions to terminate the solar investment and a handful of other clean energy credits at the end of the year, including similar credits for businesses that install solar systems. The Senate Finance Committee, in its draft, pegged the terminations to six months after the bill’s enactment, rather than a static date at the end of 2025.

“We built our business around these incentives being in place for our customers,” said Dan Clapp, co-founder of Revision Energy, a solar installer based in South Portland. “The IRA just gave us a long runway to build our business strategy.”

Clapp said it can take three to six months to complete a residential project. Commercial projects can take more than a year to design and implement.

“If these are going away, they have to be responsibly phased down based on project cycles. Businesses need certainty to plan around,” he said.",https://www.pressherald.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2025/06/42360265_20250617_solar-credits_4-1750453822.jpg?w=1024,N,,2025-06-23 07:10:34.269077

Both DIFFER’s engineers and physicists agree that fusion physics and control theory have a lot to offer each other.","Fusion energy may be the holy grail of clean energy, but harnessing its complex processes and machinery is a daunting task. Researchers at the Dutch Research Institute (DIFFER) think the solution to fusion may not only lie in deeper physics understanding but also in an engineering approach to self-steering systems.

In the final months of 2023, researchers and engineers from across Europe are in a race for fusion on the Culham Science Campus near Oxford. Their Joint European Torus (JET) reactor has been Europe’s flagship experimental fusion device for forty years and will enter retirement and decommissioning in the new year. A last experimental campaign squeezes every last bit of scientific insight from the doughnut-shaped fusion device.

As a last hurrah, the JET team even manages to set a new world record for the most fusion energy released in a single shot – an important step towards harnessing the power of the Sun as a clean energy source on Earth. But this experimental campaign is about much more than records.

Heat exhaust

Part of JET’s last experiments are three carefully tailored ‘shots’ – ten-second bursts of 100 million degrees Celsius – that have nothing to do with pushing the reactor to maximum output, and everything to do with managing the heat exhaust in future fusion power plants.

Running the three shots is a team of Dutch researchers, among whom is PhD candidate Thomas Bosman. A control engineer from the Dutch Institute for Fusion Research, Bosman, has been given temporary control over a humble gas valve at the inside bottom of JET. Its crucial role: to puff in enough gas to cool and diffuse the hot exhaust near JET’s inner wall, without adding so much gas that it snuffs out the core of the plasma (hot, charged fuel particles) where fusion reactions take place.

Bosman explains: “In JET, the plasmas are short and relatively benign. Sturdy wall materials like tungsten can manage the heat directly.” Future fusion power plants will be an order of magnitude more powerful, with much harsher conditions. He continues: “If you do not manage the heat exhaust very carefully, you could damage the inside walls in seconds.”

Engineering approach

Physicists call the regime where heat is diffused before it touches the reactor wall ‘detachment.’ They have spent years understanding the underlying interactions between the outer plasma edge, the plasma core and the reactor walls. Bosman and his colleagues instead managed to fine-tune a control algorithm that guarantees detachment in just three ten-second plasma shots, without knowing any of the underlying physics: a great success for the engineering approach to fusion.

In his PhD work at DIFFER, Bosman uses the insight that while the underlying physics of the fusion exhaust may be complex, the way the entire system behaves in response to a puff of cold gas can be caught in a basic model. Bosman recalls: “During those shots in JET, we studied how the exhaust responds to slow and fast changes in the amount of cooling gas that we puffed in. In principle, that was all the information we needed to set the rules for our controller.”

Confidence

Bosman and his colleagues in the DIFFER team on control engineering did not just swoop in and solve a grand challenge in fusion research in half a day. Getting there took years of physics research to understand the heat problem and develop a scenario to manage it; without that solid foundation, Bosman’s controller would not know where to start or what to achieve.

After successful first steps in exhaust control on the small Swiss fusion experiment TCV in 2021, the team was invited to do the same for the larger German fusion experiment ASDEX-Upgrade. Only then did the fusion community have enough confidence in the new technique to green-light dedicated experiments at JET in the UK, where experimental time is a scarce resource.

Even after this success, Bosman thinks detachment remains a challenge. He says: “The optimal fusion performance is close to the upper limit where your gas puffing starts to impact the plasma core. But once we switch on our system, our controller can maintain the exhaust in exactly the desired state.”

Full scenarios

Important as the heat exhaust may be, in the grand scheme of control engineering, it is a fairly simple system. A so-called linear equation suffices to model the response of the exhaust to outside stimuli like puffs of gas. But fusion knows many more complex, non-linear challenges, like how to foresee and manage growing instabilities, like sudden lightning-like energy outbursts from the edge of the fusion plasma. And what about long-term issues like the slow erosion of a reactor wall over months of operation?

One of the leaders in DIFFER’s fusion research is plasma physicist and computer modeller Sven Wiesen, an expert in understanding the many interacting processes that happen at the edge of a fusion reactor.

Take the case of ITER, the world’s largest fusion experiment to date. Wiesen says: “You do not just want to model the very edge of your plasma; what happens there is ultimately decided by processes upstream in the heart of the plasma.” That includes the effect of fusion heat generated in the plasma core, the magnetic cage keeping the hot mass of charged particles in place, and the turbulence that transports heat outward to the scrape-off layer, the point where plasma leaves the magnetic cage and flows towards the exhaust area.

All these processes influence each other in highly non-linear behaviour. Preparations for the ITER design were done in computer models like the Scrape-Off Layer Plasma Simulator (SOLPS). Wiesen explains: “When the ITER design was finished in the 90s and 2000s, SOLPS was the tool to create complete exhaust scenarios for how to operate it.”

Bells and whistles

From the level of turbulence and energy outbursts from the plasma edge to their effect on the fusion reactor wall, SOLPS can model it all. At a price, says Wiesen: “With the full bells and whistles of including every last process, each scenario took months to calculate on a supercomputer.” Over the years, Wiesen has learned that those high-fidelity models are crucial for the field. He says, “Simplified codes don’t cut it. If you make approximations or leave out processes, you just don’t get the right answers.”

While high-fidelity models have their place in giving fully detailed operating scenarios, the increased pace in the fusion community demands faster, more agile predictions. Wiesen is part of a movement that uses machine learning and artificial intelligence to train so-called surrogate models. Those identify trends in the output of more detailed models and can reproduce the same overall behaviour in minutes instead of months. Or faster, shares the physicist: “With the new AI methods, we are now at the point where we can predict future behaviour faster than the plasma itself evolves.”

While surrogate models only work with confidence if they can interpolate between solid data points, they open up new possibilities in the world of fusion. Control engineer Thomas Bosman: “An advanced controller could have a fast model of the plasma inside to look ahead at what the plasma will do. That would let it look predictive if, for instance, there is unwanted behaviour coming up, and decide how to tweak conditions now to dampen or avoid those conditions.”

Private parties

Asked about the applications of surrogate models, Wiesen names interested parties like the US privately funded SPARC project and the British public-private project STEP. Interestingly, both feature different configurations from existing reactors like JET. For instance, SPARC operates at a much higher magnetic field strength compared to ITER and STEP’s plasma is shaped more like a cored apple than the doughnut shapes found in other reactors. Wiesen: “For all those differences, the underlying physics is basically the same. With a proper scaling, if it exists, that lets us port our predictions without problems.”

Even ITER has shown interest, shares the physicist: “To get the go-ahead for their first shots from the licensing agency, they need to prove that it will go through in advance.”Which is tricky, because there is no similar experiment they can pull experimental data from; ITER is twice the size of its direct predecessor, JET. But fast models could extrapolate the performance of previous devices to the ITER parameters in a trustworthy way, thinks Wiesen. “That would show the necessary confidence in their approach.”

Network approach

Do fusion control algorithms always have to lean on physical understanding? Coming into the field from a PhD in system theory, DIFFER post-doc researcher Lizan Kivits has a surprising take on this. Within this topic, network identification is a very new field, with its first scientific publication in 2013. And it may herald a revolution in our understanding of highly connected networks of components.

Essentially, the field of systems theory is a highly mathematical field. Network theory can be used to describe any network, from the thousands of components on a modern computer chip to the millions of parts inside a fusion reactor. Its approach is to focus on interconnected subsystems within a network, where both the behaviour of subsystems and their interconnections are taken into account.

Kivits says: “When my colleagues talk about the physics of plasmas, I find it hard to follow them.” But as soon as she has measurements of physical quantities, Kivits can identify the dynamic interactions between them from experimental data. She says, “For instance, how the heat in the core of the plasma influences the number of plasma particles at the edge.” All without using a single physics formula.

Both DIFFER’s engineers and physicists agree that fusion physics and control theory have a lot to offer each other. Thomas Bosman says: “In the academic community, we develop very advanced, smart control algorithms, but real-world industrial applications mostly use quite simple, linear control schemes. Fusion may be one of the few fields where we actually need to implement these advanced control algorithms. And in return, those controllers offer a unique way to bring fusion energy closer to reality.”",https://www.innovationnewsnetwork.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/EUROfusion_schematic_diagram_of_fusion_power_plant.jpg,N,,2025-06-23 09:09:47.978623

A bill passed by the U.S. House, the ""One Big Beautiful Bill Act,"" would repeal key clean energy tax credits, driving up household energy bills and threatening job growth in the state. The legislation is under Senate review and could unwind many incentives, including the Inflation Reduction Act, which helped attract more than $11 billion in private investment to Ohio.

Molly Bryden, climate and sustainability researcher for Policy Matters Ohio, said the investments created quality union jobs and brought cost-saving clean energy projects to the state.

""The Inflation Reduction Act didn't just create jobs, it created good jobs with good working conditions,"" Bryden pointed out. ""Also, the apprenticeship requirements for the bonus tax credit allows workers without formal training in a certain sector to develop equitable pathways to good union jobs in the trades.""

According to a Policy Matters Ohio report and Energy Innovation modeling, the bill would increase annual household energy spending in Ohio by nearly $180 in 2030 and more than $400 by 2035, totaling at $11 billion in higher costs by 2035.

Robbie Orvis, senior director of modeling and analysis for the nonpartisan think tank Energy Innovation, said the bill's effects go beyond households, risking industrial development and energy affordability across the board.

""When those tax credits are removed, a lot less of that clean electricity gets built and our electricity gets a lot more expensive,"" Orvis stressed. ""It would push out developers and manufacturing facilities that are helping to bring industries to the U.S.""

If passed, analysts said the legislation could cost Ohio nearly 38,000 jobs and shrink the state's GDP by $53 billion through 2034. The Senate is expected to make its revisions in the coming weeks.

Federal data show roughly 75,000 South Dakota households rely on SNAP benefits to put food on the table and hunger-fighting groups paint a troubling picture if Congress goes through with big program cuts.

The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, once known as food stamps, faces a possible downsizing in the budget reconciliation bill now in the Senate. It has already cleared the House. Relief organizations say cuts proposed along the way could take away enough food for more than 9 billion meals on average every year.

Lori Dykstra, CEO of Feeding South Dakota, said it would be harder for her network to pick up the slack with donations on the decline.

""At a time when resources are the lowest, need is the highest,"" Dykstra pointed out. ""We're in this challenging space to be able to fill that gap as a food bank.""

Because of economic uncertainty, she noted businesses that normally donate excess food are being careful not to overstock. Dykstra emphasized SNAP benefits give struggling households more healthy food choices during times like these. A key GOP Senator said even though legislative rules have cast doubt over some provisions, they will still seek reforms to preserve SNAP for those who need it, while saving taxpayer dollars.

The Senate version still has nearly $100 billion in proposed cuts as Republicans look to offset proposed tax cut extensions. Poverty researchers said misinformation continues to spread about the integrity of SNAP, noting payment errors are often unintentional and fraud is only a small portion of program activity.

Vince Hall, chief government relations officer for Feeding America, a nonprofit network of 200 food banks, said the current approach targets the wrong people.

""Instead of addressing fraud in a thoughtful and effective way, it's using fraud as an excuse to hurt people who are honest, hardworking; seniors, who are in their golden years; people with disabilities; active-duty military,"" Hall outlined. ""It is harming all of those families.""

Feeding America added losing access to SNAP benefits would hurt recipients in other ways, too. For example, adults who get SNAP benefits spend about $1,400 less on average per year for medical care than adults who do not. The organization worries people would have to make tougher choices, like whether to pay for health care needs or food.

The budget reconciliation bill being considered by the U.S. Senate proposes $863 billion in Medicaid reductions over a decade, with 10.9 million Americans projected to lose coverage by 2034, according to a June 4 Congressional Budget Office report.

In Florida, where 760,000 Medicaid enrollees rely on community health centers, advocates say the cuts would destabilize preventive care and overwhelm hospitals.

Austin Helton, CEO of Brevard Health Alliance, said the cuts would dismantle primary-care access, rupturing what he called Florida's ""health-care ecosystem.""

""If you cut spending on Medicaid and ACA, which primarily pays for access to primary-care health services at community health centers, that access is gone,"" he said. ""The patients are still going to need that care. They're just going to end up sicker and they're going to end up going to more costly and more complex environments like the emergency room at the hospital.""

Helton said the cuts would hit hardest at health-care facilities such as those under Brevard, where 60% to 70% of patients use Medicaid or ACA plans.

While the Florida Policy Institute warns of clinic closures and reduced hours, supporters say the changes target inefficiencies, with House leaders claiming they'll reduce wasteful spending while protecting vulnerable patients.

Florida's community health centers, which serve one in eight Medicaid patients statewide, face what advocates call an impossible math problem: more patients but fewer resources.

""As the population in Florida increases, the number of our patients increase, the number of Medicaid enrollees decreases,"" said Jonathan Chapman, CEO of the Florida Association of Community Health Centers. ""Therefore, by process of elimination, you're going to see more uninsured people on our doorstep.""

The Congressional Budget Office projects Florida would lose $7.3 billion in federal Medicaid funds by 2030 under the House plan, with rural counties such as Gadsden and DeSoto facing severe strain. The bill remains stalled in the Senate, where Republicans are divided over many issues, including rural hospital protections.

After the Department of Government Efficiency cut AmeriCorps funding earlier this year, a federal judge last week granted a temporary halt to the cuts on behalf of a group of states that filed a lawsuit against the move. Montana is not on the list.

AmeriCorps is a national service program which has been running for three decades. In the year before the cuts, about 2,800 members, called VISTAs, served at 300 Montana host sites including food banks, schools, youth centers and more.

Rochelle Hesford, executive director of Southwest Montana Youth Partners, relied on AmeriCorps service in the group's five-year plan. But its VISTA member was on board for less than four months before funding was cut.

""We're in kind of that early critical stage where we really need to get that public support and get our name out there and build capacity for the organization,"" Hesford observed. ""We're losing, like, a year's worth of work, I would say.""

Two dozen states plus Washington, D.C., filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration arguing it did not provide sufficient notice or comment period according to law but because Montana was not a plaintiff, its AmeriCorps funding remains cut.

Groups hosting VISTA members pay about one-third of their income and AmeriCorps funding covers the rest.

Erin Switalski, senior program director for the Headwaters Foundation, which provides grants for groups across the state, said it is a big leg up for many Montana groups.

""We're a resource-scarce state in many ways, and AmeriCorps VISTAs can really come in and help organizations build new systems and find efficiencies,"" Switalski explained. ""Losing that support is really critical.""

Montana's population is one of the least dense in the country but it has the most nonprofits per capita, nearly 10 per every 1,000 residents, according to the Tax Foundation.

Switalski noted she worries cuts to AmeriCorps signal something bigger.

""It's tied to this broader trend that we're seeing in really just a gutting of civic infrastructure that helps hold our communities together in Montana,"" Switalski added.

Conclusion The global subsidy race reflects different national imperatives: China used massive subsidy to jumpstart EVs, now pivoting to tax and regulation.","As the world accelerates toward electric mobility, one thing is clear: subsidy strategies are not just policy tools — they are competitive instruments in the race for industrial dominance and climate action. Nations like India, China, the United States, and European countries are deploying different models of subsidy to push electric vehicle (EV) adoption, local manufacturing, and energy independence. This comparative article examines how these economies have established and implemented their subsidy systems, and what can be learned about how they each have evolved over time.

India: Targeted subsidies to democratise EV uptake

India has a layered, strategic approach to EV subsidies that where the strategy focuses on infrastructure, cost, and domestic manufacturing.

National Level Subsidies

Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of Electric Vehicles (FAME II), is a ₹10,000 crore scheme launched in 2019 offering direct subsidies of ₹15,000 to two-wheelers, ₹20,000 for three-wheelers and up to ₹50 lakh for electric buses.

FAME II programs had benefitted more than 11 lakh vehicles by the end of April 2024.

In October 2024, PM e-Bus Sewa and PM e-Drive were launched in India, with ₹10,900 crore available until March 2026 to support two-, three-, and four-wheelers as well as public transport fleets.

Tax-Based Financial Assistance

The GST rate on EVs has been reduced from 12% to 5%, which effectively amounts to indirect subsidization.

Under Section 80EEB of the Income Tax Act you can take a deduction of up to ₹1.5 lakh for the interest rate on your EV loan.

State-Level Subsidies

Delhi: ₹10,000 per kWh (capped at ₹1.5 lakh for four-wheelers).

Maharashtra: ₹5,000 per kWh plus scrappage incentives.

Other states like Gujarat, Tamil Nadu, Meghalaya, and Assam also offer additional subsidy benefits.

Infrastructure Subsidy

Through the Bureau of Energy Efficiency (BEE), India is deploying over 88,000 charging stations using subsidy funds under RDSS and PM e-Drive.

India’s subsidy program hopes to create a balanced EV ecosystem incorporating infrastructure and supply-chain development and customer incentives.

China: From Mass Subsidy to Market Stabilization

China was the forerunner in EV adoption by offering large subsidies over the past ten years; however, it is moving to a market-driven approach.

Historic Direct Subsidies

Between 2009 and 2022, China spent approximately ¥200 billion (US$28 billion) in direct EV subsidy.

EVs received up to ¥60,000 (US$8,000) per vehicle, covering up to 60% of purchase cost during peak years.

Current Subsidy Mechanisms

Direct subsidy ended in December 2022.

However, purchase tax exemptions remain until 2027, valued at up to ¥30,000 (US$4,300) per vehicle through 2025 and ¥15,000 (US$2,150) from 2026–2027.

Local Government Support

Major cities provide non-monetary subsidy: free or prioritized license plates, toll waivers, and exemptions from driving restrictions.

Additionally, some regions provide funding for home charger installations and fleet electrification.

China has changed a more structural rather than subsiding approach; it is focused on supply-side innovation and major capital building (NEA has a plan for 3 million charging points by 2025).

US: Supply Chain and Consumer Subsidies Based on IRA

The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) is the foundation of the U.S. subsidy model, including sourcing regulations and supply and demand incentives.

$3,750 for acquiring critical minerals (from FTA or US countries).

US$3,750 for battery component manufacturing in North America.

2. Used EVs: US$4,000 credit under Section 25E.

3.Commercial EVs: US$7,500–US$40,000 via Section 45W.

4. EV Chargers: 30% tax credit up to US$1,000 for residential and up to US$100,000 for commercial projects.

Supply Chain Subsidy

IRA provides subsidy via tax credits for battery production, EV assembly, and critical mineral extraction in the U.S.

Billions allocated for workforce training, disadvantaged community support, and industrial revitalization.

Risks

As of 2025, some legislators have introduced bills to repeal parts of IRA, including the clean vehicle subsidy — a significant risk to long-term planning.

The U.S. subsidy framework links green technology to domestic job creation and industrial policy, with a focus on energy security.

Europe: A Patchwork of National Subsidies & EU-Wide Regulations

Europe’s EV subsidy strategy blends direct incentives with emissions mandates and public charging standards.

Member State Incentives

Germany (Umweltbonus): Up to €6,000 subsidy for EVs; declining gradually.

France: Up to €7,000 for low-income households; new “social leasing” plan introduced in 2024.

UK: Plug-in grants for electric vans and fleet vehicles.

EU-Level Support

Innovation Fund and Recovery and Resilience Facility provide subsidy for battery plants and R&D.

European Investment Bank backs green auto infrastructure and manufacturing.

Regulatory Support (Indirect Subsidy)

CO₂ fleet average targets (zero-emission mandate by 2035).

Alternative Fuels Infrastructure Regulation (AFIR): mandates chargers every 60 km on highways.

Euro 7 emission norms further incentivize EV shift.

While Europe’s direct subsidy is declining, regulatory and infrastructure support remains robust.

Global Subsidy Comparison: A Quick Glance

Region Direct Purchase Subsidy Tax Incentives & Credits Infrastructure Subsidy Supply Chain Subsidy Stability Outlook India High per-kWh (FAME II, E-Drive) Loan tax breaks, 5% GST ₹2,000 cr charger rollout PLI scheme for batteries & motors Stable till 2026 China Phased out (2022) Tax exemption till 2027 Massive public & private rollout Local grants, R&D funds Phasing to market-led USA Up to US$7,500 Used EV, charger, commercial Up to US$100,000 for chargers Billions via IRA Under political scrutiny Europe Up to €7,000 (varies) VAT cuts in some regions EU funding + member plans EIB loans, battery alliances Reducing direct subsidies

Overall, subsidy intensity follows this pattern by 2025:

China: Highest cumulative and infrastructure support.

India: Targeted central + state subsidy, evolving to cover infrastructure and loans.

Europe: Moderate direct subsidy, strong regulatory frameworks.

US: Tax credit tied to supply chain; future uncertain.

Key Takeaways

Subsidy volume matters, but design matters more. China’s early direct subsidy helped EV saturation; India’s per kWh subsidy targets cost parity and scale.

The US frames subsidy to incentivize domestic supply chains via IRA, linking consumer benefit to strategic sourcing.

Europe’s subsidy packages balance grants with emissions regulations; less cash, but strong structural support.

India’s unique approach combines purchase subsidy, tax cuts, and infrastructure grants aimed at broad inclusion (2‑, 3‑, 4‑wheel segments).

Political volatility (US) and tapering (China) illustrate that long-term planning is critical—India’s schemes through 2026 offer relative stability.

Risks & Recommendations

Subsidy fatigue: China’s phase‑out shows dropping subsidy risk; India must manage fiscal sustainability.

Targeting & equity: Ensure subsidy reaches middle/lower-income buyers (used EV credits, finance schemes).

Complementarity: Domestic subsidy needs matching infrastructure investment—India’s BEE grants are key, but rural coverage lags.

Stakeholder coordination: India could stabilize state and federal subsidy alignment; US lessons show how politicization can unravel incentives.

Transition paths: As technologies mature, subsidy must shift from hardware to services (battery recycling, grid integration).

Conclusion

The global subsidy race reflects different national imperatives:

China used massive subsidy to jumpstart EVs, now pivoting to tax and regulation.

The US links subsidy directly to industrial policy via IRA but remains politically precarious.

Europe blends moderate grants with strong regulation.

India’s dynamic subsidy mix—purchase, tax, infrastructure, regional—could significantly scale EVs if maintained and aligned.

In this global contest, subsidy policy is no longer just financial—it’s about shaping supply chains, equity, and strategic autonomy. While each nation’s path varies, all are leveraging subsidy as a key tool for the green industrial transition. The next few years will determine which models are financially sustainable and scalable.",https://www.evmechanica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/The-Global-Race-for-Subsidy-How-India-Compares-with-China-the-US-and-Europe-in-EV-Incentives.jpg,N,,2025-06-23 04:05:05.715975

The framework was developed by the University of California-Berkeley's Center for Law, Energy and the Environment, and partners -- including the nonprofit advocacy group Michigan Clean Cities. The plan outlines steps local governments can take to build EV infrastructure and improve accessibility, particularly in underserved communities.

Jeffrey Hoang, communications and engagement associate for Michigan Clean Cities, shared insights about the plan in a recent Clean Fuels Michigan webinar.

""The focus of this framework is ensuring that community voice and impact is prioritized with these plans,"" Hoang explained. ""To actually receive public input on where EV charges, EVSC should be placed within the city. So, actually going out to residents and just asking.""

The framework recommends first identifying key agencies and staff involved, then those agencies can decide which action steps matter most for their community and how they should be prioritized. Still, many EV critics contend affordability is a big issue for everyday families, even with tax credits.

Backers said the plan helps cities plan for an EV future, not just for personal vehicles but rideshare services, e-bikes and e-scooters. It recommended outreach and funding strategies for transit projects along with examples of successful pilot programs.

Hoang added the framework can be viewed as a resource, connecting people to other helpful resources.

""There's so much knowledge and great experience and expertise throughout the industry,"" Hoang observed. ""It provides quick access, you know just a quick 'control-F,' search for whatever kind of resource that you might need.""

The framework highlighted the need for collaboration among local departments, such as planning, transportation and public works to ensure EV access is implemented effectively and equitably.

A critical decision now rests with Gov. Ron DeSantis, as Florida coastal communities and shellfish farmers urge him to sign a bill permanently banning oil drilling near the Apalachicola River. They see the river as a lifeline for the state's aquaculture industry - and a fragile ecosystem.

House Bill 1143, which passed the Legislature with a single ""no"" vote in the Senate, would block drilling within 10 miles of the Apalachicola National Estuarine Research Reserve.

Adrianne Johnson, executive director of the Florida Shellfish Aquaculture Association, warned that the region's economy and environment hang in the balance.

""That area is really unique; 75% of our oyster farmers operate across Franklin, Wakulla and Gulf counties, so those three counties that are downriver from the proposed oil drilling site,"" she said. ""So, protecting that water is absolutely critical to the livelihood of our farmers.""

Despite a court win stopping one drilling project in Calhoun County, she said unprotected sites still threaten Apalachicola's fragile recovery. Aquaculture in the area sustains an oyster industry that once supplied 90% of Florida's wild harvest before its collapse.

The Apalachicola River watershed supports Florida's emerging shellfish industry, which filters water, creates habitats and sustains rural coastal economies. Johnson said even the threat of oil contamination, such as what happened during the 2010 BP spill, could devastate the region.

""We are confident that the governor is supportive of our rural coastal communities,"" she said. ""Under his governorship, the state has invested millions of dollars into restoring Apalachicola Bay. So really, this bill aligns with those values.""

Under Florida's ""7-Day Rule,"" DeSantis must decide on the Apalachicola drilling ban by next Wednesday. The bill automatically becomes law if he chooses not to either sign or veto it.

June is World Oceans Month, and advocates are warning that industrial shipping pollution hurts both oceans and port communities.

At least 31 million people live within three miles of a port, according to the Environmental Protection Agency. That includes thousands of New Jerseyans. Industrial shipping frequently relies on heavy fuel oil, which releases carbon dioxide, sulfur oxides and black carbon into the atmosphere, causing harm to marine ecosystems and port communities.

Altorice Frazier, northeast port campaigner with Pacific Environment, said if the global shipping industry was its own country, it would be one of the largest polluters in the world.

""Global shipping burns some of the dirtiest fossil fuels, like heavy oil, producing toxic air pollutions and greenhouse gases,"" he explained.

Those toxic pollutants often affect the communities closest to ports, frequently working-class neighborhoods made up primarily of people of color. Shipping pollution causes $265,000 premature deaths and six million childhood asthma cases globally each year, according to the Ocean Conservancy.

One way to cut down on port pollution, Frazier said, is the electrification of cargo ships. Much like electric cars, cargo ships can be electrically powered and charged while at a port. He explained this would cut down on emissions, the acidification of marine ecosystems and the negative health effects on port communities.

""We really want to show where there's funding, there's possible job opportunities,"" Frazier continued. ""There's a gain in this. It might not be in the short term, but in the long term, there is definitely opportunity. And we want to see industry and port authorities work alongside communities and government to really strategize how this is possible.""

Frazier added shore power can create jobs and sustain economic growth for communities, while cutting down on pollution and noise.

Forest fires have broken out in parts of New Mexico that state forecasters had already warned would see an elevated wildfire risk this summer due to high temperatures, low snowpack and ongoing drought. At least 25 New Mexico jurisdictions imposed some level of fire restriction this spring.

State Forester Laura McCarthy said the peak of fire season is still a week away, beginning June 26.

""Right after the Solstice, so the days are at their longest, which means the burn periods are at their longest and typically the highest temperatures we experience all summer are in the last two to three weeks of June,"" she continued.

On Tuesday, New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham declared a state of emergency in response to the Trout Fire, which is burning in the Gila National Forest, forcing residents to evacuate. The Buck Fire also has burned more than 57,000 acres in the same area of Southwest New Mexico. The governor has urged localities to ban fireworks and restrict water usage.

McCarthy reminded people that dry conditions can cause a small fire to spread in a split second - whether it's from a backyard grill, a spark caused by welding, or a campfire that appears to be out but is reignited when hidden embers are stirred up by the wind, catching surrounding vegetation on fire. She said there's no ""go back"" - even if a fire is accidental.

""If you look at every single big fire we've had, there was either a lightning strike or a person behind it,""

she added. ""Yes, there is arson, but the majority of human-caused fires are not arson. They are caused by unintentional response and then, it's just too late.""

Just three years ago, New Mexico's Hermit's Peak/Calf Canyon fire exploded into the state's most destructive wildfire ever. State lawmakers passed billss in this year's session to address the issue. One establishes a program for wildfire prevention and mitigation, while the other allows for ignition-resistant construction.

What's being done about Investment Tax Credits?","As the U.S. Senate debates a highly controversial bill, thousands of clean energy jobs in Georgia could be on the chopping block.

What's happening?

On May 22, the U.S. House of Representatives passed H.R. 1, also known as the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, by a vote of 215-214. While the bill has been hailed by Republican lawmakers as an important stepping stone for extended tax cuts for individuals and small businesses, it also aims to greatly reduce the Inflation Reduction Act's green energy tax credits.

Many of these tax credits can be used to offset the costs of home solar panel installation. EnergySage can make it easy and painless to find solar installation estimates and compare quotes thanks to their free tools.

If passed, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act would not only hinder credits for electric vehicles and energy-efficient products, but it would also endanger many solar power and wind farm projects across the country. According to a report from Sen. Raphael Warnock of Georgia, the passing of H.R. 1 would ultimately cost the state up to 42,000 jobs.

All told, 51 new clean energy projects totaling over $28 billion in funding have been announced in Georgia since the passing of the IRA. These projects include solar manufacturing, EV production, and battery manufacturing.

Why is the passing of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act important?

In a statement to EnergySage, Warnock emphasized the importance of many of these clean energy projects. ""Georgia businesses and workers agree that we should protect investments that are spurring good-paying manufacturing jobs across the state,"" he said.

As one of the leading experts in reporting across the solar industry, EnergySage has followed this development since H.R. 1 was first introduced. Although many states have directly benefited from the IRA, Georgia has made the most of it. According to EnergySage, the state has received around $4.50 in private investment for every $1 of federal funding.

""We should not be sacrificing Georgia jobs for tax cuts for folks who are already well off, and we cannot allow political games to derail a generational economic transformation that is already putting people to work and creating economic opportunity,"" added Warnock.

What's being done about Investment Tax Credits?

If the Investment Tax Credit were successfully eliminated, it would mean that homeowners would need to complete their solar installations by the end of the year to get the 30% tax credit. While the elimination of the ITC will rely on the Senate passing the bill, it may be wise to take advantage of incentives before it's too late.

To help, you can utilize EnergySage's free services, which can save you up to $10,000 in incentives for solar purchases and installations. EnergySage even offers a mapping tool that shows the average cost of a home solar panel system in each state as well as details on solar panel incentives. When combined, they can not only help you get the best price for rooftop solar panels but also make use of all of the incentives that are available in your area.",https://www.thecooldown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Georgia-clean-energy-jobsimage-rec1U0UkZq733LpJT.jpg,N,,2025-06-23 04:05:10.259555

Under current law, developers of solar projects can choose between the ITC under Section 48E or the PTC under Section 45Y.
Curbs on Critical Mineral Production Credit The updated provision phases out the manufacturing production credit for critical minerals as well.","The United States Senate Committee on Finance has released a draft legislative text for its version of the budget reconciliation bill, which includes a provision to phase out the clean electricity production tax credit (PTC) and the investment tax credit (ITC) starting in 2026.

These credits currently support zero-emission electricity generation by rewarding either the facility’s output or the capital invested in its construction. Under existing law, both were set to phase out starting in 2032 or once electricity-related emissions fell to 25% of 2022 levels, whichever came later. The new provisions advance this timeline, particularly for wind and solar projects.

For wind and solar technologies, both credits begin phasing down in 2026, with projects starting that year receiving only 60% of the full value. This drops to 20% in 2027 and is eliminated by 2028.

For other electricity-generating technologies, such as hydropower, nuclear, and geothermal, the credit is phased out on a different timeline. These projects receive the full credit if construction begins in 2033. In 2034, they receive 75% of the credit. The value decreases to 50% in 2035, and by 2036, no credit is available.

In addition, wind and solar installations leased to residential customers will no longer be eligible for production-related incentives.

Both credits are further restricted by new rules, excluding participation by entities with links to foreign adversaries. Facilities receiving material support from such entities will not qualify if construction begins after 2025. Companies that are themselves considered prohibited foreign entities also lose access to the credits starting with the next tax year following enactment.

Wind projects were eligible for the Clean Electricity Production Credit under Section 45Y of the Inflation Reduction Act. It has no set expiration under current law and allows wind developers to claim credit based on output. The Senate proposal now repeals this credit for wind projects that begin construction after December 31, 2024. For projects that begin before the end of 2024 but are placed in service later, the step-down applies. Only wind projects commencing in 2024 will qualify for the full credit.

Similar changes apply to solar energy. Under current law, developers of solar projects can choose between the ITC under Section 48E or the PTC under Section 45Y. Both options, introduced through the Inflation Reduction Act, had no predetermined expiration. The proposed changes repeal both credits for solar projects that begin construction after December 31, 2024. For those that begin before the deadline but are delayed in completion, the value of the credit declines. To qualify for the full benefit, construction must begin in 2024 and proceed swiftly to commissioning.

Standalone Energy Storage Investment Credit

The draft bill also revokes the investment tax credit for standalone energy storage systems, which was made available under Section 48 following the Inflation Reduction Act. The repeal applies to all projects that begin construction after December 31, 2024. This means only storage systems that start before the end of 2024 remain eligible. Starting in 2025, no new standalone energy storage projects will qualify for the ITC.

Curbs on Critical Mineral Production Credit

The updated provision phases out the manufacturing production credit for critical minerals as well.

In 2031, the credit for critical minerals would be limited to 75%. It would drop to 50% in 2032, 25% in 2033, and end entirely in 2034.

The credit for wind components would phase out earlier, ending for items produced and sold after December 31, 2027.

Another change removes a rule that previously treated eligible components as sold to an unrelated party if they were integrated into another eligible component. This change will take effect for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2026.

The provision also limits credit eligibility for taxpayers with ties to certain foreign entities. Starting in 2026, no credit is available for components manufactured with material assistance from a prohibited foreign entity, as defined under section 7701, with modifications introduced in this bill.

Additionally, beginning in the first tax year after enactment, the credit is not available to taxpayers classified as specified foreign entities or foreign-influenced entities.

Energy-efficient Home Improvement

Taxpayers can claim a credit for residential spending on solar electric systems, solar water heating, fuel cells, small wind energy systems, geothermal heat pumps, and battery storage if the property is placed in service within 180 days after the bill is enacted.

Clean Hydrogen Production Credit

The bill also repeals the clean hydrogen production credit provided under Section 45V for facilities that begin construction after December 31, 2024. Unlike the wind and solar credits, there is no phase-down. The repeal is absolute. Under existing law, the credit is available for ten years from the start of production and varies based on the carbon intensity of the hydrogen produced. Its value ranges from 20% to 100% of $0.60 per kilogram.

The credit can be transferred to unrelated parties if the producer does not have sufficient tax liability. With the new proposal, only hydrogen facilities starting construction in or before 2024 will remain eligible.

The study analyzed over 2.2 million 1- to 5-year-old used cars sold in May 2023 and 2024 and found that the average used EV price is down 29.5 percent year-over-year versus 6.1 percent for the average used gas car price. In May 2024, the average used electric vehicle was priced at $28,767, or 8.3 percent below the average gas car at $31,424. These prices show a major turnaround from a year ago, when the average used EV cost $40,783 and the average used gas car cost $33,469.

Used Electric Vehicle Market Crashing

“There’s no denying the crash in used electric vehicle values over the past year,” said Karl Brauer, Executive Analyst at iSeeCars. “We’ve watched EVs prices fall between 30 and 40 percent since June of last year, while the average gas car’s price has dropped by just 3 to 7 percent in that same timeframe.”

While electric vehicle values appeared to stabilize at the end of 2023, they experienced a substantial drop in February this year and have continued to decline over the past four months. At the same time, the average used gas car price has shifted by approximately $400 during those same four months.

“It’s clear used car shoppers will no longer pay a premium for electric vehicles and, in fact, consider electric powertrains a detractor, making them less desirable – and valuable – than traditional models,” said Brauer.

Used Gas Car Prices Showing Stability

Demand for used gas cars grew during the new car production shortages brought on by the pandemic. This demand pressure is slowly easing, but with used prices hovering around $31,000 they remain well above pre-pandemic levels.

“Over the past year the average used price for traditional internal combustion engine vehicles has never shifted by more than 7 percent, with most months changing between 3 and 6 percent,” said Karl Brauer. “This is in stark contrast to the 30 to 40 percent drops in used EV pricing.”

Used EV Prices Continue To Crash

The ongoing crash in used electric vehicle prices pulled their values below the average used gas cars in February and shows no sign of stopping.

“While the drop in used EV prices is dramatic, what’s more disconcerting is no indication of used EV values stabilizing,” said Brauer. “At some point used EV prices will have to bottom out, but we don’t appear to be at that point yet.”

EV Models Lead the Drop in Used Car Values

When ranking used cars by the biggest price drops over the past year, electric vehicles take up the first seven slots and make up eight of the top 10 models with the largest drops in pricing.

Methodology

iSeeCars analyzed over 2.2 million 1- to 5-year-old used cars sold in May 2023 and 2024. The average listing prices of each car model were compared between the two time periods, and the differences were expressed as both a percentage difference from the 2023 price as well as a dollar difference. Heavy-duty vehicles, low-volume vehicles, vehicles discontinued as of the 2023 model year, and vehicles in production for fewer than four of the last five model years for each period were excluded from further analysis.

The economics of food waste disposal Food waste is the largest single component of Michigan’s municipal waste stream by weight.
For those who care about food system impacts, that power can be found in what we choose to eat.","By Nina Misuraca Ignaczak for Planet Detroit.

Broadcast version by Chrystal Blair for Michigan News Connection for the Planet Detroit-Public News Service Collaboration.

Darwin Baas surveys Kent County’s landfill from the cab of a county truck, watching the steady arrival of waste-hauling vehicles dumping drywall, sofas, home clean-outs, and bagged leftovers tumbling out by the ton. An average of 800 of these trucks arrive every day. The South Kent Landfill — just outside Grand Rapids — is now about 95% full.

“Everything up here is going to try to kill you,” he tells visitors, gesturing toward the trash compactors and bulldozers weaving between soft spots of shifting debris. But it’s not just the machinery that makes this place dangerous — it’s the system itself, designed to make waste disappear with maximum convenience and minimum cost.

Baas, director of Kent County’s Department of Public Works, has spent the last 11 years trying to bend that system in a new direction. Under his leadership, Kent County has voluntarily captured methane from its landfill, continued to operate Michigan’s only municipal waste-to-energy incinerator, and proposed an ambitious Sustainable Business Park to divert food and yard waste, recover recyclables, and incubate circular economy businesses.

But most of the county’s 600,000 tons of annual municipal solid waste still ends up here.

Kent County is among a minority of counties in Michigan managing waste through a publicly operated system. The vast majority of landfills statewide — 49 of 60 — are privately owned and profit-driven, further reinforcing the incentive to bury. Waste Management owns and operates dozens of landfills across Michigan. Baas sees this as a structural barrier to meaningful change.

“We need public-private partnerships,” he said. “The investments that need to be made are long-term — that’s not something the private sector is going to do on its own.”

The challenge Baas faces isn’t just operational — it’s systemic. As Michigan works to meet its climate goals, one of the most potent sources of greenhouse gas emissions is hiding in plain sight: landfills.

When food, yard waste, and other organic materials are buried, they decompose without oxygen and produce methane — a greenhouse gas that traps more than 80 times as much heat as carbon dioxide over a 20-year period. Though less visible than smokestacks or tailpipes, landfills are among the state’s largest sources of methane emissions, trailing only the fossil fuel sector.

Michigan recently overhauled its solid waste law, in part to address methane leaks. But even with new rules on the books, economic incentives still favor the cheapest option: burying waste.

Baas sees this as a core flaw in how Michigan manages its garbage — and a missed opportunity. In Kent County, he’s built an integrated system that prioritizes material recovery, energy generation, and composting over landfilling.

However, those systems are more expensive upfront and require initial and ongoing investment, which means aligning public infrastructure, private capital and long-term planning in ways Michigan’s current system doesn’t support.

At the heart of the issue is a tension between innovation and inertia — between new solutions and a regulatory and economic system still structured around cheap disposal. Michigan has the opportunity to lead on waste recovery, Baas argues, but doing so will require more than technical upgrades. It will demand a fundamental rethinking of how the state handles waste — and who bears the burden.

A new regulatory push

Michigan overhauled its solid waste law in 2022, in part to address methane leaks. The updated Part 115 requires all landfills — regardless of age or size — to self-monitor methane emissions and fix leaks through patching or installing gas collection systems if they exceed thresholds. New technologies, including satellite mapping and drones, offer more precise ways to detect emissions than traditional walkover surveys — but adoption remains slow.

Sniffer Robotics, an Ann Arbor-based company, developed the only EPA-approved drone for landfill methane detection. Its technology, already in use at Arbor Hills Landfill, can locate leaks faster and more accurately than older methods. Yet despite promising results, cost barriers and procurement hurdles have limited uptake across the state.

Michigan’s new rules also impose faster compliance timelines: sites must correct surface emissions within 90 days or begin designing a full gas collection system. Currently, Michigan landfills use a mix of active and passive gas systems — active systems vacuum methane to flares or energy generators. In contrast, passive systems may vent it directly into the air. Sites without active collection may eventually be forced to upgrade.

Tim Unseld, a solid waste engineer with the Department of Environment, Great Lakes, and Energy (EGLE), said two landfills without gas systems have already detected surface emissions and made repairs. But those fixes may not last. “Once enough landfill gas is generated, it will follow the path of least resistance to escape,” he said. Ongoing repairs can become costly — pushing operators toward installing full recovery systems, particularly if they can sell the captured methane as energy.

Environmental advocates argue the reforms don’t go far enough. “We’re the sixth-largest producer of landfill methane emissions, even though we’re only the 10th or 11th most populous state,” said Mike Garfield, executive director of the Ecology Center. “The basic reason is simple: We’ve made it too easy and too cheap to landfill waste.”

Garfield wants the state to adopt enforceable best practices across the board — including tighter flare controls, real-time monitoring, and mandatory adoption of tools like Sniffer’s — and points to the 2022 Arbor Hills consent judgment as a model.

Arbor Hills, owned by GFL Environmental, is the largest landfill in the state in terms of the amount of waste in place, according to EPA. It has faced years of complaints and violations tied to odor, gas migration, and leachate issues. So far, however, EGLE has not moved to apply those stricter terms statewide.

“The Part 115 amendments of 2023 include what EGLE considers best practices,” said agency spokesperson Josef Greenberg, adding that the state’s current focus is on implementation.

The economics of food waste disposal

Food waste is the largest single component of Michigan’s municipal waste stream by weight. Yet efforts to keep it out of landfills face a steep uphill climb — in large part because the system is built to reward the opposite.

Disposal fees are typically based on weight, creating a strong financial incentive for landfills owners to accept heavier materials like food waste. “This is really carbon-rich material — it generates methane, and they can use that methane to drive biogas-based processes,” Desirée Plata, an environmental engineer at MIT.

It’s a perverse incentive, she noted, especially as Michigan aims to reduce methane emissions. Instead of rewarding diversion, the current system reinforces disposal. “We’re paying for disposal by the ton, not by environmental outcome,” she said. According to EPA data, 35 out of 60 landfills in Michigan — nearly 60% — have landfill gas-to-energy projects.

That tension sits at the heart of Baas’s frustration. He’s spent years trying to reorient the local waste system around recovery. “I’ve been told I’m an oddity in the waste industry,” Baas said. “Most people don’t see the system this way.”

Waste recovery adds expense and faces adoption challenges, said Debora Johnston with Waste Management. “Capturing landfill gas generates revenue to help operators keep disposal costs down, helps protect our environment, and creates a renewable energy source for our local community,” she said.

“But separating out organics like food waste is expensive.” Indeed, the estimated cost for Kent County to meet the needs of a community of 640,000 to process 400,000 tons of mixed waste would exceed $400 million.

Plata said one of the most effective actions municipalities can take today is to fund composting. “Every municipality on the planet should be funding compost programs,” she said. “It’s one of the easiest things we can do to fight climate change — and it works.”

But Johnston points out the challenge of getting people to change their ways.

“Most communities are finding participation in recycling programs to have plateaued,” Johnston said. “And new organics collection and drop-off sites face many of the same challenges.”

That’s why Baas sees single-stream processing — separating out organics like food waste and recoverable items like recyclables and metals after pickup — as the path forward.

Despite setbacks, including the withdrawal of a private-sector partner, Kent County is moving forward with its Sustainable Business Park — a proposed 250-acre campus on county-owned farmland next to the nearly full South Kent Landfill.

The county has made a deliberate decision not to site a new landfill there and instead repurpose the land for recovery infrastructure that could process food and yard waste — which has been banned from landfills in Michigan since 1993.

“We’re past the point of building another landfill,” Baas said. “We’re trying to do something different.” Still, he acknowledges the economics won’t shift without public investment and new rules.

“We’ve determined that the highest, best use for these organics was mission critical,” he said. “But unless you change policy and infrastructure to make it go somewhere else, food waste will keep going to landfills — the lowest hanging fruit economically.”

Broadcast version by Nadia Ramlagan for West Virginia News Service reporting for the Sentient-Public News Service Collaboration

When it comes to tackling climate change and industrial animal agriculture, a long-standing debate continues to divide advocates - is it better to focus on individual dietary shifts, or demand systemic change? Over the last decade or so, environmental and animal welfare organizations have grappled with how to combine individual behavior change with a broader push for collective action. Is it more effective to urge consumers to eat less meat, or to target meat and dairy companies to transition toward plant-based alternatives? Are individual shopping choices more impactful, or should we prioritize boycotts and pressure campaigns through grassroots activism?

A new report from the World Resource Institute reveals that both strategies can - and in fact must - work together. To combat climate change, the report finds, collective change and individual action require a joint effort.

""This research shows that people really can't do it alone,"" Mindy Hernandez, one of the authors of the WRI report, tells Sentient. ""They need help in order to realize the very significant emissions reductions that are possible."" Rather than getting caught up in the idea that ""'corporations need to do something, or nothing matters,' systems-level players, specifically policy and industry actors, have a massive role to play."" At the same time, Hernandez adds, ""that does not give individuals a free pass.""

The Surprising Origins of the 'Personal Carbon Footprint'

The idea of a ""personal carbon footprint"" didn't come from climate scientists or environmental advocates - it actually came from Big Oil, as a means of placing the onus on us. In 2004, British Petroleum (BP) introduced the carbon calculator, reframing the climate crisis as a matter of personal responsibility. The message was simple: Don't look at us. Look at yourself.

We're still grappling with the legacy of that messaging. A little more than 20 years later, global emissions continue to rise yet conversations around food and climate tend to be framed in terms of individual choices - both the effective ones like eating less meat and the not-so-effective ones for climate emissions, like buying local, ""climate-friendly,"" ""regenerative"" or organic.

Meanwhile, the beef industry continues to pump out emissions, with little political will to tackle these emissions in a meaningful way.

Impact of Diet on the Planet

Around a third of global greenhouse gas emissions come from food, and most of those food-related emissions are driven by meat, especially beef. Americans and other Global North countries must eat less meat and shift to more plant-forward diets, the research suggests. ""Plant-based foods - such as fruits and vegetables, whole grains, beans, peas, nuts, and lentils - generally use less energy, land, and water, and have lower greenhouse gas intensities than animal-based foods,"" according to the United Nations.

WRI's research also finds that ""pro-climate behavior changes"" are enough, potentially, to ""theoretically cancel out all the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions an average person produces each year - specifically among high-income, high-emitting populations."" One of those climate-crucial behaviors, the research reveals, is cutting back on meat and dairy - especially beef and lamb.

Organic or regenerative food have various merits, but these do not include a reduction in climate emissions for beef, because organic and regenerative cattle ranching requires more land, and land has a climate emissions cost. Ultimately, none of these personal actions come close to the environmental impact of shifting away from meat and other animal-sourced products. ""Full veganism can save nearly 1 ton of CO2 annually, about a sixth of the average global citizen's total emissions. But even reducing meat intake captures 40% of that impact,"" the report states.

Why Individual Change Is Not Enough

The WRI research also makes a larger point: focusing solely on individual behavior is not sufficient on its own. Without systemic change, we unlock just a fraction - about 10 percent - of our true climate action potential.

The other 90 percent, according to WRI, ""stays locked away, dependent on governments, businesses and our own collective action to make sustainable choices more accessible for everyone. (Case in point: It's much easier to go carless if your city has good public transit.)""

Consider a student working to decrease their individual climate impact by eating less meat, WRI's Hernandez suggests. A systemic action the student could take would be to advocate for the school to adopt Meat Free Mondays or WRI's Cool Food Pledge, a program that helps organizations reduce the climate impact of their food offerings by shifting to plant-rich menus.

""Suddenly it's really easy for that student to keep their commitment to eating less meat,"" says Hernandez, and the collective emissions of the larger student body also then decreases.

The key is to have climate action, at both individual and systemic levels, working in unison. ""Systemic pressure creates enabling conditions, but individuals need to complete the loop with our daily choices. It's a two-way street,"" the WRI researchers write. ""Bike lanes need cyclists, plant-based options need people to consume them."" And when more of us adopt these behaviors, ""we send critical market signals that businesses and governments respond to with more investment.""

Taking Action During Difficult Times

As the current administration continues to roll back environmental protections, it's a crucial time for both individual and collective action, Lauren Ornelas, founder of the nonprofit Food Empowerment Project, tells Sentient. ""We can't say 'I can rely on the government to pass regulations that are good for the environment or that are good for the welfare of animals,' or 'I can rely on my policymakers to do those things.' It's kind of up to us,"" she says, ""and this is the best time to acknowledge that in every aspect [where] we actually have power.""

For those who care about food system impacts, that power can be found in what we choose to eat. ""Food choices are always empowering,"" says Ornelas. So is taking part in a broader collective action, she adds, ""to make sure that we are joining our voices with others to demand change.""

And what could this look like? ""Focus on the one thing that you think you can do in your household,"" Hernandez says."" And then, think about what is the one systems-level thing you can do,"" like joining a local environmental or food justice group. Shifting diets away from meat and dairy may not solve the climate crisis alone, but eating less meat can be one empowering individual choice that can be made that much stronger by collective action.

The Biden-era program limits leaks and flaring from oil and gas sites. That's important in Pennsylvania, where over 1 million tons of methane escape each year.

David Jenkins, president of Conservatives for Responsible Stewardship, said many of the larger companies capture and sell methane - but research shows smaller operators often skip repairs, wasting gas and polluting the air.

He said he supports laws to curb emissions, but is concerned this bill could roll back the rules.

""The problem is now with the reconciliation bill in Congress, there's language in there that would put off something called the methane waste fee,"" said Jenkins, ""which is the incentive basically for these companies that don't use best practices to come into compliance.""

The U.S. ranked second worldwide last year in methane pollution from energy production - just behind China, and ahead of Russia.

And Pennsylvania is the country's second-largest gas producer, with more than 221,000 wells drilled or proposed.

The International Energy Agency's Global Methane Tracker sheds light on energy-sector emissions and where cuts can be made.

Jenkins described methane as a ""super pollutant"" - much more powerful than carbon dioxide, and a major driver of climate change.

He added that a recent survey shows the Biden-era rule has the support of the American people.

""There's been polling done about the Methane Emissions Reduction Program,"" said Jenkins, ""and it showed that seven in 10 people in the U.S. support charging a fee on methane, to hold polluters accountable for methane leaks.""

The IEA tracker found in 2024, the U.S. had nearly 4 million abandoned oil and gas wells, which released almost 3 million metric tons of methane into the atmosphere.

Workers and families in Indiana could feel the impact of the ""One Big Beautiful Bill Act"" moving through the U.S. Senate. The legislation would roll back clean-energy tax credits and investments passed in the Inflation Reduction Act.

Jim Clarida, business manager for the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers in northwest Indiana, said those investments have helped create jobs and attract nearly $8 billion in private energy development to the state.

""Since the IRA was passed,"" he said, ""$7.8 billion in private clean-energy investments have flown into my home state here in Indiana, fueling the construction and manufacturing of EV battery plants, expanding solar and wind developments.""

Clarida said Indiana has about two gigabytes of utility-scale solar projects under its belt and has another gigawatt in the pipeline.

Supporters of the big budget bill have argued that the changes are necessary to cut federal spending and reduce the national deficit by eliminating costly subsidies, although it also includes an extension of tax cuts that benefit mostly wealthy Americans.

U.S. Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., warned that the bill could drive up household electricity costs by hundreds of dollars and eliminate clean-energy job growth across the Midwest.

""This could create a recession if we lose them all,"" he said. ""And so first, our union members - not just electricians, but everyone - should know that jobs are at stake in their union, either for themselves or their brothers and sisters who are in the union.""

Indiana ranks among the top 10 states for clean-energy job growth since the Inflation Reduction Act passed. Schumer urged Hoosiers to weigh in on what he calls ""critical energy investments"" as the Senate debates the bill.

A federal proposal moving through Congress could stall Michigan's booming rooftop solar industry by ending key tax credits that have fueled clean energy growth, nationwide.

What is being called the ""One Big Beautiful Bill Act"" would eliminate the 30% credit for rooftop solar and other home energy systems, including those leased by companies.

Michigan leads the nation in Inflation Reduction Act-funded projects, attracting more than $27 billion in investment and creating more than 26,000 jobs.

Allan O'Shea, founder and CEO of 50-year-old CBS Solar in Copemish, said about 90% of his family-owned business is residential rooftop solar.

""That 90% would lose one of the benefits that go with solar and that's a 30% tax credit,"" O'Shea pointed out. ""The other 10% of our business is commercial and it would survive but the damage would be done. We're talking 25+ employees here.""

O'Shea sent a heartfelt letter to most senators, expressing concerns about the bill's effects on his livelihood and others'. Supporters of the big tax-cut and spending bill argued it would boost the economy and strengthen national security.

Backers also said the bill delivers the biggest tax cut in U.S. history for those earning $30,000 to $80,000 a year, with 15% off their taxes. O'Shea emphasized he and his customers are money-smart and value long-term investments, adding the issue is not the goal, but how the bill is being pushed through.

""I just hope for the saner minds, the senators and the Congress people that we have in Michigan, to step up and slow the pace down,"" O'Shea urged. ""You can sunset it.""

In 2023, solar power jumped 51% nationwide, with solar making up more than half of all the new electricity added to the grid.

A new analysis of what Congressional lawmakers have dubbed the One Big Beautiful Bill Act found it would eliminate thousands of jobs in South Dakota and slow economic growth.

The bill's current language repeals multiple federal policies, funding programs and tax credits meant to boost American clean energy and manufacturing.

Daniel O'Brien, senior modeling analyst for the nonpartisan think tank Energy Innovation, said South Dakota could lose as many as 1,600 jobs by 2030 as funding is diverted to jobs in the coal, oil and gas industries.

""Those are but a fraction of the number of jobs that are being lost in manufacturing, construction, utilities, farming and agriculture,"" O'Brien explained.

O'Brien noted up to 840,000 jobs nationwide could be eliminated over the next five years if the current bill remains intact. It repeals more than $500 billion in Inflation Reduction Act investments, which some House Republicans have dubbed a ""green new scam.""

South Dakota households currently benefit from low energy prices, partly due to the growth of renewable energy. The industry has drawn more manufacturing to the state, along with data centers in need of large amounts of cheap power. But the analysis showed a shift toward fossil fuels will increase annual statewide energy bills by more than $180 million by 2035.

O'Brien stressed industries looking to reduce costs may choose to operate elsewhere.

""When you repeal these tax credits, you lose the incentivization of companies to build out cheap renewables in South Dakota,"" O'Brien pointed out. ""For that reason, companies that are relying on their cheap power might go to other states or they might move outside of the U.S.""

He added gas prices are also expected to rise with the repeal of EPA rules on vehicle tailpipe emissions and fuel economy standards. Zero-emission vehicle sales in South Dakota are expected to fall from more than 50% in 2030 to around 30% over the next five years.

No infrastructure project in development today delivers more cost savings to American consumers than Grain Belt Express.
The Grain Belt Express will carry the amount of power equivalent to four nuclear power plants, he noted.
“Projects like the Grain Belt Express and that supply agreement are enabling facility investments like this at Prysmian,” he said.","A Williamsport manufacturer of conductor cable has become crucial in helping America to further gain energy independence.

“Critical energy infrastructure projects like Grain Belt Express represent a direct investment in America, our economy, and the domestic supply chain,” said Shashank Sane, Invenergy’s Executive Vice President for Transmission for the recent grand opening of an expansion at Prysmian, 409 Reighard Ave., Williamsport.

“Our partnership with Prysmian only furthers our commitment to the U.S. manufacturing workforce, a stronger grid, and American energy independence.”

The Prysmian facility expansion is supported by a long-term supply and manufacturing agreement announced in 2023 with Invenergy.

As a result, Prysmian will supply up to 12,500 miles of overhead conductors to support Invenergy’s portfolio of long-distance high-voltage direct-current (HVDC) transmission projects in the U.S., including Grain Belt Express, the largest electric transmission project in development in the U.S., and the New Mexico North Path and Cimarron Link lines.

This expansion doubles the United States’ ability to manufacture advanced transmission conductors with E3X® technology. Prysmian’s E3X® advanced conductor technology increases the capacity, efficiency, and reliability of transmission lines, allowing for more electric power to be transmitted with low losses and delivered across long distances without expanding the physical footprint of the project.

Invenergy’s own presence in Pennsylvania includes the 1,485-megawatt Lackawanna Energy Center, located just outside Scranton, the Electric City. Since coming online in 2018, Lackawanna continues to be the largest natural gas plant in this state and the largest operational project in Invenergy’s fleet.

Based in Highland Heights, Kentucky, Prysmian North America is considered to be a benchmark player in the energy expansion and digital transformation. Prysmian’s strategy is said to be aligned with the main market drivers by developing resilient, high-performing, sustainable, and innovative cable systems for the transmission, power grid, electricity and digital solutions segments. Prysmian’s North American operations include 29 plant locations and nearly 8,000 associates with net sales of $8 billion.

Globally, Prysmian is the largest cable solutions provider in the world, with more than 33,000 employees, 107 production plants and 27 R&D centers in over 50 countries. In 2024, global sales exceeded 17 billion Euros.

Invenergy’s Grain Belt Express

Grain Belt Express, an Invenergy project, is the largest private sector-led transmission project in U. S history.

An energy superhighway (pipeline) connecting four U.S. grid regions, Grain Belt Express will unleash up to 5,000 MW of American energy to enhance grid reliability and strengthen U.S. energy security. No infrastructure project in development today delivers more cost savings to American consumers than Grain Belt Express.

Srini Siripurapu, Chief Innovation and Research and Design Officer, Prysmian, told the Sun-Gazette before a tour of the facility that Prysmian has over 12 patents, including the E3X coating process and the robot that was on display for guests at the ceremony.

This coating process, he said, is water-based and not harmful to the environment and is about the thickness of a hair or 50 microns. It will last longer than the aluminum, he said, to laughter on the tour of the Williamsport plant.

As electric demand in the U.S. grows, with the introduction of data centers for information technology and artificial intelligence, Invenergy is developing new electricity transmission lines – which are basically pipelines for power, said Patrick Whitty, Invenergy’s senior vice president, public affairs, transmission.

“The project we are working on that will buy electric conductor cable from this facility – the Grain Belt Express – is the largest transmission line in development in the United States,” he said.

The Grain Belt Express will carry the amount of power equivalent to four nuclear power plants, he noted.

That is 5,000 MW of power, as stated, and consists of an 800-mile-long power line that starts in Kansas, crosses Missouri, crosses Illinois and delivers it at the Illinois-Indian state line.

That matters here in Pennsylvania for a couple of reasons.

“Invenergy has committed to buying 12,500 miles of conductor cable,” he said.

The examples of the silver cable – which move the electrons – was shown to the guests.

That is a power pipeline which gave Prysmian the certainty of its investment to permit the expansion of the facility.

Tying that back to Pennsylvania, it means local jobs and because of what is produced here electricity is expected to become more affordable, with Grain Belt Express projected to save American consumers $52 billion in its first 15 years of operations and it increases reliability, Whitty said.

“When you can lower the price of power you can increase reliability it allows more factories to make investments and more American workers to be put on the job,” he said. That is because power prices are a huge driver of the nation’s economy. It is a cycle that is bringing in dollars to invest in good-paying jobs for workers, he noted.

Legislators often discuss “grid reliability,” and Whitty said this is kind of like a company that takes older technology and transforms it into a newer generation. Transmission lines that can connect different regions of the U.S. are critical for grid reliability and power-demand is always changing, if you can move electricity from where it is available to where it is needed, that is how you create reliability and deliver savings.

Invenergy (a named derived from a combination of innovation and energy) has been working with Prysmian on this factory expansion since 2022. That long-term agreement of the 12,500 miles of cable Invenergy committed to buy then is what allowed Prysmian to move forward with the expansion and gave them that certainty, Whitty remarked.

“Projects like the Grain Belt Express and that supply agreement are enabling facility investments like this at Prysmian,” he said.

The reason that the Illinois-Indian state line is vital is because it is where the grid region that serves Pennsylvania begins, that is called the PJM region.

PJM has, admittedly, faced a lot of challenges with electricity capacity and customer affordability, so getting that amount of power to the Illinois-Indiana state line allows it to get the PJM that serves Pennsylvania. “That’s a huge source of electricity that goes to Pennsylvania once this line goes on line.”",https://ogden_images.s3.amazonaws.com/www.sungazette.com/images/2023/09/19103957/fblike1.jpg,N,,2025-06-23 04:05:48.498650

On this basis, the impact of different influencing factors on the EV industry should be analyzed to propose the development direction of the EV industry in different countries (regions) on the basis of multiparty game theory.

Evolutionary pathways and current trajectories of EV industries in major economies

The existing research has primarily employed industry life cycle theory and the diffusion of innovations theory to analyze the stage-specific characteristics and technological penetration pathways of EV industries across different regions.

The U.S. EV industry follows a typical “technology-driven” development trajectory. Its industry life cycle has evolved from initial exploration (late 19th century to early 20th century) to policy-driven growth (1970s–1980s), technological breakthroughs (1990s), and commercial expansion (early 21st century to present) (Cutcliffe and Kirsch, 2001; Diouf, 2024). In recent years, the U.S. EV market has experienced rapid growth. Although EVs still account for a relatively small share of total U.S. vehicle sales (e.g., approximately 10% in 2023), the growth momentum is robust. The U.S. government supports EV industry development and supply-chain enhancement through legislation and fiscal subsidies (Archsmith et al., 2022; Afzal and Hawkins, 2024). Concurrently, U.S. EV manufacturers are actively exploring innovative business and service models to meet diverse consumer demands (Wang & Zhao, 2021). Against this backdrop, the U.S. case exemplifies the dual role of the policy impetus and technology diffusion, aligning with the “S-curve diffusion” pattern—slow initial growth followed by exponential expansion due to technological maturation and cost reductions.

The development trajectory of the EU exhibits a policy-driven pattern characterized by prolonged interplay between regulatory constraints and industrial transformation. The EU’s EV industry, following the U.S. pathway, has evolved through three distinct phases: early-stage exploration (1970s–1990s), policy-driven innovation (2000s–2010s), and market expansion with scale economies (2010s–present) (Serralles, 2006; Szabo and Newell, 2024). The EU and its member states have promoted EV adoption through fiscal incentives, tax benefits, and infrastructure investments (Gryparis et al., 2020), achieving notable technological advancements. However, challenges persist, including demand contraction postsubsidy phase-outs, inadequate charging infrastructure, and consumer range anxiety, resulting in market volatility (Serralles, 2006). Illustratively, pure EV sales plummeted 43.9% annually by August 2024, with EVs maintaining a lower market share and insufficient growth momentum than combustion engine vehicles do (Möring-Martínez et al., 2024). This policy–market dynamic aligns with institutional theory, where coercive regulatory forces dominate industrial transitions, whereas corporate strategic inertia creates periodic disequilibrium.

The Chinese pathway exemplifies a “state-led model,” marked by rapid industrial development with pronounced outcomes, operating within a dynamic equilibrium between policy subsidies and market consolidation. China’s EV evolution comprises four phases: exploration (2000–2012), unrestrained growth (2013–2017), market shakeout (2018–2020), and rationalized competition (2021–present) (Wang and Kimble, 2021; Zhao et al., 2019; Wang and Yu, 2021; Xiong et al., 2022). Extensive studies have highlighted that national and local fiscal subsidies fueled speculative market behavior and unregulated expansion in China’s EV sector (Chen and Midler, 2016; Pelegov and Eremenko, 2021). Subsidy reductions and market stagnation triggered industry-wide restructuring (Lin et al., 2024). This trajectory aligns with the resource-based view, where scale-driven production and supply-chain integration (e.g., CATL’s battery innovations) create inimitable competitive advantages.

Japan’s EV industry is entrenched in a “technology-locked model,” characterized by technological conservatism and path dependency dilemmas. Its development spans three phases: early-stage exploration (1960s–1990s), hybrid vehicle breakthroughs (late 1990s–early 2010s), and EV R&D adoption (2010s–present) (Kempton and Kubo, 2000; Ahman, 2006; Yamashita, 2009). In recent years, Japan has prioritized hydrogen fuel cell vehicles (FCVs), achieving notable advancements in technological innovation and policy frameworks (Takahashi, 2021). Despite progress, Japan’s EV market remains cautious, with subdued consumer adoption rates and low EV sales penetration relative to those of the EU, the U.S., and China (Palmer et al., 2018). This trajectory exemplifies path dependency theory, where early-mover advantages in hybrid technologies engendered innovation rigidity, hindering adaptation to global electrification trends.

Main factors influencing the development of the EV industry

There are numerous factors influencing the development of the EV industry, but from a subjective perspective, the primary driving forces behind its advancement can be categorized into government, enterprises, and individuals (Kumar Alok 2020).

Policy-driven mechanisms

Drawing on North’s institutional theory, governments shape institutional environments for EV development through coercive policy instruments (e.g., the EU’s 2035 internal combustion engine vehicle ban) and incentive-based policy tools (Sheldon and Tamara, 2022; Zhang et al., 2023; Jia et al., 2023). On the one hand, the government’s support and encouragement policies for EVs, including financial subsidies, tax incentives, and preferential electricity prices, have directly facilitated the research, development, production, and sales of EVs (Liu et al., 2021). On the other hand, the government has standardized the development of the EV industry by formulating relevant regulations and standards, providing legal support for the popularization of EVs (Yuan et al., 2015). Furthermore, the development of EVs requires corresponding infrastructure support, including charging stations and battery swapping stations (Fan et al., 2023). The government plays a pivotal role in advancing the construction of related infrastructure.

Competitive dynamics of firms

On the basis of the theory of resources and capabilities, supply-chain actors and automakers jointly shape the competitive landscape and evolutionary trajectory of the EV industry (Shang et al., 2025). In terms of enterprises, various supply-chain enterprisers and automobile enterprisers have jointly shaped the competitive landscape and development trends of the EV industry. First, capital serves as the foundation for enterprise development. Enterprises with strong capital resources are capable of rapidly carrying out research and development, production, and market promotion of EVs (Pei et al., 2023). Second, technological innovation capability is the core of competitiveness for EV enterprises. Enterprises possessing independent intellectual property rights and core technologies can occupy a favorable position in market competition (Grosjean et al., 2012). Third, enterprises should respond to the rapid changes in the EV industry on the basis of clear strategic planning and strong execution capabilities (Shi and Wang, 2024). Fourth, enterprises need to possess strong supply-chain management capabilities to ensure a stable supply of raw materials and components and reduce production costs (Benjamin et al., 2022; Ghorbani et al., 2024). Finally, enterprises need to have strong marketing capabilities, utilizing precise market positioning, effective marketing channels, and innovative marketing methods to enhance brand awareness and market share (Kumar and Revankar, 2017).

Market acceptance

On the basis of the technology acceptance model and diffusion of innovations theory, the adoption of EVs reflects dual influences from perceived usefulness (e.g., driving range) and perceived ease of use (e.g., charging convenience) in consumer decision-making (Kim and Cho, 2024). Discrete choice experiments by Fatah et al. (2024) revealed significantly higher price elasticity coefficients for EVs than for conventional vehicles, aligning with early adopter characteristics in the Bass diffusion model. Government procurement of EVs has positive spillover effects on private consumption through observational learning (Lin and Shi, 2024).

Growing environmental awareness and technological advancements are accelerating EV demand (Fatah et al., 2024; Lin and Shi, 2024). However, Bigerna et al. (2017a, 2017b) emphasized that green technology diffusion depends not only on performance but also on credible messaging and user-friendly payment schemes to lower behavioral barriers. Converting abstract environmental benefits into tangible economic value is critical for broader adoption. Thus, EV market demand is shaped by consumer perceptions, pricing, and key performance attributes (e.g., range).

Game theory in the EV industry

Evolutionary game theory (Hilbe et al., 2018; Zhao and Du, 2021) provides an integrated framework to analyze multiagent interactions—from microlevel technological adoption to macrolevel institutional design. In the EV sector, strategic equilibria emerge from dynamic interactions between technology pathways and policy incentives.

Supply-chain analyses demonstrate the critical role of policy interventions in market equilibrium. Under Stackelberg game frameworks, Ma et al. (2020) and Liu et al. (2024) revealed how subsidies interact with strategic consumer behavior to shape pricing strategies and market shares between EVs and conventional vehicles, highlighting the tension between policy optimization and corporate competition. Cao et al. (2021) extended this via dynamic game theory, showing that sustainable EV markets require not only short-term subsidies but also long-term incentives (e.g., R&D competition, infrastructure investment, and ecosystem coevolution). Trencher et al. (2021)‘s cross-national comparison further underscored that successful EV adoption relies on industrial ecosystem development, technical standardization, and market cultivation—not just fiscal incentives. Collectively, these studies emphasize dynamic equilibria among policymakers, firms, and consumers as the linchpin of industry evolution.

Above all, the development of the EV industry has garnered significant attention. Extensive and in-depth research has been conducted on its development path, influencing factors, and future strategies, yielding fruitful results. However, the existing literature has focused primarily on the current state of the development of the EV industry during the modeling process, predominantly using assignment methods in simulations. Compared with traditional industries, the development of the EV industry involves not only a complex feedback loop involving government promotion, automotive company profits, and market selection but also a synergistic effect of technological breakthroughs and industrial chain development. Furthermore, it is an important manifestation of emission reduction goals and the green economy. Therefore, this industry faces higher levels of uncertainty. To better depict the complex game dynamics of this industry, this paper selects a stochastic evolutionary game model with time delays, further considering the impact of time delays and carbon prices on the equilibrium state. Real data is used to describe and predict the behaviors and strategic choices of game participants in the development of the EV industry within a complex dynamic environment.

Research hypotheses and parameter settings

The EV industry is currently in its growth phase, having already passed the initial research and development and production stages. Competition among vehicle enterprisers is intensifying, with each company competing to launch EVs of superior quality. Accordingly, the strategic choice for vehicle enterprisers is no longer whether to produce traditional fuel vehicles or develop new energy vehicles, but whether to produce new energy vehicles under current technology or increase capital investment to achieve the upgrading and replacement of new energy vehicles. Consumers can choose to purchase traditional fuel vehicles or new energy vehicles currently available in the market.

To summarize the main methods, market-based measurement methods neglect dynamic policy–market feedback loops (Peng et al., 2025). However, path-dependence effects are quantified via replicator dynamics, which agent-based models struggle to parameterize empirically (Mahmoudi et al., 2024). Through their rigorous mathematical frameworks, game-theoretic models can transform the vague “development pathways” in industries into computable and predictable chains of strategic interactions, capturing key contradictions in industrial evolution (Li et al., 2024). Therefore, this paper employs such models to analyze the evolutionary trajectories of the EV industry across nations. The development of the EV industry involves three main entities: the government, EV enterprises, and consumers. All three entities are characterized by bounded rationality. Ideally, enterprisers can choose the type of new energy vehicle to produce, consumers are willing to purchase new energy vehicles, and the government promotes and supervises the research, development, and production of new energy vehicles through policy measures while also encouraging consumers to purchase such vehicles. Throughout this process, enterprisers adjust their high-quality new energy vehicle research and development strategies on the basis of short- and long-term benefits and costs, consumers adjust their new energy vehicle purchase strategies on the basis of price and utility, and the government adjusts its subsidy strategies on the basis of market conditions, costs, and policy objectives. The government, enterprises, and consumers engage in repeated games on the basis of their respective benefits and costs.

To analyze EV industry dynamics, this study develops a four-dimensional framework comprising economic, technological, behavioral, and institutional factors:

Economic dimension

Grounded in evolutionary economics, firm R&D decisions follow path-dependent cost‒benefit mechanisms. The key variables include subsidy-adjusted R&D costs and production cost differentials, capturing the “Red Queen effect” (Barnett and Hansen, 1996; Kamikawa and Brummer, 2024).

Technological dimension

Adopting dynamic technology diffusion theory, we measure premium pricing capability as the intensity of technological disruption.

Behavioral dimension

Per Hicksian compensated demand (Hicks, 1939), consumers minimize costs while maintaining utility, operationalized via price elasticity differentials.

Institutional dimension

Employing externality internalization theory, policy incentives (subsidies, tax credits) serve as the experimental lever.

In modeling the tripartite evolutionary game of EV industry development, incorporating time delays and stochastic elements is crucial for capturing real-world complexities. First, policy adjustments such as subsidy phase-outs and carbon emission allowance system revisions typically require 6-12 months for legislative review and corporate response before market impacts materialize. Technological conversion lags exist between R&D investments and product enhancement. Consumer adoption follows S-shaped diffusion curves influenced by social network effects. Second, significant uncertainties emerge from market fluctuations, technological breakthroughs, and implementation variances in subsidy policies. This study enhances conventional tripartite game models by integrating time‒delay differential equations and stochastic processes to better characterize the industry’s intricate dynamics.

On the basis of the above observations, basic assumptions are made before a three-party evolutionary game model is constructed.

Assumption 1: On the basis of the findings of Lim et al. (2022) and Li et al. (2023), the government benefits derived from the development of the EV industry can be systematically articulated as follows. Assuming that \({{E}}_{S}\) represents the expected revenue generated by the government’s strategy of subsidizing and supporting the EV industry, \({{\rm{E}}}_{{nS}}\) represents the expected revenue generated by the strategy of not supporting the EV industry. The government provides subsidies at a ratio of x, whereas the nonsubsidy ratio is \(1\,\mbox{-}{x}\). The government needs to bear the EV production subsidy \({E}_{1}\) and EV consumption subsidy \({E}_{2}\) and obtain government subsidies, including reputation, social benefits, and market order, with a total revenue of \({E}_{3}\), as well as the current social benefits of EV \({S}_{1}\) and the social benefits of high-quality EV \({S}_{2}\).

Assumption 2: On the basis of the research findings of Massiani (2015), enterprises can obtain profits in the EV industry as follows. Assume that \({{\rm{E}}}_{m}\) represents the expected revenue for enterprises choosing to develop and produce high-quality EVs, and that \({{\rm{E}}}_{{nm}}\) represents the revenue for those choosing not to develop and produce high-quality EVs (maintaining the current production of EVs). The proportion of enterprises choosing to develop and produce high-quality EVs is \(y\), whereas the proportion not choosing to develop is \(1-y\). Enterprises are responsible for bearing the research and development cost \({C}_{1}\) of high-quality EVs, the production cost \({C}_{2}\) of EVs under the current technological level, the production cost \({C}_{3}\) of traditional fuel vehicles, and the consumption taxes \({T}_{1}\) and \({T}_{2}\) on EVs and traditional fuel vehicles, respectively; they also obtain long-term sales revenue \({P}_{1}\) from high-quality EVs, revenue \({P}_{2}\) from EVs under the current technological level, sales revenue \({P}_{3}\) from traditional fuel vehicles, and government production subsidies \({E}_{1}\).

Assumption 3: On the basis of the research findings of Plötz et al. (2014) and Stekelberg and Vance (2024), the consumer benefits derived from the purchase of an EV can be systematically articulated as follows. Assume that \({E}_{o}\) represents the benefit of consumers choosing to purchase EVs and that \({E}_{{no}}\) represents the benefit of consumers choosing to purchase traditional fuel vehicles. The proportion of consumers choosing to purchase EVs is \(z\), whereas the proportion of those choosing not to purchase EVs but to purchase traditional fuel vehicles is \(1\,-\,z\). Consumers bear the selling prices of different types of vehicles, namely, \({P}_{1}\), \({P}_{2}\), and \({P}_{3}\), and obtain utilities \({U}_{1}\), \({U}_{2}\), and \({U}_{3}\) for purchasing fuel vehicles, EVs, and high-quality EVs, respectively.

Assumption 4: On the basis of the research findings of Fei et al. (2025), given that various countries (regions) have begun to incorporate carbon emissions into their respective markets, the carbon emission cost of traditional fuel vehicles is set to \({C}_{4}\). The specific settings of the main parameters in this paper are shown in Table 1.

where \({S}_{1} > {S}_{2} > {S}_{3}\), \({P}_{1}-{C}_{1}\, > \,{P}_{2}-{C}_{2}\), \({P}_{1}-{C}_{1}\, > \,{P}_{3}-{C}_{3}\), \({C}_{5} < 0\), \({U}_{4} < 0\), \({C}_{2} < {C}_{1}\), \({C}_{3} < {C}_{1}\), \({P}_{1} > {C}_{1}\), \({P}_{2} > {C}_{2}\), \({P}_{3} > {C}_{3}\), and all other parameters are nonnegative.

Stochastic evolutionary game model with time delay

On the basis of the parameter selection in section “Research hypotheses and parameter settings”, the government, enterprises and consumers obtain corresponding utilities by choosing any one of the strategies. By integrating the utility performance of different strategies, we obtain the utility function presented in Table 2.

On the basis of the utility function presented in Table 2, the replication dynamic equation for tripartite decision-making can be analyzed.

First, we analyze the replication dynamic equation of government decision-making.

Let \({{\rm{E}}}_{g}\) represent the average return of all strategies adopted by the government \({{\rm{E}}}_{{\rm{g}}}=x{{\rm{E}}}_{S}+(1-x)\,{{\rm{E}}}_{{nS}}\). After the calculation, the following equation is obtained:

$${{\rm{E}}}_{S}={yz}\left({S}_{1}+{S}_{2}+{T}_{1}-{E}_{1}-{E}_{2}+{E}_{3}\right)+y\left(1-z\right)\left({S}_{3}+{T}_{2}+{E}_{3}\right)+\left(1-y\right)z\left({S}_{2}+{T}_{1}-{E}_{1}-{E}_{2}+{E}_{3}\right)+\left(1-y\right)\left(1-z\right)\left({S}_{3}+{T}_{2}+{E}_{3}\right),$$

$${{\rm{E}}}_{{nS}}={yz}\left({S}_{1}+{S}_{2}+{T}_{1}\right)+\,y\left(1-z\right)\left({S}_{3}+{T}_{2}\right)+\left(1-y\right)z\left({S}_{2}+{T}_{1}\right)+\left(1-y\right)\left(1-z\right)({S}_{3}+{T}_{2}),$$

and the dynamic equation for government decision replication is as follows:

$$F\left(x\right)=\frac{{dx}}{{dt}}=x\left({{\rm{E}}}_{S}-{{\rm{E}}}_{g}\right)=x\left(1-x\right)\left({{\rm{E}}}_{S}-{{\rm{E}}}_{{nS}}\right)=x\left(1-x\right)\left[z\left(-{E}_{1}-{E}_{2}\right)+{E}_{3}\right]$$

(1)

Second, we analyze the replication dynamic equation of enterprise decision-making.

Let \({{\rm{E}}}_{b}\) represent the average revenue of the enterprise adopting all strategies \({{\rm{E}}}_{b}=y{{\rm{E}}}_{m}+(1-y){{\rm{E}}}_{{nm}}\). After the calculation, the following equation is obtained:

$$\begin{array}{l}{{\rm{E}}}_{m}={xz}\left({P}_{1}+{P}_{2}-{C}_{1}-{C}_{2}+{E}_{1}\right)+\,x\left(1-z\right)\left({C}_{5}+{P}_{3}-{C}_{3}\right)\\\qquad\quad+\,\left(1-x\right)z\left({P}_{1}+{P}_{2}-{C}_{1}-{C}_{2}\right)+\left(1-x\right)\left(1-z\right)({C}_{5}+{P}_{3}-{C}_{3})\end{array}$$

$$\begin{array}{l}{{\rm{E}}}_{{nm}}={xz}\left({P}_{2}-{C}_{2}+{E}_{1}\right)+\,x\left(1-z\right)\left({P}_{3}-{C}_{3}\right)\\\qquad\quad+\,\left(1-x\right)z\left({P}_{2}-{C}_{2}\right)+\left(1-x\right)\left(1-z\right)({P}_{3}-{C}_{3})\end{array}$$

and the dynamic equation for enterprise decision replication is as follows:

$$F\left(y\right)=\frac{{dy}}{{dt}}=\,y\left({{\rm{E}}}_{m}-{{\rm{E}}}_{b}\right)=y\left(1-y\right)\left({{\rm{E}}}_{m}-{{\rm{E}}}_{{nm}}\right)=y\left(1-y\right)\left[z\left({P}_{1}-{C}_{1}\right)+\left(1-z\right){C}_{5}\right]$$

(2)

Third, we analyze the replication dynamic equation of consumer decision-making.

Let \({{\rm{E}}}_{c}\) represent the average return of all strategies adopted by the consumer \({{\rm{E}}}_{c}=z{{\rm{E}}}_{o}+(1-z){{\rm{E}}}_{{no}}\). After the calculation, the following equation is obtained:

$$\begin{array}{l}{{\rm{E}}}_{o}={xy}\left({U}_{1}+{U}_{2}-{T}_{1}+{E}_{2}\right)+x\left(1-y\right)\left({U}_{2}-{T}_{1}+{E}_{2}\right)\\\qquad\,\,+\,\left(1-x\right)y\left({U}_{1}+{U}_{2}-{T}_{1}\right)+\left(1-x\right)(1-y)\left({U}_{2}-{T}_{1}\right)\end{array}$$

$$\begin{array}{l}{{\rm{E}}}_{{no}}={xy}\left({U}_{3}+{U}_{4}-{T}_{2}-{C}_{4}\right)+x\left(1-y\right)\left({U}_{3}-{T}_{2}-{C}_{4}\right)\\\qquad\quad+\,\left(1-x\right)y\left({U}_{3}+{U}_{4}-{T}_{2}-{C}_{4}\right)+\left(1-x\right)(1-y)\left({U}_{3}-{T}_{2}-{C}_{4}\right)\end{array}$$

and the dynamic equation for consumer decision replication is as follows:

$$\begin{array}{l}F\left(z\right)=\frac{{dz}}{{dt}}=z\left({{\rm{E}}}_{o}-{{\rm{E}}}_{c}\right)=z\left(1-z\right)\left({{\rm{E}}}_{o}-{{\rm{E}}}_{{no}}\right)\\\qquad\,\,=z\left(1-z\right)[y({U}_{1}-{U}_{4})+x{E}_{2}+{U}_{2}-{U}_{3}+{T}_{2}-{T}_{1}+{C}_{4}]\end{array}$$

(3)

On the basis of the general form of stochastic differential equations, this paper introduces Gaussian white noise into the replication dynamic equation of a three-party Itô stochastic evolutionary game, which represents the random perturbations in the game system as follows:

$${dx}\left(t\right)=\left[z\left(-{E}_{1}-{E}_{2}\right)+{E}_{3}\right]x\left(t\right)\left[1-x\left(t\right)\right]{dt}+\sigma x\left(t\right)\left[1-x\left(t\right)\right]d\omega \left(t\right)$$

(4)

$${dy}\left(t\right)=\left[z\left({P}_{1}-{C}_{1}\right)+\left(1-z\right){C}_{5}\right]y(t)\left[1-y(t)\right]{dt}+\sigma y(t)\left[1-y(t)\right]d\omega (t)$$

(5)

$$\begin{array}{l}{dz}\left(t\right)=[y({U}_{1}-{U}_{4})+x{E}_{2}+{U}_{2}{-U}_{3}+{T}_{2}-{T}_{1}{+C}_{4}]z(t)\left[1-z(t)\right]{dt}\\\qquad\qquad+\,\sigma z(t)\left[1-z(t)\right]d\omega (t)\end{array}$$

(6)

Since \(x\), \(y\), and \(z\) are all within the range of \([\mathrm{0,1}]\), \(1-x\), \(1-y\), and \(1-z\) are all nonnegative real numbers, which will not affect the evolutionary outcome of the final strategy.

This paper follows the approach of Xu et al. (2015) and modifies the traditional three-party game model in Eqs. (4) to (6) as follows:

$$\begin{array}{c}{dx}(t)=\left[z\left(-{E}_{1}-{E}_{2}\right)+{E}_{3}\right]x(t){dt}+\sigma x(t)d\omega (t)\\ {dy}\left(t\right)=\left[z\left({P}_{1}-{C}_{1}\right)+\left(1-z\right){C}_{5}\right]y(t){dt}+\sigma y(t)d\omega (t)\\ {dz}\left(t\right)=[y({U}_{1}-{U}_{4})+x{E}_{2}+{U}_{2}-{U}_{3}+{T}_{2}-{T}_{1}+{C}_{4}]z(t){dt}+\sigma z(t)d\omega (t)\end{array}$$

(7)

Among them, \(x(t)\), \(y(t)\), and \({z}(t)\) are all one-dimensional Itô stochastic differential equations. Here, \(\omega (t)\) denotes a one-dimensional standard Brownian motion, \(\omega (t)\sim N\left(0,t\right)\). \(d\omega (t)\) represents Gaussian white noise. When \({t} > \,0\) and its step size is \({h} > \,0\), its increment \(\Delta \omega \left(t\right)=\omega \left(t+h\right)-\omega (t)\) also follows a normal distribution \(N(0,\,h)\). \(\sigma\) denotes the intensity of a random disturbance, which is taken as a positive constant.

In Eq. (7), the decision-making of the game participants in the next step is solely dependent on the current situation. However, in reality, both parties in the game will make predictions on the basis of the cumulative experience of the game process; that is, the game participants will make predictions on the basis of the dynamic information of the opponent’s previous decisions. This process can be understood as the game participants having a lag effect on the opponent’s information. Assuming that among the three parties in the game, the government’s information lag to consumers is \({\tau }_{1}\), the enterprise’s information lag to consumers is \({\tau }_{2}\), the consumer’s information lag to the government is \({\tau }_{3}\), and the consumer’s information lag to the enterprise is \({\tau }_{4}\). Then, the stochastic evolutionary game model in this paper becomes a stochastic evolutionary game model with time delays, that is,

$$\begin{array}{c}\frac{{dx}(t)}{{dt}}=x\left[z\left(t-{\tau }_{1}\right)\left(-{E}_{1}-{E}_{2}\right)+{E}_{3}\right]+\sigma {xd}\omega (t)\\ \frac{{dy}(t)}{{dt}}=y\left[z\left(t-{\tau }_{2}\right)\left({P}_{1}-{C}_{1}\right)+\left(1-z\left(t-{\tau }_{2}\right)\right){C}_{5}\right]+\sigma {yd}\omega (t)\\ \frac{{dz}\left(t\right)}{{dt}}=z[y\left(t-{\tau }_{4}\right)({U}_{1}-{U}_{4})+x{\left(t-{\tau }_{3}\right)E}_{2}+{U}_{2}-{U}_{3}+{T}_{2}-{T}_{1}+{C}_{4}]+\sigma {zd}\omega (t)\end{array}$$

(8)

This model is also a time-delay system.

Model stability analysis

Let \(F(x)\,=\,0\), \(F(y)\,=\,0\), and \(F(z)\,=\,0\). This yields 8 equilibrium points for the evolutionary game system involving the government, car companies, and consumers to be analyzed: (0,0,0), (1,0,0), (0,1,0), (0,0,1), (1,1,0), (1,0,1), (0,1,1), and (1,1,1). The Jacobian matrix of the system can be obtained on the basis of the replication dynamic equations of the government, enterprises, and consumers.

$$\left(\begin{array}{ccc}\left(1-2x\right)[z\left(-{E}_{1}-{E}_{2}\right)+{E}_{3}] & 0 & x\left(1-x\right)\left(-{E}_{1}-{E}_{2}\right)\\ 0 & \left(1-2y\right)[z\left({P}_{1}-{C}_{1}\right)+\left(1-z\right){C}_{5}] & y\left(1-y\right)\left({P}_{1}-{C}_{1}-{C}_{5}\right)\\ z\left(1-z\right){E}_{2} & z\left(1-z\right)({U}_{1}-{U}_{4}) & \left(1-2z\right)[y({U}_{1}-{U}_{4})+x{E}_{2}+{U}_{2}-{U}_{3}+{T}_{2}-{T}_{1}+{C}_{4}]\end{array}\right)$$

(9)

According to Lyapunov’s stability criterion, the condition for determining the equilibrium point as a stable strategy is that the real part of the characteristic roots of the Jacobian matrix is less than zero. The eigenvalues corresponding to the equilibrium point and the stability determination are shown in Table 3.

As shown in Table 3, the evolutionary game in this paper has only one evolutionary equilibrium solution (1,1,1) that was ultimately established.

Compared with the deterministic evolutionary game model, the stochastic evolutionary game model can more accurately and realistically reflect the dynamic evolution process of strategic behaviors among the three groups. To this end, based on Eq. (8), random perturbation factors are added to obtain a stochastic evolutionary game model for the government–enterprise–consumer tripartite relationship in the development process of new energy vehicles. The stochastic replication dynamic equation of Eq. (8) can be seen that its form is a nonlinear Ito-type stochastic differential equation with Gaussian perturbations, requiring numerical solutions to approximate its analytical solutions. Let the general form of the Itô-type stochastic differential equation be

$${dx}\left(t\right)=f\left(t,x\left(t\right)\right){dt}+g\left(t,x\left(t\right)\right)d\omega \left(t\right)$$

(10)

where \(t\in \left[{t}_{0},T\right]\), \(x\left({t}_{0}\right)={x}_{0}\), and \({x}_{0}\in R\); \(\omega (t)\) is a standard one-dimensional Brownian motion following a normal distribution. Let the sampling frequency be \(s\), the initial time be \({t}_{0}\), and the nth sampling time be \({t}_{n}\)(\(n\in \left\{\mathrm{0,1},\ldots ,s\right\})\). The step size for discretizing this stochastic differential equation is \(h=\left(T-{t}_{0}\right)/s\), where \({t}_{n}={t}_{0}+{nh}\).

Using the stochastic Taylor series expansion of the above expression and applying the Euler method from the literature Kai and Gu (2022) for numerical simulation, we can truncate certain terms in the Taylor series expansion for numerical solution, thus obtaining the following:

$$x\left({t}_{n+1}\right)=x\left({t}_{n}\right)+{hf}\left(x\left({t}_{n}\right)\right)+\Delta {\omega }_{n}g\left(x\left({t}_{n}\right)\right)$$

(11)

According to the method described above, expanding the three equations in Eq. (8) yields the following:

$$\begin{array}{c}x({t}_{n+1})=x({t}_{n})+h{x}({t}_{n})\left[z\left(-{E}_{1}-{E}_{2}\right)+{E}_{3}\right]+\Delta {\omega }_{n}\sigma x({t}_{n})\\ y({t}_{n+1})=y({t}_{n})+h{y}({t}_{n})\left[z\left({P}_{1}-{C}_{1}\right)+\left(1-z\right){C}_{5}\right]+\Delta {\omega }_{n}\sigma y({t}_{n})\\ z({t}_{n+1})=z({t}_{n})+hz({t}_{n})\left[y({U}_{1}-{U}_{4})+x{E}_{2}+{U}_{2}-{U}_{3}+{T}_{2}-{T}_{1}+{C}_{4}\right]+\Delta {\omega }_{n}\sigma z({t}_{n})\end{array}$$

(12)

The evolutionary equilibrium solution in Eq. (8) can be solved iteratively through Equation (12).

For the evolutionary equilibrium solution existing in Eq. (8), the stability of the solution needs to be analyzed on the basis of the stability criterion theorem of stochastic differential equations. Assuming that there exists a function \(V\left(t,x\right)\) and positive constants \({c}_{1}\), \({c}_{2}\), such that \({c}_{1}{\left|x\right|}^{p}\le V\left(t,x\right)\le {c}_{2}{\left|x\right|}^{p}\), \(t\ge 0\). If there exists a positive constant \(\mu\) such that \({LV}\left(t,x\right)\le -\mu V\left(t,x\right)\) for \(t\ge 0\), then the zero-solution expectation matrix of the formula exhibits exponential stability, and the inequality \(E{\left|x\left(t,{x}_{0}\right)\right|}^{p}\le \left({c}_{2}/{c}_{1}\right){\left|{x}_{0}\right|}^{{p}_{e}-\mu t}\)(\(t\ge 0\)) holds.

Let \(V\left(t,x\right)=x\),\(V\left(t,y\right)=y\),\(V\left(t,z\right)=z\),\({c}_{1}={c}_{2}=1\), \(p=1\), and

$$\left\{\begin{array}{c}{LV}\left(t,x\right)=f\left(t,x\right)=x\left[z\left(-{E}_{1}-{E}_{2}\right)+{E}_{3}\right]\,\\ {LV}\left(t,y\right)=f\left(t,y\right)=y[z\left({P}_{1}-{C}_{1}\right)+\left(1-z\right){C}_{5}]\,\\ {LV}\left(t,z\right)=f\left(t,z\right)=z[{y(U}_{1}-{U}_{4})+x{E}_{2}+{U}_{2}{-U}_{3}+{T}_{2}-{T}_{1}{+C}_{4}]\end{array}\right.$$

(13)

If the zero-solution moment index of Eq. (13) is stable, it needs to satisfy the following:

$$\left\{\begin{array}{l}x\left[z\left(-{E}_{1}-{E}_{2}\right)+{E}_{3}\right]\le -x\,\\ y\left[z\left({P}_{1}-{C}_{1}\right)+\left(1-z\right){C}_{5}\right]\le -y\,\\ z[y({U}_{1}-{U}_{4})+x{E}_{2}+{U}_{2}-{U}_{3}+{T}_{2}-{T}_{1}+{C}_{4}]\le -z\end{array}\right.$$

(14)

If the zero-solution moment index of Eq. (13) is unstable, it needs to satisfy the following:

$$\left\{\begin{array}{l}x\left[z\left(-{E}_{1}-{E}_{2}\right)+{E}_{3}\right]\ge x\,\\ y\left[z\left({P}_{1}-{C}_{1}\right)+\left(1-z\right){C}_{5}\right]\ge y\,\\ z[y({U}_{1}-{U}_{4})+x{E}_{2}+{U}_{2}-{U}_{3}+{T}_{2}-{T}_{1}+{C}_{4}]\ge z\end{array}\right.$$

(15)

In this work, if Eq. (14) is satisfied during the three-party game process, it implies that as time progresses, the game participants tend to opt for affirmative strategies. Conversely, when Eq. (15) is satisfied, the game participants will ultimately choose negative strategies.

In section “Results and discussion”, the robustness of the time-delay stochastic evolutionary game model constructed in this paper can be tested via specific data.

Using the method in the section “Data sources and descriptions” and empirical market data, we identify EV industry development trajectories across countries/regions, quantify the impact of key determinants on these trajectories, and test the robustness of the proposed stochastic delay evolutionary game model.

EV industry development trajectories

The evolutionary game model requires solving equilibrium points through differential equation iterative algorithms. To mitigate matrix condition number deterioration and iterative divergence caused by extreme values, all raw data were normalized (converted to USD units and scaled down by a factor of 1000). Supplementary Table S1 details the processed dataset. Using Eq. (8) and these calibrated inputs, we derive country/region-specific EV industry development trajectories.

As shown in Fig. 1, in the development process of the EV industry, the U.S., China and the EU have the same trend during their stochastic evolutionary games. Specifically, the R&D strategy of enterprises first stabilizes, followed by consumer purchases, and then, government subsidies reach stability. This trend aligns with analytical solutions, ultimately stabilizing at the state of \(x(t)=1\), \(y(t)=1\), and \({z}(t)=1\). Although the evolutionary strategies and equilibrium points of the three countries (regions) tend to be consistent, the form and rate of evolution to the equilibrium point differ. First, in terms of government subsidies, although all countries (regions) choose to subsidize new energy vehicles, the time for their nonsubsidy strategy to evolve to an equilibrium strategy varies. The United States has the fastest rate of increase in new energy vehicle subsidies, taking approximately 5 times to evolve to an equilibrium state. Similarly, although the EU’s subsidy policy evolves 2 times later than that of the U.S., its initial evolution rate is similar to that of the U.S. China’s new energy vehicle subsidy strategy probability has increased at the slowest rate, with the longest evolution cycle. This result is directly related to China’s current highly competitive new energy vehicle market, the highest level of marketization, and the weaker influence of government subsidies. Second, in terms of consumers purchasing new energy vehicles, the evolutionary game strategies of China, the U.S., and the EU are similar. Although the advantages of fuel cost and oil vehicle price make American consumers less likely to purchase new energy vehicles in the short term, other advantages of new energy vehicles quickly compensate for the cost deficiency. Chinese consumers spend an average of 1.5 times in game time choosing to purchase new energy vehicles, whereas American and European consumers spend only 2 times making the same choice. Finally, in terms of whether enterprises develop high-quality new energy vehicles, the willingness to develop among enterprises in China, the U.S., and the EU is strong.

Japan’s EV development trajectory diverges markedly from those of China, the U.S., and the EU. While its government demonstrates the strongest subsidy commitment—achieving strategic equilibrium fastest—Japanese automakers exhibit weaker R&D commitment than their counterparts in those markets do, resulting in a longer time taken to reach a stable strategy. Moreover, the strategy for consumers to choose to purchase new energy vehicles requires a lengthy evolution period in Japan, and in the short term, Japanese consumers’ willingness to purchase new energy vehicles is very low. In summary, from the perspective of the consumer side, the evolutionary game paths of new energy vehicles in China, the U.S., and the EU are similar. This similar development path is a key reason for the excellent development of the new energy vehicle industry in China, the U.S., and the EU.

Analysis of the mechanisms influencing EV industry development pathways

Impact of information delays

Information lags distort game-theoretic outcomes by impairing firms’ R&D commitments, market positioning, consumer demand fulfillment, and supply-chain coordination efficiency while reducing policy adaptability. This subsection parameterizes these delays to explain cross-regional variations in EV industry trajectories.

Figure 2 demonstrates that information delays disproportionately prolong government subsidy equilibrium convergence. The solid trajectories (without delays) reach equilibrium faster than their dashed counterparts do (τ = 2). Across 100 evolutionary dynamics simulations, the U.S., China, and EU subsidy strategies exhibit 127% longer convergence versus the baseline under τ = 2, versus 68% and 54% delays for firms and consumers, respectively. Notably, Japan exhibits inverse dynamics: government subsidy convergence accelerates (blue dashed trajectory) despite firm (+39%) and consumer (+61%) response delays. This anomaly likely stems from Japan’s industry-centric policymaking, where incomplete information triggers oversubsidization traps—governments prioritize sustained EV competitiveness through irrational subsidies, diverging from consumer/firm responses.

Impact of carbon pricing

As carbon pricing mechanisms mature, their price signals reshape industrial ecosystems through production cost restructuring effects and shifts in market demand elasticity. While rising carbon costs amplify marginal costs for internal combustion vehicles, explicit environmental cost differentials alter consumer preferences. However, heterogeneous impacts emerge across countries due to variations in economic development levels, energy mix heterogeneity, policy environments, and EV industrial foundations. We empirically test these heterogeneous impacts on EV industry game-theoretic outcomes.

As shown in Fig. 3, on the one hand, an increase in the carbon price enhances consumers’ willingness to purchase new energy vehicles. With the rise in the carbon price, the evolutionary game cycle for consumers in various countries (regions) will be advanced. Compared with the stable evolution time of consumer strategies when carbon prices are stable and surge (tripling the carbon price), the increase in purchasing willingness among Chinese and EU consumers is most significant. The stable strategy for Chinese consumers to purchase new energy vehicles has evolved from a 2.7-times cycle when carbon prices are stable to less than 2.2 times, whereas for European consumers, the stable strategy has evolved from a 2-times cycle to less than 1.5 times, with both achieving stability 0.5 times earlier. In contrast, the willingness of Japanese consumers to purchase EVs is less affected by an increase in the carbon price.

The core mechanism hinges on carbon pricing dynamics. Price elasticity drives strategic interactions: Rising carbon prices amplify internal combustion vehicle operational costs (fuel, taxes) while enhancing EV competitiveness through stable, lower electricity costs. China’s coal-dominated power mix sustains electricity‒oil price differentials, intensifying consumer EV adoption incentives. Conversely, Japan’s low baseline carbon pricing weakens multiplier effects on EV purchase intent despite policy escalation.

Moreover, cross-country heterogeneity exists in the relationship between carbon price escalation rates and consumer adoption growth rates. In Japan, a 1% carbon price increase corresponds to a 1% acceleration in EV adoption rates, whereas other regions exhibit decoupled growth patterns between carbon pricing rates and adoption rates. This disparity arises from Japan’s comparatively low EV penetration, which diminishes the perceived cost impact of carbon pricing on conventional vehicle users, resulting in weaker consumer sensitivity to carbon price fluctuations relative to other markets.

Impact of subsidies

The impact of government subsidies on new energy vehicle enterprises and consumers is multifaceted. For enterprises, government subsidies reduce their production costs and R&D risks, enhancing the market competitiveness of EVs. For consumers, government subsidies lower the cost of purchasing vehicles, increasing their willingness to purchase new energy vehicles. However, similar to the impact of carbon pricing, the market effects of government subsidies vary across different countries (regions).

Figure 4 reveals that subsidy adjustments primarily influence consumers: consumption subsidies (e.g., purchase incentives) increase EV adoption intent, whereas production subsidies show limited efficacy in stimulating high-quality EV R&D among the U.S., China and EU manufacturers. A cross-regional 50% subsidy increase accelerates equilibrium convergence (red dashed vs. solid trajectories) but has weaker effects than does carbon pricing. This stems from the subsidy policies’ one-off transfers versus the carbon pricing’s persistent operational cost restructuring. As markets mature, carbon-driven cost differentials dominate consumer decisions, surpassing transient subsidy impacts.

The empirical results indicate that across all regions except Japan, equilibrium convergence rates under stable production subsidies (blue solid trajectories) align closely with subsidy escalation scenarios (blue dashed trajectories). This demonstrates the limited efficacy of production subsidies in accelerating high-quality EV R&D commitments or inducing equilibrium convergence acceleration. The reason for this is cost, which is crucial. Subsidies in various countries (regions) are one-time, while the impact of carbon prices is long-lasting. As the market matures and the use of new energy vehicles extends, the impact of carbon prices on consumers is significantly greater than that of government subsidies. On the other hand, rising production subsidies in various countries (regions) will neither stimulate an increase in enterprisers’ willingness to develop high-quality new energy EVs nor lead to an earlier arrival of the game equilibrium state. The reason for this is that production subsidies can directly reduce the production costs of new energy vehicles, allowing enterprisers to invest more funds into research and development activities while maintaining reasonable profits. However, it should be noted that in fierce market competition, technological innovation is crucial for enterprisers to increase their competitiveness and seize market opportunities. Moreover, the effectiveness of research and development lags behind, which is reflected in the time required for technological breakthroughs, the cycle needed for the transformation of research results, and the slow increase in market acceptance. Therefore, companies choosing to develop high-quality new energy EVs are all manifestations of their long-term adaptation to market competition, and production subsidies will not affect their research and development strategies for high-quality new energy EVs. In addition, unclearly targeted production subsidies may also distract enterprises’ resources and efforts from the research and development of high-quality new energy EVs, ultimately causing companies to abandon the research and development of high-quality new energy EVs. The results of this paper indicate that increasing subsidy levels will not change the strategic choices of companies in developing high-quality EVs. This result further verifies the conclusion of Zhao et al. (2024) that “government subsidies will hinder the high-quality research and development of EVs by companies”.

Robustness test

To validate the stability of the stochastic delay evolutionary model, we replicate the EV industry evolutionary game outcomes using U.S. empirical market data under a 1-time information lag (τ = 1), demonstrating model consistency across temporal parameterizations.

As shown in Fig. 5, both the stochastic evolutionary game model and the evolutionary game model with time delay exhibit evolutionary trends and convergence consistent with the standard evolutionary game model, with differences only in the evolutionary rate and stabilization time. The fluctuation in the rate of strategy changes caused by stochasticity is most pronounced during the consumer strategy selection game process, whereas the time delay has the most profound effect on the robustness of government strategies. Under the guidance of stochasticity, consumers may reach an equilibrium strategy for purchasing new energy vehicles earlier. Under the guidance of a time delay, the rate of enterprise R&D strategies is significantly higher than that of consumer new energy vehicle purchases and government subsidies, resulting in a shorter game time for the final stable state of R&D strategies. We can conclude that randomness does not change the outcome of the game, but affects only the rate during the game process; information delay does not change the outcome of the game, but affects only the game time. However, both randomness and time delay reflect the game process and do not affect the convergence of the final model. The evolutionary game model with time delay proposed in this paper is robust.

Conclusion

The development of the EV industry involves multiple aspects, such as technology, the market, policy, and infrastructure. When any country or region develops its EV industry, if there are shortcomings in policy, technology, the market, and infrastructure, its development of the EV industry will be affected. The results of this study indicate that the U.S., the EU, and China share strong similarities in terms of the development prospects of the EV industry. This similarity is attributed mainly to similar policy support, technological innovation, market demand, and cost control, to the extent that the governments of the three countries (regions) adopt the same strategies when facing information lag, consumers facing policy subsidy reductions, and enterprises facing market competition. Moreover, these similarities reflect the common trends and patterns of the development of the global EV industry, namely, policy support and promotion, technological innovation and iteration, market demand and growth, industrial chain collaboration and development, and low-carbon and sustainable development are the origins of promoting the continuous prosperity of the global EV industry. These findings align with those of Wu et al. (2021), Liu et al. (2023), Liu et al. (2024), and Nylund and Brem (2024) in identifying policy incentives, technological innovation cycles, market demand dynamics, supply-chain coordination, and low-carbon sustainability imperatives as foundational drivers of sustained growth of the EV industry.

In contrast, the development model of the EV industry in Japan tends to fluctuate between government-led and enterprise-led approaches. This is reflected in the intersection of EV research and development strategies and policy subsidy strategies during its stochastic evolutionary game, where the government’s subsidy reduction strategy is more rapid than that of enterprises. Considering the current development status of EVs in Japan, owing to Japan’s long-term focus on the research and development of hydrogen-powered vehicles in the field of new energy vehicles and its relatively lower investment in pure EVs and hybrid EVs, the lack of subsidy policies and the lag in the construction of charging infrastructure have caused Japanese automobile manufacturers to have a hesitant attitude about the EV revolution, preferring to continue the existing hybrid technology route. Moreover, although the development model of EVs in Japan is similar to that in China and the U.S., the price of EVs in Japan is still higher than that of traditional fuel vehicles, which inhibits consumers’ desire to purchase EVs and hinders the popularization of EVs.

The research results of this paper further show that information timeliness, the carbon price and subsidies are the core factors that affect the decision-making of relevant subjects in the EV industry.

First, information timeliness affects the strategic choice and duration of government subsidy policies. The more significant the information lag is, the longer the evolution cycle of the subsidy policy, and the weaker the government’s market regulation ability. Deng and Hao (2024) provided theoretical grounding: information lags induce policy inertia, where regulators extend existing policy cycles to minimize institutional adjustment costs from frequent revisions, systematically dampening market responsiveness.

Second, carbon prices affect consumers’ willingness to buy EVs. The higher the carbon price is, the shorter the time to reach the purchase intention of EVs. However, there is no obvious proportional relationship between the time when the purchase strategy is reached and the carbon price. The results of this study show that the time of consumers’ willingness to purchase EVs triggered by the quadruple carbon price is consistent with that triggered by the double carbon price. These empirical findings corroborate those of Bhat et al. (2025), who reported that carbon abatement policy implementation accelerated EV adoption rates.

Third, subsidies not only affect consumers’ EV purchase strategies but also affect enterprisers’ choice of high-quality EV R&D strategies, but the impact is limited. This finding corroborates Sun et al.’s (2019) conclusion that consumer subsidies outperform manufacturer subsidies in promoting EV adoption and technological breakthroughs. Furthermore, we demonstrate that while production and consumption subsidies temporarily increase consumers’ purchase intentions and manufacturers’ R&D incentives for high-quality EVs, they do not ultimately alter the equilibrium strategy outcomes for either party. Especially for EV enterprisers, in the current fierce market competition, the profits brought by high-quality new energy vehicles are not enough to offset the decline in profits brought by high R&D costs. Therefore, the profit and market share demand of enterprisers is higher than the R&D demand for high-quality EVs. It is difficult for production subsidies to promote the research and development of high-quality new energy and new energy vehicles.

Policy recommendations

Our findings reveal that convergent development pathways across China, the U.S. and the EU accelerate technology diffusion and cost reduction in the EV industry. However, achieving exponential economic growth through the “economies of scale-technological innovation-policy iteration” virtuous cycle requires addressing the following challenges.

First, the information lag of the government should be reduced. The market is the wind vane of industrial development, and changes in the market signal can reflect the supply and demand situation, competition situation and other important information of the industry. The EV industry is highly competitive, with a high market growth rate and fast technology update speed. Rapidly responding to market changes and technological progress, and formulating policies and measures that meet actual needs are highly important for industry development. If the government information lags behind, it may miss the best time for the introduction of the policy, resulting in a great discount on the effect of the policy. Therefore, when formulating a reasonable EV industry policy, we should first improve the timeliness of information, accurately understand the current situation of the industry in a timely manner and predict the development trend.

Second, carbon price tools can be reasonably used to improve the penetration of new energy vehicles. The use of a carbon price tool is a complex but important strategy to improve the penetration of new energy vehicles. The carbon price can provide a clear price signal to guide enterprises and consumers to transfer to low-carbon products (such as EVs). By increasing the cost of high-carbon products (such as traditional fuel vehicles), the relative price of low-carbon products can be reduced, and consumers can be encouraged to buy EVs. Moreover, we should optimize the allocation of resources, guide funds to the field of low-carbon technologies and products and promote the development of the EV industry. However, the factors influencing the carbon price are complex, and the requirements for policymaking are high. Therefore, a reasonable carbon price level should be formulated according to national conditions and actual industrial development. We should not only consider the affordability of enterprises but also ensure that carbon prices can play an effective incentive role.

Third, a precise subsidy policy and a perfect subsidy exit mechanism should be designed. In the current market-oriented global EV industry environment, government subsidies should avoid the traditional “flood irrigation” form, guide enterprises to strengthen technological innovation and product research and development and promote industrial transformation and upgrading through the precise positioning of subsidy objects, the refinement of subsidy standards and the innovation of subsidy means. First, subsidies should focus on EV enterprises and projects with technological innovation capabilities, broad market prospects and strong industrial chain operations. Second, differentiated subsidy standards should be formulated according to key performance indicators such as the EV range, energy consumption level and battery energy density. Third, in addition to direct subsidies, we can also consider various ways to support the development of the EV industry, such as tax relief, loan preferences, and charging facility construction subsidies. Third, the government should gradually reduce the subsidy standards and scope according to industrial development and market changes until it finally withdraws completely. However, it should be noted that the withdrawal of subsidies should be carried out in stages to avoid excessive impacts on the market caused by a one-time withdrawal. In the process of subsidy withdrawal, an effective market incentive mechanism should be established to encourage enterprises to rely on their own technical strengths and market competitiveness.

Despite the model’s attempt to simulate the consequences of EV development paths from a realistic perspective, there are inherent limitations. First, while the model captures dynamic strategy evolution, its probabilistic nature restricts precise prediction of the exact timing of stable equilibria, yielding only trend-based projections. Second, the simplified consumer decision rules inadequately represent heterogeneous preferences (e.g., brand loyalty, charging infrastructure concerns), potentially deviating from real-world market behaviors. Third, the aggregated data standards across countries/regions and the binary comparison between premium EVs and conventional vehicles overlook performance variations across price segments (e.g., economy vs. luxury EVs), limiting insights into submarket competition. Future research will enhance the model by integrating Bayesian networks to address nonlinear and abrupt influencing factors, improving practical simulation capabilities. We will also incorporate segmented cost data (low/mid/high-tier EVs) to examine heterogeneous carbon pricing impacts across consumer tiers.",https://media.springernature.com/m685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1057%2Fs41599-025-05342-5/MediaObjects/41599_2025_5342_Fig1_HTML.png,N,,2025-06-23 06:07:12.498888

“We already secured or are negotiating green energy agreements that would allow us to fulfill the 2030 targets,” said Meshali.
However, not all green energy could be sold abroad, as it would annul the local energy security imperative.
The consensus at the conference was that the government must reduce the cost of investing in green energy.
“It is time-consuming, which makes achieving Egypt’s energy transition challenging,” said Bishay.","For Egypt, transitioning from fossil fuels to clean, sustainable, renewable energy goes beyond protecting the environment or keeping up with investment trends. “Green energy is about energy security,” Ossama Bishay, Orascom Construction CEO, told AmCham Egypt’s April Investment Conference. “We don’t have fossil fuel self-sufficiency,” and continuing to import is unsustainable.

“Our main energy source needs to be renewables,” stressed Beshay, noting that Egypt has the natural resources for that transition. “Our wind energy is generated from one of the most efficient locations (the Red Sea coast), and we have the clearest sun rays in the world in the south.”

The key will be choosing business models that allow green energy investors to profit by ensuring affordable funding from abroad and reasonably priced at home.

Government vision

Egypt faces “multiple challenges to meet all [its] national energy needs,” said Sabah Meshali, deputy minister at the Ministry of Electricity and Renewable Energy, during the Investment Conference. “Most of those challenges revolve around securing fuel for our power plants.”

Overcoming those “challenges” requires shifting from fossil fuels to renewables. By 2030, 42% of Egypt’s electricity should come from renewables, up from 20% in 2022, the latest public statistic. “We already secured or are negotiating green energy agreements that would allow us to fulfill the 2030 targets,” said Meshali.

She estimated wind power output would increase from the current 2.5 gigawatts to 12 gigawatts by 2030, solar energy would go from 2.2 gigawatts to 7 gigawatts, and there would be 3.5 gigawatts of stored electricity generated during low-consumption periods. By 2040, more than 60% of Egypt’s electricity should come from renewables, Meshali said.

The government also wants to connect the national grid with Italy, Greece, and Saudi Arabia. “We are currently looking at supplying Italy with 3 gigawatts of clean energy and are in early talks with Greece,” Meshali said. “We should connect to Saudi Arabia’s power grid by the end of 2025.” However, there have been no reports of power-sharing negotiations or agreements.

The third part of the government’s plan is to reduce consumption of fossil fuels. “Since October, we have saved EGP 8 billion ($160.3 million) in spending on fossil fuels,” she said

The state also is updating and strengthening the national grid. “We have a strong one now, but we need more investment to accommodate additional supply from renewables,” said Meshali.

The problem is that “the law views the power grid as a matter of national security,” Meshali said. “Therefore, the government must own the grid. We are developing other investment options for the private sector.”

Increasing demand

A key attraction for the private sector to invest in green energy in Egypt is that “from a cash cost perspective, [solar and wind energy] are equal to fossil fuels if you exclude the subsidy and [unnatural] price fluctuations,” among other factors, according to Bishay of Orascom Construction.

Capitalizing on “cash-cost” parity should prove transformative for Egypt, as “there is serious and big FDI behind sustainable energy,” said Bishay. “Most of the [new] energy investors and [existing] local ones are international companies,” which means potentially big investment budgets.

Egypt is on the right path as “almost all [renewable energy projects] are done by the private sector,” he said. “So it is not straining the government’s budget. It is the most efficient way to achieve energy security.”

Fueling more need for clean energy is the growing demand for data centers, which cloud providers and AI require. “Egypt is well located to attract [such] investors,” said Reem El-Saady, deputy head of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) in Egypt. However, “it won’t be possible to invest in data centers if they aren’t green.”

Those opportunities bring risk. “Collections from the local market happen in local currency [which has been depreciating since 2022], while payment [to foreign green energy investors] is in dollars,” El-Saady said. Meshali estimates the government could pay “over $3 billion a year” to foreign investors.

Export opportunity?

Exporting sustainable energy would help balance government finances. However, not all green energy could be sold abroad, as it would annul the local energy security imperative. “Renewable energy should be used to meet local demand,” Khaled Abu Bakr, chairman of TAQA Arabia, said at the Investment Conference. “Green hydrogen is for exports.”

“Supply is not a major challenge,” he added, “as the government has allotted locations for projects and has an incentive program for production and transportation.” The challenge will be what markets will need green hydrogen and when.

Egypt’s primary green hydrogen market would be Europe, which is problematic. “Some are hesitant to transition, while others are eager,” Abu Bakr said. “That means energy transition timelines vary greatly, hurting short-term financing options. It is especially evident in green hydrogen.”

Infrastructure is another issue. “Stabilizing the [power] grid to accommodate the extra generated green energy is critical. [That includes] storage options in Egypt and the receiving countries,” said Yehia Shankir, CEO of Elsewedy Energy. “Greece, for example, doesn’t currently have the proper grid technology and capabilities to accommodate green energy.”

Regulatory alignment between importers and exporters is another issue. “There needs to be a task force comprising [buyers and sellers],” Shankir said. “Their work includes coordinating national energy objectives between both nations and payment processes.”

Green money

In Egypt, funding for environmentally friendly projects mostly happens under the Nowafy Program, a 2022 sustainability initiative under the Ministry of International Cooperation. The EBRD leads its energy pillar, coordinating with all development finance institutions (DFIs) in Egypt.

The allure of working under a government program is “it prevents duplicated efforts, and there is a higher level of coordination between the DFIs,” El-Saady noted.

Funding also is necessary for Egypt’s power grid. However, using traditional “loans from DFIs to governments to finance their national grid is not sustainable given Egypt’s high deficits and debt levels,” El-Saady said.

The solution the EBRD is considering is “blended finance,” where funds come from private and public (or philanthropic) sources. “It would take the shape of ‘soft loans’ [long-term, low-interest debt],” El-Saady said. “We are in the design phase with an international investment bank.”

Made in Egypt

Conference speakers agreed that local manufacturing of parts necessary for renewable and sustainable energy projects is critical to Egypt’s energy transformation.

The consensus at the conference was that the government must reduce the cost of investing in green energy. “Investors need to make money to come,” said Merette El Sayed, group chief commercial officer at Hassan Allam Holding, a developer. “Cheaper finance is at the forefront.”

Localization goes beyond hardware manufacturing, requiring the development and deployment of new technologies, like AI, in the power grid. “It is not a luxury. [AI has] a growing track record of predicting demand patterns, which is essential,” El Sayed stressed.

Shankir of Elsewedy Energy said Egypt could use a model similar to that of GCC countries, where they increase the localization percentage requirement for green energy projects over time. “Once their business cases proved profitable, massive clean energy manufacturing investments entered Gulf states,” he said.

The government also should reduce bureaucracy and complicated paperwork. “It is time-consuming, which makes achieving Egypt’s energy transition challenging,” said Bishay. A case in point was when Orascom Construction signed an MoU for a wind farm June 2022 and did not receive a plot of land until late 2024.

Ultimately, Bishay stressed the importance of investing in local R&D to support manufacturing localization, citing costly equipment like wind turbines. “Egypt can’t access the latest [international] technologies fast enough,” he said. “R&D will help us develop our own solutions.”

Tesla investor and social-media personality Sawyer Merritt posted videos on X showing him ordering and taking a ride to a nearby bar and restaurant, Frazier’s Long and Low, using a Tesla robotaxi app.

If Tesla succeeds with the small deployment, it still faces major challenges in delivering on Musk’s promises to scale up quickly in Austin and other cities, industry experts say.

It could take years or decades for Tesla and self-driving rivals, such as Alphabet’s Waymo, to fully develop a robotaxi industry, said Philip Koopman, a Carnegie Mellon University computer-engineering professor with expertise in autonomous-vehicle technology.

A successful Austin trial for Tesla, he said, would be “the end of the beginning, not the beginning of the end.”

Most of Tesla’s sky-high stock value now rests on its ability to deliver robotaxis and humanoid robots, according to many industry analysts. Tesla is by far the world’s most valuable automaker.

As Tesla’s robotaxi rollout date approached, Texas lawmakers moved to enact autonomous-vehicle rules. Texas Governor Greg Abbott, a Republican, on Friday signed legislation requiring a state permit to operate self-driving vehicles.

The law, which takes effect September 1, signals that state officials from both parties want the driverless-vehicle industry to proceed cautiously.

Tesla did not respond to requests for comment. The governor’s office declined to comment.

The company that once revolutionized electric vehicles with laptop batteries is now pivoting hard into full autonomy and AI-powered transportation, and the outcome is far from guaranteed.

According to a new report from The Wall Street Journal, Tesla has shifted its focus from refining proven technology to chasing unproven, futuristic ideas, namely fully self-driving cars. It’s a sharp departure from the company’s original success formula.

Tesla rose to prominence by rethinking how to use existing lithium-ion batteries in cars, beating out slower-moving competitors. Now it's entering a space where the technology is still in development and, in some ways, not fully functional.

Musk envisions a fleet of fully autonomous robotaxis dominating roads by 2026, according to The Cool Down.

Tesla's current Full Self-Driving (FSD) feature is a long way from that goal. It's been linked to federal investigations, public safety concerns, and disturbing footage of system failures, including test dummies being repeatedly struck during trials in Texas.

Critics describe FSD's current form as a ""glorified cruise control,"" which is a far cry from the no-hands, no-hassle vision Musk continues to promote. Still, the CEO is charging forward, aiming to retrain Tesla’s AI and expand into ride-hailing services, potentially cutting out human drivers while maximizing company profits.

If the gamble pays off, Tesla could redefine mobility once again. Autonomous vehicles could make transportation safer, cheaper, and more accessible.

However, if the tech falls short—either on safety, scalability, or regulatory acceptance—Tesla’s valuation could suffer a major blow. The company’s stock has already seen sharp swings in 2025, and another misstep could mean big issues.

There are also broader implications. Musk's robotaxi model raises ethical and economic concerns, especially for gig workers who depend on driving for income. Replacing them with AI fleets may boost efficiency, but it could deepen tensions over automation's role in the economy.

Tesla isn't pulling back—its rollout is already in motion. But whether this shift cements the company's future or exposes its limits will depend on more than Musk's confidence. For a brand built on calculated disruption, this might be the most unpredictable bet yet.",https://www.mensjournal.com/.image/ar_1.91%2Cc_fill%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Cg_faces:center%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MjE1ODAzMzQ1MTMzMTE4ODMx/tesla-motors-ceo-elon-musk-speaks-to-the-media.jpg,N,,2025-06-23 04:06:02.364305

The offshore wind industry will push forward.","I recently sat down with Kris Ohleth, Director of the Special Initiative on Offshore Wind, to discuss the challenges, opportunities, and progress in the US offshore wind market. It was a great and fascinating discussion of the US offshore wind industry, what it’s been going through in the paste decade or more, where it stands now, and what needs to be done to progress it in coming years. The podcast discussion complements our previous one with Susan Muller, a Senior Energy Analyst with the Union of Concerned Scientists (UCS), regarding the US offshore wind market and the benefits of offshore wind power.

Give the discussion a listen! You can listen to this podcast on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, SoundCloud, Overcast, Pocket, Podbean, Radio Public, or via the embedded YouTube or SoundCloud player below.

“Right now, the Trump administration is trying to increase the production of methane gas and other fossil fuels while dismantling clean energy sources — a strategy that may be good for the fossil fuel industry, but fails to address the real challenges facing America’s energy system,” Kris and her team wrote when reaching out for the podcast. “While heavy dependence on fossil fuels exposes consumers to price spikes from a volatile global market, technologies like offshore wind can help keep energy prices stable and support American energy independence. Ultimately, offshore wind is an opportunity to build up American energy infrastructure, boost our power supply, keep energy prices under control, create high-quality jobs and drive billions in investment, all while fighting climate change. These are real, important opportunities; it would be a mistake to waste them.”

Indeed. All true. Unfortunately, the US wind power market, especially the offshore wind power market, is on edge right now with the very anti–clean energy Trump White House in power. Here’s more from Kris and team on these matters:

Job security/economic impacts

Federal uncertainty and meddling places tens of thousands of jobs in the wind industry at risk, along with more than 400,000 clean energy jobs nationwide. The current administration’s energy policies have already stalled or led to the losses of over 40,000 jobs, including over 11,000 in the wind industry.

That’s not including the recent and unfair cleaving of over 4,000 federal employees, including around 800 at NOAA, who have been dedicated to the thorough review of offshore wind deployment and wildlife protection. We already know offshore wind will harness utility-scale, zero-carbon, homegrown generation and with it a reduction in public health harms from airborne particulate matter and a reduction on consumer electricity and gas bills.

Renewables made up over 90% of new resources added to the grid last year. With energy demand projected to rise nationwide, stifling renewable deployment will worsen supply shortfalls while supply chain, infrastructure and transmission bottlenecks delay new fossil fuel plants.

Offshore wind and other clean energy investments strengthen American manufacturing and make our electricity more independent and reliable. There are already nearly 2,000 offshore wind supply chain contracts in place across 40 states.

Embracing OSW means that less nonvariable, fossil fuel generation capacity like methane gas is needed.

On top of all its advantages for the energy system, more offshore wind would also bring a lot of other benefits to our communities. The offshore wind industry is already driving billions of dollars in investments in the U.S., supporting high-quality jobs in everything from manufacturing and construction to ship-building, and helps reduce air pollution and fight climate change to boot.

There are strong tailwinds when it comes to the consumer and policymaker perspective on the technology.

Investment: An estimated $25 billion has been invested into the U.S. offshore wind ecosystem, including in manufacturing, ports, vessels, and workforce development.

Deployment: American Clean Power analysis (March 2025): the U.S. deployed 49 GW of clean energy capacity—a third more than the prior year—with 40 GW of on- and offshore wind energy in the pipeline.

Reliability: New demand is anticipated, and a great mismatch between how quickly new electricity loads (such as factories or data centers) can be connected to the grid, and the longer timelines required for adding new power generation and transmission lines to serve that load. The offshore wind industry has matured over the past few Presidential administrations, and the good news is that the technology can be swiftly deployed in those sites that are permitted and approved, to meet this enormous need.

The offshore wind industry will push forward. Stay tuned to keep an eye on how it progresses, and to not miss out on any huge milestones in the burgeoning industry.",https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Kris-Ohleth-CleanTechnica-CleanTech-Talk-Podcast.png,N,,2025-06-23 09:09:52.360223

The measure will substantially decrease the chances of North Carolina imposing a regulation for which compliance costs exceed the potential health or safety benefits.
Occupational licensing is an area where North Carolina still has much room for improvement.
Regulatory reform will help take North Carolina to the next level.","Fiscal negotiations between the North Carolina House and Senate appear to have stalled out for now, with the two chambers too far apart on the timing and magnitude of future tax cuts to strike a budget deal before the July 1 start of the 2025-26 fiscal year.

But that doesn’t mean nothing of consequence is happening on Raleigh’s Jones Street. For more than a decade, state lawmakers have used both fiscal and regulatory policy to make North Carolina a more attractive place to live, work, invest, and do business. Over the past couple of weeks, the General Assembly has continued this important work by advancing several critical reforms.

On June 19, the legislature gave final approval to Senate Bill 266, the Power Bill Reduction Act. It eliminates the requirement that North Carolina households and businesses meet an interim carbon-reductions goal by 2030, even as it retains the target of achieving net-zero emissions by 2050.

The 2030 target wasn’t going to be met, at least not without drastic measures that would have sent energy prices skyrocketing.

“Our residents shouldn’t be saddled with higher power bills to satisfy arbitrary targets,” said Senate leader Phil Berger, R-Rockingham. “Senate Bill 266 ensures that North Carolina will have reliable energy at competitive prices to serve our citizens and businesses.”

The legislation also changes the way electrical utilities operating in the state (primarily Duke Energy) finance new power plants, which will at least modestly reduce their construction costs.

On the same day, the General Assembly sent House Bill 401, North Carolina’s version of a REINS Act, to Gov. Josh Stein. I hope he either signs it or allows it to become law without his signature.

REINS stands for “Regulations from the Executive in Need of Scrutiny.” The bill requires that any proposed rule with an economic cost of $20 million or more over five years must receive direct approval from the General Assembly. At the administrative level, rules costing more than $10 million would require unanimous approval by the rulemaking agency and those exceeding $1 million would require a two-thirds supermajority. Only rules mandated by the federal government would be exempt.

The measure will substantially decrease the chances of North Carolina imposing a regulation for which compliance costs exceed the potential health or safety benefits. It also strengthens the constitutional separation of powers, as Jon Sanders — director of the John Locke Foundation’s Center for Food, Power, and Life — explained in a recent piece.

“Agencies can create law-like rules only with deferred lawmaking authority from the legislature,” he wrote. “This delegated power is supposed to be limited to accomplishing an objective in legislation. Unfortunately, thanks to the vast difference between passing laws and creating rules, agencies can easily exceed their authority.”

With regard to the labor market, the Senate Rules Committee approved House Bill 763, the Neighbor State License Recognition Act. As the title suggests, the legislation would make it easier for individuals already licensed in Georgia, South Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia, or West Virginia to relocate and work in the Tar Heel State.

“If you’re an occupational license holder in one of these five states, and you establish residency in North Carolina, instead of going through the hurdles to get that occupational license, this would grant you an automatic license,” said state Sen. Tim Moffitt, R-Henderson.

Occupational licensing is an area where North Carolina still has much room for improvement. We currently license more occupations than do all but 10 other states in the country. These regulations raise consumer prices as much as 16% and reduce employment by a net of about 42,500 jobs, according to a recent John Locke Foundation study. Reciprocity will make our labor markets freer and more dynamic.

Although our state’s gross domestic product grew by an inflation-adjusted 17% over the past five years — faster than all but seven other states in the country — we can’t afford to rest on our laurels. Regulatory reform will help take North Carolina to the next level.",https://www.carolinajournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/timmoffitt-041025-768x432.jpeg,N,,2025-06-23 03:02:04.753181

With regard to the current volatility around global trade, Dr. Amit Paithankar, whole-time director and CEO of Waaree Energies, stated, ""We're not waiting for the dust to settle.""

Waaree has taken a proactive approach to invest in America's solar energy future. The company announced that it will invest an additional $200 million in U.S. energy storage, raising its total U.S. investment in solar to $1.2 billion.

Waaree cites market potential as a major reason for the investment.

The company understands that installing solar panels can bring household energy usage costs down and may even eliminate costs completely.

As the solar industry expands, both individuals and manufacturers are benefiting from the cost savings that installing solar panels can bring, as well as the environmental benefits of this clean energy source. Even individuals who are not able to install rooftop solar panels for financial or practical reasons can take advantage of community solar programs and have a positive impact on the environment.

Solar energy is becoming more accessible and affordable due to companies like EnergySage, which offers an easy tool to compare solar installers, potentially saving homeowners up to $10,000 on installation.

Due to the upfront investment, installing solar panels may not be for everyone, which makes leasing solar panels a great alternative for people looking to avoid high energy prices while benefiting the planet. Palmetto's LightReach solar panel leasing program, for example, will install solar panels for no money down.

Waaree's continued investment in the U.S. solar market is not only benefiting the planet; it is also expected to bring an additional 300 to 500 jobs to Texas, in addition to the 1,500 new jobs that were already announced.

Waaree is drawn to the U.S. because of the massive energy demand by both companies and homeowners, recognizing that solar is the cheapest source of power that can be scaled quickly.

If the current expansion plans come to fruition, Waaree's Texas facility will be one of the largest solar panel factories in the U.S.

In this article, the authors review the Trump administration's recent efforts with respect to the critical minerals industry that may be the kick-start the U.S. critical minerals sector needs to strengthen the supply chain and build domestic resiliency.

Those in the critical minerals industry have been waiting to see what President Donald Trump's next move would be after his ""Unleashing American Energy"" executive order on January 20, 2025 (the January Executive Order),1 the recent executive order launching the 232 investigation to determine the effect that copper imports have on national security,2 and the potential 25% proposed copper tariff on copper imports.

Then, on March 20, two months after the January executive order, the White House released a new executive order, ""Immediate Measures to Increase American Mineral Production"" (the EO),3 leaving no doubt about President Trump's plans (and ability) to spur domestic critical mineral production and reduce reliance on foreign critical minerals and processing capabilities. Importantly, the EO requires immediate action to ""facilitate domestic mineral production to the maximum possible extent.""

The first major item to note is that the EO confirms what industry players have been demanding for several years; the EO includes copper as a ""mineral"" and supports the development of US copper projects. Those following this topic will be aware that copper was not deemed a ""critical mineral"" by the Secretary of the Interior in its 2022 Critical Mineral List,4 and was only deemed a ""critical material"" by the Department of Energy in 2023. Because copper is so vital to the energy infrastructure and energy technology, this inclusion by President Trump is critical when focusing on U.S. mineral production and supply chain resiliency.

This EO also defined ""mineral"" to include ""a critical mineral, as defined by 30 U.S.C. 1606(a)(3), as well as includes uranium, copper, potash, gold, and any other element, compound or material as determined by the chair of the National Energy Dominance Council (NEDC)."" The EO specifically identifies uranium, potash, and gold as minerals, which were all excluded from the 2022 Critical Mineral List.

Also, this definition of ""mineral"" allows the Trump administration flexibility in determining which minerals are included under the act as the chair of the NEDC or the Secretary of the Interior (using power under 30 U.S.C. 1606(c)) can determine which mineral productions should be increased.

Notably, despite the inclusion of copper, gold, potash, and uranium as ""minerals"" under the EO, the EO does not amend the Secretary of the Interior's 2022 Critical Mineral List to include these additional minerals as ""critical minerals"" thereunder, nor does it allow for these minerals to otherwise qualify for eligibility under Section 45X of the Internal Revenue Code (a means by which critical mineral producers and others in the critical mineral space can monetize tax credits for certain eligible components).

The EO also defined ""mineral production"" as ""the mining, processing, refining, and smelting of minerals, and the production of processed critical minerals and other derivative products."" This broad definition of mineral production suggests that the Trump administration intends to increase and support mining at all stages, from the extraction phase – which was not supported under the Inflation Reduction Act until October of 2024 – to the refining and smelting phases, processes in which the United States is severely lacking. CREATIN

CREATING PRIORITY PROJECTS LISTS

The Trump administration instructed the head of each executive department and agency involved in the permitting of mineral production in the United States to provide, within 10 days of the EO, a list of all mineral production projects for which a plan of operation, permit application, or other application for approval has been submitted to that agency. 10 days after these first lists are submitted, those same agency heads must work with the chair of the NEDC to make a ""priority list of projects,"" and must take all necessary or appropriate actions to expedite and issue the relevant permits or approvals.

15 days later, the chair of the NEDC must submit, to the executive director of the Permitting Council, mining projects for consideration to the FAST-41 program for expedited and transparent permitting review and approval.

FAST-41 project timelines for such project must be set forth by no later than 15 days after getting such initial list. Currently, there is only one mining project in the FAST-41 program, as it has been argued that the program's requirements for public transparency with a mining project's plans and operations discourages participation. It will be interesting to see if this new process required by this EO will encourage more participation.

While the need for efficiency and expediency with the U.S. permitting timelines is long overdue, it is unclear if these federal agencies and departments can produce these lists and ramp up their approval processes so quickly. Perhaps this is a step in the right direction to encourage that process. Finally, the EO also requested industry feedback on regulatory bottlenecks and other strategies for expediting domestic mineral production.

ADDRESSING THE MINING ACT OF 1872

The Trump administration is also proposing to address the Mining Act of 1872, by requiring recommendations to clarify the treatment of waste rock, tailings, and mine waste disposal under the Act.

LOCATING FEDERAL LAND FOR NEW LAND MINERAL PROJECTS

By no later than 10 days after the EO, the Secretary of the Interior must provide a list of all Federal lands known to currently hold mineral deposits and reserves, and then the Secretary of the Interior shall designate the mining of these minerals the primary use of such lands, and any related land use plans under the Federal Land Policy and Management Act for these designated lands shall be amended or revised if necessary, so that the intent of the EO can be carried out on such lands.

Further, the Secretary of Defense, Secretary of the Interior, Secretary of Agriculture, and Secretary of Energy are, required to, within 30 days of the EO, identify sites on federal land that may be suitable for leasing or development for the construction and operation of critical mineral projects. These sites on which these projects could be fully permitted and operational as soon as possible are to be prioritized. The EO also requires these agencies to enter into extended-use leases with private entities to advance the installation of commercial mineral production enterprises on the lands identified.5 The Trump administration has also instructed agencies that provide financing or capital assistance to mining companies or their project sponsors to ensure favorable terms and conditions for these parties entering into mineral production leases.

FINANCING OF DOMESTIC MINING PROJECTS

The Secretary of Defense has been granted the president's authority under the Defense Production Act Section 303 – which is generally used for defense needs – and the Secretary of Defense (and in consultation with the Secretary of Energy, the Secretary of the Interior and others), can use this authority to progress the advancement of domestic critical mineral production for strategic resources. The Secretary of Defense shall also focus on pairing providers of private capital with mining companies.

Agencies empowered to make loans, equity investments, grants, etc. are instructed to rescind policies6 that require applicants to include disclosures required by Regulation S-K part 1300. The Trump administration has also waived the requirements of 50 U.S.C. 4531(d)(1)(a)(ii), 4332(d)(1)(B), and 4553(a)(1)-(a)(6). President Trump has also delegated to the chief executive officer of the United States International Development Finance Corporation certain authority of the president under the Defense Production Act.

Finally, the EO also requires that, within 30 days:

The DFC and the Secretary of Defense develop a proposal for a dedicated mineral production fund for domestic investments;

The Export-Import Bank release a program for the use of mineral production financing tools to support domestic mineral production and to secure the United States' offtake of foreign raw minerals; and

The Assistant Secretary of Defense for Industrial Base Policy is tasked with organizing mineral buyers and establishing a system for bids from critical mineral producers to supply the minerals.

The EO implements several rapidly approaching deadlines on various governmental agency heads showing that the Trump administration is highly prioritizing the domestic production of critical minerals. These requirements aim to expedite the domestic permitting process, expand the scope of minerals and types of mining processes for those critical to energy security, remove bottlenecks and barriers for the projects, and support government and private capital into the critical minerals market. It is clear the programs and timelines set forth by the Trump administration are aggressive, but it may be the kick-start the U.S. critical minerals sector needs to strengthen the supply chain and build domestic resiliency.

,Indiana American Energy ,2025-06-23 05:01:20+00:00,Mail Online,American energy expert's brutal message to Anthony Albanese's government - Daily Mail,"Sarah Brookes, www.facebook.com",,,,,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14836931/Robert-Bryce-Australia.html,"An American energy expert has delivered a blistering verdict on Australia's energy policy, describing it as 'baffling' and potentially disastrous for the nation's economy.
'You export three times more natural gas in the form of LNG than you consume, and you won't drill for gas.
Australia's net zero policy aimed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to virtually zero by 2050 through a transition to renewables, storage, and gas-backup.
'Even if you're not serious about climate change - natural gas to nuclear is the way forward.'
Mr Bryce said countries around the world were looking to nuclear energy, including Poland, France and Germany.","An American energy expert has delivered a blistering verdict on Australia's energy policy, describing it as 'baffling' and potentially disastrous for the nation's economy.

During an interview with Peta Credlin, veteran energy analyst Robert Bryce, who is on a sold-out national tour to blow the lid off the true cost of net zero, said the policy was destroying Australia's economic future.

'What is wrong with you Australians? You have natural resources that are the envy of the rest of the world,' he said.

'You're the Saudi Arabia of the Southern Hemisphere, you export seven times more coal than you consume and yet you don't want to burn coal.

'You have nearly 30 per cent of the world's uranium and you won't build nuclear reactors.

'You export three times more natural gas in the form of LNG than you consume, and you won't drill for gas.

'I've got no dog in this fight, but it just is incredible to see how bad the policy is here in such a resource-rich country.'

Australia's net zero policy aimed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to virtually zero by 2050 through a transition to renewables, storage, and gas-backup.

Mr Bryce warned that Australia's push toward net‑zero was placing a heavy economic strain on ordinary households, as soaring power prices ripple through the economy, driving up costs in key industries and inflating prices for everything from construction to groceries.

He said earlier this month Victoria used 13 per cent of its gas in three days after alternative energy sources failed to produce the level of energy required to power the state.

'How many warnings do you need before your policymakers wake up and smell the coffee?' he said.

'Even if you're not serious about climate change - natural gas to nuclear is the way forward.'

Mr Bryce said countries around the world were looking to nuclear energy, including Poland, France and Germany.

'There's more energy realism in the rest of the world, and unfortunately, for some reason, it hasn't come all the way down under yet,' he said.

'Again, I want the best for Australia. I've got no dog in this fight, but it just is incredible to see how bad the policy is here in such a resource-rich country.'

Power bill increases of more than nine per cent have been locked in for some Australian households from July 1, with high demand and network outages blamed for the steep wholesale prices feeding into higher retail prices, along with low levels of renewable energy as Australian governments try to phase out coal-fired power stations.

Meanwhile, there was a grim warning last week from the boss of Transgrid, Australia's largest electricity transmission provider, that the nation's power grid was dangerously light and needed back-up buffers like coal.

Chief executive Brett Redman told The Australian newspaper it was time to prioritise putting more buffer back into the system.

'We've really stripped the system very, very thin,' he said.

'The probability of more and more, say, failures of units and coal fired generators or unforeseen weather events, you name it, it's going to happen.

'On those days where things go wrong, no one's going to want to hear explained to them how statistically, that seemed very unlikely... even as people are taking cold showers.'",https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/06/23/02/99622747-0-image-a-7_1750640692388.jpg,N,,2025-06-23 04:05:53.719340

“Due to policy and market uncertainty, we are pausing construction at our South Carolina facility at this time,” AESC said in a recent statement.
South Carolina Gov.
The company had earlier scaled back plans to build two plants in South Carolina, saying one would suffice to meet BMW’s projected demand.
Despite AESC’s construction pause, BMW confirmed it will proceed with the opening of its $700 million battery assembly plant in Woodruff, South Carolina, by 2026.","Faced with shifting US policy and trade risks, AESC — a Japan-based battery maker majority-owned by China’s Envision Group — has paused its $1.6 billion battery cell factory project in South Carolina, originally intended to supply BMW electric vehicles.

The move underscores Korean battery firms as potential alternatives for the German automaker, given their accelerated push to expand US-based production.

“Due to policy and market uncertainty, we are pausing construction at our South Carolina facility at this time,” AESC said in a recent statement. While no timeline was given, the company said it would “resume construction once circumstances stabilize” and reiterated its pledge to invest $1.6 billion and create 1,600 jobs.

South Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster noted that AESC is navigating potential fallout from the loss of federal EV subsidies and tax incentives, as well as tariff risks linked to US President Donald Trump’s return to power.

AESC said it has already invested $1 billion in the Florence facility — its second US production site after an ongoing project in Kentucky. The company had earlier scaled back plans to build two plants in South Carolina, saying one would suffice to meet BMW’s projected demand.

Despite AESC’s construction pause, BMW confirmed it will proceed with the opening of its $700 million battery assembly plant in Woodruff, South Carolina, by 2026. The automaker had originally planned to use AESC’s 46-series cylindrical cells — 46 millimeters in diameter — in its next-generation EV lineup, including the “BMW Vision Neue Klasse.” By 2030, BMW aims to produce at least six all-electric models in the US.

Industry insiders say the disruption in AESC’s US supply could open doors for Korean battery makers. Among them, Samsung SDI began supplying the larger cylindrical batteries to a US carmaker for the first time in March. LG Energy Solution is set to begin mass production in the latter half of this year, while SK On has completed its development process.

“AESC, acquired by Hong Kong’s Envision Group in 2018, managed to bypass US trade barriers targeting the Chinese EV supply chain due to its Japanese origins,” said Park Cheol-wan, an automotive engineering professor at Seojeong University. “Its pause could signal a cautious approach amid trade tensions — or a strategic pullback by BMW in its US EV plans.”

Yang Min-ho, an energy engineering professor at Dankook University, noted, “Given BMW’s commitment to the US market and the likelihood that it will need to expand local production under Trump’s protectionist trade stance, the automaker will likely seek to fill the gap in its battery supply chain.”

He added that BMW could turn to LG Energy Solution or SK On, both of which have US production sites and carry less tariff risk. As of June, LG Energy Solution and SK On are operating or building seven and four facilities, respectively, in North America, including joint ventures with major automakers.

Before the Trump administration’s shifting tariff policies targeting both allies and adversaries, BMW’s US EV strategy relied on importing vehicles assembled in Europe — primarily Germany — while ramping up its production capacity in North America.

BMW’s key battery suppliers in Europe, Samsung SDI and China’s CATL, signed long-term contracts in 2019 extending through 2031. These deals played a crucial role in BMW’s European EV push and allowed the automaker to allocate part of its European output to the US.

Meanwhile, BMW had also looked to cost-competitive battery producers like AESC for US supply. But after facing a 27.5 percent tariff on passenger cars imported from EU countries, the company has been under growing pressure to increase domestic production.

German Chancellor Friedrich Merz recently announced plans to offset US tariffs by equalizing the value of automobile trade. The proposal would allow duty-free imports of US-made cars into Germany in exchange for equivalent tariff waivers on German cars shipped to the US.

However, based on the recent US–UK tariff arrangement — which limits 10 percent tariffs to just 100,000 vehicles from the UK — Germany’s roughly 400,000 annual car exports to the US may only benefit from partial tariff relief.

“Even though Germany has more at stake than the UK, Trump is unlikely to offer full waivers on German cars,” said Yang.

Why it matters: More clean energy projects could follow if the Senate's version of the reconciliation bill passes.

The Senate draft bill would slash tax credits for EVs, solar rooftops, utility solar and wind, leading to more manufacturers pulling back.

Zoom in: A report from research group E2 said that the year's cancelled factories and projects would have created nearly 12,000 jobs.

The May cancellations included Cleveland-Cliff's plan to convert a West Virginia factory to make electric transformers, OneD Battery Science's planned pilot facility in Washington, GM's designs for an EV factory in New York, and Meyer Burger's planned solar modular factory in Arizona.

The cancelled projects also included battery recycling company Li-Cycle's development of plants in New York, Arizona and Alabama.

Stunning stat: Republican districts accounted for more than 9,000 of those jobs and $9 billion of the $15.5 billion total.

The intrigue: Rivian, GTI Energy, Prolec GE Waukesha and Damera were among companies that announced nearly $450 million in new investments for solar, grid and EV factories in May, but those fell well short of offsetting the losses.

The big picture: The surge in cancellations this year versus the previous two years came as manufacturers responded to the Trump administration's pivot from low-carbon energy.

But the new permit application seems to show that the developer, Delaware River Partners, still wants to build the terminal.
Under the Trump administration, federal agencies including the EPA, Fish & Wildlife Service and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration have lost many long-time employees, and with them institutional knowledge that is hard to replace, the source said.
The Trump administration has not made its intentions clear on the future of fracking in the watershed.","On June 11, all four states represented by the Delaware River Basin Commission approved a plan by the agency’s federal member, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, to end any future funding for programs on diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI), and climate change.

For the Trump administration’s critics, the resolution was the latest sign of the shifting role of the federal government in the watershed’s management and the Trump administration’s push to promote fossil fuels, dismantling environmental protection, and attempting to deny climate change.

That the Army Corps, as a part of the Trump administration, should propose such a cut is less surprising than the unanimous agreement of the states — New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania and Delaware — to a plan that would fuel the federal government’s attacks on science in the Delaware River’s urban estuary and beyond.

“It was an appalling capitulation to the Trump Administration’s attempts to wipe out diversity, equity, and inclusion and to ignore the crisis we are all experiencing, including in the watershed, with climate change impacts,” said Tracy Carluccio, deputy director of Delaware Riverkeeper Network, an environmental nonprofit.

“Not only is it impossible to ignore the reality that our overburdened communities are suffering from environmental racism that must be corrected through actions and policies by the states and independent agencies like DRBC, it is ludicrous to pretend there isn’t a climate crisis that must be addressed,” Carluccio said.

The resolution said: “In recognition of policies of the current federal administration, from this point forward and for as long as these policies remain in effect, federal funds awarded hereafter to the Commission through the United States Army Corps of Engineers shall not be used directly or indirectly to support programs or policies that advance the principles of ‘diversity, equity, and inclusion’ or the concept of ‘climate change.’”

New political reality

The Delaware River Basin Commission is facing a new political reality since NJ Spotlight News explored the threats and promises of the watershed and its ecosystem in its “Water’s Edge” project in 2023.

At the time, the river’s urban estuary especially — running from Cape May to Trenton — faced profound threats both natural and human-caused, yet progress in addressing them was also evident. Now programs underpinning that progress are threatened by an administration in Washington seemingly bent on gutting such programs.

The commission’s vote for the federal funding cut earlier this month was the latest example of the threats. The vote came as somewhat of a surprise, as it was not on the meeting agenda ahead of time, fueling suspicions that the commission was seeking to hide the vote from public view.

“No agency should hide the proverbial football by having a resolution that is not publicly available ahead of the meeting,” said Doug O’Malley, director of the nonprofit Environment New Jersey, who attended the meeting. “There was no detail given until the actual vote occurred.”

Beth Brown, a spokeswoman for the commission, declined to say what the withdrawal of federal funding would mean for the agency’s policies on DEI and climate change, but she said the commissioners’ vote will mean the Army Corps continues to cooperate with the commission’s management of the region’s water resources.

“The action taken by the Commission at its June 11, 2025, business meeting will ensure that the commission can continue to provide trusted, effective, and coordinated management of the Basin’s shared water resources with the full participation of the United States,” Brown said in a statement.

The resolution does not affect other sources of federal grant funding from the Environmental Protection Agency, the Federal Emergency Management Agency and the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service, she said.

The federal spending cut cited by the resolution is “limited to potential future funding provided through the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers,” Brown said. She noted that the federal government paid its scheduled yearly dues of $715,000 to the commission for both the 2023 and 2024 fiscal years but not for fiscal year 2025, which ends on June 30. For fiscal year 2026, the federal dues are “not guaranteed” and will depend on the passage of a federal budget, Brown said.

“If DRBC does not receive federal signatory funding for FY 2026, the Commission can seek other sources of support, such as competitive grants, that align with its mission of managing, protecting and improving the shared water resources of the Delaware River Basin,” she said.

Climate change

In 2019, the commission set up the Advisory Committee on Climate Change to identify “potentially significant” impacts on the basin from climate change-related impacts such as salinity from sea-level rise in the Delaware River’s tidal section, and impacts to stream flow because of changes in precipitation. The committee’s 18 members include appointees by the DRBC’s executive director, water company executives and academics.

Since 1996, the federal government has contributed to the DRBC’s approximately $8 million annual budget only three times: that year, plus in 2023 and 2024. Its accumulated shortfall is $17.1 million since agreeing in 1988 to pay 20% of the agency’s annual running costs, commission data shows.

Some funding that was initially cut from groups that work on the estuary has now been restored but other sources have been irrevocably lost, forcing those groups to cut their environmental work.

The Delaware River Basin Commission, which oversees water quality and supply in the basin, represents the water interests of its four member states, plus the federal government. It was set up by the administration of President John F. Kennedy in 1961.

In Trenton, a statement from the office of Gov. Phil Murphy did not say why his representative on the commission voted for the funding cut, but said it would only apply to Army Corps funding for DEI and climate programs.

“The prohibition on ‘directly or indirectly’ using funds awarded by the US Army Corps for DEI/Climate projects is specifically limited to US Army Corps funds,” and does not affect any funding for those programs from New Jersey or other states, the statement said.

Pressure from Congress

Pressure on the DRBC and its management of water resources in the Delaware River Basin is also coming from Congress, where U.S. Rep. Rob Bresnahan, a new Republican member for part of northeast Pennsylvania, sponsored a bill calling for a federal review of the commission and two other mid-Atlantic river basin commissions.

The bill, introduced on May 15, would require the U.S. Comptroller General to investigate the ethics, practices and funding of each commission, and recommend any reforms.

Bresnahan’s office did not respond to a request for comment on the reasons for the bill. Carluccio of the Delaware Riverkeeper Network called the measure an effort to disempower an agency that protects the public, rather than any attempt to uncover waste and fraud.

“This is a thinly veiled attempt to probe the DRBC and the other two commissions to find out how to bring them into compliance with the dysfunctional systems the Department of Government Efficiency is creating with its destructive actions,” she said, referring to the controversial agency set up by President Donald Trump to reduce government spending and jobs, and initially led by Tesla boss Elon Musk.

Critics of the Trump administration’s actions in the Delaware River estuary also cite a last-minute order by the U.S. Department of Energy to keep an aging power plant at Eddystone near Philadelphia running beyond its scheduled retirement on the grounds that its power is needed to meet higher summer demand. The plant, built in the 1960s, generates electricity using oil and gas, and therefore contributes to the atmospheric warming that helps to boost demand.

The plant had been scheduled to close permanently on May 31 but was directed by the DOE only one day before to continue providing power to the grid at times of peak demand for at least 90 days. The plant’s owner, Constellation Energy Corp., said it had decided to close the plant for economic reasons after an earlier determination by the grid operator PJM Interconnection that a shutdown would not hurt grid reliability. But after the DOE order, Constellation said it would retain the staff needed to continue operations safely and reliably.

Liquefied natural gas

Further evidence of the administration’s promotion of fossil fuels in the urban estuary, critics say, is the recent advocacy for a proposed export terminal for liquefied natural gas on the Delaware River near Philadelphia by the new Republican U.S. senator for Pennsylvania, Dave McCormick. The senator, who was endorsed by then-candidate Trump in the campaign, narrowly defeated Bob Casey, a three-term Democrat, in 2024.

In March, McCormick met with Franc James, chief executive of Penn America Energy Holdings, which plans to build the $7 billion terminal, which would also be at Eddystone, Pa.

“This massive, proposed project in southeastern Pennsylvania has the potential to generate billions in economic impact over the next 20 years, create 3,000 good-paying jobs, and produce $30-$40 million per year in tax revenue for this community,” McCormick said in a statement on his website. His office did not respond to a request for further comment for this story.

‘The impacts of fracking on watersheds are indisputable. Landmark protections require eternal vigilance, and clearly the industry is still looking to drill in the watershed.’ — Doug O’Malley, director, Environment New Jersey

In early June, James met officials at the White House to “provide intelligence” about the project, Reuters reported on June 5.

Across the river in Gibbstown, New Jersey, another proposed LNG export terminal awaits a decision from the DRBC on whether to extend a construction permit for another three years. That project looked doomed after the Biden administration withdrew a permit that would have allowed the transportation of LNG to Gibbstown by rail. But the new permit application seems to show that the developer, Delaware River Partners, still wants to build the terminal.

At the same site beside the Delaware River, the company also plans to build giant caverns to store liquefied petroleum gases (LPG) including butane and propane produced by the natural gas industry active in Pennsylvania’s giant Marcellus Shale, one of the world’s biggest natural gas formations. New Jersey regulators issued a draft approval for the project and are expected to issue a final decision in coming months after a public comment period that ended on June 16.

Federal funding cuts

At a grassroots level, work to protect the river and its urban estuary as far upstream as Trenton has been hurt by millions of dollars in recent direct and indirect federal funding cuts, according to the leader of one nonprofit who spoke on condition of anonymity because she fears that any public criticism of funding cuts would provoke retaliation from the Trump administration.

Some funding that was initially cut from groups that work on the estuary has now been restored but other sources have been irrevocably lost, forcing those groups to cut their environmental work. Under the Trump administration, federal agencies including the EPA, Fish & Wildlife Service and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration have lost many long-time employees, and with them institutional knowledge that is hard to replace, the source said.

While many of those employees have left voluntarily, others may still be laid off, fueling fears that even if certain federal grants survive the bloodletting, there won’t be anyone left at some agencies to hand out the money.

Still, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service plans to continue its funding for the congressionally mandated Delaware Watershed Conservation Fund, and expects to announce grantees in August or September. “We are moving forward with our grant cycle as planned for this fiscal year,” said FWS spokeswoman Bridget MacDonald.

Meanwhile, unconfirmed reports say the DRBC’s hard-fought ban on fracking for natural gas in the Delaware Basin is under pressure from both state and federal Republican lawmakers, including Pennsylvania’s Bresnahan, and perhaps from the head of the EPA, Lee Zeldin.

The fracking ban, finalized in 2021 after being unofficially in place for about a decade, was a landmark decision that protects the Delaware watershed from an industry that could otherwise contaminate aquifers supplying drinking water to some 13 million people, said O’Malley of Environment New Jersey.

The Trump administration has not made its intentions clear on the future of fracking in the watershed. But any lifting of the ban would be consistent with the administration’s support for fossil fuels, he said.

“No one, including the federal government, gets to wave a wand and reverse decisions by the DRBC,” O’Malley said. “The impacts of fracking on watersheds are indisputable. Landmark protections require eternal vigilance, and clearly the industry is still looking to drill in the watershed.”",https://www.njspotlightnews.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/123/2025/06/Delaware-River-estuary-at-Chester-Marcus-Hook.jpg,N,,2025-06-23 01:02:00.786110

GOP districts see $9 billion in investments; 10,000 jobs disappear due to cancelled or delayed projects so far

$444 million in new investments announced in May don’t offset cancellations

WASHINGTON – As the U.S. Senate prepares to vote on massive tax and spending bill that would increase taxes on clean energy factories and projects, businesses canceled another $1.4 billion in new factories and clean energy projects in May, according to E2’s latest monthly analysis of clean energy projects tracked by E2 and Clean Economy Tracker.

The latest cancellations – including battery, electric vehicle and solar panel factories in West Virginia, New York, Alabama, Arizona and Washington – mean $15.5 billion in new factories and electricity projects have been cancelled since January 1. The cancelled projects were expected to create nearly 12,000 new jobs.

Republican congressional districts are losing the most. More than $9 billion in investments and almost10,000 jobs have been cancelled, delayed or closed in Republican districts so far in 2025.

The $1.4 billion in projects cancelled in May were expected to create at least 1,000 new jobs. Another 600 workers were laid off across five closures announced last month. May’s cancellations also include GM’s decision to cancel plans for an EV factory in Tonawanda plant in New York and instead shift its investments there to build 8-cylinder gas vehicles.

Following is a statement from MICHAEL TIMBERLAKE, E2 COMMUNICATIONS DIRECTOR:

“The consequences of continued policy uncertainty and the expectation of higher taxes on clean energy businesses are becoming painfully clear. Businesses are reacting to the Senate’s proposal—like the House’s— that would drastically scale back the very tax credits that had been driving an American energy and manufacturing boom.

“These cancellations are just the first shoe to drop. With renewable energy supplying more than 90 percent of new electricity in America last year, canceled projects will likely mean less available energy and higher electricity prices for consumers and business alike.”

Amid the cancellations, businesses in May also announced nearly $450 million in investments for new solar, EV and grid and transmission equipment factories across five states – including a $120 million investment by electric vehicle maker Rivian to build 1.2 million-square-foot supplier park in Illinois that is expected to create 100 new jobs. Separately, Prolec-GE Waukesh announced plans for a $140 million electricity transformer manufacturing facility in North Carolina expected to create 330 new jobs. Combined, the eight projects announced in May are expected to create at least 1,310 new permanent jobs if completed.

Through May, 62 percent of all clean energy projects announced—along with 71 percent of all jobs and 82 percent of all investments —are in congressional districts represented by Republicans.

According to a separate report from the Clean Energy Buyers Association, average household utility bills would rise by more than $110 per year and businesses would see at least a 10 percent increase in energy costs if Congress goes forward with its plans to repeal clean energy tax credits.

May’s announcements bring the overall number of major clean energy projects tracked by E2 to 397 across 42 states and Puerto Rico. Companies have said they plan to invest nearly $132 billion in these projects and hire 123,000 permanent workers. (These figures reflect ongoing revisions and updates).

Since federal clean energy tax credits were passed by Congress in August 2022, a total of 53 announced projects have been cancelled, closed, or downsized. More than 21,000 jobs and $18.2 billion in investments were connected with the abandoned projects.

A full map and list of announcements is available at e2.org/announcements/. Cancellation data will be incorporated in the coming months.

About E2’s Analysis

Announcements

Projects that began development, were proposed, or applied for local and state approval before the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) are not included. This analysis also does not include investments in which the federal government has provided financial resources for the complete project, lease sales, projects in which an announcement was made but lacked specific geographic information, etc. Details on projects came from news reports on new and related projects; press releases from companies announcing new developments; and government announcements.

Cancellations, Closures, Downsizes

This tracking includes all projects, plants, operations, or expansions that were cancelled or closed since passage of the IRA in August 2022. This does not include announced layoffs that are not associated with a project downsizing unless there is a stated decease in production output. This list also does not include the transfer of project ownership, if production will continue under the new ownership, power purchasing agreements, or other similar type of announcements. Project delays or idling of facilities are not included unless there in an announced decrease in production or investment or unless the project will need to be restarted to proceed in the future.

“This technology overcomes the shortcomings of supercapacitors by using single-walled carbon nanotubes and conductive polymers,” said Dr. Bon-Cheol Ku of KIST.","Developing next-generation energy storage technologies that can deliver both high power and high capacity at the same time.

A research team led by Dr. Bon-Cheol Ku and Dr. Seo Gyun Kim from the Carbon Composite Materials Research Center at the Korea Institute of Science and Technology (KIST), along with Professor Yuanzhe Piao of Seoul National University (SNU), has developed a high-performance supercapacitor that may represent the next generation of energy storage.

Their breakthrough addresses key limitations of current supercapacitors by using an advanced fiber structure made from single-walled carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and the conductive polymer polyaniline (PANI).

Supercapacitors charge faster and offer higher power density than traditional batteries, with minimal performance loss even after tens of thousands of charging cycles. However, their lower energy density limits how long they can operate, which has made them less practical for extended-use applications like electric vehicles and drones.

Innovative CNT‑PANI fiber structure

To address this challenge, the researchers chemically bonded single-walled carbon nanotubes (CNTs), known for their high conductivity, with polyaniline (PANI), a low-cost and easily processed conductive polymer. By combining these materials at the nanoscale, they created a complex fiber structure that improves the movement of both electrons and ions. This results in a supercapacitor capable of storing more energy and releasing it more quickly.

The new supercapacitor has demonstrated stable performance through over 100,000 charge and discharge cycles and remains effective even in high-voltage environments. Because of its durability and efficiency, the technology can serve as either a replacement or an enhancement to current battery systems. In electric vehicles, it could deliver fast-charging power that boosts both driving range and performance.

Drones and robots may also benefit from longer operation times and improved reliability. Additionally, the CNT-PANI composite fiber is highly flexible, allowing it to be rolled or folded for use in next-generation electronics like wearable devices.

Mass production and cost reduction

Another major achievement of the research is the reduction of production costs and the possibility of mass production. Despite their excellent properties, single-walled carbon nanotubes (CNTs) have been difficult to commercialize due to their high production costs, but the researchers solved this problem by compounding them with the low-cost conductive polymer polyaniline (PANI).

Furthermore, they have laid the foundation for mass production through a simple process, and recently succeeded in developing film-like structures based on this technology, further advancing commercialization. In the future, it will be utilized as a key enabling technology for the transition to a carbon-neutral society across various industries such as electric vehicles, robots, drones, and wearable devices.

“This technology overcomes the shortcomings of supercapacitors by using single-walled carbon nanotubes and conductive polymers,” said Dr. Bon-Cheol Ku of KIST. “We will continue to develop and industrialize ultra-high-performance carbon fibers based on carbon nanotubes.”

After the Eastern Washington plant returned to service, turbine vibration readings increased to higher that expected.
As the plant reached 80% power, turbine vibration levels reached a point that require a turbine balancing procedure to reduce vibration and support full-power operation, Energy Northwest said late Sunday afternoon.

If vibration levels are again too high, an additional balancing procedure may be required, Energy Northwest said.","The Northwest’s only nuclear power reactor will disconnect from the grid early Monday morning after an issue developed following the plant outage that ended June 16.

Energy Northwest’s Columbia Generating Station was expected to start powering down on Sunday before disconnecting from the grid and then addressing the problem.

After the Eastern Washington plant returned to service, turbine vibration readings increased to higher that expected.

As the plant reached 80% power, turbine vibration levels reached a point that require a turbine balancing procedure to reduce vibration and support full-power operation, Energy Northwest said late Sunday afternoon.

Siemens Energy has provided technical guidance, and Energy Northwest workers will install balance weights on the main turbine, Energy Northwest said.

“Balancing the turbine is a precise process and it’s important for the long-term reliability of our equipment to provide power to the region,” said Bob Schuetz, Energy Northwest chief executive officer, in a statement.

The time the plant will be disconnected from the Northwest electric grid is expected to be brief.

Once balancing is done and the plant is back on the grid, the turbine will be closely monitor.

If vibration levels are again too high, an additional balancing procedure may be required, Energy Northwest said.

A similar turbine balance was performed in December 2021 during a planned maintenance outage that also required temporary disconnection from the grid.

Columbia Generating Station’s turbine system includes three low-pressure turbines and one high-pressure turbine, with a combined rotating mass of approximately 1.2 million pounds. Precise alignment and balance are essential for reliable operation, as the turbines drive the main generator to produce electricity for the region.

The plant, which usually supplies enough electricity around the clock to power about 1 million homes, reconnected to the grid about 5 p.m. Monday, June 16, after a 65-day outage for refueling and for maintenance work that cannot be done while the reactor is operating.

Every other spring a third of the fuel rods in the reactor are replaced with fresh fuel.

The 2025 outage for the plant 10 miles north of Richland was longer than usual and the 2,000 workers hired were more than usual due to a major project, installing a new adjustable speed drive system.

The system needed to be replaced after there were a few issues that required powering down to fix components.

The speed drive controls the pumps that control the water inside the core, which in turn controls the amount of power the reactor produces, according to Energy Northwest.

The heat produced by a chain reaction boils the water within the core, creating steam that turns turbines attached to an electric generator.

Maine is home to two of the last remaining paper plants in the country that burn tires as fuel.
As other mills move away from so-called “tire-derived fuels,” Maine plants have increased their use in recent years, adding to their output of harmful pollutants.
When biogenic fuel is taken into account, mill greenhouse gas emissions are almost as high as the dirtiest U.S. oil refineries, according to EIP.
Nationwide, EIP found that paper mills’ greenhouse gas emissions were 350% higher than public-facing EPA estimates.","Two of Maine’s largest paper mills are among the dirtiest in the country, according to a new study on U.S. pulp and paper plants, putting their emissions on par with some oil refineries.

The May report from the Environmental Integrity Project, a nonprofit advocacy group, calls attention to the industry’s overreliance on dirty fuels and the old, inefficient technologies they use to burn them.

“In Maine, there are several plants that are still burning coal and… tires,” said Courtney Bernhardt, EIP’s director of research who co-authored the report. “We wanted to raise awareness about that.”

The group analyzed greenhouse gas emissions from 185 paper plants across the country, which Bernhardt says are undercounted by federal estimates because of a loophole in the reporting process: the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency doesn’t include greenhouse gas emissions from “biogenic” fuel sources like biomass or black liquor, a wood byproduct of the chemical papermaking process, both of which mills burn to power their operations and can be dirtier than coal.

The agency’s rationale for excluding those sources from total emissions estimates in its Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program, according to EIP, is “because trees can grow back in the future” and offset the carbon emissions from biomass fuels.

Until the EPA accurately reports and regulates all facility emissions, mill owners will have less of a reason to pursue energy efficiency upgrades that can both cut back reliance on dirty fuels and maintain profits, the report claims.

The study’s recommendations for tightening limits on the paper industry’s emissions come as the Trump administration eyes drastic rollbacks of federal rules curtailing greenhouse gases and hazardous air pollutants released by American power plants, according to reporting from The New York Times.

Maine is home to two of the last remaining paper plants in the country that burn tires as fuel. As other mills move away from so-called “tire-derived fuels,” Maine plants have increased their use in recent years, adding to their output of harmful pollutants.

The combination of coal, tires and other fuels burned by ND Paper’s plant in Rumford made it the second-largest emitter of mercury out of the 185 facilities included in EIP’s analysis of 2023 EPA data. The Sappi Somerset mill in Skowhegan, which also burns tires, was a top-20 emitter of hazardous air pollutants in 2020.

Both plants’ emissions have local and global effects. Common mill byproducts like nitrogen oxides, sulfur dioxide and fine particulate matter all harm the respiratory system and can linger in the atmosphere, where nitrogen oxide creates acid rain.

When biogenic fuel is taken into account, mill greenhouse gas emissions are almost as high as the dirtiest U.S. oil refineries, according to EIP. Sappi Somerset mill’s total greenhouse gas emissions balloon from 316,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide to nearly 1.6 million when including biogenic fuel sources — a 400% increase.

Nationwide, EIP found that paper mills’ greenhouse gas emissions were 350% higher than public-facing EPA estimates.

At the state level, these emissions are counted. Maine ditched the EPA’s model and began including biogenic sources of carbon dioxide in a 2022 update on its climate change goals.

Maine lawmakers recently codified a new 2040 deadline to reach net zero carbon emissions, and one effective way to do so nationwide, according to Bernhardt, is upgrading the inefficient boilers that many mills have relied on for decades to power operations.

The EIP report estimates that 40% of all analyzed pulp and paper mills have a boiler that is at least a half century old, including the power boiler that Woodland Pulp’s Washington County mill still uses 54 years after it was installed.

A representative for Woodland Pulp said that the company’s Baileyville mill has reduced its emissions over the past two decades by switching from fuel oil to natural gas. Mill energy needs are also supported by on-site hydropower.

Although many boilers are upgraded and retrofitted to add pollution controls — including the one used by Woodland Pulp — EIP recommends replacing them with zero-emission industrial heat technologies where possible, reducing overall emissions and the amount of heat lost by inefficient boilers during the papermaking process.

Sappi has pursued similar efficiency updates at its Somerset mill in recent years, according to Sappi communications manager April Jones. The company no longer burns coal and has reduced reliance on other dirty fuels, setting a 2030 deadline to reduce the mill’s 2019 greenhouse gas emissions by 41.5% per ton of product.

Sappi and Woodland Pulp also disputed EIP’s claims that their total mill greenhouse gas emissions are underreported. Despite EPA’s reporting framework, both companies stated that they still publish their mills’ biogenic emissions. (ND Paper did not respond to requests for comment).

The paper industry hasn’t yet been targeted by rollbacks on hazardous air pollution limits the same way power plants have, according to Bernhardt, but broad changes in emissions regulations could impact industries across the board. Further greenhouse gas reductions may instead have to come from paper companies deciding to invest in clean technologies and reduce pollution.

“There’s a real role for paper to play in a more sustainable economy,” Bernhardt said. “It really comes down to dollars. Can companies afford it?”

For instance, the first CIS auction sought to secure 6GW of renewable energy generation in the National Electricity Market (NEM).
Specifically, 23GW of this figure will be renewable energy generation, while 9GW will come from dispatchable capacity, such as battery energy storage systems (BESS).

It will be connected to the NEM and within the T3 Tasmania Midlands proposed Renewable Energy Zone (REZ).","This change is estimated to reduce the time to finalise the tender outcomes from nine to six months.

Bowen said in his speech that the government would continue to optimise the scheme, admitting that it must overcome several hurdles.

“The beauty of the CIS is that it provides the industry investment certainty, but also that we can learn and improve it as we go, as we will continue to do,” Bowen said.

“The sector still faces social license challenges, workforce constraints, and approval times. Together with the states and the industry, we are working to alleviate these constraints. Ensuring community benefit is built into CIS contracts has been fundamental – and we’ll keep improving that.”

Since its introduction, the CIS has spearheaded the growth of Australia’s renewable energy generation and energy storage fleet. Several of these tenders, both at a national and state level, have been oversubscribed.

For instance, the first CIS auction sought to secure 6GW of renewable energy generation in the National Electricity Market (NEM).

The round saw 40GW of bids registered, with 27GW of “very high quality” bids going through to the next stage. Because of the oversubscribed round, the federal government has increased the amount of capacity it is seeking to 10GW in the NEM, with 4GW of dispatchable power and 6GW of renewable energy generation.

Bowen said that the latest tender round was oversubscribed nearly three times, with 16.5GW of projects having registered their interest, with the government having sought 6GW.

For reference, the CIS aims to unlock the “record levels of investment” required for Australia to attain its 82% renewables by 2030 target, aiming to deliver 32GW of renewable energy and energy storage capacity.

Specifically, 23GW of this figure will be renewable energy generation, while 9GW will come from dispatchable capacity, such as battery energy storage systems (BESS).

576MWh solar-plus-storage project approved in just 20 days

In other Australia news, a 576MWh solar-plus-storage site in Tasmania has been approved by the national government in just 20 days.

The 250MW Weasel Solar Farm project was submitted to the federal government’s Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation (EPBC) Act in April 2025. It includes plans for a co-located BESS that will be 144MW/576MWh in size and occupy a 3-hectare area.

The federal government confirmed that the approval process for this project took just 20 days.

It will be located 9km north of Bothwell in the centre of the state and near the River Clyde. It will be connected to the NEM and within the T3 Tasmania Midlands proposed Renewable Energy Zone (REZ).

The Downie family from Dungrove and the Bowden family from Weasel Plains are proposing the project in collaboration with Alternate Path, an energy consultancy based in Victoria.

The solar PV power plant will feature up to 4,000 single-axis tracking PV modules installed over 270 hectares of land. The plant’s layout will enable the continuation of agricultural practices, principally sheep grazing, in a site use combination often called ‘agrivoltaics’.

Alongside agrivoltaics, the project developers have stated their desire to ensure forestry practices can continue in the vicinity to “generate significant social and economic benefits for the local community, surrounding landowners, and the state of Tasmania.”

The project’s anticipated operational lifespan is 30 to 40 years. At the end of its tenure, the plant will be decommissioned.

The study analyzed over 2.2 million 1- to 5-year-old used cars sold in May 2023 and 2024 and found that the average used EV price is down 29.5 percent year-over-year versus 6.1 percent for the average used gas car price. In May 2024, the average used electric vehicle was priced at $28,767, or 8.3 percent below the average gas car at $31,424. These prices show a major turnaround from a year ago, when the average used EV cost $40,783 and the average used gas car cost $33,469.

Used Electric Vehicle Market Crashing

“There’s no denying the crash in used electric vehicle values over the past year,” said Karl Brauer, Executive Analyst at iSeeCars. “We’ve watched EVs prices fall between 30 and 40 percent since June of last year, while the average gas car’s price has dropped by just 3 to 7 percent in that same timeframe.”

While electric vehicle values appeared to stabilize at the end of 2023, they experienced a substantial drop in February this year and have continued to decline over the past four months. At the same time, the average used gas car price has shifted by approximately $400 during those same four months.

“It’s clear used car shoppers will no longer pay a premium for electric vehicles and, in fact, consider electric powertrains a detractor, making them less desirable – and valuable – than traditional models,” said Brauer.

Used Gas Car Prices Showing Stability

Demand for used gas cars grew during the new car production shortages brought on by the pandemic. This demand pressure is slowly easing, but with used prices hovering around $31,000 they remain well above pre-pandemic levels.

“Over the past year the average used price for traditional internal combustion engine vehicles has never shifted by more than 7 percent, with most months changing between 3 and 6 percent,” said Karl Brauer. “This is in stark contrast to the 30 to 40 percent drops in used EV pricing.”

Used EV Prices Continue To Crash

The ongoing crash in used electric vehicle prices pulled their values below the average used gas cars in February and shows no sign of stopping.

“While the drop in used EV prices is dramatic, what’s more disconcerting is no indication of used EV values stabilizing,” said Brauer. “At some point used EV prices will have to bottom out, but we don’t appear to be at that point yet.”

EV Models Lead the Drop in Used Car Values

When ranking used cars by the biggest price drops over the past year, electric vehicles take up the first seven slots and make up eight of the top 10 models with the largest drops in pricing.

Methodology

iSeeCars analyzed over 2.2 million 1- to 5-year-old used cars sold in May 2023 and 2024. The average listing prices of each car model were compared between the two time periods, and the differences were expressed as both a percentage difference from the 2023 price as well as a dollar difference. Heavy-duty vehicles, low-volume vehicles, vehicles discontinued as of the 2023 model year, and vehicles in production for fewer than four of the last five model years for each period were excluded from further analysis.

In a 7-2 decision issued late last week, the justices revived the industry’s lawsuit and ruled that fuel makers had standing to sue over California’s strict emissions standards.

In a 7-2 decision issued late last week, the justices revived the industry’s lawsuit and ruled that fuel makers had standing to sue over California’s strict emissions standards.

The suit argued that California and the Environmental Protection Agency under President Biden were abusing their power by relying on the 1970s-era rule for fighting smog as a means of combating climate change in the 21st century.

California’s new emissions standards “did not target a local California air-quality problem — as they say is required by the Clean Air Act — but instead were designed to address global climate change,” Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh wrote, using italics to described the industry’s position.

The court did not rule on the suit itself but he said the fuel makers had standing to sue because they would be injured by the state’s rule.

“The fuel producers make money by selling fuel. Therefore, the decrease in purchases of gasoline and other liquid fuels resulting from the California regulations hurts their bottom line,” Kavanaugh said.

Only Justices Sonia Sotomayor and Ketanji Brown Jackson disagreed.

Jackson questioned why the court would “revive a fuel-industry lawsuit that all agree will soon be moot (and is largely moot already). … This case gives fodder to the unfortunate perception that moneyed interests enjoy an easier road to relief in this Court than ordinary citizens.”

But the outcome was overshadowed by the recent actions of Trump and congressional Republicans.

With Trump’s backing, the House and Senate adopted measures disapproving regulations adopted by the Biden administration that would have allowed California to enforce broad new regulations to require “zero emissions” cars and trucks.

Trump said the new rules were designed to displace California as the nation’s leader in fighting air pollution and greenhouse gases.

In a bill-signing ceremony at the White House, he said the disapproval measures “will prevent California’s attempt to impose a nationwide electric vehicle mandate and to regulate national fuel economy by regulating carbon emissions.”

“Our Constitution does not allow one state special status to create standards that limit consumer choice and impose an electric vehicle mandate upon the entire nation,” he said.

In response, California Atty. Gen. Rob Bonta said “the fight for clean air is far from over. While we are disappointed by the Supreme Court’s decision to allow this case to go forward in the lower court, we will continue to vigorously defend California’s authority under the Clean Air Act.”

Some environmentalists said the decision greenlights future lawsuits from industry and polluters.

“This is a dangerous precedent from a court hellbent on protecting corporate interests,” said David Pettit, an attorney at the Center for Biological Diversity’s Climate Law Institute. “This decision opens the door to more oil industry lawsuits attacking states’ ability to protect their residents and wildlife from climate change.”

In Massachusetts, Gov. Maura Healey’s administration last month said it will not enforce minimum electric vehicle sales requirements for model years 2026 and 2027, a step officials say will give more time for the auto industry to ramp up production.

“We’re giving carmakers more runway to invest in their manufacturing and supply chains,” said Healey at the time, “which will help ensure customers have additional affordable electric vehicles options at dealerships in the future. Massachusetts will continue to invest in charging infrastructure to support the widespread adoption of electric vehicles.”

The removal of coal from UK electricity generation is the most important factor in the UK’s reduction in CO2 emissions in the last 30 years.
This development was underpinned by a Contract For Difference (CFD), awarded in September 2024, which provides guaranteed electricity prices to the developer.
No-one in the industry is pretending that the UK oil and gas industry will ever be the scale it was 20 years ago.
Although supposedly self-sufficient in renewable electricity, Scotland still relies on base load capacity from Torness nuclear power station and imports from England.","The UK government recently made a headline grabbing statement on energy- backing the Sizewell C nuclear plant with £14 billion, plus commitments to Small Modular Reactors (SMR) and fusion technology. However, despite these decisive steps, energy policy and the energy market in Scotland and the UK are broken. Although some of this is due to geopolitical issues, there are also significant policy issues. I want to highlight three areas in particular.

First, the promise of ever increasing generation of renewable electricity is being challenged due to increasing costs and public backlash. Secondly, the domestic oil and gas industry is being hammered by the Labour government’s approach to domestic oil and gas. Thirdly, and most importantly, continuing high electricity prices are impacting on UK households and industry leading to populist politicians questioning New Zero. Fundamentally, the promises of renewable energy being introduced through a ‘Just Transition’ that will automatically lead to new jobs and lower energy costs are not coming to fruition.

There are key structural elements in the UK energy market that do not work. Most critically, the electricity price is set by the last therm generated which, about 80% of the time in the UK, is from gas. Therefore, there is an intimate link between the gas price and electricity price which means that the notionally lower price of renewables are not being seen by consumers.

This is the key reason why electricity prices remain high in the UK. To be clear, this is a feature of the system not a bug- it ensures that we should always be producing enough electricity as there will always be gas generators available to generate the final therm at a price that makes economic sense for them. In time, this issue should decrease. As more interconnectors are installed from the north of Scotland to east of England, as currently under construction by National Grid and the Scottish operators, renewables will be able to deliver more of the time. Storage capacity will also come onstream – be that pumped hydro storage, including plans to upgrade Cruachan and newer schemes in the Highlands, or battery storage. California essentially shows the future in this regard – enormous generation of solar during the day fills batteries which are then discharged in the evening and overnight.

A second live issue is ‘zonal pricing’. Under this proposal, the UK would be split in to a number of regions. If there is excess generation in a region which cannot be exported consumers in this area would get cheaper electricity and vice versa. Zonal pricing should reduce curtailment charges and drive investment in new generating capacity to areas with higher prices (eg new nuclear power stations in the south of England) and new consumers to areas with lower prices (eg new data centres in Inverness). Some people in the industry, in particular the CEO of Octopus Energy, are strongly advocating this in support of consumer rights. Many of the incumbent generators and companies with plans for large developments are vehemently against it. Although it has not yet had much publicity, I assume there will be some pressure (?!) against the concept in the south of England which is likely, at least in the short term, to see higher prices. And, in time, if the market works properly, this approach will decimate the renewable industry in Scotland without even greater investment in grid infrastructure or storage. The proposals are therefore highly contentious in the industry.

The growth of renewable electricity generation over the last few years has been remarkable. According to the SNP government, Scotland now generates more than 100% of its total electricity consumption from renewables. A better figure is that in 2024, renewables accounted for 70% of Scotland’s total electricity generation with about 40% of the total electricity generated exported to England and Ireland. It is important to note, however, that Scotland still relies on base load nuclear generation and imports from England because the wind doesn’t blow all the time. Further, as is widely known, huge amounts of money (£500 million year to date in 2025 according to a study by Octopus) are paid to generators in curtailment charges when there is an overcapacity of generation in the system. These issues could become a key factor in the Holyrood elections next year particularly in rural communities facing an onslaught of wind farm proposals with locals realising that most of the new generation will either be exported or shut in as there is insufficient grid capacity.

The removal of coal from UK electricity generation is the most important factor in the UK’s reduction in CO2 emissions in the last 30 years. For many years, this was driven by the replacement of coal by gas but has more recently been due to the huge increase in wind and solar generation. The last few years have seen a huge expansion in offshore wind. The last licencing round, Allocation Round 6 in 2024, had bidders for 9.6GW of capacity- this is against a current total of about 75GW. However, very significant increases in costs are meaning that developers’ economics are being challenged. Within the last few weeks, Oersted announced that they will not be progressing their Hornsea 4 wind development offshore Yorkshire – one of the largest windfarm developments in the world. This development was underpinned by a Contract For Difference (CFD), awarded in September 2024, which provides guaranteed electricity prices to the developer. However, very significant cost increases in the sector have led to decisions such as that on Hornsea 4 and likely on other developments. There will presumably be less impact on onshore developments which are much lower cost, but which are also likely to foment much more local opposition. In principle, renewable electricity should be cheaper than gas or nuclear generation- the cost of the inputs are free- and not subject to variable international commodity prices. However, due to capital costs increases, the requirements for storage, as the wind doesn’t blow all the time, and essential upgrades to the grid, consumers are not yet seeing cheaper electricity.

Another fundamental energy issue is the impact of Energy Profit Levy (EPL) on the North Sea oil industry. The EPL, which is a marginal tax rate of 78%, was introduced as a windfall tax when oil and gas prices were substantially higher. Although certain capital allowances were retained at the last budget, the tax rates are crippling for new capital expenditure. There have been substantial job losses over the last few months at a number of the large operators, not necessarily the household names but the companies which now dominate the North Sea industry. Uncertainty about licencing and field development approvals have also led to a haemorrhaging of capital investment. This framework of general unfriendliness to the industry is in contrast to other countries, including the Netherlands and New Zealand, which have backtracked on their previous de facto bans, and near neighbour Norway which is maximising its production. Last week Centrica signed a deal with Equinor to import £20 billion of gas over the next 10 years. Only a small proportion of this gas could be produced in the UK. However, even a small proportion would be helpful for the UK Treasury, UK jobs and UK shareholders. No-one in the industry is pretending that the UK oil and gas industry will ever be the scale it was 20 years ago. However, they are pointing out that it seems ludicrous to be importing increasing volumes of oil and gas from international markets including Liquid Natural Gas (LNG) from countries like the USA, Qatar and Peru, which have significantly higher CO2 emissions related to transportation than North Sea produced gas. The Scottish government talks about a ‘Just Transition’ – there seems to be nothing ‘just’ about prematurely curtailing UK oil and gas production while replacing this with imported gas and oil. The UK government is considering changes to the regime but there does not seem to be the necessary urgency.

The combination of all these factors, with a dose of blatant political opportunism, are placing the Net Zero commitment of the Scottish and UK governments in the cross hairs of right wing parties and populists questioning the principle of Net Zero in its totality, or at a minimum questioning the timeframes. Even the Tony Blair Foundation seemed to get in on the act with the headlines around their recent publication stating that current net zero policies are ‘doomed to fail’ – although in this case the headlines missed the key points of an incredibly well thought out set of proposals which do not in any way question the need to tackle climate change. And who can blame people? Households are seeing ongoing high energy costs because we still link the electricity price to gas price. UK industry is saddled with the most expensive electricity in Europe. Local communities throughout Scotland are facing proposals for windfarms and electricity pylons to export electricity to England while seeing little benefit. This is compounded by the Scottish government stating that renewables are the new North Sea- with the key differences being the number of jobs created during the supposed ‘Just Transition’, most of the infrastructure for the oil and gas industry being hundreds of miles offshore rather than back gardens in Angus and unspoilt Highland glens, and that we actually still need North Sea oil and gas.

However, what consumers are not yet seeing is reduced electricity prices as a result of supposedly cheaper forms of generation. Why would local people agree to new windfarms or huge electricity pylons when they know the electricity is being exported south and they are not seeing cheaper electricity bills? No Scottish manufacturing of wind turbines – so where are the just transition jobs actually going to come from?

So what can be done? Well, a positive conclusion is that most of the issues and problems I have highlighted can be solved by policy interventions rather than tricky new technology – albeit policy interventions requiring a huge amount of investment.

From a Scottish perspective, the government needs to get real about the ‘Just Transition’. As my colleague Neil Gilmour wrote on this forum recently, the report from the Just Transition Commission has ‘No timeline. No costs. No specific accountabilities. No integrated road map for the overall journey.’ It is therefore doomed to failure. Enlighten have previously highlighted the plethora of targets, strategies and initiatives from the Scottish government which do no link up. The Scottish Government needs a reality check.

Secondly, the Scottish Government, working with Scottish SNP and Labour MPs (and indeed Conservatives MPs and MSPs), must be much more forthright with the Westminster government about the North Sea oil industry. It is difficult to identify another sector which can demonstrate highly paid jobs, UK capital investment, tax revenue, reduced import costs and lower carbon emissions for the next twenty years. The current consultation has to result in a new tax structure and licencing framework which will be implemented very quickly to protect the industry.

The Scottish government needs to think realistically about base load electricity generation. Although supposedly self-sufficient in renewable electricity, Scotland still relies on base load capacity from Torness nuclear power station and imports from England. The UK government has committed to nuclear plants at Sizewell and investment in Small Modular Reactors and fusion to underpin the base load capacity and Ed Milliband, UK Energy Secretary’ has stated that he sees no reason why there shouldn’t be nuclear in Scotland. Although principally involved in planning decisions, the Scottish government should support the UK position. The construction of new nuclear capacity at existing sites at either Torness or Hunterston, close to Scottish population centres with grid connections would be transformational for the Scottish energy system. The Scottish university sector, with its own severe financial challenges, would benefit from a resurgence in nuclear engineering requirements. Scotland currently generates more electricity than it uses. However, much of this is in wrong place – requiring huge impact on remote parts of the country and transmission lines to the population centres. Better to place the generation close to the central belt.

The UK government needs to redesign the electricity market to a system which will lower prices in the short to medium term. Disconnecting the electricity price from the gas price, as is the case in other countries, would be a first step. Zonal pricing may be a short term fix to placate some objectors who see local windfarm developments but do not see the benefit of local pricing and may also encourage local businesses. However, it would also have a devastating effect on the renewable sector in Scotland. At a minimum, the UK Government should publish its Review of the Energy Markets as soon as possible to remove ongoing uncertainties from the sector.

The single most important way to achieve Net Zero in the UK is electrification of everything that can be electrified- home heating, transport, industry. This requires investment in generation, storage and transmission. However, as Enlighten have written previously, even more important is the hearts and mind campaign to demonstrate to individuals that this energy can be delivered reliably but cheaper than currently, into a daily experience similar to how people live now. It still strikes me as amazing that the need for change- to electric cars and heat pumps, district heating projects, demand side management, domestic generation and storage of electricity, improved domestic insulation- are still geeky, niche topics much like homemade yoghurt in the 1970s. Until these interventions and solutions become mainstream, alongside the policy changes outlined above, we are not going to have a chance of delivering Net Zero.",https://www.enlighten.scot/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/AdobeStock_1064917606-1920x1127.jpg,N,,2025-06-23 00:00:37.093034

Energy security affected by disrupted LNG supplies South Korea’s U.S. LNG import has faced challenges.
In 2022, South Korea's U.S. LNG imports plummeted by 31.84% year-on-year due to outages at the Freeport facility, which accounts for 17% of total U.S. LNG export capacity.
Uncertain economics of the Alaska LNG project The Alaska LNG project is one of several proposed export projects in the U.S.
South Korea’s LNG imports have been on a downtrend since 2022, when they peaked at a historic high of 46.4MTPA.","Since South Korea began tariff discussions in Washington in late April 2025, there has been growing speculation over whether the country will participate in the proposed United States (U.S.) Alaska liquefied natural gas (LNG) export development project. The USD44 billion undertaking aims to boost U.S. energy exports to key allies like South Korea and Japan.

In March 2025, U.S. President Trump mentioned cooperation between the U.S. and South Korea in the shipbuilding sector and the Alaska LNG project during a call with Acting President and Prime Minister Han Duck-Soo.

A delegation from South Korea's Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy (MOTIE) and the state-run gas utility Korea Gas Corporation (KOGAS) visited Alaska in early June 2025 to gather information on the LNG project.

On 3 June 2025, Alaska LNG developer Glenfarne announced that 50 companies had expressed interest in purchasing gas from the project at an estimated total contract value of USD115 billion. Given South Korea’s commitment to achieving net zero emissions by 2050 and the early stage of the Alaska project’s development, questions arise about the suitability of the LNG project for the country.

U.S. LNG imports driven by geopolitical considerations

South Korea began importing LNG from the U.S. in 2017, primarily driven by the U.S. shale gas boom and geopolitical considerations. The country’s LNG imports from the U.S. spiked 70 times year-on-year after the first U.S. export project, Sabine Pass, began operating in 2016. KOGAS signed a long-term contract with Cheniere, the LNG project developer. The South Korean utility imports 3.5 million tonnes per annum (MTPA) of LNG from the project through a 20-year purchase agreement.

Additional reasons for South Korea’s LNG imports from the U.S. included efforts to address the trade deficit, which prompted renegotiations of the Korea-U.S. Free Trade Agreement (FTA). The media and parliament frequently mentioned LNG as a potential remedy to alleviate the trade disparity and FTA cancellation risks by the U.S.

At the G20 Summit in 2017, South Korea’s administration announced its 'Coal and Nuclear-free Economy' policy, recognizing LNG as a form of ‘green energy’ and a key component of its energy transition strategy. In December of that year, MOTIE increased the targeted share of LNG in the power mix from 16.9% to 18.8% by 2030.

By the end of the year, South Korean imports of U.S. LNG more than doubled year-on-year, coinciding with the start of the Korea-U.S. FTA renegotiation.

In December 2020, the targeted share of LNG in the country’s power mix increased to 23.3% by 2030, and U.S. LNG imports hit a historic high in 2021.

Financial consequences of additional LNG imports

South Korea needs to carefully consider its energy sourcing strategy, given the potential impact LNG purchases could have on the economy. Currently, U.S. LNG purchases are being considered as an option for tariff negotiation to address the trade imbalance between South Korea and the U.S. In 2024, that deficit was USD66 billion.

As of 01 May 2025, the LNG spot market price was around USD10.50per million British thermal units (MMBtu). South Korea would need to purchase an estimated 121 million tonnes (Mt) of LNG annually to close the trade deficit. In 2024, the country imported46.3Mt of LNG, with only 5.6Mt coming from the U.S. The U.S. exported only 88Mt of LNG in 2024 to over a dozen countries. It does not produce enough LNG to close South Korea’s trade deficit or meet the requirements of multiple trading partners simultaneously.

Most South Korean LNG imports are secured through existing long-term contracts. In 2024, around 18% of the country’s imports came from the short-term or spot market, suggesting some potential for converting spot purchases into longer-term contracted purchases. This could allow for an additional small percentage of long-term imports from U.S. sellers.

However, South Korea should maintain flexibility in its purchasing portfolio to account for LNG consumption changes, as demand depends on economic fluctuations and weather patterns. The country’s demand for LNG is declining. It fell 5% in 2023 and is projected to decrease 20% through 2030. LNG is the most expensive imported fuel, as demonstrated during the Russia-Ukraine war, providing a natural price signal that has triggered reductions in demand. The South Korean economy and its electric power sector may struggle to bear the additional LNG costs.

Energy security affected by disrupted LNG supplies

South Korea’s U.S. LNG import has faced challenges. The U.S. Freeport export facility, one of South Korea’s primary suppliers, experienced frequent outages starting in 2022, lasting more than a year. This undermined energy security during the Russia-Ukraine war when stable LNG supplies were crucial amid global disruptions.

In 2022, South Korea's U.S. LNG imports plummeted by 31.84% year-on-year due to outages at the Freeport facility, which accounts for 17% of total U.S. LNG export capacity.

The disrupted U.S. supply reduced the power output from one of South Korea’s fleet of LNG-fired power plants. For example, SK E&S, an off-taker from the Freeport facility, lowered the operating rates of its LNG-fired power plants from 79% in 2021 to 71% in 2022 due to the supply shortage.

This prompted the company and KOGAS to purchase more expensive spot LNG to compensate for the losses. The U.S. LNG cargoes bought by South Korea were also costly, as prices were 16% higher than cargoes sold to Japan in 2022. These illustrate the potential risks of increasing LNG imports from the U.S.

Uncertain economics of the Alaska LNG project

The Alaska LNG project is one of several proposed export projects in the U.S. However, final investment decisions and commercial partnerships with buyers and financiers are still pending, and the project has experienced delays due to costs, market conditions, and geopolitical shifts.

Despite being proposed nearly two decades ago, the Alaska LNG project is still in its early stages of development. So far, no buyers have signed long-term purchase agreements. For LNG export projects to progress, at least 80% of output should be committed under such contracts to obtain financing.

In 2017, KOGAS signed a memorandum of understanding with the Alaska Gasline Development Corporation (AGDC) to develop the project. However, the state-run gas company stalled its rollout due to economic feasibility and strategic considerations.

LNG’s declining demand and limited role in the energy transition

South Korea’s declining LNG demand and the fuel’s diminishing role in the energy transition are key reasons why U.S. LNG imports should be approached cautiously. South Korea’s LNG imports have been on a downtrend since 2022, when they peaked at a historic high of 46.4MTPA. Despite imports rebounding in 2024 due to stronger industry demand amid lower prices, the downtrend will likely continue amid strengthening decarbonization efforts worldwide.

South Korea’s recently finalized 11th Basic Plan for Long-Term Electricity Supply and Demand (BPLE) also aims to reduce the share of gas from 28% to 10.55% by 2038 to reach its decarbonization goals by reducing fossil fuel dependency and increasing renewable energy generation in its power mix.",https://ieefa.org/sites/default/files/2025-06/shutterstock_1967657407.jpg,N,,2025-06-23 00:01:00.675048

Teslas were spotted early Sunday in a neighborhood called South Congress, with no one in the driver's seat but one person in the passenger seat.

The electric car maker planned a small trial with about 10 vehicles and front-seat riders acting as ""safety monitors,"" though it remained unclear how much control they had over the vehicles.

In recent days, the automaker sent invites to a select group of influencers for a carefully monitored robotaxi trial in a limited zone. The rides are being offered for a flat fee of $4.20, Musk said on X.

Tesla investor and social-media personality Sawyer Merritt posted videos on X Sunday afternoon showing him ordering, getting picked up, and taking a ride to a nearby bar and restaurant, Frazier's Long & Low, using a Tesla robotaxi app.

If Tesla succeeds with the small deployment, it still faces major challenges in delivering on Musk's promise to scale up quickly in Austin and other cities, industry experts say.

It could take years or decades for Tesla and self-driving rivals, such as Alphabet's Waymo, to fully develop a robotaxi industry, said Philip Koopman, a Carnegie Mellon University computer-engineering professor with expertise in autonomous-vehicle technology. A successful Austin trial for Tesla, he said, would be ""the end of the beginning — not the beginning of the end.""

Most of Tesla's sky-high stock value now rests on its ability to deliver robotaxis and humanoid robots, according to many industry analysts. Tesla is by far the world's most valuable automaker.

As Tesla's robotaxi-rollout date approached, Texas lawmakers moved to enact autonomous-vehicle rules. Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, a Republican, on Friday signed legislation requiring a state permit to operate self-driving vehicles.

The law, which takes effect Sept. 1, signals that state officials from both parties want the driverless-vehicle industry to proceed cautiously.

Tesla did not respond to requests for comment. The governor's office declined to comment. The law softens the state's previous anti-regulation stance on autonomous vehicles. A 2017 Texas law specifically prohibited cities from regulating self-driving cars.

The new law requires autonomous-vehicle operators to get approval from the Texas Department of Motor Vehicles before operating on public streets without a human driver. It gives state authorities the power to revoke permits for operators they deem a public danger.

The law also requires firms to provide information on how first responders can deal with their driverless vehicles in emergency situations.

The law's permit requirements for an ""automated motor vehicle"" are not onerous but require firms to attest their vehicles can operate legally and safely. It defines an automated vehicle as having at least Level 4 autonomous-driving capability under a recognized standard, meaning it can operate with no human driver under specified conditions. Level 5 autonomy is the top level and means a car can drive itself anywhere, under any conditions.

Compliance remains far easier than in some states, notably California, which requires submission of vehicle-testing data under state oversight. Bryant Walker Smith, a University of South Carolina law professor who focuses on autonomous driving, said it appears any company that meets minimum application requirements will get a Texas permit — but could also lose it if problems arise.

""California permits are hard to get, easy to lose,"" he said. ""In Texas, the permit is easy to get and easy to lose.""

East Coast Hydrogen will repurpose and build new gas pipelines to deliver clean hydrogen at scale across the North East, the Humber region, Yorkshire and the East Midlands – a critical step on the UK’s journey to clean, secure energy.

East Coast Hydrogen will play a key role in helping power generation and heavy industry across the East Coast transition from natural gas – replacing it with low-carbon hydrogen to protect jobs, keep the lights on and deliver the infrastructure needed to support the UK’s future hydrogen economy.

Ofgem has now confirmed its support for East Coast Hydrogen – a partnership led by National Gas, Cadent and Northern Gas Networks – by awarding around £96 million in funding to carry out engineering, planning and public consultation on proposals. This follows the £500 million announced by Government last week for regional hydrogen transport and storage networks as part of the Spending Review.

It will pave the way for delivery of a hydrogen-ready pipeline network which is expected to be delivered over the next decade and make a major contribution to the UK’s decarbonisation efforts.

This latest funding ensures work can continue at pace on the infrastructure needed to deliver that transformation.

Jon Butterworth, Chief Executive Officer at National Gas, said:

'This funding marks a crucial step in building the infrastructure needed to unlock the UK’s hydrogen economy at scale.

'At National Gas, we’re committed to enabling the UK’s transition to a low-carbon energy system that is secure, cost-effective, and future-ready. Project Union, our plan to create a 1,500-mile core hydrogen network across Great Britain, will start in the East Coast and this funding will support that ambition.

'By repurposing existing infrastructure, we will connect hydrogen production, storage, and demand, helping to deliver flexible electricity, decarbonise industry, and protect jobs in some of the UK’s most energy-intensive regions.'

Steve Fraser, Chief Executive Officer at Cadent, said:

'This funding marks a major milestone and is very welcome news: not just in terms of this specific project, but for the UK’s entire energy transition. Ofgem’s support will allow our partnership to forge ahead with the vital planning and engagement work that is needed to fully realise this important project.

'East Coast Hydrogen is exactly the type of pioneering partnership that’s needed on the path towards achieving net zero. It not only lays the foundations for the creation of a new low-carbon network, but it will also protect jobs, support industry, and help deliver on national ambitions for growth via the creation of new green skills and jobs, with the benefits being felt right across the country.'

Mark Horsley, Chief Executive at Northern Gas Networks, said:

'Our East Coast Hydrogen partnership represents a clear route to driving growth for regional economies, job creation and decarbonisation support for industries that otherwise would find it difficult to meet net zero targets.

'This funding is essential to determining the technical work needed to build hydrogen infrastructure, in order to understand how a hydrogen network can be operational in time to meet government net zero plans.'

Ofgem’s decision signals confidence in the region’s ability to help lead the UK’s hydrogen transition and opens the door to thousands of jobs and future investment in key industrial heartlands.

East Coast Hydrogen is expected to move into the delivery phase later this decade, with the aim of starting hydrogen flows from the early 2030s.

It brings together over 120 organisations across key sectors including hydrogen producers, power generators, industry, energy networks, airports and hospitals.

From decarbonising industry to reducing the carbon footprint of everyday products and services, the shared ambition is to build a hydrogen economy that reduces emissions and generates secure energy, economic growth and new domestic jobs.

Darren Hall, Raw Materials Buyer at Verallia UK, said:

'As a significant energy user with ambitious decarbonisation plans, we’re delighted to hear East Coast Hydrogen has secured its next phase.

‘Verallia UK Ltd is a critical cog in the food supply chain, supplying glass packaging in to the food and beverage industry in the UK and abroad. We see the East Coast Hydrogen network playing a critical role in supporting those plans and ensuring glass is a sustainable packaging choice for the future.'

The study analyzed over 2.2 million 1- to 5-year-old used cars sold in May 2023 and 2024 and found that the average used EV price is down 29.5 percent year-over-year versus 6.1 percent for the average used gas car price. In May 2024, the average used electric vehicle was priced at $28,767, or 8.3 percent below the average gas car at $31,424. These prices show a major turnaround from a year ago, when the average used EV cost $40,783 and the average used gas car cost $33,469.

Used Electric Vehicle Market Crashing

“There’s no denying the crash in used electric vehicle values over the past year,” said Karl Brauer, Executive Analyst at iSeeCars. “We’ve watched EVs prices fall between 30 and 40 percent since June of last year, while the average gas car’s price has dropped by just 3 to 7 percent in that same timeframe.”

While electric vehicle values appeared to stabilize at the end of 2023, they experienced a substantial drop in February this year and have continued to decline over the past four months. At the same time, the average used gas car price has shifted by approximately $400 during those same four months.

“It’s clear used car shoppers will no longer pay a premium for electric vehicles and, in fact, consider electric powertrains a detractor, making them less desirable – and valuable – than traditional models,” said Brauer.

Used Gas Car Prices Showing Stability

Demand for used gas cars grew during the new car production shortages brought on by the pandemic. This demand pressure is slowly easing, but with used prices hovering around $31,000 they remain well above pre-pandemic levels.

“Over the past year the average used price for traditional internal combustion engine vehicles has never shifted by more than 7 percent, with most months changing between 3 and 6 percent,” said Karl Brauer. “This is in stark contrast to the 30 to 40 percent drops in used EV pricing.”

Used EV Prices Continue To Crash

The ongoing crash in used electric vehicle prices pulled their values below the average used gas cars in February and shows no sign of stopping.

“While the drop in used EV prices is dramatic, what’s more disconcerting is no indication of used EV values stabilizing,” said Brauer. “At some point used EV prices will have to bottom out, but we don’t appear to be at that point yet.”

EV Models Lead the Drop in Used Car Values

When ranking used cars by the biggest price drops over the past year, electric vehicles take up the first seven slots and make up eight of the top 10 models with the largest drops in pricing.

Methodology

iSeeCars analyzed over 2.2 million 1- to 5-year-old used cars sold in May 2023 and 2024. The average listing prices of each car model were compared between the two time periods, and the differences were expressed as both a percentage difference from the 2023 price as well as a dollar difference. Heavy-duty vehicles, low-volume vehicles, vehicles discontinued as of the 2023 model year, and vehicles in production for fewer than four of the last five model years for each period were excluded from further analysis.

—

Earlier this month, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) put forward a proposal to repeal all greenhouse gas emissions standards for the power sector, dealing another blow to climate action.

The new rules target pollution control standards for coal and gas power plants established by the EPA under the Clean Air Act in 2015 as well as Biden-era regulations to phase out emissions from electricity-producing fossil fuel plants.

EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin earlier this month said that greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuel-fired power plants “do not contribute significantly to dangerous air pollution,” when in reality, they are a major contributor and a huge threat to human health. Carbon dioxide (CO2), a by-product of burning fossil fuels, is the principal anthropogenic greenhouse gas in the atmosphere.

“This is the scientific equivalent to saying that smoking doesn’t cause lung cancer,” climate scientist Zeke Hausfather said in response to Zeldin’s claim.

The health benefits associated with reducing long-term exposure to air pollution are significant, as exposure to toxic pollutants has been found to cause certain types of cancer, such as lymphoma, leukemia, breast cancer and liver cancer and even lead to premature death. Approximately 7 million people die each year from air pollution globally.

Zeldin and Energy Secretary Chris Wright anticipated the administration’s move when they publicly attacked the EPA’s Endangerment Finding earlier this year, threatening to end it.

“The 2009 Endangerment finding has had an enormously negative impact on the lives of the American people for more than 15 years. It’s past time the United States ensures the basis for issuing environmental regulations follows the science and betters human lives,” said Wright.

Issued in 2009, the finding revealed that greenhouse gases in the atmosphere can endanger both public health and the environment for current and future generations. The proposed rules effectively dismiss these findings, enabling weaker power plant regulations by overturning the original restriction.

Mercury

The new proposal also targets the Mercury and Air Toxics Standards (MATS), which former president Joe Biden toughened last year. The new rule would cut emissions limits for toxic substances like nickel, arsenic, and lead by two-thirds and reduce regulation on mercury emissions by 70%.

44% of all manmade mercury emissions come from burning coal for electricity. Power plants that burn coal to create electricity are the largest source of mercury emissions in the US, though activities involving the burning of electronic waste such as phones and batteries, as well as steel production, also generate mercury emissions.

Overexposure to mercury is linked to health issues such as speech impairment, hearing, walking or muscle weakness, insomnia, and changes in nerve responses, possibly even leading to memory loss. Exposure to methylmercury, a highly toxic form of mercury that is formed by bacteria in water and soil, can adversely affect unborn infants’ growing brains and nervous systems, children exposed to methylmercury while they are in the womb can have impacts on their cognitive thinking, memory, attention, language, fine motor skills, and visual spatial skills.

‘Legally Baseless’

The Trump administration described the new rules as necessary to restore American energy dominance by removing undue burdens on coal-fired plants, and as a way to accomplish the EPA’s “core mission” of protecting human health and the environment. But critics warn that these rollbacks will have serious repercussions on the health of millions of Americans.

“It would lead to the biggest pollution increases in decades and is a blatant give-away to polluters,” more than 200 health experts wrote in the letter published after the EPA’s announcement. They added that any attempt to reverse the endangerment finding would be “legally baseless”, and would harm communities already suffering from the impacts of climate changes, like extreme heat.

According to the Sierra Club, a grassroots environmental organization, rolling back the EPA’s standards limiting emissions from gas- and coal-fired power plants would release seven times as much CO2 as they currently put into the atmosphere. “This repeal means more climate disasters, more heart attacks, more asthma attacks, more birth defects, more premature deaths,” said Patrick Drupp, the Sierra Club Climate Policy Director.

Howard Frumkin, Director of the CDC’s National Center for Environmental Health, warned that the rollbacks will have “major, direct consequences” for the health and well-being of Americans, adding that “Americans will die needlessly.”

“They would lead to more illnesses, which in turn would mean more days missing school and work, more visits to doctors and hospitalizations, and increased medical costs,” said Vickie Patton, General Counsel of Environmental Defense Fund.",https://earth.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/marcin-jozwiak-uKvPDQop-JA-unsplash-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-06-22 21:01:36.563321

Many of the places most brutally exposed to out-of-kilter weather patterns and natural disasters are in the global south, and rightly demand solidarity from the wealthier countries responsible for most historical emissions. But the costs of the emergency are being felt everywhere.

Three nuggets from the last week alone: first, chocolate prices in the UK increased at a record annual rate of 18% rate last month, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS), driven by repeated weather-related failures of the cocoa crop in west Africa.

Second, research by Bloomberg Intelligence calculated that an extraordinary $1tn was spent in the US last year on rebuilding and recovery after climate disasters such as wildfires and floods.

The analysis highlighted the benefits for companies specialising in repair and resilience (the DIY chain Home Depot gets a mention, for example, as does the cement-maker Heidelberg), but rightly pointed out that these are resources that have to be diverted from other purposes.

“Climate-related disasters are redistributing trillions of dollars in global spending away from the broader economy to pay for the costs of repairing the damage from the last fire, flood and storm and preparing for the next one,” as the authors put it.

And third, a deeply depressing paper by US academics, for the IZA Institute of Labor Economics, was highlighted by Ruth Curtice of the Resolution Foundation. It showed that wildfires, which are becoming increasingly prevalent, have a direct impact on jobs and earnings because the smoke affects the health of people many miles away from the centre of the blaze.

Researchers found that the impact over a typically smoky year knocks as much as 2%, or $125bn, off the total earnings of US workers – with older employees feeling the worst effects. That’s a health crisis and an economic challenge, too.

Even in wealthy countries, in other words, the climate emergency is absorbing an ever-expanding share of resources and causing repeated cost shocks.

For policymakers contemplating this “age of shifts and breaks”, as the ECB chief Christine Lagarde has called it, another fascinating piece of research published last week – not specifically about climate, but about cost shocks more generally – provided some worrying context.

Isabella Weber and her colleagues analysed transcripts of more than 100,000 “earnings calls” – the crucial meetings at which companies update their investors – from almost 5,000 US companies between 2007 and 2022, and cross-checked them against data on costs across the economy.

They found that during cost shocks – when everyone knows costs are going up – companies feel emboldened to push up prices and build their profit margins.

Scrutinising the language used on the calls, Weber et al suggest executives tend to calculate that they won’t lose market share, because rival companies will also raise prices, and assume the public will be more understanding than during normal times.

It’s not that CEOs put their heads together and cook up a top-secret plan to make bumper profits in the teeth of a crisis – instead, an economy-wide cost shock acts as what the authors call an “implicit coordination mechanism”.

This is what Weber and co call “sellers’ inflation” – driven not by the demands of workers for higher wages, which companies then pass on to consumers, but by opportunistic behaviour from bosses.

They don’t argue that this is necessarily the main driver of inflation during crises such as the Covid pandemic, but that this “markup increase” channel is significant – and makes managing inflation more complex.

“If, in the face of major supply shocks, firms do not absorb cost increases but instead perceive them as good news – as they facilitate price hikes and hence higher profits – this has important implications for price stability in a world of overlapping emergencies,” they warn.

Climate change is one such emergency – alongside burgeoning global conflicts, and the dismantling of long-established trading relationships. And as it hits food production in particular, it appears likely to continue presenting policymakers with cost shocks.

The main weapon of central banks – raising interest rates – is a very blunt one against this particular species of inflation.

Weber argues instead for a “toolbox approach” that includes building up “buffer stocks” of essential commodities (chocolate, sadly, seems unlikely to qualify), cracking down on companies taking unfair advantage of economic shocks, and in extremis, price controls.

Another recent plea for policymakers to think differently about climate-driven inflation came from a pair of researchers at the LSE’s Grantham Research Institute.

David Barmes and Luiz Awazu Pereira da Silva advocate “adaptive inflation targeting,” in what they call a “hot and volatile world”.

They argue that given the likelihood of increasingly frequent climate cost shocks, policymakers would be wise to tolerate, or “look through,” these short-term blips more willingly than they do at present.

They suggest politicians might also want to allow central banks to temporarily target a higher inflation rate at times of repeated shocks, and perhaps allow more leeway around the target, too.

Keeping rates high to squash climate-driven inflation has no impact on the underlying problem, Barmes and Pereira da Silva argue, and raises government borrowing costs, just as public investment in the green transition is urgently needed.

If you’re hesitant about electric vehicles (EV), it’s likely that your top concerns include how far you can drive in a single charge, how long it takes to charge the battery, and how much this advanced tech will cost you. And you’re not alone.

According to Deloitte’s 2025 Global Automotive Consumer Study, nearly half of U.S. consumers (49%) still say that available battery driving range is their biggest worry about EVs. That’s followed closely by the time required to charge (46%) and the lingering cost premium (44%) associated with battery electric vehicles.

But that narrative may finally be flipping. Just this past week, two developments showcase how much EV technology has evolved over the past decade: China’s BYD is breaking new grounds on just how far you can drive an EV on a single 12-minute charge. Meanwhile, the Nissan Leaf, seen as the first mass-market EV in 2010, is getting an impressive upgrade even as it remains one of the most affordable options on the market.

BYD’s bold battery bet

Chinese auto giant BYD, already the world’s top-selling EV manufacturer, may have just redrawn the limits of battery performance. According to Chinese media, and other reports, the company is testing a new solid-state battery that can add 900 miles of range in just 12 minutes of charging.

Let that sink in. That’s nearly four times the range of many current EVs—enough to drive from New York to Chicago —and charging that’s as fast as a coffee stop.

The battery in question is being trialed in a prototype vehicle reportedly based on BYD’s Seal sedan, and one model even achieved over 1,000 miles of total range in early tests. It uses solid-state battery chemistry, which replaces the liquid electrolyte found in traditional lithium-ion cells with a solid electrolyte, improving safety, energy density, and—clearly—charging speed.

Unlike conventional lithium-ion batteries, solid-state variants are less prone to overheating, can be charged at higher rates, and take up less space, allowing more energy to be packed into a smaller space. Toyota, QuantumScape, and others have been developing this tech for years, but BYD’s real-world trials might give it a huge first-mover advantage.

This leap in performance doesn’t just make EVs more appealing—it threatens to make current battery standards obsolete.

Nissan’s Redemption Arc

If BYD represents the future, Nissan is hoping to reboot its own place in the EV conversation by reinventing the car that started it all: the Nissan Leaf.

When the Leaf debuted in 2010, it was a revolutionary moment—the first mass-market electric vehicle. With a 24 kWh battery and a real-world range of about 75 miles, it wasn’t meant to cross continents but to commute quietly and cleanly. And at around $32,000, it was seen as an affordable gateway into a gas-free lifestyle.

Still, it didn’t take long for Tesla to steal the spotlight. By 2012, the Model S had arrived with 265 miles of range, but it came with a far steeper price tag—between $57,000 and $87,000—and didn’t exactly cater to the average buyer. The Leaf had affordability; Tesla had performance. But over the next decade, Nissan stopped investing in EV tech and the Leaf barely improved, while competitors caught up.

Now, Nissan’s finally stepping back into the ring.

The 2026 Nissan Leaf has shed its econobox styling in favor of a sleek new hatchback body, powered by a liquid-cooled battery and equipped with Tesla’s NACS charging port—meaning it can now plug directly into Tesla’s Supercharger network. Range? Up to 300 miles. That’s a fourfold improvement from the original.

The new Leaf also comes with a revamped infotainment system featuring native Google Maps with EV route planning, a wireless charging pad, and a suite of driver-assistance tech under the umbrella of Nissan ProPILOT. Using sensors and cameras, it enables semi-autonomous driving, helping the Leaf catch up to the competition.

Here’s the kicker: despite the upgrades, Nissan aims to keep the price roughly in line with the original—which means we’re likely looking at something around $32,000–$35,000 before tax credits.

For a tech-packed EV with 300 miles of range and Supercharger compatibility, that’s an aggressive play. It repositions the Leaf not just as a nostalgic nameplate, but as a genuine competitor for entry-level EV shoppers.

The Road Ahead

The EV world has changed dramatically since 2010. What started as a slow, expensive, and often uncertain journey into electrification has accelerated into a global arms race for innovation.

On one end, you’ve got BYD pushing technological boundaries that could make 1,000-mile EVs as common as V6 engines once were. On the other, Nissan is trying to rewrite the Leaf’s history, proving that affordability and advancement don’t have to be mutually exclusive.

Business reporter & Transport correspondent

Reporting from Guangzhou

""I drive an electric vehicle because I am poor,"" says Lu Yunfeng, a private hire driver, who is at a charging station on the outskirts of Guangzhou in the south of China.

Standing nearby, Sun Jingguo agrees. ""The cost of driving a petrol car is too expensive. I save money driving an electric vehicle,"" he says.

""Also, it protects the environment,"" he adds, leaning against his white Beijing U7 model.

It's the kind of conversation climate campaigners dream of hearing. In many countries, electric vehicles (EVs) are considered luxury purchases.

But here in China - where almost half of all cars sold last year were electric - it's a banal reality.

'King of the hill'

At the beginning of the century, China's leadership laid out plans to dominate the technologies of the future. Once a nation of bicycles China is now the world's leader in EVs.

For Guangzhou's more than 18 million people, the roar of the rush hour has become a hum.

""When it comes to EVs, China is 10 years ahead and 10 times better than any other country,"" says auto sector analyst Michael Dunne.

China's BYD now leads the global EV market, after overtaking US rival Tesla earlier this year.

BYD's sales have been helped by a vast domestic market of more than 1.4 billion people and it is now looking to sell more cars overseas. So too are a raft of other Chinese start-ups that make affordable EVs for the mass market.

So how did China build this lead, and can it be caught?

The master plan

In tracing the origins of China's EV dominance, analysts often credit Wan Gang - a German-trained engineer who became China's minister of trade and science in 2007.

""He looked around and said, 'Good news: we are now the largest car market in the world. Bad news: on the streets of Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou all I see is foreign brands',"" says Mr Dunne.

At the time, Chinese brands simply couldn't compete with the European, American and Japanese car makers for quality and prestige. These companies had an unassailable head start when it came to producing petrol or diesel-powered cars.

But China did have ample resources, a skilled labour force and an ecosystem of suppliers in the motor industry. So Mr Wan decided to ""change the game and flip the script by moving to electrics"", according to Mr Dunne.

This was the master plan.

Even though the Chinese government had included EVs in its five-year economic blueprint as early as 2001, it wasn't until the 2010s that it started to provide vast amounts of subsidies to grow the industry.

China, unlike Western democracies, has the capacity to mobilise huge swathes of its economy over many years towards its aims.

The country's mammoth infrastructure projects and dominance in manufacturing are a testament to this.

A US think tank, the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), estimates that from 2009 to the end of 2023, Beijing spent around $231bn (£172bn) developing the EV industry.

From consumers and carmakers to electricity providers and battery suppliers, everyone in China is entitled to money and assistance when it comes to EVs.

It encouraged BYD, for example, to switch from making smartphone batteries to focusing on producing EVs.

Ningde-based CATL - which supplies firms such as Tesla, Volkswagen and Ford - was founded in 2011 and now produces a third of all the batteries used for EVs worldwide.

This combination of long-term planning and government funding also allowed China to dominate critical supply chains in battery production.

It has helped build the world's largest public charging network with stations concentrated in big cities, which put drivers just minutes away from the nearest charger.

""If you want to manufacture a battery to put into an electric car today, all roads go through China,"" says Mr Dunne.

Some refer to this as ""state capitalism"". Western countries call it unfair business practice.

Chinese EV executives insist all companies, domestic or foreign, have access to the same resources.

As a result, they argue, China now has a thriving EV start-up sector, driven by fierce competition and a culture of innovation.

""The Chinese government is doing the same thing you see in Europe and in the US - providing policy support, consumer encouragement and infrastructure,"" Brian Gu, president of EV maker XPeng, tells the BBC.

""But I think China has done it consistently and in a way that really fosters the most competitive landscape that there is. There's no favouritism to anybody,"" he adds.

XPeng is one of the ""Chinese champions"", as Mr Gu puts it, driving the industry forward. Barely a decade old and yet to turn a profit, the start-up is already in the world's top 10 EV producers.

The company has attracted some of China's top young graduates to its headquarters in Guangzhou, where casually dressed staff sip flat whites and internet streamers sell cars live in the showroom.

A brightly coloured slide taking employees from the top to the ground floor would seem more at home in Silicon Valley than China's industrial heartland.

Despite the relaxed atmosphere, Mr Gu says the pressure to offer consumers better cars at lower prices is ""immense"".

The BBC was invited on a test drive of XPeng's Mona Max, which has just gone on sale in China for around $20,000.

For this price you get self-driving capability, voice activation, lie-flat beds, film and music streaming. Young Chinese graduates, we're told, see all these as standard features for a first car purchase.

""The new generation of EV makers... look at cars as a different animal,"" says David Li, the co-founder and chief executive of Hesai, which makes the Lidar sensing technology used in many self-driving cars.

'An EV makes sense for me'

Young Chinese consumers are certainly attracted to top-of-the-range technology, but a huge amount of government spending goes towards making EVs financially attractive, according to the CSIS study.

Members of the public receive subsidies for trading in their non-electric car for an EV as well as tax exemptions and subsidised rates at public charging stations.

These perks drove Mr Lu to go electric two years ago. He used to pay 200 yuan ($27.84; £20.72) to fill up his car for 400km (248 miles) of driving. It now costs him a quarter of that.

People in China also normally pay thousands for their vehicle registration plate - sometimes more than the cost of the car itself - as part of government efforts to limit congestion and pollution. Mr Lu now gets his green one for free.

""The rich drive petrol cars because they have unlimited resources,"" Mr Lu says. ""An EV just makes sense for me.""

Another proud EV owner in Shanghai, who wanted to use her English name Daisy, says that rather than charge her vehicle at a station, she changes her car's battery at one of the city's many automated swapping stations provided by EV maker Nio.

In under three minutes, machines replace her flat battery with a fully charged one. It's state of the art technology for less than the price of a tank of fuel.

The road ahead

The government subsidies at the heart of China's EV growth are seen as unfair by countries looking to protect their car industries.

The US, Canada and the European Union have all imposed substantial import taxes on Chinese EVs.

However, the UK says it's not planning to follow suit - making it an attractive market for firms like XPeng, which started delivering its G6 model to British consumers in March, and BYD, which launched its Dolphin Surf model this month in the UK, and is available for as little as $26,100.

This should be music to the ears of Western governments that enthusiastically back the transition to EVs, which the United Nations calls ""pivotal"" to avert climate disaster.

Several Western countries, including the UK, say they will ban the sale of petrol and diesel cars by 2030. No country is better placed to help make this a reality than China.

""The Chinese are thinking about a future where they manufacture just about every single car for the world. They're looking around saying, 'Can anybody do it better than us?'"" says Mr Dunne.

""Leaders in Detroit, Nagoya, Germany, UK, everywhere around the world, are shaking their heads. It's a new era, and the Chinese are feeling very confident about their prospects right now.""

Despite the environmental benefits, there is still suspicion about what relying on Chinese technology could bring.

Britain's former head of MI6, Sir Richard Dearlove, recently called Chinese EVs ""computers on wheels"" that can be ""controlled from Beijing"".

His claim that Chinese EVs could one day immobilise British cities was dismissed by BYD's executive vice-president Stella Li in a recent BBC interview.

""Anyone can claim anything if they lose the game. But so what?"" she said.

""BYD pays for a very high standard of data security. We use local carriers for all our data. In fact we do it 10 times better than our competition.""

Nevertheless Sir Richard's concerns echo previous national security debates surrounding Chinese technology.

This includes telecoms infrastructure maker Huawei, whose equipment was banned in several Western countries, as well as the social media app TikTok, which is prohibited on UK government devices.

But for Sun Jingguo in Guangzhou, the message is simple.

""I think the world should thank China for bringing this technology to the world,"" he laughs. ""I do.""

Separately, heavy industries like steel, chemicals and glass will have their network charges, paid to maintain the grid, discounted by 90% from next year – up from 60% currently. This will help around 500 firms, according to a statement.

Article content

UK manufacturers have long complained about the crippling cost of energy in the UK, which is among the highest in the developed world. Some of that is down to climate levies like feed-in tariffs and the renewables obligation.

Article content

The energy exemptions are the highlight of the government’s Industrial Strategy, a 10-year plan to lift investment and make it easier to do business in the UK. The full plan is released on Monday.

Article content

Prime Minister Keir Starmer said the strategy “marks a turning point for Britain’s economy and a clear break from the short-termism and sticking plasters of the past.”

Article content

The government has been struggling to drive economic growth since hitting businesses with a £26 billion ($35 billion) tax on jobs and higher minimum wage, both of which came into effect in April. GDP that month shrank 0.3% and the Bank of England has warned of underlying weakness in the economy.

Article content

Article content

Labour insisted the exemptions would complement its “long-term mission for clean power” and would not be paid for by raising household bills or taxes. Instead, they will be “funded through reforms to the energy system,” specifically higher UK carbon pricing. As part of the recent trade deal with the European Union, the government agreed to rejoin the EU carbon market.

A recent study by the Institute of Energy Economics and Financial Analysis found that the government would have raised an extra £2.9 billion over 2024-25 and 2025-26 had it matched the EU’s emissions trading scheme.

They promise a new way to provide heat and electricity that is cheaper than current nuclear power plants, being faster to build, easily scalable, and inherently safer.
However, it is in line with American legislation and executive orders going back to 2019, as well as the current administration's commitment to increasing US energy production and promoting nuclear energy in general, so it is a significant advancement.
The reactor would provide heat as well as light, which is important in Alaska, where it can reach minus 50 °F (-45 °C).
""This microreactor pilot could position Alaska and the nation at the forefront of energy innovation – leading us to a new era of safe, secure, and reliable energy,"" said Secretary of the Air Force Troy Meink.","In a major milestone for modular nuclear power on the way to the mainstream, the US Department of the Air Force has issued a Notice of Intent to Award (NOITA) to Oklo that may lead to the construction and operation of a military reactor in Fairbanks, Alaska.

Small nuclear reactors yielding less than 50 MW that can be mass produced in factories and shipped to where needed have very much been in the news in recent years. They promise a new way to provide heat and electricity that is cheaper than current nuclear power plants, being faster to build, easily scalable, and inherently safer.

Such reactors are also a power source that's much easier to set up in remote locations, which is why the US military is so interested in them. Presently, the Air Force wants to test that concept at Eielson Air Force Base (AFB), located 26 miles (42 km) southeast of Fairbanks, Alaska, as a way of replacing the tonnes of coal that regularly have to be shipped in to power the facility.

The latest agreement was made in coordination with the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) Energy Office and is not a firm contract, so many technical details about what the Alaskan reactors would look like are unknown. However, it is in line with American legislation and executive orders going back to 2019, as well as the current administration's commitment to increasing US energy production and promoting nuclear energy in general, so it is a significant advancement.

If a contract is awarded, it will be for a 30-year power fixed-price purchase agreement after securing an NRC license that will include construction, operation, maintenance, and decommissioning of the reactor.

Based on previous designs, the new demonstration reactor will have an output of about 5 MW and provide part of the base's 35-MW requirements, though the modular design allows for easy scalability by adding more modules if need be. The reactor would provide heat as well as light, which is important in Alaska, where it can reach minus 50 °F (-45 °C).

The type of reactor built will depend on the kind of nuclear fuel selected. The main candidates are some form of high-assay, low-enriched uranium (HALEU), with uranium-235 concentrations higher than that found in conventional commercial power reactors, or TRISO (Tristructural-isotropic) pebbles, where each spherical uranium particle is encapsulated by multiple protective layers of carbon and ceramics. Both of these share the ability to operate for up to 15 years without refueling.

""This microreactor pilot could position Alaska and the nation at the forefront of energy innovation – leading us to a new era of safe, secure, and reliable energy,"" said Secretary of the Air Force Troy Meink.

Would you settle for 10 or 12?

Musk appears to be on the verge of making his robotaxi vision a reality with a test run of a small squad of self-driving cabs in Austin, Texas, that began Sunday. Reaching a million may take a year or more, however, although the billionaire should be able to expand the service this year if the Austin demo is a success.

The stakes couldn't be higher, nor the challenges.

While Musk was making those “next year” promises, rival Waymo was busy deploying driverless taxis in Los Angeles, San Diego, Austin and other cities by using a different technology that allowed it to get to market faster. It just completed its 10 millionth paid ride.

Boycotts related to Musk's politics have tanked Tesla's sales. Rival electric vehicle makers with newly competitive models have stolen market share. And investors are on edge after a $150 billion stock wipeout when Musk picked a social media fight with a U.S. president overseeing federal car regulators who could make the robotaxi rollout much more difficult. The stock has recovered somewhat after Musk said he regretted some of his remarks.

Tesla shareholders have stood by Musk over the years because he’s defied the odds by building a successful standalone electric vehicle company — self-driving car promises aside — and making them a lot of money in the process. A decade ago, Tesla shares traded for around $18. The shares closed Friday at $322.

Musk seemed jubilant Sunday morning, posting on X, “The @Tesla_AI robotaxi launch begins in Austin this afternoon with customers paying a $4.20 flat fee!”

The test is beginning modestly enough. Tesla is remotely monitoring the vehicles and putting a person in the passenger seat in case of trouble. The number of Teslas deployed will also be small — just 10 or 12 vehicles — and will only pick up passengers in a limited, geofenced area.

Musk has vowed that the service will quickly spread to other cities, eventually reaching hundreds of thousands if not a million vehicles next year.

Some Musk watchers on Wall Street are skeptical.

“How quickly can he expand the fleet?” asks Garrett Nelson, an analyst at CFRA. “We're talking maybe a dozen vehicles initially. It's very small.""

Morningstar's Seth Goldstein says Musk is being classic Musk: Promising too much, too quickly.

“When anyone in Austin can download the app and use a robotaxi, that will be a success, but I don't think that will happen until 2028,"" he says. “Testing is going to take a while.”

Musk's tendency to push up the stock high with a bit of hyperbole is well known among investors.

In 2018, he told Tesla stockholders he had “funding secured” to buy all their shares at a massive premium and take the company private. But he not only lacked a written commitment from financiers, according to federal stock regulators who fined him, he hadn't discussed the loan amount or other details with them.

More recently, Musk told CNBC in May that Tesla was experiencing a “major rebound” in demand. A week later an auto trade group in Europe announced sales had plunged by half.

Musk has come under fire for allegedly exaggerating the ability of the system used for its cars to drive themselves, starting with the name. Full Self-Driving is a misnomer. The system still requires drivers to keep their eyes on the road because they may need to intervene and take control at any moment.

Federal highway safety regulators opened an investigation into FSD last year after several accidents, and the Department of Justice has conducted its own probe, though the status of that is not known. Tesla has also faced lawsuits over the feature, some resulting in settlements, other dismissed. In one case, a judge ruled against the plaintiffs but only because they hadn't proved Musk “knowingly” made false statements.

Musk says the robotaxis will be running on an improved version of Full Self-Driving and the cabs will be safe.

He also says the service will be able to expand rapidly around the country. His secret weapon: Millions of Tesla owners now on the roads. He says an over-the-air software update will soon allow them to turn their cars into driverless cabs and start a side business while stuck at the office for eight hours or on vacation for a week.

“Instead of having your car sit in the parking lot, your car could be earning money,” Musk said earlier this year, calling it an Airbnb model for cars. “You will be able to add or subtract your car to the fleet.”

Musk says Tesla also can move fast to deploy taxis now because of his decision to rely only on cameras for the cars to navigate, unlike Waymo, which has gone a more expensive route by supplementing its cameras with lasers and radar.

“Tesla will have, I don’t know,” Musk mused in an conference call with investors, ”99% market share or something ridiculous.” Given Waymo's head start and potential competition from Amazon and others, dominating the driverless market to that extent could be a reach.

But Dan Ives, a Wedbush Securities analyst and big Musk fan, says this time Musk may actually pull it off because of Tesla's ability to scale up quickly. And even skeptics like Morningstar's Goldstein acknowledge that Musk occasionally does gets things right, and spectacularly so.

He upended the car industry by getting people to buy expensive electric vehicles, brought his Starlink satellite internet service to rural areas and, more recently, performed a gee-whiz trick of landing an unmanned SpaceX rocket on a platform back on earth.

“Maybe his timelines aren’t realistic,"" Goldstein says, “but he can develop futuristic technology products.”","https://www.detroitnews.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/06/22/PDTN/84310082007-ap-25173749006223.jpg?crop=5994,3371,x0,y584&width=3200&height=1800&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-06-22 20:05:17.025543

— Rayne van den Berg, Values Australia

LONDON, ENGLAND , UNITED KINGDOM, June 21, 2025 /EINPresswire.com/ -- Today London Climate Action Week commences which will be attended by some 45,000 people. One of the key themes is mobilizing public and private finance to support global climate goals and transitions, particularly in the lead-up to COP30.

To advance this mission, ten leading forestry companies are today announcing they will quantify and value a set of ecosystem services with the aim of building the foundation for an investible market. These entities own or manage millions of hectares of forests in 21 countries.

The 18-month project, an initiative of the International Sustainable Forestry Coalition (ISFC), will be supported by Value Australia (part of the Capitals Coalition) and the Taskforce on Nature Related Financial Disclosures (TNFD).

Independent Chair of the ISFC, Dr David Brand said, “The world must begin to increase investments with positive impacts on both climate and nature. However, if we are to attract the scale of funding required these investments must also make economic sense. The global forestry sector can deliver sustainable, renewable materials as well as positive outcomes for climate and nature. Central to this is standardizing the accounting for the extensive natural capital assets managed by these companies. ISFC members wish to be at the forefront of this work and have therefore decided to come together to build out mutually supporting Natural Capital reports.”

Mark Gough, Chief Executive Officer of Capitals Coalition said, “The contribution that the forestry sector can make has often been undervalued. The ISFC is stepping up to address this by working with the Capitals Coalition and TNFD to produce consistent accounts and disclosures that can reflect the true value of forestry.”

Rayne van den Berg, Chief Value Officer at Value Australia (a regional Capitals Coalition hub), said, “Many individual companies and thought leaders have worked for years to develop frameworks and methodologies to quantify and value Natural Capital with the aim of providing better information for more informed decision-making. This project will be a ‘game-changer’ as, for the first time, a collective of leading forestry companies will develop consistent reports for their most material ecosystem services and the approach taken to quantifying impacts and dependencies.”

Tony Goldner, Chief Executive Officer of the Taskforce for Nature Related Financial Disclosures said, “TNFD is pleased to support this collective effort as ISFC has been able to bring together an impressive range of forestry sector players prepared to work together for the good of nature and climate outcomes, balanced with delivering returns. The TNFD framework, and the LEAP process, being adopted by enterprises all over the world, provides the frame of reference for this project. The missing piece of that puzzle has been the valuation of ecosystem services, which must occur if we are to pivot globally away from nature destructive investments to nature enhancing capital flows. TNFD will utilize the learnings from this project to help inform its guidance and to demonstrate the link between TNFD Nature-related assessments and Natural Capital Accounting for Valuation and presentation.”

About the ISFC:

The ISFC currently represents 17 major forestry companies across the world which steward some 18 million hectares in 37 different countries on all six forest growing continents. The ISFC is open to applications for membership from those which share its vision and meet its requirements. Read more at https://is-fc.com/

Those currently taking part steward estates in 21 countries: Australia/ Brazil/ Cambodia/ Canada/ China/ Estonia/ Finland/ Indonesia/ Ireland/ Japan/ Laos/ Mozambique/ New Zealand/ Papua New Guinea/ Romania/ Solomon Islands/ Sweden/ Tanzania/ Uganda/ United Kingdom/ USA/ Uruguay

About the Capitals Coalition:

The Capitals Coalition is a global collaboration of the leading initiatives involved in measuring and valuing natural, social, and human capital, providing best-in-class technical expertise and deep understanding of this evolving space. https://capitalscoalition.org/

About the TNFD:

The Taskforce on Nature-related Financial Disclosures (TNFD) is comprised of 40 business and finance leaders from around the world and was launched in 2021 with the support of the G20. TNFD provides recommendations and guidance for market participants and other stakeholders about how nature beyond climate should be assessed, managed and reported. It has built a global movement of support and action, including over 500 organizations and over USD$17 trillion in assets under management (AUM) now committed to reporting their nature-related issues aligned with the TNFD recommendations published in September 2023. The TNFD recommendations build on the previous approach and recommendation of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) and are aligned with the impact standards of the GRI, the European Union’s Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) and the sustainability reporting standards of the International Sustainability Standards Board (ISSB). https://tnfd.global/

The plan, which may slash energy bills by up to 25% for more than 7,000 UK businesses, is set to be unveiled on Monday alongside other measures hoped to boost growth.

Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer called the industrial strategy ""a turning point for Britain's economy"" by supporting key industries where there is potential for growth.

Conservative acting shadow energy secretary Andrew Bowie criticised the plans, saying the UK needed ""a serious approach to energy policy"" that ""tackles the root cause of our high energy prices"".

He said it was ""astonishing"" Labour was ""finally admitting that the costs of net zero are so high that they're having to spend billions of pounds of taxpayers' money subsidising businesses' energy bills to stop them going bust"".

Manufacturers in the UK currently pay some of the highest electricity prices in the developed world.

A new British Industrial Competitiveness Scheme will cut costs by up to £40 per megawatt-hour from 2027 for more than 7,000 manufacturing firms by exempting them from levies on bills including the renewables obligation, feed-in tariffs and the capacity market.

About 500 of the most energy-intensive firms, including the steel industry, chemicals and glassmaking, will also have their network charges cut.

Those firms currently get a 60% discount through the British Industry Supercharger scheme, which will increase to 90% from 2026.

Monday's announcement will also contain measures to speed up the time it can take to connect new factories and projects to the energy grid.

The prime minister said the industrial strategy gave businesses ""the long-term certainty and direction"" they need to ""invest, innovate and create good jobs that put more money in people's pockets"".

It also aims to support the creation of more than one million new ""well-paid jobs"" over the next decade.

Other plans within the industrial strategy include:

upskilling Britons and reducing reliance on foreign workers by spending an extra £1.2bn each year for skills by 2028-29

attracting ""elite global talent"" to come and work in the UK with visa and migration reforms

hiring more planners and streamlining application processes to reduce planning timelines and cut costs for developers

boosting research and development spending to £22.6bn per year by 2029-30 to drive innovation - including £2bn for AI

The government said it will be focusing on eight specific sectors where the UK is already strong and therefore should have the potential for faster growth.

These sectors are advanced manufacturing, clean energy industries, creative industries, defence, digital and technologies, financial services, life sciences, and professional and business services.

A bespoke 10-year plan for five of the sectors will be published on Monday, but the defence, financial services and life sciences strategies will come later.

The announcement will come after latest figures showed the UK economy shrank by 0.3% in April - its worst contraction for a year-and-a-half.

Meanwhile, in April business groups raised concerns that the government's Employment Rights Bill could hit growth at an uncertain time for the UK economy.

Chancellor Rachel Reeves said the industrial strategy will ""see billions of pounds for investment and cutting-edge tech, ease energy costs, and upskill the nation"".

Manufacturer's organisation Make UK's chief executive Stephen Phipson said the government strategy set out plans to address ""all three"" major challenges facing industry - ""a skills crisis, crippling energy costs and an inability to access capital for new British innovators"".

He said: ""For too long, UK industry has been hamstrung by energy prices far above those in France and Germany. It's made it harder to compete, invest, and grow.""

New Industrial Strategy to unlock billions in investment and support 1.1 million new well-paid jobs over the next decade.

Strategy developed in partnership with business, marking a new era of collaboration between government and high growth industries.

Strategy will make the UK the best country to invest in and grow a business, delivering on the Plan for Change.

More than 7,000 British businesses are set to see their electricity bills slashed by up to 25% from 2027, as the Government unveils its bold new Industrial Strategy today [Monday 23 June].

The modern Industrial Strategy sets out a ten-year plan to boost investment, create good skilled jobs and make Britain the best place to do business by tackling two of the biggest barriers facing UK industry - high electricity prices and long waits for grid connections.

British manufacturers currently pay some of the highest electricity prices in the developed world while businesses looking to expand or modernise have faced delays when it comes to connecting to the grid.

For too long these challenges have held back growth and made it harder for British firms to compete. Today’s announcement marks a decisive shift — with government stepping in to support industry and unlock the UK’s economic potential.

From 2027, the new British Industrial Competitiveness Scheme will reduce electricity costs by up to £40 per megawatt hour for over 7,000 electricity-intensive businesses in manufacturing sectors like automotive, aerospace and chemicals.

These firms, which support over 300,000 skilled jobs, will be exempt from paying levies such as the Renewables Obligation, Feed-in Tariffs and the Capacity Market — helping level the playing field and make them more internationally competitive. Eligibility and further details on the exemptions will be determined following consultation, which will be launched shortly.

The government is also increasing support for the most energy-intensive firms — like steel, chemicals, and glass — by covering more of the electricity network charges they normally have to pay through the British Industry Supercharger. These businesses currently get a 60% discount on those charges, but from 2026, that will increase to 90%. This means their electricity bills will go down, helping them stay competitive, protect jobs, and invest in the future.

This will help around 500 eligible businesses in sectors such as steel, ceramics and glass reduce their costs and protect jobs in industries that are the backbone of our economy and will be delivered at no additional cost to the taxpayer.

These reforms complement the government’s long-term mission for clean power, which is the only way to bring down bills for good by ending the UK’s dependency on volatile fossil fuel markets.

To ensure businesses can grow and hire without delay, the government will also deliver a new Connections Accelerator Service to streamline grid access for major investment projects — including prioritising those that create high-quality jobs and deliver significant economic benefits.

We will work closely with the energy sector, local authorities, Welsh and Scottish Governments, trade unions, and industry to design this service, which we expect to begin operating at the end of 2025. New powers in the Planning and Infrastructure Bill, currently before parliament, could also allow the Government to reserve grid capacity for strategically important projects, cutting waiting times and unlocking growth in key sectors.

The Industrial Strategy is a 10-year plan to promote business investment and growth and make it quicker, easier and cheaper to do business in the UK, giving businesses the confidence to invest and create 1.1 million good, well-paid jobs in thriving industries – delivering on this government’s Plan for Change.

Prime Minister Keir Starmer said:

This Industrial Strategy marks a turning point for Britain’s economy and a clear break from the short-termism and sticking plasters of the past.

In an era of global economic instability, it delivers the long term certainty and direction British businesses need to invest, innovate and create good jobs that put more money in people’s pockets as part of the plan for change.

This is how we power Britain’s future - by backing the sectors where we lead, removing the barriers that hold us back, and setting out a clear path to build a stronger economy that works for working people. Our message is clear - Britain is back and open for business.

Chancellor of the Exchequer Rachel Reeves said:

The UK has some of the most innovative businesses in the world and our Plan for Change has provided them with the stability they need to grow and for more to be created.

Today’s Industrial Strategy builds on that progress with a ten-year plan to slash barriers to investment. It’ll see billions of pounds for investment and cutting-edge tech, ease energy costs, and upskill the nation. It will ensure the industries that make Britain great can thrive. It will boost our economy and create jobs that put more money in people’s pockets.

Business and Trade Secretary Jonathan Reynolds said:

We’ve said from day one Britain is back in business under this government, and the £100 billion of investment we’ve secured in the past year shows our Plan for Change is already delivering for working people.

Our Modern Industrial Strategy will ensure the UK is the best country to invest and do business, delivering economic growth that puts more money in people’s pockets and pays for our NHS, schools and military.

Not only does this Strategy prioritise investment to attract billions for new business sites, cutting-edge research, and better transport links, it will also make our industrial electricity prices more competitive.

Tackling energy costs and fixing skills has been the single biggest ask of us from businesses and the greatest challenge they’ve faced – this government has listened, and now we’re taking the bold action needed. Government and business working hand in hand to make working people better of is what this Government promised and what we will deliver.

Energy Secretary Ed Miliband said:

For too long high electricity costs have held back British businesses, as a result of our reliance on gas sold on volatile international markets.

As part of our modern industrial strategy we’re unlocking the potential of British industry by slashing industrial electricity prices in key sectors.

We’re also doubling down on our clean power strengths with increased investment in growth industries from offshore wind to nuclear. This will deliver on our clean power mission and Plan for Change to bring down bills for households and businesses for good.

The Supercharger and British Industrial Competitiveness Scheme will be funded through reforms to the energy system. The government is reducing costs within the system to free up funding without raising household bills or taxes and intends to also use additional funds from the strengthening of UK carbon pricing, including as a result of linking with the EU carbon market.

We have set out an intention to link emissions trading systems, as part of our new agreement with the European Union to support British businesses. Without an agreement to do this, British industry would have to pay the EU’s carbon tax.

We intend to link our carbon pricing system with the EU’s, we will ensure that money stays in the UK—which allows us to support British companies and British jobs through these schemes.

Building on the Spending Review and the recently announced 10-Year Infrastructure Strategy, the Industrial Strategy is the latest step forward in our plans to deliver national renewal. It will include targeted support for the areas of the country and economy that have the greatest potential to grow, while introducing reforms that will make it easier for all businesses to get ahead.

The Strategy’s bold plan of action includes:

Slash electricity costs by up to 25% from 2027 for electricity-intensive manufacturers in our growth sectors and foundational industries in their supply chain, bringing costs more closely in line with other major economies in Europe.

Unlocking billions in finance for innovative business, especially for SMEs by increasing British Business Bank financial capacity to £25.6 billion, crowding in tens of billions of pounds more in private capital. The includes an additional £4bn for Industrial Strategy Sectors, crowding in billions more in private capital. By investing largely through venture funds, the BBB will back the UK’s most high-growth potential companies.

Upskilling the nation with an extra £1.2 billion each year for skills by 2028-29, and delivering more opportunities to learn and earn in our high-growth sectors including new short courses in relevant skills funded by the Growth and Skills Levy and skills packages targeted at defence digital and engineering.

Reducing regulatory burdens by cutting the administrative costs of regulation for business by 25% and reduce the number of regulators.

Supporting 5,500 more SMEs to adopt new technology through the Made Smarter programme while centralising government support in one place through the Business Growth Service.

Boosting R&D spending to £22.6bn per year by 2029-30 to drive innovation across the IS-8, with more than £2bn for AI over the Spending Review, and £2.8bn for advanced manufacturing over the next ten years. This will leverage in billions more from private investors. Regulatory changes will further clear the path for fast-growing industries and innovative products such as biotechnology, AI, and autonomous vehicles.

Attracting elite global talent to our key sectors, via visa and migration reforms and the new Global Talent Taskforce.

Deepening economic and industrial collaboration with our partners, building on our Industrial Strategy Partnership with Japan and recent deals with the US, India, and the EU.

Reducing planning timelines and cutting costs for developers, by hiring more planners, streamlining pre-application requirements and combining environmental obligations, removing burdens on businesses as well as accelerating house building.

Revolutionising public procurement and reducing barriers for new entrants and SMEs to bolster domestic competitiveness.

Supporting the UK’s city regions and clusters by increasing the supply of investible sites through a new £600m Strategic Sites Accelerator, enhanced regional support from the Office for Investment, National Wealth Fund, and British Business Bank, and more.

The plan focuses on 8 sectors where the UK is already strong and there’s potential for faster growth: Advanced Manufacturing, Clean Energy Industries, Creative Industries, Defence, Digital and Technologies, Financial Services, Life Sciences, and Professional and Business Services. Each growth sector has a bespoke 10-year plan that will attract investment, enable growth and create high-quality, well-paid jobs.

Dame Clare Barclay DBE, Chair of the Industrial Strategy Advisory Council and President of Enterprise & Industry EMEA at Microsoft said:

I welcome today’s Industrial Strategy, which sets out a clear plan to back the UK’s growth driving sectors. It is particularly positive to see the strong focus on skills in areas such as engineering, technology and defence. Commitments such as £187 million for the TechFirst programme will ensure the UK has the skills it needs to support our growth industries and seize transformative opportunities like AI.

Rain Newton-Smith, Chief Executive, CBI said:

Today’s Industrial Strategy announcement is a significant leap forward in the partnership between government and business that sets us on the path to our shared goal of raising living standards across the country.

It sends an unambiguous, positive signal about the nation’s global calling card as well as the direction of travel for the wider economy for the next decade and beyond.

The CBI has long been advocating for a comprehensive industrial strategy, based on the UK’s USP - the sectors and markets where we can compete to win on the global stage.

More competitive energy prices, fast-tracked planning decisions and backing innovation will provide a bedrock for growth. But the global race to attract investment will require a laser-like and unwavering focus on the UK’s overall competitiveness.

Today marks the beginning of delivering this strategy in close partnership, at pace, and with a shared purpose.

Stephen Phipson CBE, CEO at Make UK said:

British industry has been in desperate need for a government who understands our sector and had the strategic vision for a plan for growth. Today’s Industrial Strategy is a giant and much needed step forward taken by the Secretary of State who has seen the potential and provided the keys to help unlock it.

Make UK has led the campaign for a new industrial strategy for many years, highlighting the three major challenges that were diminishing our competitiveness, hampering growth and frustrating productivity gains: a skills crisis, crippling energy costs and, an inability to access capital for new British innovators.

The strategy announced today sets out plans to address all three of these structural failings. Clearly there is much to do as we move towards implementation but, this will send a message across the Country and around the world that Britain is back in business.

Tufan Erginbilgic, Rolls-Royce CEO, said:

The UK Government’s Industrial Strategy commitment to support our world-leading aerospace and nuclear industries shows long-term strategic foresight. Rolls-Royce’s highly differentiated technologies in gas turbines and nuclear capabilities- including SMRs and AMRs- are uniquely placed to deliver economic growth, skilled jobs and attract investment into the UK.

Mike Hawes OBE, SMMT Chief Executive said:

The publication of an Industrial Strategy – one with automotive at its heart – is the policy framework the sector has long-sought and Government has now addressed. Such a strategy – long-term, aligned to a trade strategy and supported by all of Government – is the basis on which the UK automotive sector can regain its global competitiveness. Making the UK the best place to invest now depends on implementation, and implementation at pace, because investment decisions are being made now against a backdrop of fierce competition and geopolitical uncertainty. The number one priority must be addressing the UK’s high cost of energy, enabling the sector to invest in the technologies, the products and the people that will give the UK its competitive edge.

Five sector plans have been published today:

Advanced Manufacturing - Backing our Advanced Manufacturing sector with up to £4.3 billion in funding, including up to £2.8 billion in R&D over the next five years, with the aim of anchoring supply chains in the UK - from increasing vehicle production to 1.35 million, to leading the next generation of technologies for zero emission flight.

Manufacturers have warned “crippling” power costs are far higher for UK businesses than competitors overseas.
There are also concerns in industry about the impact of the Government’s Employment Rights Bill, which could add to business costs.
TUC general secretary Paul Nowak said: “We welcome ministers taking action to reduce sky-high energy costs for manufacturers – something unions have been calling for as a matter of urgency.
“For too long, UK industry has been hamstrung by energy prices far above those in France and Germany.","The Government’s industrial strategy includes measures to ease the ‘crippling’ costs of energy for UK manufacturers.

Electricity costs for thousands of businesses will be cut by scrapping green levies to help them compete with foreign rivals.

The plan, which could cut bills by up to 25%, forms a key part of Sir Keir Starmer’s 10-year industrial strategy which he hopes will address stuttering economic growth and transform the business landscape.

The Prime Minister said the plan marks a “turning point for Britain’s economy” by supporting key industries where there is potential for growth.

Manufacturers have warned “crippling” power costs are far higher for UK businesses than competitors overseas.

From 2027, a new British Industrial Competitiveness Scheme will cut costs by up to £40 per megawatt hour for over 7,000 manufacturing firms by exempting them from levies on bills including the renewables obligation, feed-in tariffs and the capacity market.

Around 500 of the most energy-intensive firms, including the steel industry, chemicals and glassmaking, will also see their network charges cut – they currently get a 60% discount through the British Industry Supercharger scheme, which will increase to 90% from 2026.

The plan also promises measures to speed up the time it can take to connect new factories and projects to the energy grid.

Sir Keir said: “This industrial strategy marks a turning point for Britain’s economy and a clear break from the short-termism and sticking plasters of the past.”

He said the decade-long plan would deliver “the long-term certainty and direction British businesses need to invest” during an “era of global uncertainty”.

Energy Secretary Ed Miliband blamed “our reliance on gas sold on volatile international markets” for the high electricity costs for businesses.

He said “doubling down” on wind and nuclear power would “bring down bills for households and businesses for good”.

The industrial strategy focuses on eight areas where the UK is already strong and there is potential for further growth: advanced manufacturing, clean energy, creative industries, defence, digital, financial services, life sciences and professional and business services.

Plans for five of the sectors will be published on Monday, but the defence, financial services and life sciences strategies will come later.

Other measures include:

– Increasing the British Business Bank’s financial capacity to £25.6 billion, including £4 billion for sectors in the industrial strategy.

– Raising research and development spending to £22.6 billion a year by 2029/30.

– An extra £1.2 billion a year for skills by 2028-29 to train Britons to do jobs in growth industries and reduce reliance on foreign workers.

– Attracting “elite” overseas talent through visa and migration reforms.

– Cutting the administrative cost of red tape by 25% and reducing the number of regulators.

– Reducing the time it takes to get planning permission by hiring more planners, streamlining pre-application requirements and combining environmental obligations.

– Increasing the supply of locations for investment around the country with a £600 million strategic sites accelerator.

The strategy comes after the latest figures indicated the economy shrank by 0.3% in April, the biggest monthly contraction in gross domestic product for a year-and-a-half, as businesses felt the impact of Donald Trump’s tariffs and domestic pressure as a result of hikes to firms’ national insurance contributions.

There are also concerns in industry about the impact of the Government’s Employment Rights Bill, which could add to business costs.

Confederation of British Industry chief executive Rain Newton-Smith said: “More competitive energy prices, fast-tracked planning decisions and backing innovation will provide a bedrock for growth.

“But the global race to attract investment will require a laser-like and unwavering focus on the UK’s overall competitiveness.”

Manufacturers’ organisation Make UK’s chief Stephen Phipson said the three major challenges facing industry were “a skills crisis, crippling energy costs and an inability to access capital for new British innovators”, and the strategy “sets out plans to address all three”.

TUC general secretary Paul Nowak said: “We welcome ministers taking action to reduce sky-high energy costs for manufacturers – something unions have been calling for as a matter of urgency.

“For too long, UK industry has been hamstrung by energy prices far above those in France and Germany. It’s made it harder to compete, invest, and grow.”

Acting shadow energy secretary Andrew Bowie said: “It is astonishing that Labour are finally admitting that the costs of net zero are so high that they’re having to spend billions of pounds of taxpayers’ money subsidising businesses’ energy bills to stop them going bust.”

Shadow business secretary Andrew Griffith has written an open letter to firms warning they are being “sleepwalked into disaster” by the Employment Rights Bill.

He said: “When it comes to business, it’s actions, not words, which count, but this Government is stepping on the accelerator and the brake at the same time.”",https://www.perspectivemedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/httpsimage.assets.pressassociation.iov2imageproduction1ca88a233df21696c0c79b3df1479b24Y29udGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNzUwNjkxMjA12.79736461.jpgrect1387040004000ext.jpg,N,,2025-06-22 22:02:23.224299

The measure is a key plank of the long-awaited industrial strategy, a 10-year plan to boost sectors ranging from the creative industries to manufacturing.

More than 7,000 businesses could have their energy bills reduced as the government removes levies such as the renewables obligation, which funds continuing commitments to earlier renewable electricity generation projects.

It will come alongside a parallel policy, reported in the Guardian last week, aimed at helping particularly electricity-intensive industries such as the beleaguered steel sector.

This will involve increasing the discount on the fees that energy-intensive firms pay to connect to the grid to 90%, up from 60%.

Industry sources told the Guardian last week that, while the policy was welcome, the overall saving for steel is expected only to be worth about £15m a year.

However, the discount is also anticipated to help about 500 businesses in other industries, including aluminium, ceramics and glass.

British manufacturers have long complained of having to grapple with some of the highest electricity prices in the developed world, as well as delays in connecting to the grid, a particular concern in the tech sector.

There will be new systems put in place for major investment projects that create significant numbers of jobs to have faster grid access, expected to be in place before the end of the year.

Announcing the plan, the prime minister, Keir Starmer, said he hoped it would be “a turning point for Britain’s economy and a clear break from the short-termism and sticking plasters of the past.

“In an era of global economic instability, it delivers the long-term certainty and direction British businesses need to invest, innovate and create good jobs that put more money in people’s pockets as part of the plan for change.”

The chancellor, Rachel Reeves, said the strategy would complement the spending review, which prioritised investment in infrastructure and industry. “It’ll see billions of pounds for investment and cutting-edge tech, ease energy costs and upskill the nation. It will ensure the industries that make Britain great can thrive,” she said. “It will boost our economy and create jobs that put more money in people’s pockets.”

The government said the reforms would not directly cost the taxpayer anything or lead to an increase in household bills, but would be funded through reforms to the energy system.

Energy costs are likely to remain significantly higher than in Germany and France, chiefly because UK electricity prices are linked to the cost of wholesale gas, which is a larger part of the British energy mix than on the continent.

Key to the plan is the proposed linking of the UK’s emissions trading scheme with that of the EU, announced in May at a joint summit in London, though negotiations about the UK’s entry into that carbon market are still not concluded.

The strategy on Monday is expected to focus on eight sectors where the UK has potential for fast growth: advanced manufacturing, clean energy, creative industries, defence, digital, financial services, life sciences and professional services.

The Confederation of British Industry’s chief executive, Rain Newton-Smith, praised the strategy, saying “competitive energy prices, fast-tracked planning decisions and backing innovation will provide a bedrock for growth. But the global race to attract investment will require a laser-like and unwavering focus on the UK’s overall competitiveness.”

Stephen Phipson, the chief executive of the manufacturers’ organisation Make UK, said the strategy was a “giant and much-needed step forward”, saying there had long been frustration in the sector at the skills crisis, crippling energy costs and difficulty in accessing capital.

“The strategy announced today sets out plans to address all three of these structural failings,” he said. “Clearly there is much to do as we move towards implementation, but this will send a message across the country and around the world that Britain is back in business.”",https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/943c35793c0ec235bb796ae1e9eb2bd6b054e735/630_75_4561_3649/master/4561.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=3d7e896e1e1306935bb10b7fece46127,N,,2025-06-22 18:03:01.911730

That justification must supply a “core justification” for the EPA’s action, Thomas said, as it did in the case of the six refineries, whose requests for biofuel mandate exemptions were denied based on an interpretation of the Clean Air Act that the agency applied to all refineries regardless of their geographic location.

“Allowing 12 different circuit courts to adjudicate SREs (small refinery exemptions) would result in a fractured and inconsistent body of law, causing chaos and confusion in the marketplace,” biofuel groups Growth Energy and the Renewable Fuels Association wrote in a joint statement.

Conservative Justice Neil Gorsuch, in a dissenting opinion joined by conservative Chief Justice John Roberts, said the test that the majority laid out was “both mistaken and likely to render simple venue questions unnecessarily difficult and expensive to resolve.”

They nonetheless concurred with the court’s decision to reverse the conclusion by the Denver-based 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals that the case by Oklahoma and Utah should be transferred to the D.C. Circuit.

That case concerned a rule the EPA issued in March 2023 intended to target gases that form ozone, a key component of smog, from power plants and other industrial sources in 23 upwind states whose own plans did not satisfy the the Clean Air Act’s “Good Neighbor” provision.

Oklahoma and Utah were among 21 states whose air quality plans were rejected by the EPA under that policy. Numerous lawsuits followed, including by Oklahoma and Utah, who sought to challenge the decision in the Denver-based 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.

While the 10th Circuit held the case belonged in the D.C. Circuit because it concerned a national policy, Thomas wrote that the 10th Circuit could hear the case because the EPA’s action turned on state-specific factors.

Right now, the 30% federal tax credit is still fully in place, and that’s excellent news for anyone going solar in 2025.
While national politics can feel distant, the proposed federal changes could have real impacts here at home.","Dear Eartha, I heard the federal tax credit for solar might change. If I install solar this year, am I still eligible?

Great question — and one we’ve been hearing a lot lately from Summit County homeowners considering solar. With the proposed One Big Beautiful Bill Act being debated in Congress, there’s a lot of uncertainty around how it might affect clean energy incentives. The 30% federal tax credit has been a huge driver of solar adoption both nationally and right here in Summit County through programs like Solarize Summit. So, let’s break down what’s going on and how it could impact your savings.

What is the One Big Beautiful Bill Act?

This proposed legislation is being described by supporters as the “largest tax cut in history.” But for those interested in clean energy, it could bring major changes. Among many revisions to the tax code, the bill proposes terminating the residential solar tax credit 180 days after it’s signed into law. That’s a dramatic shift from the current timeline, which guarantees the full 30% credit through 2032 under the Inflation Reduction Act passed in 2022. But if the One Big Beautiful Bill becomes law, that timeline could be cut short by more than six years.

Where does the bill stand now?

As of now, the bill has already cleared one major hurdle: it passed the U.S. House of Representatives on May 22, 2025 , by a very narrow margin. The bill is now under consideration in the U.S. Senate, where lawmakers have already proposed changes to the House version.

Next, the Senate will finalize and vote on its own version of the bill, which is expected to happen by early July. If the Senate passes a version with amendments — which is very likely — a conference committee made up of House and Senate members will be formed to resolve the differences between the two versions . This negotiated bill, called a conference report, must then be voted on again by both the House and the Senate before it can be sent to the President’s desk for signature.

If signed into law in its current form sometime this summer, the 180-day clock would begin — giving homeowners just six months to install solar and qualify for the full federal tax credit. This means the credit could expire as early as 2026.

What does this mean for Summit County homeowners?

Right now, the 30% federal tax credit is still fully in place, and that’s excellent news for anyone going solar in 2025. But if the bill becomes law, homeowners could have only six months to complete their installation in order to take advantage of the tax credit.

Fortunately, Solarize Summit is designed to help homeowners move quickly and confidently. In addition to the federal tax credit, participants who sign a contract before July 31 can access up to $2,400 in combined incentives from High Country Conservation Center and the program’s installer, Active Energies Solar . But don’t delay, these incentives are limited and on a first-come, first-served basis.

The takeaway

The combination of the federal tax credit, local rebates and the streamlined Solarize Summit process makes 2025 one of the most affordable and impactful years to go solar.

While national politics can feel distant, the proposed federal changes could have real impacts here at home. By acting now, you can secure your solar savings, reduce your reliance on fossil fuels and be part of the transition to a cleaner, more resilient energy future.

Have questions or want to explore your solar options? Visit HighCountryConservation.org or contact a local installer to see if solar is right for your home. The sun is shining — and your solar opportunity is right now.

The technology corporation Rheinmetall has secured a double-digit million euro order from a renowned North American truck manufacturer. The order involves a mid-six-figure quantity of CWA 2000 high-voltage coolant pumps being used in the manufacturer’s battery-powered medium and heavy duty trucks. Rheinmetall will supply the customer directly from 2028 to 2035.

The deciding factor behind the order were the technical characteristics of the product. The CWA 2000 is a versatile solution for a wide range of cooling specifications. In principle it is just as suitable for battery-powered electric vehicles as it is for fuel-cell drives. The CWA 2000 has a long life-cycle and is designed for the HV3b voltage level, which allows an operating voltage of up to 850V. It is available with either an active or passive high-voltage interlock loop, which keeps the battery system ready for operation as long as the loop is closed. If the loop is interrupted, this system protects all persons who could come into contact with high-voltage components during the life-cycle of an electric vehicle by switching off the power.

This order is a confirmation of the customer´s trust to Rheinmetall´s technology for the North American market. The order is also of strategic importance, as it enables Rheinmetall to increase its footprint with components for the thermal management of electric trucks. This is a further important step with a view to the transformation of drive technology.

In a shift in policy, the latest draft of the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” omits residential solar lease providers from the Investment Tax Credit. Already, solar stocks are falling and bankruptcies are ticking up as tension and worries rise.

Until now, home solar and batteries have benefitted from a 30 percent tax credit. That would drop to zero percent 180 days after Trump signs, if this latest version of the bill goes through. However, the bill is expected to undergo further changes as it moves through the Senate. But no matter the fine print, the writing is on the wall for solar companies in the United States, and the markets are already strongly responding to this new antagonistic policy space for solar.

PV Magazine reports that the domestic residential solar industry is “on the brink of collapse,” adding that the newest draft of the bill is sweepingly discouraging for clean energy as a whole, but particularly punishing for residential solar. While cuts were anticipated, this new proposed slashing of federal credits is coming far sooner than expected. What is more, this blow is hitting an already bruised and battered industry which was already reeling from tariffs that hit solar supply chains hard.

“The residential solar industry is no stranger to highs and lows, often referred to as the ‘solar coaster’ by those who have weathered the storm of hot-and-cold policies that create markets and then take them away at a breakneck pace,” PV Magazine reports. “But the latest draft of the federal reconciliation bill may represent a crash.”

Already, solar company bankruptcies are piling up. Just this month, two major industry players – residential solar provider Sunnova and financing firm Mosaic – filed for bankruptcies. Sunnova pointed to “uncertainty over the nation’s commitment” to solar power as a major motivation of the filing. “The two companies are among the largest casualties in the sector since Donald Trump took office,” reports the Financial Times.

The news has also hit the stock market hard, with a wide array of solar companies taking major hits. Solar inverter company Enphase Energy and solar panel manufacturer First Solar dropped by 27.2 percent and 19.3 percent, respectively, placing them amongst the largest decliners on the S&P 500. “Solar stocks have had a terrible run lately, amid anticipation that this would happen,” reports Barron’s. Looking at the last year, Enphase, SolarEdge, and Sunrun are all down between 52 percent and 70 percent.

“We are in a fight for our lives,” Abigail Ross Hopper, CEO of the Solar Energy Industries Association, said at a rally in Washington earlier this week. “The bill does not achieve American energy dominance . . . In the residential solar industry alone, 1,500 small businesses and over 250,000 jobs are at risk.”

While the prognosis is grim for residential solar, utility-scale solar may be shielded from some of the worst effects of the bill and be able to bounce back better. The latest draft of the bill is “less punitive for utility-scale developers,” which will not be bound by the same leasing restrictions as residential companies. Furthermore, energy demand growth will help to stabilize large-scale energy generation overall. “Even absent tax credits we believe solar remains highly cost competitive with other fossil fuel generation technologies,” RBC Capital Markets analyst Christopher Dendrinos told Barron’s.

Hydropower, nuclear energy, and geothermal energy will also be spared. The current iteration of the bill extends their tax credits through 2036.

Is it possible the predictions of the death of offshore wind power — one of our single best tools in the fight against climate change — were wrong?

While fossil fuel lobbyists and wealthy waterfront landowners in beachfront communities were cheering on the impending death of clean energy, a funny thing happened: Turbines continued going up, large-scale projects got built and began turning wind into electricity, and the wind projects continued their progress toward construction.

Dominion Energy continues — quietly — to work toward completing the nation’s largest offshore wind project after battling years of fossil-fuel funded opposition and weathering the Trump administration’s repeated — albeit inconsistent — moves to shut down wind. Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind is more than halfway complete. In many ways, between the jobs, the power and the investment, it may simply be too big to fail.

With 176 turbines, the $6 billion project will power 660,000 homes with clean energy when finished in 2026. It has already created 2,000 jobs and stands as proof that offshore wind is alive and well.

So while the naysayers were busy writing obituaries, offshore wind continued to do what it was always meant to do: generate power, create jobs, and help secure a livable future.

Meanwhile the most audacious attack on offshore wind, a stop work order from the Trump administration against New York’s Empire Wind, was rescinded earlier this month. That project is now back under construction. Empire has created 1,500 jobs and will power half-a-million New York homes when completed in 2028. To the extent reports that New York Gov. Kathy Hochul agreed to fresh consideration of one or more fracked gas pipelines in exchange for allowing Empire to proceed are accurate, such ill-advised and outdated proposals face major obstacles, including stiff public opposition. Meanwhile, construction of the critical clean energy that New York actually needs proceeds in the form of Empire Wind.

Revolution Wind, 15 miles off the coast of Rhode Island, began work two years ago and is on target to be finished and powering 350,000 homes in Connecticut and Rhode Island by next year. Revolution has faced an onslaught of legal attacks from wealthy waterfront owners concerned about their ocean views. But at least for now, the project has been safe from Trump’s anti-wind attacks. And again, size and economic clout may have helped keep the project viable. Revolution has spent more than $100 million shoreside redeveloping waterfront in both Connecticut and Rhode Island and, by creating 1,500 jobs, has strong political and union support.

Finally, there is Vineyard Wind.

After a devastating turbine break stopped construction in July, Vineyard Wind has quietly — very quietly — managed to get back to work. Their project will power 400,000 homes in Massachusetts, revitalize the port of New Bedford, and generate 2,000 jobs. The project is also generating electricity — though how much is impossible to establish since the developer, possibly in response to the high-profile attacks on wind by the Trump administration, has opted to answer few questions about the work, the progress, the number of turbines in operation, or the resulting power.

Each of these projects has — so far — survived in the face of relentless attacks from the Trump administration, fossil fuel proponents, and greenwashed fronts. Baseless charges that wind power kills whales; lawsuits targeting transmission cables, substations and transmission cables; phony ‘grassroots’ organizations bankrolled by waterfront homeowners and/or oil and gas companies; attacks by the Trump bureaucracy — all so far have failed.

Silence about success and ongoing work seems to be a part of the strategy for offshore wind developers — and maybe you can’t blame them.

One of the directors of the Dominion project said simply this week that continued construction came from “keeping our head down” and keeping the project away from any fanfare. Dominion has also managed to keep working by touting offshore wind not as clean, green or planet saving — which, of course, it is — but simply as homegrown American power. Like federal biologists and health experts, offshore wind developers have learned not to bring the benefits of clean air and cuts to pollution into their conversations.

They can’t say it. But we can: When these four projects go on-line in the next three years, they will power two million homes while taking millions of tons of carbon pollution out of the air we breathe — the equivalent of taking 2,300,000 cars off the road. That means less asthma, better heart health, and a planet moving further from a future marked by increasing heat and drought, flooding and erosion, real damage to marine life, and more houses being swallowed by a rising ocean.

Jobs, measurable economic impact, and the promise of reliable domestic power — these may be keeping offshore wind on track to survive the current headwinds and thrive when the coast is clear. But for now, just don’t say out loud that it could also help protect our health and save the planet.",https://newbedfordlight.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/your-voice-bendy2.png,N,,2025-06-22 17:05:56.790813

Under the Program, eligible WA battery manufacturers1 will be able to access a $30 million grants program to grow manufacturing capacity and provide competitive residential battery products — not just to local, but also international markets.
The Local Battery Manufacturing Program is only part of the Cook Government’s Made in WA plan.
“Building batteries here in Western Australia was a key part of the Made in WA plan my government took to the election,” said Premier Cook.
The scheme is still missing some important detail though, including a list of eligible batteries and suppliers/installers — and with just over a week to go until kick-off.","Amid some backlash over its re-jiggered rebate, Western Australia’s Cook Government’s Budget 2025/26 has earmarked tens of millions of dollars to support a local home battery manufacturing industry.

With launch of the state’s rebate scheme imminent, Premier Cook wants to see some of the home batteries installed under the program ‘Made In WA’, and is backing industry with a $50 million Local Battery Manufacturing Program providing direct grants and low-interest loans.

Under the Program, eligible WA battery manufacturers1 will be able to access a $30 million grants program to grow manufacturing capacity and provide competitive residential battery products — not just to local, but also international markets. The grants will need to be matched dollar for dollar by the manufacturer/proponent.

The package also involves $20 million for low-interest loans, or the State Government providing land to encourage the industry to make major new technology and facility investments.

“Most local manufacturers are focused on commercial and regional or remote battery technologies, and have expressed strong interest in scaling up residential battery manufacturing when the market becomes stronger,” says the WA Government.

Much of the important detail is yet to be announced; such as what will constitute being “Made In WA” — it could be as simple as partial local assembly — and when this initiative will officially roll out.

The Local Battery Manufacturing Program is only part of the Cook Government’s Made in WA plan. Overall, $2.7 billion is being injected into the initiative under Budget 2025/26.

“Building batteries here in Western Australia was a key part of the Made in WA plan my government took to the election,” said Premier Cook. “It will support our nation-leading battery rebates, which in turn will secure our clean energy future and provide long-term, sustainable cost-of-living relief to tens of thousands of households throughout WA.”

WA Home Battery Rebate Rebellion

Some would argue that more generous battery rebate rates were also something else the Cook Government took into the election and then back-flipped on.

While the upcoming scheme was recently expanded to support up to five times the number of rebates previously (~20,000 -> ~100,000), maximum rebate value was slashed from up to $5,000 for Synergy customers to up to $1,300; and from up to $7,500 for Horizon Power customers to up to $3,800.

Another major change was in relation to a previous requirement that eligible solar batteries would just need to be Virtual Power Plant (VPP) capable. This has been tightened up to requiring those receiving states rebates to join a VPP.

However, the “stackability” of WA’s initiative with the national Cheaper Home Batteries program has been confirmed, as have interest-free loans up to $10,000 for households with combined annual incomes of under $210,000.

Premier Cook mightn’t be the most popular person among some Western Australian solar power system owners at the moment judging by comments on our blog post regarding changes to WA’s battery rebate. It saw a few comments from purchasers and potential buyers feeling misled.

Among those balancing criticism of the Cook Government’s move, SolarQuotes’ Anthony Bennett commented:

“For the same state government spend there’s now going to be about 5 times more people eligible, 5 times more leverage of private investment and that equates to perhaps 10 times the impact in terms of grid resilience, because it’s the first 5kWh that makes the most difference to peak demand and thus grid costs.” Anthony said. “80,000 more batteries will make a MASSIVE dent in demand and equally be able to soak up otherwise wasted renewable capacity.”

While Anthony mentions 5 kWh, the maximum state rebate levels are for 10 kWh systems, with 5 kWh being the minimum capacity. The scheme is still missing some important detail though, including a list of eligible batteries and suppliers/installers — and with just over a week to go until kick-off.",https://www.solarquotes.com.au/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/wa-battery-manufacturing.jpg,N,,2025-06-22 18:02:54.493074

“Excelsior Springs does not train for solar facility fires.
In response, McHugh said Gateway Trail Solar is working with the Excelsior Springs Fire Department to implement emergency access protocols and that the project will carry comprehensive insurance coverage.
Mallory Brown from the City of Excelsior Springs also raised concerns about the project’s impact on city expansion.
Gateway Trail Solar plans to present a revised Conditional Use Permit application at the Clay County Planning and Zoning Commission meeting on July 1, 2025, at 6 p.m.","Clay County, Mo. – A formative plan to convert a portion of a generational farm into a solar energy project led by Gateway Trail Solar sparked debate at the April 2025 Clay County Planning and Zoning Commission meeting, setting the stage for a revised proposal to be brought forward in July.

While the project wasn’t officially denied, developers are returning to the drawing board to address concerns raised by both officials and members of the public. The proposed site, located at 12222 N Highway just outside the city limits of Excelsior Springs, is a 207.2-acre parcel owned by Roy Sams, with approximately 111.3 acres designated for solar infrastructure under the preliminary plan.

Michael McHugh, project manager for Gateway Trail Solar, said the site was selected due to a mix of favorable conditions, including existing power infrastructure, land compatibility, and proximity to distribution lines. He emphasized the project’s low-impact design and long-term benefits, describing it as a practical way to generate clean energy while preserving the character of the land.

The project is expected to generate 20 megawatts of power, enough to supply electricity to roughly 2,300 homes. The solar panels would be installed on single-axis trackers, engineered to follow the sun throughout the day and last up to 35 years. Solis Renewables will manage day-to-day operations, with the landowner bearing no operational risk or maintenance responsibility.

McHugh explained that the project would create 55 new jobs in Clay County during construction and 155 statewide, resulting in over $6.3 million in local earnings and more than $15.4 million across Missouri. Long-term, the site is projected to support 1.6 local jobs and six statewide, with annual earnings exceeding $100,000 locally.

While the project will benefit from federal tax credits such as the Investment and Production Tax Credits, McHugh clarified that it is privately financed and will generate local property tax revenue through a Chapter 100 tax agreement, pending county approval.

The current landowner, Roy Sams, spoke in support of the project, emphasizing its role in preserving both the land and his family’s legacy. “My grandparents bought this farm in 1942, and it has been passed down through generations,” Sams said. “Farming is tough. This lease would allow me to maintain ownership while securing income for my family’s future without permanently altering the land.”

Several attendees echoed Mr. Sams’ position. Environmental advocate Linda Hetzel noted that solar development may actually support wildlife habitat. “If this land were developed for housing instead, it would likely remove timber and food sources. Solar farms allow ecosystems to thrive,” she said.

Rick Yoder, a supporter from Missouri Energy Professionals, urged the commission to think long-term. “What we have now isn’t going to sustain the number of people and cooling demands we’re facing,” he said, calling the shift to renewable energy both necessary and forward-thinking.

Still, opposition to the project was vocal and wide-ranging. Susan Meehan, a nearby resident, raised concerns about emergency response limitations and fire safety. “Excelsior Springs does not train for solar facility fires. There are no hydrants in this location,” she said, also questioning whether insurance would cover potential damage.

In response, McHugh said Gateway Trail Solar is working with the Excelsior Springs Fire Department to implement emergency access protocols and that the project will carry comprehensive insurance coverage. He also noted that the company will post a fully funded decommissioning bond, ensuring the site can be restored once operations end.

Joe Meehan expressed concern about how the fencing would impact wildlife access. In a written statement, developers clarified that no barbed wire would be used and that the fencing would meet safety and aesthetic standards. Other concerns centered on long-term accountability and the company’s relative newness.

Excelsior Springs City Councilman Stephen Spear, who lives near the Sams property, questioned whether the community could count on the company to remain solvent for the full 30-year life of the project. “Unless the bond is fully funded upfront, there’s no guarantee there will be money to remove the panels when the project ends,” he said.

Mallory Brown from the City of Excelsior Springs also raised concerns about the project’s impact on city expansion. She noted that the site lies in an area targeted for future growth due to the region’s ongoing housing shortage. “If developed, the solar farm prevents annexation and limits our ability to provide necessary utilities,” she said.

Gateway Trail Solar plans to present a revised Conditional Use Permit application at the Clay County Planning and Zoning Commission meeting on July 1, 2025, at 6 p.m. The public is invited to attend in person or virtually at:https://www.claycountymo.gov/217/Planning-Zoning-Department.",https://excelsiorcitizen.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/solar-farm-feat.jpg,N,,2025-06-22 17:06:06.770044

Circuit rather than regional circuit courts of appeals, the U.S. Supreme Court has ruled 7-2 in reversing a decision from the 5th Circuit.

The Clean Air Act includes a comprehensive venue framework for judicial review of EPA actions. Under 42 U. S. C. §7607(b)(1), the general rule is that “nationally applicable” EPA actions must be reviewed in the D. C. Circuit, whereas “locally or regionally applicable” actions are heard in regional circuits.

However, the statute provides an exception for regionally applicable actions that are “based on a determination of nationwide scope or effect.” Cases that fall into that category must be reviewed in the D. C. Circuit.

The case before the court involved a number of refineries that challenged the EPA’s denial of petitions for exemptions from the CAA’s renewable fuel program under which most domestic refineries are required to blend a certain percentage of ethanol and other renewable fuels into the fuels they produce.

Small refineries across the country initiated challenges in a number of circuits. With the exception of the 5th Circuit, circuit courts either dismissed the petitions for improper venue or transferred them to the D. C. Circuit.

The 5th Circuit rejected the EPA’s efforts to have cases filed by six refineries transferred to the D.C. Circuit, ruling in favor of the refineries on the merits.

Click here to read the full text of the June 18 decision in EPA v. Calumet Shreveport Refining.

BULLET POINTS: “[W]e conclude that EPA’s denials of the small refineries’ exemption petitions were based on determinations of nationwide scope or effect. We agree with EPA’s finding … that its interpretation of the phrase ‘disproportionate economic hardship’ under §7545(o)(9)(B)(i) and its [economic theory that Renewable Identification Number (RIN) costs are fully passed through to consumers, creating a presumption against granting exemptions,] were determinations of nationwide scope or effect that formed the core basis for EPA’s denials. Both conclusions are clear determinations of nationwide scope or effect: EPA invoked both its statutory interpretation and its passthrough theory in justifying its denials, and both points apply generically to all refineries, regardless of their geographic location. …

“These conclusions also can be deemed the ‘basis’ for EPA’s denials here. EPA decided, in light of the foregoing determinations, that it would presumptively deny all the exemption petitions before it. It then considered other, refinery-specific considerations only to confirm that it had no reason to depart from its presumptive disposition. In this posture, EPA’s statutory interpretation and passthrough theory plainly are the most important parts of its reasoning. Or, put another way, where EPA relies on determinations of nationwide scope or effect to reach a presumptive resolution, those determinations qualify as the primary driver of its decision. EPA’s confirmatory review of refinery-specific facts is ‘[m]erely peripheral’ by comparison.

“Accordingly, we agree with EPA that the ‘nationwide scope or effect’ exception applies here. The Fifth Circuit should have transferred this case.”

—Justice Clarence Thomas, opinion of the court

“The question we face does not concern the merits of what EPA did, only where the small refineries’ lawsuit challenging the agency’s actions should be heard. The Act instructs that litigation over ‘nationally applicable’ EPA ‘actions’ belongs in the D. C. Circuit, while disputes over ‘locally or regionally applicable’ agency ‘actions’ generally belong in a regional circuit. In Parts I and II of its opinion, the Court concludes that these rules presumptively route the dispute before us to a regional circuit because EPA’s decision to deny an individual refinery’s petition for a hardship exemption is a ‘locally or regionally applicable’ action. With all that, I agree.

“But then, in Part III of its opinion, the Court pivots. Even when a case challenges only a ‘locally or regionally applicable’ action, the Court observes, the Act routes it to the D. C. Circuit if EPA’s action ‘is based on a determination of nationwide scope or effect.’ Applying a new multistep test it announces, the Court concludes that EPA’s actions at issue here were based on such a determination.

Democrats and clean energy advocates are ratcheting up pressure on a handful of Republican senators to salvage billions of dollars in projects, ahead of an expected vote next week on President Trump’s megabill that targets critical subsidies for elimination.

How fast to wind down clean-energy credits is one of several contentious pieces of the tax-and-spending legislation, along with reductions in Medicaid spending, that Republican party leaders need to iron out quickly to hit a July 4 deadline for delivering the bill to Trump’s desk. While some Republicans are trying to protect funding for projects in their states, other GOP lawmakers see the subsidies as a ripe target for savings, as the party moves to extend and expand Trump’s tax cuts.

Republican Sen. Thom Tillis, who backs the subsidies and is up for re-election next year in closely divided North Carolina, said the Senate language released Monday “moved substantially” in the right direction from an earlier House version, and that he is still in negotiations with colleagues.

Senate Majority Leader John Thune (R., S.D.) said Wednesday that the energy credits language in the bill is “not totally settled yet.” Any changes that pass the Senate would then have to be approved by the House, where Republicans have taken a dimmer view of the subsidies.

The tug of war over renewable energy projects and manufacturing has centered in recent weeks on senators like Tillis, who hails from a state with billions of dollars of investment at stake in the fate of the tax credits.

In one TV ad, funded by Protect Our Jobs, a clean-energy advocacy group, the owner of a solar installation company says he employs hundreds of North Carolinians and complains about “this dumb idea in Congress to cut investments in clean energy.” The ad urges viewers to call Tillis. On Thursday, the group planned to launch two new 15-second ads in North Carolina targeting Tillis.

A Protect Our Jobs spokesman said the group is organized as a 501(c) 4, a type of nonprofit that can engage in some politics and doesn’t have to disclose its donors. The group has spent more than $7 million on its ad campaign since April, according to data from advertising tracking firm AdImpact, targeting a range of House and Senate Republicans, including Sen. Susan Collins of Maine who faces re-election next year.

Other senators targeted by the ads include Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Jerry Moran of Kansas. They joined Tillis in signing a letter to party leaders earlier this year warning against “full-scale repeal” of current credits for clean energy projects.

Solar and wind production and investment tax credits would wind down through 2026 and 2027 in the Senate proposal, instead of around 2032 in the current law. Battery storage avoided an early sunset. The House version included difficult-to-meet provisions that would have meant an immediate rollback of credits. The Senate extended the time that nuclear, hydropower and geothermal projects would be eligible for credits.

North Carolina’s clean-energy boom

The bulk of the renewable energy construction and manufacturing launched as a result of President Joe Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act happened largely in Republican states, where it is often easier and faster to build something like a new factory or solar farm.

North Carolina has been one of the biggest beneficiaries. More than $21 billion in manufacturing and generation projects have been announced in North Carolina since the IRA was signed in August 2022, according to data from the nonprofit environmental business group E2 and the Clean Economy Tracker.

When the tax credits were enacted, congressional scorekeepers expected them to cost $271 billion over a decade. But without the GOP bill to end them, the total would likely be several hundred billion dollars above that.

Should the credits be sharply curtailed—as now looks likely—Democrats and aligned groups plan to pummel vulnerable Republicans on the issue as they try to chip away at the GOP’ 53-47 majority in the midterm elections next year.

The bill could help Democrats oust Tillis, said Lauren French, a spokeswoman for Senate Majority PAC, a super PAC run by allies of Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D., N.Y.). “That’s what happens when you put kowtowing to Donald Trump before serving your state,” French said.

Tillis spokesman Daniel Keylin shot back that Democrats should be thanking the Republicans who have been working on a gentler phaseout.

“If Democrats had just worked with Republicans to make these credits fiscally sustainable a few years ago, they wouldn’t all be on the chopping block right now,” he said.

Energy executives try to buy time

As the Senate nears a vote, several renewable energy executives said they have been meeting at length with senators and staffers, pressing for a wind-down that would give them and financiers enough time to adjust business models to life without tax credits.

The Senate changes to the Republican megabill are viewed as better but not meaningfully so by many in the power and manufacturing industry, and are the latest in a long fight over the fate of the Inflation Reduction Act, a signature law of the Biden era meant to spark clean energy construction and new factories for products like solar panels and batteries.

Ben Catt, chief executive officer of Pine Gate Renewables, a North Carolina-based developer of solar and storage projects across the U.S., said that he has tried to convey to lawmakers the number of good working-class jobs at stake.

“The vast majority of those are construction and installation jobs,” Catt said. “Those are the ones that are really going away.”

Alex Epstein, an author who promotes the benefits of fossil fuels, attended a closed-door lunch with Republican senators on Wednesday to push for a compromise: an end to tax credits for all technologies after 2028, ensuring their sunset during this administration.

“That would actually extend the subsidies for residential solar purchases and leases,” Epstein said, calling the idea a “very generous compromise.”

The Senate proposal, like the House version, appears dire for companies in the business of selling and installing solar panels for homes and businesses. Tax credits for home solar and storage, energy efficiency investments and the $7,500 tax credit for many electric vehicle purchases, would end six months to a year after enactment.

Utility industry group Edison Electric Institute’s interim CEO Pat Vincent-Collawn said that companies appreciated that senators included “more reasonable timelines for phasing out energy tax credits” and would preserve transferability of credits, which lets companies that don’t owe taxes transfer credits to companies that do.

Analysts say that the Senate proposal might be the best the industry can hope for.

Here's a look at 10 energy stocks across traditional and lower-carbon areas with tremendous growth potential in the decades ahead.

Antero Resources

Antero Resources (NYSE: AR) is a leading U.S. natural gas producer focused on the Appalachian region (Ohio Utica Shale and West Virginia Marcellus Shale). It has the largest and lowest-cost inventory among producers in the region.

That puts it in a strong position to capitalize on the expected surge in natural gas demand in the coming decades. Catalysts such as liquid natural gas (LNG) exports, artificial intelligence (AI) data centers, electric vehicles (EVs), and crypto could fuel a 116% surge in natural gas demand by the end of the decade compared to their current demand level.

Bloom Energy

Bloom Energy (NYSE: BE) makes the Bloom Energy Server. The distributed generation platform provides customers with resilient power by converting natural gas, biogas, or hydrogen into electricity through its proprietary solid oxide technology.

The scalable technology can serve as either a backup power system or the main electricity source. ""Looking ahead,"" stated founder and CEO KR Sridhar in the first-quarter earnings press release, ""the world needs power, and we expect demand to grow, driven by AI, data center needs and industrial electrification, and Bloom is well-positioned to serve these markets.""

Clearway Energy

Clearway Energy (NYSE: CWEN)(NYSE: CWEN.A) operates a growing portfolio of clean power assets (wind, solar, and natural gas generation) across the U.S. It sells this power to utilities and large corporate customers under long-term, fixed-rate power purchase agreements (PPAs).

Those PPAs produce predictable cash flow, the bulk of which Clearway pays to investors in dividends (a 5.5% current yield). It uses the cash it retains to invest in additional clean power assets. With demand for clean power expected to surge, Clearway Energy can grow its earnings and high-yielding dividend at healthy rates for decades to come.

Diamondback Energy

Diamondback (NASDAQ: FANG) is a leading oil and gas producer in the Permian Basin, which runs through Western Texas and parts of New Mexico. Diamondback has quietly built one of the largest resource bases in that prolific region through a series of highly accretive acquisitions.

The company has nearly 900,000 net acres in the region, with best-in-class inventory depth and quality at 8,400 remaining drilling locations that are economic at $50 per barrel of oil. That massive resource base gives Diamondback Energy a long growth runway to continue supplying the country with more low-cost energy.

Enphase Energy

Enphase Energy (NASDAQ: ENPH) is the world's leading supplier of microinverter-based solar-plus storage systems. The company's microinverters are crucial for converting the direct current (DC) produced by solar panels into the alternating current (AC) used to power our modern society.

While microinverters are more expensive compared to string inverters, they last longer and are more efficient. Enphase has been expanding beyond microinverters to capture a larger total share of a solar panel installation by adding battery storage and software to its packaged offering. It sees a massive $25.4 billion (and growing) market opportunity for its products.

Kinetik Holdings

Kinetik Holdings (NYSE: KNTK) is an energy midstream company focused on the Permian Basin. It owns an extensive natural gas gathering system in the region and holds equity interests in several long-haul pipelines that move Permian production to market centers along the Texas Gulf Coast.

Rising regional production to support growing gas demand is expected to continue fueling robust growth for Kinetik. The company can continue investing capital to expand its existing systems and make bolt-on acquisitions. That growth should give Kinetik Holdings the fuel to continue increasing its high-yielding dividend (over 7%).

NextDecade

NextDecade (NASDAQ: NEXT) is building the Rio Grande LNG export facility in Brownsville, Texas. Phase 1 (LNG liquefaction trains 1-3) is already under construction and should start entering service in 2027. It has enough space to build up to 10 liquefaction trains at this site in the future, enabling the export of gas produced from the Permian and Eagle Ford. NextDecade is also in the early stages of developing a potential carbon-capture and sequestration project at its Rio Grande facility, opening the door to another potentially large market opportunity.

NuScale Power

NuScale Power (NYSE: SMR) is working to bring small modular reactor (SMR) technology to the global energy market. SMRs are smaller nuclear energy reactors built in a factory, which should save construction costs and time. The company currently has a dozen fully factory-fabricated modules in production and is working with a partner to help commercialize the technology. NuScale sees a massive market opportunity for SMRs, especially in helping to meet the enormous and growing power needs of data centers.

Oklo

Oklo (NYSE: OKLO) is developing fast-fission power plants that can use uranium more efficiently than traditional nuclear power plants. The company is building its first Aurora powerhouse, which it expects will be operational in late 2027 or early 2028. Oklo, backed by OpenAI's Sam Altman, has signed commercial deals to sell power produced by its Aurora powerhouses to data center operator Switch, oil and gas producer Diamondback Energy, and others.

QuantumScape

QuantumScape (NYSE: QS) is working to revolutionize energy storage by creating a better battery. Its solid-state lithium metal battery technology will provide faster charging and enhanced safety compared to traditional lithium-ion batteries. The company started shipping its first battery samples to its prospective launch customer earlier this year. QuantumScape estimates that demand for solid-state batteries will exceed 1 terawatt-hour per year by 2040, which it calls a ""truly enormous opportunity"" and ""a challenge worth pursuing.""

High-powered energy stocks

These 10 energy companies have enormous growth potential as the sector continues to grow and evolve. Because of that, they could produce high-octane total returns for their investors in the future. However, they also have higher risk profiles, which is something to keep in mind before buying shares.

The study analyzed over 2.2 million 1- to 5-year-old used cars sold in May 2023 and 2024 and found that the average used EV price is down 29.5 percent year-over-year versus 6.1 percent for the average used gas car price. In May 2024, the average used electric vehicle was priced at $28,767, or 8.3 percent below the average gas car at $31,424. These prices show a major turnaround from a year ago, when the average used EV cost $40,783 and the average used gas car cost $33,469.

Used Electric Vehicle Market Crashing

“There’s no denying the crash in used electric vehicle values over the past year,” said Karl Brauer, Executive Analyst at iSeeCars. “We’ve watched EVs prices fall between 30 and 40 percent since June of last year, while the average gas car’s price has dropped by just 3 to 7 percent in that same timeframe.”

While electric vehicle values appeared to stabilize at the end of 2023, they experienced a substantial drop in February this year and have continued to decline over the past four months. At the same time, the average used gas car price has shifted by approximately $400 during those same four months.

“It’s clear used car shoppers will no longer pay a premium for electric vehicles and, in fact, consider electric powertrains a detractor, making them less desirable – and valuable – than traditional models,” said Brauer.

Used Gas Car Prices Showing Stability

Demand for used gas cars grew during the new car production shortages brought on by the pandemic. This demand pressure is slowly easing, but with used prices hovering around $31,000 they remain well above pre-pandemic levels.

“Over the past year the average used price for traditional internal combustion engine vehicles has never shifted by more than 7 percent, with most months changing between 3 and 6 percent,” said Karl Brauer. “This is in stark contrast to the 30 to 40 percent drops in used EV pricing.”

Used EV Prices Continue To Crash

The ongoing crash in used electric vehicle prices pulled their values below the average used gas cars in February and shows no sign of stopping.

“While the drop in used EV prices is dramatic, what’s more disconcerting is no indication of used EV values stabilizing,” said Brauer. “At some point used EV prices will have to bottom out, but we don’t appear to be at that point yet.”

EV Models Lead the Drop in Used Car Values

When ranking used cars by the biggest price drops over the past year, electric vehicles take up the first seven slots and make up eight of the top 10 models with the largest drops in pricing.

Methodology

iSeeCars analyzed over 2.2 million 1- to 5-year-old used cars sold in May 2023 and 2024. The average listing prices of each car model were compared between the two time periods, and the differences were expressed as both a percentage difference from the 2023 price as well as a dollar difference. Heavy-duty vehicles, low-volume vehicles, vehicles discontinued as of the 2023 model year, and vehicles in production for fewer than four of the last five model years for each period were excluded from further analysis.

John Lewis, the chief executive of char.gy, which operates on-street chargers, welcomed the £400m pledge.
However, the focus has shifted from rapid chargers, which can allay “range anxiety” on longer journeys, to the slower on-street chargers needed for car owners who do not have private parking spaces.
A Department for Transport spokesperson said: “The rapid charging fund was designed to support the rollout of charging infrastructure on motorways and major A roads – but the previous government did not set out detailed plans to deliver this.","Labour ministers have scrapped a promise by the previous government for a £950m fund for installing electric car chargers near motorways, instead setting aside a smaller sum mainly for on-street charging points.

The rapid charging fund (RCF) was first announced in 2020 by Rishi Sunak, then Conservative chancellor, with the aim of supporting upgrades to the grid so that more electric vehicles could be rapidly charged at the same time.

However, it was mired in delays amid concerns it could unfairly benefit some motorway service companies.

The Department for Transport said the RCF had never formally been included in budget plans, so the promise was unfunded.

The Guardian revealed in March that ministers were considering directing proposed funding away from motorway services amid criticism of the fund’s design from industry.

The chancellor, Rachel Reeves, committed £400m over the next five years “to support the rollout of charging infrastructure” in this month’s spending review, after announcing £200m for charging in the autumn budget. It is understood much of the spending will support on-street charge points in poorer areas, where private-sector investment has lagged behind.

However, some people in the charging industry said the government should have honoured the £950m pledge in full, even if the money was redirected towards other incentives for people to switch to EVs.

John Lewis, the chief executive of char.gy, which operates on-street chargers, welcomed the £400m pledge. However, he said: “The key question now is: couldn’t the full amount have been directed towards the EV effort – whether through the continued rollout of on-street charging or other consumer incentives – to give people greater confidence to make the switch to electric?”

The number of electric car chargers in the UK is rising rapidly, passing 80,000 in May, according to the data company Zap Map. That represented a 29% increase compared with a year earlier, while the number of rapid chargers with power above 50kW rose by a third.

Increasing the number of public chargers is seen as crucial to persuading people to switch to electric cars. However, the focus has shifted from rapid chargers, which can allay “range anxiety” on longer journeys, to the slower on-street chargers needed for car owners who do not have private parking spaces.

Ian Johnston, the chief executive of Osprey Charging, said: “New funding should be more effectively deployed on projects in prime locations where the grid connection costs render the site unviable – whether A roads, underserved regions or the small number of motorway locations with unviable grid – rather than gifted to all motorway sites regardless of the costs, as was envisaged under the RCF.”

Johnston also called for changes to road signage permissions to allow charge points to be easily advertised to drivers.

Quentin Willson, the founder of FairCharge, a group campaigning for cheaper charging, said the full £950m should have been spent on accelerating the switch to electric cars.

“Withholding unused RCF funds and not diverting them towards other EV charging initiatives isn’t a great look for government,” he said. “It opens them to the obvious questions about their commitment to the EV transition.”

Willson, a former presenter of Top Gear, said the government should also cut VAT on public charging to match the lower rates available on home electricity.

A Department for Transport spokesperson said: “The rapid charging fund was designed to support the rollout of charging infrastructure on motorways and major A roads – but the previous government did not set out detailed plans to deliver this.

“Since the fund was announced in 2020, the market has changed significantly, with the number of open-access rapid and ultra-rapid charge points within one mile of the strategic road network almost quadrupling in the last three years alone.”",https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c5fb3040d17a8fb58e70942562025b76af0fb878/623_0_4167_3335/master/4167.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=6a9c62e7a5d03c6ee2c59080b646e1bd,N,,2025-06-22 16:02:48.016492

So far, the village's federal grants for the solar array haven't been affected, but local leaders know the risk remains.
In rural areas of Alaska, the costs for many goods can be high, as they must be brought in.
Last year, the 19-year old graduated from the academy, where he learned about solar energy.
And soon, solar energy,"" he said.","GALENA, Alaska -- Eric Huntington built his dream cabin nestled in the wilderness of central Alaska, eventually raising two daughters there. But over the years, he learned that living in this quiet, remote village came with a hefty cost.

Every year, the Huntington family spent about $7,000 on diesel to heat the cabin during bone-chilling winters, and a few years back, a power outage at the town's diesel plant left residents freezing in minus 50 degrees Fahrenheit. When power finally returned hours later, water pipes had frozen, leaving about two dozen homes without running water for days.

""We just didn't open our door all morning until the lights came back on,"" said Huntington, a member of the local Louden Tribe.

In Galena, a sprawling village of 400 people on the banks of the Yukon River, a community built around a former military base is shifting to clean energy in an effort to reduce its reliance on expensive, imported diesel. Local leaders say their nearly completed solar farm, along with an existing biomass plant, will boost the town's savings and protect residents from blackouts during extreme weather. The technology has the potential to provide clean backup power in emergencies and improve the power grid's resiliency, all while diversifying the village's energy sources and providing job opportunities for locals.

The projects come at a precarious time for renewable energy transition in the United States. The Trump administration has canceled billions of dollars of clean energy grants in an effort to bolster fossil fuel production, and billions more in investments have been scrapped or delayed this year. So far, the village's federal grants for the solar array haven't been affected, but local leaders know the risk remains. Whatever the future of public funding, the village is an example of how renewable energies can save costs, boost reliability during extreme weather and create jobs.

Once online, the solar array will ensure that the village's power grid has a backup system, said Tim Kalke, general manager of Sustainable Energy for Galena Alaska, a nonprofit that will operate it. So when the power goes out, it doesn't result in tens of thousands of dollars in repairs, he added, and heat is guaranteed in times of extreme cold.

""You're dealing with life, health and safety,"" he said.

In May, dozens of high school students in navy blue caps and gowns stood with nervous excitement in a locker-brimmed hallway, each waiting their turn to walk through yellow tinsel into a packed auditorium. It was graduation day for Galena Interior Learning Academy.

The school's vocational training courses and cultural offerings attract some 200 students annually from across Alaska, boosting the village's population and energy needs.

Students here can take classes on sustainable energy, aviation, carpentry and much more. But in order to keep it running -- especially during long, cold winters -- it needs heat.

That's where the biomass project comes in. Every winter since 2016, trees, mostly paper birch, are locally harvested and shredded into wood chips that fuel a large boiler plant on campus, offsetting about 100,000 gallons of diesel annually for the school district and the city, said Brad Scotton, a Galena City Council member who also serves on SEGA's board. It's notable as one of the state's first large-scale biomass plants and is the most rural, he added.

Cost savings from using biomass has allowed the Galena City School District to hire certified professionals in trade jobs and do upkeep on campus facilities, said district superintendent Jason R. Johnson in an email.

It's also created a local workforce and a job base the village never used to have. ""It's keeping the money that used to go outside within the community and providing pretty meaningful jobs for people,"" Scotton said.

In rural areas of Alaska, the costs for many goods can be high, as they must be brought in. Galena burns just under 400,000 gallons of diesel annually to produce electricity, and an energy price hike around 2008 helped the village realize something needed to change. Scotton remembered when a gallon of diesel was $1.64 and then skyrocketed to $4.58 another year. At that wholesale price, the city was paying more than $1.8 million to keep the lights on.

""It was really quite a shock to everybody's system in terms of trying to operate with those elevated costs,"" said Scotton. ""So that really got the community assessing whether or not we could continue business as usual with that reliance."" That's when they started looking for grants to build a solar array.

On an overcast May day, on a field flanked by boreal forests, workers in reflective safety vests slotted rectangular panels on a metal grid. They were working on the nearly completed 1.5 megawatt solar farm that will connect to a battery system.

Once it's in use, the community will be able to turn off its diesel engines and run on 100% clean, renewable energy on sunny summer days, and any excess power will be battery stored for nights, emergencies or heating the local indoor pool. The solar array will allow them to shut off the diesel operation between 800 to 1,000 hours a year, totaling about 100,000 gallons.

The solar farm won't necessarily lower people's electricity bills. But like the biomass plant, the hope is that it will stabilize energy costs, allowing those savings to go back into the community, all while providing work opportunities for residents like Aaren Sommer.

Last year, the 19-year old graduated from the academy, where he learned about solar energy. Now he's helping to install the solar array. ""That's going to reduce the diesel usage a whole bunch over at the power plant, which is going to help us out,"" he said.

In addition to the solar farm and biomass project, the Louden Tribe is building new energy-efficient homes that will help members be less reliant on diesel. Some of the siding used in the homes comes from wood harvested in the area.

In November, the Huntington family moved into a new, stilted house with a solar-compatible roof, 13-inch walls and 18 inches of insulation to keep the cold at bay. When they lived in the cabin, the $7,000 a year Huntington spent on diesel was a good chunk of his annual income.

The new home's energy-efficient features are already saving them money. The 300-gallon diesel tank Huntington filled before moving cost him about $2,400. Six months later, he still has unused fuel in the tank.

The Huntingtons are one of eight families the tribe has moved into sustainable homes, and they plan to turn over the keys to three more this year.

Kalke, SEGA's general manager, is often asked what Galena produces. He used to just say education.

""But since 2016 you can say education and wood chips. And soon, solar energy,"" he said.

The executive orders direct government agencies to work more efficiently as customers and supporters of new energy technologies. They focus on modernizing how companies license, fuel, and build advanced nuclear power to meet growing energy demand.

Oklo stands out in the nuclear space because it's developing fast fission power plants that can recycle used nuclear material and convert it into clean, reliable power. The company already has an active site use permit from the Department of Energy, making it the only advanced nuclear developer with this approval.

Nuclear fission energy works by splitting atoms to release massive amounts of energy with zero carbon pollution. This technology could change how we power our communities by providing clean, reliable electricity that doesn't depend on weather conditions like solar or wind power.

Nuclear plants can run 24/7 for decades without interruption, providing stable electricity prices that protect homes from volatile energy markets.

Oklo's use of recycled nuclear fuel from old reactors means the company can turn what was once considered waste into clean energy, solving two problems simultaneously.

The company's power plants can use fresh uranium or recycled nuclear material, offering flexibility in fuel sourcing. This diversification reduces dependence on dirty energy while creating a more secure supply chain.

By expanding nuclear energy options, such projects can help reduce reliance on polluting coal and gas plants. Cleaner air means fewer respiratory problems, heart disease cases, and other health issues linked to dirty energy sources.

The executive orders also emphasize using existing domestic nuclear fuel to jump-start early projects and strengthen national energy resilience, which could help the United States become more energy independent while creating good-paying jobs in the clean energy sector.

""These executive orders are about enabling deployment. They show clear alignment around the need to modernize how we license, fuel, and build advanced nuclear power to meet rising demand,"" Jacob DeWitte, co-founder and CEO of Oklo, said.",https://www.thecooldown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Okloimage-reck5tgAhVQ1jyzoz.jpg,N,,2025-06-22 15:03:49.631709

Beyond its value to the grid, hydropower is a direct economic engine for America’s communities.
Hydropower facilities provide local jobs that are often high-paying technical positions, forging long-term career pathways for residents.
Historically, hydropower hasn’t received the same level of federal support as other energy sources, despite its strong track record.
An investment in hydropower is an investment in the future of America’s communities.","As Congress turns its attention to a budget reconciliation bill that could shape the nation’s energy future, it is essential not to overlook one of our most reliable and time-tested sources of baseload electricity: hydropower.

My company has been fortunate to contribute to this critical industry for more than 40 years. But much of the budget reconciliation process in Washington has ignored hydropower. The House-passed bill is missing big opportunities to support this technology. Without continued investment in our hydroelectric infrastructure, we could face dire consequences.

Our nation is currently focused on increasing domestic energy output, supporting technological innovation and creating jobs. Hydropower offers a compelling and often underappreciated value proposition. It is a foundation for emission-free grid reliability, economic development, job creation and energy independence.

Unlike other renewable sources of electricity, hydropower delivers energy around the clock, making it an essential source of baseload power. Without hydropower’s steady and reliable output, keeping the grid stable would become much harder and more expensive. Those rising costs don’t disappear; they ultimately show up in consumers’ energy bills.

What’s more, hydropower’s flexibility allows it to ramp up quickly when demand spikes or when intermittent renewables like wind and solar dip unexpectedly. It’s one of the few energy sources that can respond to grid needs in seconds. This makes it a vital partner in a grid increasingly dominated by variable demand and resources.

Beyond its value to the grid, hydropower is a direct economic engine for America’s communities. Hydropower facilities provide local jobs that are often high-paying technical positions, forging long-term career pathways for residents.

Many hydropower projects also create and maintain reservoirs and waterways that support flood protection, agriculture, water storage, tourism, fishing, and outdoor recreation, contributing millions of dollars annually to local economies. In our decades of work in this field, we have seen these benefits drive prosperity for generations.

Historically, hydropower hasn’t received the same level of federal support as other energy sources, despite its strong track record. That needs to change. Through the reconciliation process, Congress has a pivotal chance to correct that imbalance and invest in one of our most dependable forms of U.S. energy.

The bill text just released by the Senate is a step in the right direction, but there remains a host of critical priorities to strengthen our hydropower resources, such as extending the investment tax credits to dam safety and environmental upgrades at existing facilities and streamlining licensing and relicensing processes.

America’s hydropower fleet is aging, — most facilities are more than 65 years old. This longevity is a testament to hydropower’s durability and value, but it also signals an urgent need for reinvestment. We see this firsthand as we work to repair aging and deteriorated dam structures.

These facilities have the potential to serve our communities for decades to come as “forever assets,” but only if we modernize them. This requires updated tax incentives, streamlined licensing processes and policies that reflect the crucial role of hydropower in our energy mix.

If we let these critical assets deteriorate, the costs will fall directly onto consumers in the form of higher rates and lost services. We cannot let that happen. It is imperative that we act now.

This is a defining moment. The next four years in Washington will be decisive for hydropower, as about 40 percent of the non-federal fleet is facing license expiration in the next decade. Many facilities could voluntarily shut down if the support they need isn’t there.

If hydropower isn’t fully valued, our communities will pay the price with higher bills, fewer jobs and a less stable grid. I strongly urge lawmakers in Washington, D.C., to back hydropower and value it in the current budget bill and future legislative efforts. An investment in hydropower is an investment in the future of America’s communities.

(CNN) — Sign up for CNN’s Life, But Greener newsletter. Our limited newsletter series guides you on how to minimize your personal role in the climate crisis — and reduce your eco-anxiety.

Whether it’s answering work emails or drafting wedding vows, generative artificial intelligence tools have become a trusty copilot in many people’s lives. But a growing body of research shows that for every problem AI solves, hidden environmental costs are racking up.

Each word in an AI prompt is broken down into clusters of numbers called “token IDs” and sent to massive data centers — some larger than football fields — powered by coal or natural gas plants. There, stacks of large computers generate responses through dozens of rapid calculations.

The whole process can take up to 10 times more energy to complete than a regular Google search, according to a frequently cited estimation by the Electric Power Research Institute.

So, for each prompt you give AI, what’s the damage? To find out, researchers in Germany tested 14 large language model (LLM) AI systems by asking them both free-response and multiple-choice questions. Complex questions produced up to six times more carbon dioxide emissions than questions with concise answers.

In addition, “smarter” LLMs with more reasoning abilities produced up to 50 times more carbon emissions than simpler systems to answer the same question, the study reported.

“This shows us the tradeoff between energy consumption and the accuracy of model performance,” said Maximilian Dauner, a doctoral student at Hochschule München University of Applied Sciences and first author of the Frontiers in Communication study published Wednesday.

Typically, these smarter, more energy intensive LLMs have tens of billions more parameters — the biases used for processing token IDs — than smaller, more concise models.

“You can think of it like a neural network in the brain. The more neuron connections, the more thinking you can do to answer a question,” Dauner said.

What you can do to reduce your carbon footprint

Complex questions require more energy in part because of the lengthy explanations many AI models are trained to provide, Dauner said. If you ask an AI chatbot to solve an algebra question for you, it may take you through the steps it took to find the answer, he said.

“AI expends a lot of energy being polite, especially if the user is polite, saying ‘please’ and ‘thank you,’” Dauner explained. “But this just makes their responses even longer, expending more energy to generate each word.”

For this reason, Dauner suggests users be more straightforward when communicating with AI models. Specify the length of the answer you want and limit it to one or two sentences, or say you don’t need an explanation at all.

Most important, Dauner’s study highlights that not all AI models are created equally, said Sasha Luccioni, the climate lead at AI company Hugging Face, in an email. Users looking to reduce their carbon footprint can be more intentional about which model they chose for which task.

“Task-specific models are often much smaller and more efficient, and just as good at any context-specific task,” Luccioni explained.

If you are a software engineer who solves complex coding problems every day, an AI model suited for coding may be necessary. But for the average high school student who wants help with homework, relying on powerful AI tools is like using a nuclear-powered digital calculator.

Even within the same AI company, different model offerings can vary in their reasoning power, so research what capabilities best suit your needs, Dauner said.

When possible, Luccioni recommends going back to basic sources — online encyclopedias and phone calculators — to accomplish simple tasks.

Why it’s hard to measure AI’s environmental impact

Putting a number on the environmental impact of AI has proved challenging.

The study noted that energy consumption can vary based on the user’s proximity to local energy grids and the hardware used to run AI models.

That’s partly why the researchers chose to represent carbon emissions within a range, Dauner said.

Furthermore, many AI companies don’t share information about their energy consumption — or details like server size or optimization techniques that could help researchers estimate energy consumption, said Shaolei Ren, an associate professor of electrical and computer engineering at the University of California, Riverside who studies AI’s water consumption.

“You can’t really say AI consumes this much energy or water on average — that’s just not meaningful. We need to look at each individual model and then (examine what it uses) for each task,” Ren said.

One way AI companies could be more transparent is by disclosing the amount of carbon emissions associated with each prompt, Dauner suggested.

“Generally, if people were more informed about the average (environmental) cost of generating a response, people would maybe start thinking, ‘Is it really necessary to turn myself into an action figure just because I’m bored?’ Or ‘do I have to tell ChatGPT jokes because I have nothing to do?’” Dauner said.

Additionally, as more companies push to add generative AI tools to their systems, people may not have much choice how or when they use the technology, Luccioni said.

“We don’t need generative AI in web search. Nobody asked for AI chatbots in (messaging apps) or on social media,” Luccioni said. “This race to stuff them into every single existing technology is truly infuriating, since it comes with real consequences to our planet.”

With less available information about AI’s resource usage, consumers have less choice, Ren said, adding that regulatory pressures for more transparency are unlikely to the United States anytime soon. Instead, the best hope for more energy-efficient AI may lie in the cost efficacy of using less energy.

“Overall, I’m still positive about (the future). There are many software engineers working hard to improve resource efficiency,” Ren said. “Other industries consume a lot of energy too, but it’s not a reason to suggest AI’s environmental impact is not a problem. We should definitely pay attention.”",https://kvia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/cnn-L19jb21wb25lbnRzL2ltYWdlL2luc3RhbmNlcy9jbWM1YmtjMnowMDFiM2o2bndhZDM3OHA2-L19jb21wb25lbnRzL2FydGljbGUvaW5zdGFuY2VzL2NtYzViZzM0bzAwdGwyN3FlaDludmhueHk.jpg,N,,2025-06-22 15:04:01.166503

The study analyzed over 2.2 million 1- to 5-year-old used cars sold in May 2023 and 2024 and found that the average used EV price is down 29.5 percent year-over-year versus 6.1 percent for the average used gas car price. In May 2024, the average used electric vehicle was priced at $28,767, or 8.3 percent below the average gas car at $31,424. These prices show a major turnaround from a year ago, when the average used EV cost $40,783 and the average used gas car cost $33,469.

Used Electric Vehicle Market Crashing

“There’s no denying the crash in used electric vehicle values over the past year,” said Karl Brauer, Executive Analyst at iSeeCars. “We’ve watched EVs prices fall between 30 and 40 percent since June of last year, while the average gas car’s price has dropped by just 3 to 7 percent in that same timeframe.”

While electric vehicle values appeared to stabilize at the end of 2023, they experienced a substantial drop in February this year and have continued to decline over the past four months. At the same time, the average used gas car price has shifted by approximately $400 during those same four months.

“It’s clear used car shoppers will no longer pay a premium for electric vehicles and, in fact, consider electric powertrains a detractor, making them less desirable – and valuable – than traditional models,” said Brauer.

Used Gas Car Prices Showing Stability

Demand for used gas cars grew during the new car production shortages brought on by the pandemic. This demand pressure is slowly easing, but with used prices hovering around $31,000 they remain well above pre-pandemic levels.

“Over the past year the average used price for traditional internal combustion engine vehicles has never shifted by more than 7 percent, with most months changing between 3 and 6 percent,” said Karl Brauer. “This is in stark contrast to the 30 to 40 percent drops in used EV pricing.”

Used EV Prices Continue To Crash

The ongoing crash in used electric vehicle prices pulled their values below the average used gas cars in February and shows no sign of stopping.

“While the drop in used EV prices is dramatic, what’s more disconcerting is no indication of used EV values stabilizing,” said Brauer. “At some point used EV prices will have to bottom out, but we don’t appear to be at that point yet.”

EV Models Lead the Drop in Used Car Values

When ranking used cars by the biggest price drops over the past year, electric vehicles take up the first seven slots and make up eight of the top 10 models with the largest drops in pricing.

Methodology

iSeeCars analyzed over 2.2 million 1- to 5-year-old used cars sold in May 2023 and 2024. The average listing prices of each car model were compared between the two time periods, and the differences were expressed as both a percentage difference from the 2023 price as well as a dollar difference. Heavy-duty vehicles, low-volume vehicles, vehicles discontinued as of the 2023 model year, and vehicles in production for fewer than four of the last five model years for each period were excluded from further analysis.

The 70% Solution: How 156 Residents Are Redefining Rural Energy Furner’s solar statistics are staggering.","I’m standing at the edge of a tiny South Australian farming community where roof after roof glistens with solar panels. On this crisp winter morning, Furner—population 156—seems unremarkable at first glance. But I’ve just discovered Australia’s unlikely renewable energy champion. With 45 solar systems per 100 dwellings, this microscopic agricultural settlement is silently outperforming Adelaide’s trendy eco-suburbs in green energy adoption.

My rental car thermometer reads 8°C as I navigate the empty streets, exactly 337 kilometers southeast of Adelaide. What brought me to this dot on the map? A tip from a regional energy consultant who called Furner “Australia’s most surprising solar success story.” He wasn’t exaggerating.

The 70% Solution: How 156 Residents Are Redefining Rural Energy

Furner’s solar statistics are staggering. That 45 systems per 100 dwellings translates to roughly 70% of all homes generating their own power—far exceeding Australia’s national average of about 30%. For context, this achievement would be remarkable in a major city with sustainability initiatives, let alone a farming community established in 1896.

“We’re practical people,” explains a sunburned farmer as we chat outside the Furner Community Hall. “Solar just makes sense when you’re this far from everything.” His pragmatism echoes throughout the community.

Unlike Queensland’s rapidly growing regions that attract headlines for population booms, Furner’s revolution is quieter. The town sits at approximately 65 meters elevation in the Limestone Coast region, where agricultural production—beef, wool, lamb, blue gums, and native flowers—has been the economic backbone since 1847.

What’s most striking is how this transition happened without fanfare. No government showcases. No sustainability awards. Just a community quietly adapting to changing energy landscapes while maintaining deep agricultural roots.

South Australia’s Rural Innovation Versus Urban Adoption

When comparing Furner to Adelaide’s eco-conscious neighborhoods, the contrast is striking. While urban sustainability often comes with architectural showcases and technology demonstrations, Furner’s approach is understated yet more comprehensive.

“We visited expecting rural Australia. We found tomorrow’s energy community instead. It’s like they’ve solved problems the cities are still debating.”

Unlike Tasmania’s unique coastal experiences that blend tourism with conservation, Furner offers no packaged experiences. What you see is authentic rural ingenuity—solar panels on weathered farmhouses, water management systems supporting intensive agriculture, and a community hall that doubles as an emergency shelter powered entirely by renewable energy.

This winter morning reveals another advantage: even with June’s limited sunlight, the systems produce enough energy for basic needs. Similar to America’s emerging rural stargazing destinations, Furner benefits from minimal light pollution, creating potential for astronomy-focused sustainable tourism.

What Guidebooks Won’t Tell You About Furner

Access Furner via Princes Highway, turning onto Furner Road. Park anywhere—space isn’t an issue in a town of 156. Visit during late morning when solar production peaks and locals are most receptive to conversations about their energy systems.

The Ken Stuckey Arboretum offers a peaceful walking trail through native vegetation. Geocaching enthusiasts will find hidden caches throughout the reserve—an unexpected treasure-hunting opportunity.

For accommodation, unlike massive innovative community developments, Furner offers no hotels. Stay in Millicent (25km west) or arrange farmstays through regional tourism offices.

By 2026, as 2025 sustainable tourism trends evolve, Furner could become a case study in rural energy transformation. Visit now before educational eco-tourism puts this hidden gem on the map.

As I prepare to leave, watching morning sun intensify on solar panels across town, I’m reminded that Australia’s energy future may not be designed in corporate boardrooms but in places like Furner—where necessity, practicality and community spirit have created what policy alone could not. Sarah would call it “accidental brilliance”—the kind of unplanned perfection that makes travel journalism endlessly rewarding.",https://www.journee-mondiale.com/en/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/2025-06-22-21-27-20_.webp,N,,2025-06-22 16:03:05.297716

The event also featured panel discussions, a documentary screening, and an ecotourism expo where residents could tour some of the green projects already in the area.

For Fulton residents like Maureen Crocker, the environment and ecosystem of the area is what drew her to the Coastal Bend in the first place. ""I've spent my entire life in the some of the biggest cities in the country. And the first time I came down to Rockport, Fulton, I just fell in love with it.

Belaire emphasizing the area’s ecological significance, noting, ""We have several ecosystems and we're fortunate enough that unlike some of the larger cities, the bays that have larger cities on them, we, we haven't had the impact to our ecosystems that they have."" He continued, ""We still have abundant sea grass, unlike Galveston Bay, which lost all of its sea grass in the 1970s.""

""It came about through art. Artists have been lured here for decades by our ecosystem, painting wildlife scenes and picturesque areas,"" RCAD Executive Director Jennifer Day told KRIS 6 about the decision to host the inaugural event. She highlighted recent initiatives, including certified wildlife habitats in public spaces and Rockport’s designation as the ""Ecosystem Capital of the Texas Gulf Coast.""

There are a couple of claims about China and its car industry that are quite common and aim to discredit what Chinese automakers have been achieving in the EV world. Overall, the idea is that EV producers get too much government support. However, there are a couple of things to note about this that a commenter recently pointed out in an insightful comment on CleanTechnica.

First of all, a key is really the consistency of China’s long-term vision to transition to EVs. China has had quite a consistent and predictable drive in its long-term goal of phasing out polluting gas cars. It has used various carrots and sticks in that regard. That’s a positive thing. Europe has been similar, but has had a little more auto industry influence trying to slow down or effectively slowing down pro-EV policies. The US has been like a slow, old, half-broken train trying to get somewhere with its EV policies. When Democrats have had power, they’ve gotten almost half-decent policies through. When Republicans have been in power, they’ve pulled those back a bit. Is it China’s fault that Europe and especially the US have weaker, less persistent policies telling the auto industry that it’s time to move to EVs? Is it a problem that China is consistent and doesn’t give in to legacy automakers and back down on its vision?

Before I get to the second point, I’ll include that reader comment, from “fsc,” here in full:

“The evil Chinese government is helping the companies out-competing the very corporations that the Holy US Government ILLEGALLY bailed out from bankruptcy! Let’s punish China for interfering in the market!

“My hypocrisy meter goes red on this whole theme about how it is China’s fault that they have an industrial policy and the US does not. IMHO: it is the opposite. We failed to adapt to changing technology and consumer desires and are getting our lunch eaten for our corporate short-sightedness.

“This is 1980’s Japanese car crisis 2.0

“When the oil crisis hit, Americans wanted small cars and Detroit refused to make them. ‘Big cars, big profits. Small cars, small profits’ Henry Ford III once said. They dragged their feet as the market evolved and got hit by their arrogance. I am old enough to remember the bumper stickers: ‘No job? Eat your Toyota.’ People were really pissed-off at Japan while they were making a killing in showrooms despite the hatred.

“Now that the world demands EVs, we are seeing a news rerun of the 1980s. Just substitute BYD for Toyota, and the US market for the world.

“‘Those who do not learn from history are condemned to repeat it.’ George Santayana”

The second point here is about the bailouts. The US has interfered in the market significantly by bailing out its legacy automakers when the were in crisis. The Germany government has heavily supported the German auto industry, the French government the French auto industry, the Italian government the Italian auto industry….

I’ve actually been surprised at times at how willing China has been to let giant companies collapse and go bankrupt. In particular, I was surprised to see this in the solar industry, but it has been the case in other industries as well. If big Chinese automakers do get into financial trouble, will the Chinese government bail them out? I wouldn’t bet on it, actually. There are plenty of highly competitive automakers, and I assume the government would let the market play out and let the best companies win. The Chinese government seems very keen on having intense competition and then letting the market pick winners and losers. It seems that the government is much less under the thumb of mega-corporations than governments in the West.

Of course, some may see that as a problem — the government having too much power. But in this case, in the auto industry, having a strong government that is not pushed around by slow-moving legacy automakers appears to be a definite plus that leads to more competitive companies, a more competitive industry, and faster innovation and growth. The Chinese government is not letting itself be dragged back or slowed down by excessive corporate influence. The vision is there, the vision is good, and the vision is being implemented.",https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/BYD-dealership-Philippines.jpg,N,,2025-06-22 13:08:40.816743

In this regard, the CAA requires “state implementation plans” include “adequate” provisions” to prevent in-state emissions activity that would interfere the air quality compliance efforts of other states.

“There is a faint signal of hope in the update in that the rate of increase in carbon dioxide emissions over the last decade has slowed compared to the 2000s. But global mean sea-level rise continues to accelerate,” Ramesh said on X, citing the analysis.

“The earth’s energy imbalance, which represents the difference between the radiative forces acting to warm the climate on the one hand and to oppose the warming on the other, has increased significantly,” he said.

Most worryingly continued emissions of all greenhouse gases at current levels would cause human-induced global warming to reach the critical 1.5 degrees Celsius in about five years, Ramesh said.

The present policies of the US could well advance this tipping point, he said and added that already 2024 was the hottest year on record.

A year later, he promised to deliver them the next year, but that didn’t happen either.

Despite the empty pledges the promises kept coming. Last year in January, Musk said, “Next year for sure, we’ll have over a million robotaxis.”

Would you settle for 10 or 12?

Musk appears to be on the verge of making his robotaxi vision a reality with a test run of a small squad of self-driving cabs in Austin, Texas, starting Sunday. Reaching a million may take a year or more, however, although the billionaire should be able to expand the service this year if the Austin demo is a success.

The stakes couldn’t be higher, nor the challenges.

While Musk was making those “next year” promises, rival Waymo was busy deploying driverless taxis in Los Angeles, San Diego, Austin and other cities by using a different technology that allowed it to get to market faster. It just completed its 10 millionth paid ride.

Boycotts related to Musk’s politics have tanked Tesla’s sales. Rival electric vehicle makers with newly competitive models have stolen market share. And investors are on edge after a $150 billion stock wipeout when Musk picked a social media fight with a U.S. president overseeing federal car regulators who could make the robotaxi rollout much more difficult. The stock has recovered somewhat after Musk said he regretted some of his remarks.

Tesla shareholders have stood by Musk over the years because he’s defied the odds by building a successful standalone electric vehicle company — self-driving car promises aside — and making them a lot of money in the process. A decade ago, Tesla shares traded for around $18. The shares closed Friday at $322.

Musk says the Austin test will begin modestly enough, with just 10 or 12 vehicles picking up passengers in a limited area. But then it will quickly ramp up and spread to other cities, eventually reaching hundreds of thousands if not a million vehicles next year.

Some Musk watchers on Wall Street are skeptical.

“How quickly can he expand the fleet?” asks Garrett Nelson, an analyst at CFRA. “We’re talking maybe a dozen vehicles initially. It’s very small.”

Morningstar’s Seth Goldstein says Musk is being classic Musk: Promising too much, too quickly.

“When anyone in Austin can download the app and use a robotaxi, that will be a success, but I don’t think that will happen until 2028,” he says. “Testing is going to take a while.”

Musk’s tendency to push up the stock high with a bit of hyperbole is well known among investors.

In 2018, he told Tesla stockholders he had “funding secured” to buy all their shares at a massive premium and take the company private. But he not only lacked a written commitment from financiers, according to federal stock regulators who fined him, he hadn’t discussed the loan amount or other details with them.

More recently, Musk told CNBC in May that Tesla was experiencing a “major rebound” in demand. A week later an auto trade group in Europe announced sales had plunged by half.

Musk has come under fire for allegedly exaggerating the ability of the system used for its cars to drive themselves, starting with the name. Full Self-Driving is a misnomer. The system still requires drivers to keep their eyes on the road because they may need to intervene and take control at any moment.

Federal highway safety regulators opened an investigation into FSD last year after several accidents, and the Department of Justice has conducted its own probe, though the status of that is not known. Tesla has also faced lawsuits over the feature, some resulting in settlements, other dismissed. In one case, a judge ruled against the plaintiffs but only because they hadn’t proved Musk “knowingly” made false statements.

Musk says the robotaxis will be running on an improved version of Full Self-Driving and the cabs will be safe.

He also says the service will be able to expand rapidly around the country. His secret weapon: Millions of Tesla owners now on the roads. He says an over-the-air software update will soon allow them to turn their cars into driverless cabs and start a side business while stuck at the office for eight hours or on vacation for a week.

“Instead of having your car sit in the parking lot, your car could be earning money,” Musk said earlier this year, calling it an Airbnb model for cars. “You will be able to add or subtract your car to the fleet.”

Musk says Tesla also can move fast to deploy taxis now because of his decision to rely only on cameras for the cars to navigate, unlike Waymo, which has gone a more expensive route by supplementing its cameras with lasers and radar.

“Tesla will have, I don’t know,” Musk mused in an conference call with investors, ”99% market share or something ridiculous.” Given Waymo’s head start and potential competition from Amazon and others, dominating the driverless market to that extent could be a reach.

But Dan Ives, a Wedbush Securities analyst and big Musk fan, says this time Musk may actually pull it off because of Tesla’s ability to scale up quickly. And even skeptics like Morningstar’s Goldstein acknowledge that Musk occasionally does gets things right, and spectacularly so.

He upended the car industry by getting people to buy expensive electric vehicles, brought his Starlink satellite internet service to rural areas and, more recently, performed a gee-whiz trick of landing an unmanned SpaceX rocket on a platform back on earth.

Hydrogen fuel cell vehicles employ a method known as reverse electrolysis.
In theory, that would be the easiest way to power a hydrogen fuel cell vehicle, but as we mentioned, many of them use reverse electrolysis instead.
Speaking of which, the fuel economy of a hydrogen fuel cell vehicle is twice that of standard gasoline engines.
Hydrogen fuel cell vehicles may give you more fuel economy, but no one knows the kind of maintenance they will need or how much it will cost.","Ah, alternative fuels. Aren't they the best? It all started with a hybrid car, which led to plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs), and now battery-electric vehicles (BEVs) are dominating the scene. Hydrogen fuel cell vehicles are also possible these days. The how is pretty scientific, but we can break it down easily. Hydrogen fuel cell vehicles employ a method known as reverse electrolysis. They're a great alternative to gasoline-powered vehicles, especially since they emit zero carbon dioxide emissions, except for some water coming out of the tailpipe. And we don't recommend you drink it.

Anyone who has taken chemistry in high school knows that the elements that make up water are two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom. With a little electricity, we can split up the atoms, and voila! In theory, that would be the easiest way to power a hydrogen fuel cell vehicle, but as we mentioned, many of them use reverse electrolysis instead. This is the process of introducing hydrogen to water in a fuel-cell stack. When they combine, they produce the electricity that turns the wheels. However, surely, there must be some cons to a vehicle filled with a highly combustible gas, right?

Let's talk about the good first. They're quiet, smooth, and can drive laps around the standard BEV, only needing five minutes to refuel. Speaking of which, the fuel economy of a hydrogen fuel cell vehicle is twice that of standard gasoline engines. As we mentioned, the energy comes from hydrogen and oxygen, both of which are clearly abundant, meaning the fuel for hydrogen fuel cell vehicles comes from a renewable energy source we may never run out of.

Let's look at the opposites. It may only take five minutes to refuel, but have you seen a hydrogen fueling station? The infrastructure to build them is pretty limited, and so far, they're only in California. Hydrogen fuel cell vehicles may give you more fuel economy, but no one knows the kind of maintenance they will need or how much it will cost. And if your fuel cell blows, it's going to be a costly replacement, so there goes all the money you could potentially save on gasoline.

Plus, there are obvious safety concerns over the flammability of hydrogen, which President Trump keeps claiming. H2O may be a renewable energy source, but the current hydrogen used to power hydrogen fuel cell vehicles is a nonrenewable natural gas that actually creates enormous CO2 emissions. It's a catch 22, over here. Thankfully, Kia is working on green hydrogen to turn that around with carbon neutrality.",https://www.jalopnik.com/img/gallery/are-hydrogen-fuel-cars-worth-it-the-pros-cons-explained/l-intro-1749735043.jpg,N,,2025-06-22 12:16:16.723980

What global banks are doing right now isn’t a reversal of climate commitments—it’s a long-overdue reality check. In 2024, they dumped nearly $900 billion into fossil fuel financing, according to the latest “Banking on Climate Chaos” report. And while advocacy groups are clutching their pearls, investors are quietly nodding.

Banks funding fossil fuels haven’t lost their way—they’ve just stopped pretending.

JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, Citigroup, and Barclays topped the charts, each tacking on over $10 billion in new fossil-fuel financing. JPM alone dropped $53.5 billion into oil, gas, and coal. That’s not exactly chump change—and it’s certainly not the behavior of an institution planning to kick the hydrocarbon habit anytime soon.

Critics say this undermines climate targets. The reality? These banks were never designed to hit climate targets. Their mandate is to maximize returns. And with interest rates stabilizing, oil prices firming, and energy demand still rising globally, fossil fuel investments—messy, profitable, scalable—are back in vogue.

Yes, some of these banks made splashy commitments during the ESG boom. They joined net-zero alliances. They funded glossy sustainability reports. But those were branding exercises, not binding strategies. The minute those commitments became a regulatory liability—or a political punchline—they started dissolving. Exhibit A: the exodus from the UN-sponsored Net-Zero Banking Alliance, timed nicely with President Trump’s return to office.

“This reversal exemplifies the limits of voluntary commitments by financial firms whose primary goal is short-term profit,” the report complains. That’s the closest the report comes to admitting the obvious: voluntary green finance was always a shaky foundation for decarbonization.

In fact, the Banking on Climate Chaos report makes that plain: banks committed $869 billion to fossil fuel companies in 2024 alone—up $162 billion from the year before. Nearly half of that financing came from U.S.-based banks, with JPMorgan Chase leading at $53.5 billion, followed by Bank of America ($46 billion) and Citigroup ($44.7 billion). Barclays was the top fossil fuel financier in Europe at $35.4 billion. Meanwhile, over $347 billion went to the top 100 companies actively expanding their fossil fuel operations.

For a supposedly dying industry, fossil fuels are drawing a staggering amount of capital.

It’s not lost on anyone that some of the same banks being scolded for fossil fuel financing are still pouring money into renewables and climate tech. But here’s the thing: they’re not missionaries—they’re market players. And right now, oil and gas projects are delivering stable returns, while clean tech continues to wrestle with cost overruns, supply chain headaches, and policy volatility.

Banks are not public policy arms. They’re capital allocators. And right now, capital is flowing toward fossil fuels for one simple reason: the energy transition isn’t happening fast enough to make renewables the better bet.

There’s also the regulatory vacuum to consider. As long as no one is forcing banks to price in climate risk with real teeth, voluntary initiatives will keep folding under pressure. A report can scold them all it wants—until there’s a law on the books or a tax on the balance sheet, banks will do what they’ve always done: follow the money.

What’s more, climate advocacy itself has lost coherence. The same groups that demand banks stop lending to fossil fuels often oppose mining permits for the metals and minerals needed for clean tech. That contradiction hasn’t gone unnoticed in boardrooms. Banks, to their credit, have at least picked a lane: they’ll fund what actually gets built.

And for now, what’s getting built—at scale, at speed, and at profit—is still largely oil and gas. As long as energy security, inflation, and political volatility remain unresolved, fossil fuels will continue to look like the safer bet. Not morally. But financially.

So yes, banks are still backing fossil fuels. And yes, they’re still issuing climate reports. But no, they’re not confused. They’re just honest—at least in their balance sheets. The climate movement may not like it, but until the economics change or the regulations bite, this isn’t a scandal. It’s a strategy. And for now, it seems to be working.

The funding package –comprising debt and a performance-based grant from the regional financier with support from the World Bank– was announced last Wednesday on the sidelines of the Africa Energy Forum (AEF) in Cape Town, South Africa.

Burn, the maker of Jikokoa and Ecoa stoves, says the funding will be used to subsidise prices in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and Mozambique, where it is already selling, and expand operations into Zambia. In addition to wood and charcoal stoves, Burn also manufactures electric, LPG, and ethanol cookstoves.

The company plans to repay the debt using revenue from carbon credits, a model it already uses in Kenya to make its cookstoves more affordable.

“This particular funding is meant to help reach underserved communities in DRC, Mozambique, and Zambia. We’re manufacturing in Kenya and will continue to do so, but the stoves will be distributed in these three countries,” said Leif Haerum, Burn’s Chief Financial Officer, during the signing.

The two financial facilities are expected to help subsidise 429,127 cookstoves across the three countries, although the specific stove models were not disclosed.

While Burn already operates in DRC and Mozambique, this marks its entry into the Zambian market, supplying Kenyan-made stoves designed to be more energy-efficient than traditional cookstoves. The company also has a presence in Tanzania, Somalia, Ghana, and Nigeria.

The firm’s business model hinges on selling carbon credits –earned by the reduction of carbon emissions through the use of its energy-saving stoves – and using the proceeds to subsidise product prices and promote uptake, especially among low-income households.

A carbon credit represents a certificate for avoiding the emission of one tonne of carbon dioxide equivalent. These credits can be sold to companies looking to offset their own greenhouse gas emissions.

This is the first time Burn is taking a loan to be repaid through future carbon credit revenues, marking a shift in its financing model. But CEO Peter Scott said the company expects to pursue more such arrangements in the near future.

“Burn is confident that this will be the first of many such deals with TDB and similar institutions,” he said following the signing in Cape Town.

TDB, the financial arm of the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (Comesa), primarily funds trade and infrastructure projects for public and private entities across the region.

This financing is part of a broader partnership with the World Bank to accelerate access to clean energy across Africa through a mix of debt, grants, and equity directed at small and medium-sized enterprises in the sector.

The move also aligns with the Mission300 initiative – launched by the World Bank and the African Development Bank (AfDB) in January – which aims to connect 300 million Africans to modern, affordable, and clean energy by 2030.",https://www.businessdailyafrica.com/resource/image/5041360/landscape_ratio3x2/1200/800/fb06343c65ac676c979483b0d9990cca/to/peter.jpg,N,,2025-06-22 13:07:44.466935

Scientists say crossing that limit would mean worse heat waves and droughts, bigger storms and sea-level rise that could imperil small island nations.

He added that efforts to curb emissions and the impacts of climate change must continue even if the 1.5 degree threshold is exceeded.","WASHINGTON (AP):

Humans are on track to release so much greenhouse gas in less than three years that a key threshold for limiting global warming will be nearly unavoidable, according to a study to be released Thursday.

The report predicts that society will have emitted enough carbon dioxide by early 2028 that crossing an important long-term temperature boundary will be more likely than not. The scientists calculate that by that point there will be enough of the heat-trapping gas in the atmosphere to create a 50-50 chance or greater that the world will be locked in to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) of long-term warming since preindustrial times. That level of gas accumulation, which comes from the burning of fuels like gasoline, oil and coal, is sooner than the same group of 60 international scientists calculated in a study last year.

“Things aren’t just getting worse. They’re getting worse faster,” said study co-author Zeke Hausfather of the tech firm Stripe and the climate monitoring group Berkeley Earth. “We’re actively moving in the wrong direction in a critical period of time that we would need to meet our most ambitious climate goals. Some reports, there’s a silver lining. I don’t think there really is one in this one.”

That 1.5 goal, first set in the 2015 Paris agreement, has been a cornerstone of international efforts to curb worsening climate change. Scientists say crossing that limit would mean worse heat waves and droughts, bigger storms and sea-level rise that could imperil small island nations. Over the last 150 years, scientists have established a direct correlation between the release of certain levels of carbon dioxide, along with other greenhouse gases like methane, and specific increases in global temperatures.

In last Thursday’s Indicators of Global Climate Change report, researchers calculated that society can spew only 143 billion more tons (130 billion metric tons) of carbon dioxide before the 1.5 limit becomes technically inevitable. The world is producing 46 billion tons (42 billion metric tons) a year, so that inevitability should hit around February 2028 because the report is measured from the start of this year, the scientists wrote. The world now stands at about 1.24 degrees Celsius (2.23 degrees Fahrenheit) of long-term warming since preindustrial times, the report said.

Earth’s energy imbalance

The report, which was published in the journal Earth System Science Data, shows that the rate of human-caused warming per decade has increased to nearly half a degree (0.27 degrees Celsius) per decade, Hausfather said. And the imbalance between the heat Earth absorbs from the sun and the amount it radiates out to space, a key climate change signal, is accelerating, the report said.

“It’s quite a depressing picture unfortunately, where if you look across the indicators, we find that records are really being broken everywhere,” said lead author Piers Forster, director of the Priestley Centre for Climate Futures at the University of Leeds in England. “I can’t conceive of a situation where we can really avoid passing 1.5 degrees of very long-term temperature change.”

The increase in emissions from fossil-fuel burning is the main driver. But reduced particle pollution, which includes soot and smog, is another factor because those particles had a cooling effect that masked even more warming from appearing, scientists said. Changes in clouds also factor in. That all shows up in Earth’s energy imbalance, which is now 25 per cent higher than it was just a decade or so ago, Forster said.

Earth’s energy imbalance “is the most important measure of the amount of heat being trapped in the system,” Hausfather said.

Earth keeps absorbing more and more heat than it releases. “It is very clearly accelerating. It’s worrisome,” he said.

Crossing the temperature limit

The planet temporarily passed the key 1.5 limit last year. The world hit 1.52 degrees Celsius (2.74 degrees Fahrenheit) of warming since preindustrial times for an entire year in 2024, but the Paris threshold is meant to be measured over a longer period, usually considered 20 years. Still, the globe could reach that long-term threshold in the next few years even if individual years haven’t consistently hit that mark, because of how the Earth’s carbon cycle works.

That 1.5 is “a clear limit, a political limit for which countries have decided that beyond which the impact of climate change would be unacceptable to their societies”, said study co-author Joeri Rogelj, a climate scientist at Imperial College London.

The mark is so important because once it is crossed, many small island nations could eventually disappear because of sea level rise, and scientific evidence shows that the impacts become particularly extreme beyond that level, especially hurting poor and vulnerable populations, he said. He added that efforts to curb emissions and the impacts of climate change must continue even if the 1.5 degree threshold is exceeded.

Crossing the threshold “means increasingly more frequent and severe climate extremes of the type we are now seeing all too often in the US and around the world – unprecedented heat waves, extreme hot drought, extreme rainfall events, and bigger storms,” said University of Michigan environment school dean Jonathan Overpeck, who wasn’t part of the study.

Andrew Dessler, a Texas A&M University climate scientist who wasn’t part of the study, said the 1.5 goal was aspirational and not realistic, so people shouldn’t focus on that particular threshold.

“Missing it does not mean the end of the world,” Dessler said in an email, though he agreed that “each tenth of a degree of warming will bring increasingly worse impacts”.",https://jamaica-gleaner.com/sites/default/files/styles/250px/public/media/article_images/2025/06/22/3162843/8324562.jpg?itok=4mVoyLZL,N,,2025-06-22 14:06:24.112239

In 2020, the government approved the procurement of a huge quantity of new coal-fired capacity as part of South Africa’s energy mix.","South Africa has long been dependent on coal, finding it difficult to leave fossil fuels in the past for a future in green energy. The African country has produced and exported coal to bolster its economy as well as to provide energy for its population of over 60 million. However, now it has a $2.2 billion coal-exit plan thanks to funding from the World Bank.

Coal contributes around 82 percent of South Africa’s energy mix. In addition, roughly 28 percent of the country’s coal production is exported, primarily through the Richards Bay Coal Terminal, making South Africa the fourth-largest coal exporting country in the world. It was also the world’s 15th-highest emitter of carbon dioxide in 2023.

Although there is a multitude of coal producers in South Africa, just five account for around 85 percent of saleable coal production. Meanwhile, 11 mines contribute 70 percent of the output. The country’s coal deposits are relatively shallow with thick seams, making them easier and, generally, cheaper to mine, than the international average. At the present production rate, there is more than an estimated 50 years of coal supply left.

Its long dependency on coal, both for energy and revenue, has made many doubtful that South Africa will be able to move away from the fossil fuel any time soon. However, in June, the World Bank’s Climate Investment Funds (CIF) announced a new funding plan to support South Africa’s Accelerating Coal Transition investment plan. The CIF plan was put on hold last year after South Africa requested to delay the closure of three coal-fired power plants to ease an energy crisis. The CIF plans to provide South Africa with $500 million in funding, which could open the door to a further $2.1 billion in investment from multilateral lenders. South Africa must now provide projected project costs for approval from the CIF.

The CIF initially announced the plan in 2022, but it has taken several years to get to this point, and progress will rely heavily on South Africa’s ability to shift away from a dependence on coal by developing its renewable energy capacity. There are plans to disperse CIF funds to several different countries around the world to support a global green transition. Of the 15 fund donors, the U.S. was the biggest, having contributed $3.8 billion by the end of 2024, followed by the U.K. at $3.6 billion, then Germany, Japan and Canada, which have contributed over $1 billion each.

Fears have mounted over the future of U.S. contributions to the fund and in support of other international climate action following President Trump’s planned withdrawal from the Paris Agreement and the decision to cut the U.S. contribution to the Green Climate Fund. Earlier in the year, the U.S. withdrew from plans backed by rich nations to help Indonesia, Vietnam, and South Africa reduce their coal dependency.

Environmentalists have long been calling for South Africa to reduce its reliance on coal and develop its renewable energy sources, but this has long fallen on deaf ears. In 2020, the government approved the procurement of a huge quantity of new coal-fired capacity as part of South Africa’s energy mix. While the government has stated its support for the development of renewable energy projects, such as solar and wind energy, it has repeatedly said it will continue to pursue coal, oil, and gas production.

However, in April, a court ruled that the government’s new coal plans were unlawful, invalid, and against the country’s constitution. The decision came three years after three South African environmental and climate justice groups took the South African government to court to fight the authorisation of new coal-fired power.

Despite the strong opposition to new coal development on the grounds of environmental concerns, not everyone is happy leaving coal in the ground. Hundreds of thousands of coal workers are concerned about the prospect of losing their jobs as South Africa transitions away from the fossil fuel. A 2023 government reportestimated that 80,000 coal mining jobs were at risk in the Mpumalanga province alone. Many believe that greater progress needs to be made in developing the country’s renewable energy sector before coal plant closures can take place.

Joanne Yawitch, who leads the government’s Just Energy transition unit, stated, “These coal transitions are difficult right around the world and they take decades to achieve. And, in many parts of particularly the developed world, what it’s taken is throwing a lot of money at them in order for them to work.”

To be successful in moving away from coal, the government must establish a clear roadmap to increase South Africa’s renewable energy network, supported by the development of an adequate transmission network. In addition, to avoid widespread job losses, the government must also plan for a just transition, in which coal workers are provided with training to develop the skills needed to work in other parts of the energy sector.

The industry considers these climate lawsuits a major threat.
Judges in Massachusetts, Hawaii and Minnesota, among other places, have denied the oil companies’ SLAPP motions, though appeals of some of those decisions are pending.
She said that under California law, lawsuits filed by the state attorney general “are, by definition, not SLAPP suits,” she said.","Oil companies are employing an unusual tactic in some of their biggest court battles. They’re alleging that their critics are infringing on their free-speech rights, invoking laws designed to protect people who challenge the powerful.

The laws, known as “anti-SLAPP” provisions, were created to stop companies or people from silencing their critics with the threat of costly lawsuits. Oil companies have turned this around, arguing that climate lawsuits against them should be thrown out because they infringe on the companies’ protections under the First Amendment.

“What we’re seeing now is a complete inversion” of the original intent of these laws, said Nicole Ligon, an assistant professor of law at Campbell University in North Carolina and expert on freedom of speech and SLAPP, which is shorthand for strategic lawsuit against public participation. The laws offer judges a way to dismiss cases that they determine lack merit.

This strategy is playing out in courtrooms nationwide, particularly where oil companies are fighting lawsuits filed by state and local governments that claim the industry has misled Americans about global warming and should help pay the cost of adapting to climate change.

The industry considers these climate lawsuits a major threat. Nearly 40 have been filed since 2017. They are seeking potentially billions of dollars in damages.

Recently, the cases have come under increased scrutiny as the Trump administration has sought to stop them, even pre-emptively suing Hawaii and Michigan to try to block them from filing their own climate-change lawsuits. (Hawaii sued anyway, and Michigan has said it will.)

While each case differs, the lawsuits generally allege that various oil companies and trade associations have for decades covered up what they knew about climate change in a quest for profit. The lawsuits cite laws against consumer deception, creating a public nuisance and others. None has yet made it to trial.

The companies, in turn, have accused the plaintiffs of filing copycat lawsuits that are aimed at bankrupting the fossil fuel industry. They also say the lawsuits, filed in state courts, are improperly trying to dictate national energy policy when that should be left to the federal government, not state proceedings. Jury trials could create a patchwork of policies around the country, the companies argue, which wouldn’t be the right way to address climate change. A few cases have been partly or fully dismissed.

Theodore J. Boutrous Jr., a veteran First Amendment lawyer who represents Chevron in the climate litigation, said the lawsuits against the oil companies are centered on political speech by the companies that is protected by the Constitution. “The First Amendment applies to everyone,” he said. “It applies to companies.” He pointed to the 2010 Supreme Court decision in Citizens United, in which the justices, citing free speech, ruled that the government could not ban political spending by corporations.

With the climate-change lawsuits, he said, “The government is trying to squelch speech it doesn’t like and punish it and deter it in the future.”

The companies haven’t yet prevailed using these arguments. Judges in Massachusetts, Hawaii and Minnesota, among other places, have denied the oil companies’ SLAPP motions, though appeals of some of those decisions are pending.

The term SLAPP was coined in the 1980s by two professors at the University of Denver, the sociologist Penelope Canan and the law professor George W. Pring, who went on to write the 1996 book “SLAPPs: Getting Sued for Speaking Out.” In the years since, anti-SLAPP laws have been adopted by most states. To deter frivolous lawsuits, these laws typically require a losing plaintiff to pay the defendants’ legal bills.

Professor Canan said the energy companies were essentially interfering with the right of local officials to raise their concerns before a judge and jury. “The logic of what the energy companies are doing is the logic of a SLAPP, not the logic of an anti-SLAPP,” she said.

Observers are particularly watching cases in California, where the attorney general, Rob Bonta, and eight local governments, including San Mateo County and the city of Imperial Beach, have filed suits against Exxon Mobil, Chevron and other companies.

The suits argue that oil companies used deceptive public statements and marketing to deter government action to curb greenhouse gas emissions. They are being handled jointly by the Superior Court for the County of San Francisco.

California has a strong anti-SLAPP law that was enacted in 1992.

This coming August, Mr. Boutrous is expected to argue on behalf of the companies that the judge should strike parts of the lawsuits that concern the companies’ participation in the public debate around climate change. In a joint motion earlier this year, the companies argued that the First Amendment prohibits liability based on advocacy, lobbying or scientific debate.

Judge Ethan P. Schulman dismissed a similar motion in December that had been filed solely by Chevron, saying the state’s anti-SLAPP law carves out an exception for “commercial” speech related to the selling of goods and services.

Mr. Boutrous said that decision was wrong because the speech described in the lawsuit against the oil companies was not part of a commercial transaction. In the climate change cases, where governments are seeking damages based on speech concerning public issues, anti-SLAPP laws are applicable tools, he said.

“The double standard drives me crazy, the notion that the First Amendment and the anti-SLAPP laws are only meant to protect one side of a debate,” Mr. Boutrous said. Restrictions on particular viewpoints, he said, are “an insult to the First Amendment.”

Mr. Edling said the fossil fuel companies “want to have it both ways.” They want First Amendment protections for their own statements, he said, but also to “use First Amendment and anti-SLAPP arguments proactively to silence public entities” from challenging those statements.

Christine Lee, a spokeswoman for Mr. Bonta, noted that two higher courts in California had declined to hear appeals of the decision on Chevron’s motion. She said that under California law, lawsuits filed by the state attorney general “are, by definition, not SLAPP suits,” she said.

(Judge Schulman did not address the question of whether prosecutors like Mr. Bonta are automatically exempt from anti-SLAPP laws.)

Professor Ligon, the Campbell University legal expert, said that anti-SLAPP laws had traditionally been invoked almost exclusively in defamation suits and that fossil fuel companies had started using them as a legal tactic only in recent years. So far the companies have largely been unsuccessful, she said, but courts haven’t closed the door entirely on the idea.

Still, Professor Ligon said, political speech and commercial speech have different protections under the First Amendment, complicating the energy industry’s argument. “These laws were meant to protect vulnerable speakers,” she said.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/06/18/multimedia/00cli-slapp-01-jcpv/00cli-slapp-01-jcpv-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-06-22 12:17:05.478776

“I’ve learned that not only do we have contaminated air when we are outside in Richmond, but there’s contamination and toxins within our homes,” Gomez said in a recent phone call.

She started attending City Council meetings and organizing with her neighbors as a member of the Alliance of Californians for Community Empowerment (ACCE) Action, because, she said, “I wanted something different. I wanted something better.”

But ACCE Action’s goal isn’t simply to get rid of gas stoves. In a city where about one in four people—nearly double the national average—suffer from asthma due in large part to pollution from heavy industry, the group wants to shut off or “prune” the lines that send natural gas into homes in some neighborhoods. The phenomenon is called “neighborhood-scale decarbonization,” and it’s just getting off the ground in California.

Pacific Gas & Electric, the utility in the area, is on board with the idea. It has expressed a willingness to spend a portion of the money it would otherwise use to maintain gas lines to help electrify the homes in the neighborhood that will no longer use the gas.

David Sharples, county director at ACCE Action, says the group is looking at different neighborhoods that PG&E has identified as likely candidates. Once the group chooses an area, it plans to run a pilot project with the goal of electrifying all the appliances and adding solar panels and batteries for up to 80 homes.

“We’re looking at the Coronado, Iron Triangle and Santa Fe neighborhoods, which are working class, Black and brown neighborhoods where ACCE has been organizing for years,” Sharples said. “They all have old gas lines that need to be replaced, so it represents an opportunity to electrify.”

To understand the appeal of neighborhood-scale decarbonization, which is also sometimes called “zonal decarbonization,” it helps to be able to envision the vast network of gas pipelines that exist under most cities in the Western U.S. That network holds a potentially explosive gas, and it requires constant, expensive upkeep.

California has pledged to install 6 million heat pumps by 2030 as part of its larger effort to reach net zero by 2045. And while a rule will begin going into effect in the Bay Area in 2027 requiring that broken water heaters and furnaces be replaced by electric appliances, a similar rule was just rejected in Southern California.

Experts say a large-scale effort just makes more sense than a piecemeal approach in many parts of the state. And as dramatic as it might sound to transition a whole block or neighborhood off gas at once, the approach may also cost less overall and make it easier to employ people fairly.

Neighborhood-scale decarbonization has also been popular with lawmakers. Last fall, the California Legislature voted to adopt SB 1221, a bill that will enable up to 30 neighborhood-scale projects of this type over the next five years.

The catch is that most residents in the neighborhoods must agree to the change. While the state’s obligation to serve currently requires 100 percent approval, SB 1221 will lower the threshold to 67 percent as the pilot projects start rolling out. Several groups have begun the work of educating communities about the benefits of the switch.

In Albany, a city of about 20,000 people north of Berkeley, Michelle Plouse, the city’s community development analyst, has spent the last few years working with PG&E to pilot one of the first neighborhood-scale projects in the state. Using the gas line mapping tool developed by the utility, Plouse and other city staff worked with the Albany City Council to identify 12 potential blocks. This spring, they narrowed it down to three.

The goal, Plouse said, is to find blocks that are easier to electrify while also focusing on lower-income parts of the city, where residents are less likely to be able to afford to electrify.

“What will happen if we don’t decommission the gas line is that the cost of maintaining it will continue to increase over time, and the user base will drop as people electrify,” said Plouse. “The folks who don’t have the money to electrify will be stuck on gas that will get more expensive every year.”

The City of Albany received a grant from the U.S. Department of Energy for the project, and they’ve used the funds to support an outreach plan that involves a block party, a focus group and a team that goes door-to-door in hopes of talking to everyone on the three blocks. “It’s going to be a lot of listening and a lot of connecting with different people,” said Plouse.

Rachel Wittman, a senior strategic analyst at PG&E, said the utility provided a letter of commitment in support of Albany’s DOE grant, but it won’t be providing financial support for the project.

Although the California Public Utilities Commission is soliciting interest from communities that want to take part in the SB 1221 pilot program, a spokesperson for the commission said it won’t have a list of potential sites until the second half of 2026, at the soonest.

The Albany project will begin before then, so it won’t likely be considered one of the 30 pilots, and Plouse said they’re hoping to get 100 percent of the residents to sign on. “What’s most likely is that we continue serving as a kind of first test run that can provide information for those pilots,” she said. If that doesn’t work, they may decide to wait until they only need 67 percent resident approval.

“Albany’s learnings from their efforts in community outreach and advocacy during this project will provide valuable insights that can inform zonal electrification outreach strategy,” said Wittman. “This applies not just for SB 1221 and PG&E, but for any utility or community.” She said over three dozen cities, counties and other energy providers have reached out to the utility with interest in zonal decarbonization.

ACCE Action and others in Richmond hope its neighborhood-scale project—dubbed Clean Energy and Healthy Homes—will be included in the list of pilot projects, and it appears to have a good chance at making the list. If they’re able to decommission a gas line there, Sharples estimates that it could cost as much as $15 million to upgrade and electrify homes spanning a few different neighborhoods and provide them with solar power. He hopes PG&E will cover around 10 percent of that cost.

The Richmond City Council approved the effort in early 2024, but the remaining funding is still in question. Chevron, whose local refinery has been a major polluter for more than a century, entered into a settlement with the city for $550 million over the next 10 years to avoid paying a per-barrel tax on the oil it produces. ACCE Action wants to see a portion of that money spent on the neighborhood-scale project. The group has been hosting community events and engaging community members like Gomez.

Tim Frank, a representative of the Building and Construction Trades Council in the county, wants to see the project move forward because it could also create a model for so-called high-road work in the home electrification space. Currently, unionized workers tend to do larger electrification projects, while one-off residential projects are done by smaller companies not affiliated with unions. While some pay their workers well, many hire temporary laborers and keep wages low.

Electrifying all the homes on one block allows for the efficiency and stability associated with larger projects while benefiting individual families. It’s also more cost-efficient because it allows for bulk purchases of supplies.

It’s a worthwhile experiment, Frank said. “We’re engaged, partly because we see the huge promise of this strategy and we want to help prove out the model and scale it up,” he added.

For Gomez, who has been talking to her neighbors about the possibility that all their homes could be upgraded and electrified at once, the biggest barrier is convincing them that it’s not a scam. Richmond’s low-income communities have seen their share of companies that go door-to-door trying to extract money from people who are stretched thin and working multiple jobs. Some clean energy providers have turned out to be imposters.

“It’s something they’ve never heard of before. So, people ask: Is this a real thing? Can it actually happen?” And she tells them that yes, if the plan goes as a growing number of people hope it will, it just might.

This is what communities need to do, but those questions must be met with facts, not fear.

Recent headlines about Wendell’s battery energy storage bylaw and the ongoing legal challenge paint the picture of a community fighting to protect itself. I understand that instinct. I spent nearly two decades as the mayor of Somerville, the densest city in the country, where every infrastructure decision impacted the whole community. I know what it feels like when communities believe they aren’t being heard. And I also know how important it is not to let misinformation, emotion, or outdated understanding of technology derail solutions essential to our economic and energy future.

Battery energy storage systems (BESS) are not science fiction or untested theory. They’re a proven tool for reducing energy costs, stabilizing the grid, and protecting our communities from fossil fuel price shocks, which, as this past winter and summer reminded us. We are seeing those shocks play out monthly in our ever-rising energy bills. Storage is the infrastructure that enables us to take full advantage of cheaper, cleaner, local sources like solar and wind, holding that energy and delivering it when it’s needed most. Without it, we’re stuck paying more for dirty, more costly oil and gas.

In addition, Massachusetts families are footing the bill for addressing gas system leaks, which will cost the consumer more than $40 billion to fix. They’re also paying for fossil fuel volatility driven by global markets, and for decades of underinvestment in alternatives. At the same time, they’re told to fear the very infrastructure, like battery storage, that can lower their bills and keep the lights on. That’s a lose-lose scenario.

We can’t let anecdotes from rare, isolated incidents obscure what decades of progress and modern safety protocols have delivered. The Moss Landing fire in California, frequently cited by opponents, involved older equipment and site-specific failures, issues that wouldn’t meet today’s rigorous standards. The latest National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) codes mandate advanced thermal management, isolation systems, remote monitoring, and local emergency coordination. These are not optional guidelines, they’re enforceable codes that reflect lessons learned.

As a former mayor, I understand you can never dismiss real concerns about siting, water safety, or community engagement. These must be addressed transparently and honestly. Projects should include local consultation, third-party safety reviews, and community benefits. However, a blanket rejection of battery storage based on generalizations or misread legal distinctions, such as zoning versus general bylaw, doesn’t just delay solutions. It risks deepening the very vulnerabilities we’re trying to solve.

Wendell’s case is not an isolated incident; it reflects a broader trend, and that’s no accident. Across the Northeast, we see a well-organized playbook of local opposition that mixes skepticism, exaggerated risk, and appeals to “home rule,” often fueled by groups fighting renewable energy across the board. Though they may appear “organic,” they’re frequently coordinated and funded by dark money, and they don’t always reflect the full voice of a community. But these efforts can effectively slow the clean energy transition, unless the truth is told.

Let’s elevate a different kind of leadership rooted in science, public benefit, and local trust. Clean energy infrastructure, including storage, isn’t just about meeting state climate goals. It’s about protecting public health, increasing energy security, creating good jobs, and insulating families from fossil fuel price shocks.

Battery storage, like all infrastructure, must be safe. But it must also be understood. The communities that lead the way on clean energy will shape their future, economically and environmentally. Those who reject it based on misinformation and fear will find themselves stuck with older, dirtier, and more expensive systems long after the rest of the state has moved forward.

We have a responsibility to facts, to each other, and to future generations to make renewables the safe, easy, and affordable choice for our energy future. Let’s meet this challenge head on.

Around here, we call it for what it is: Biden’s Green New Scam.
A recent report from the Clean Energy Buyers Association shows why.
They found that a full repeal of the technology-neutral investment and production tax credits would lead to an annual average yearly increase of more than $110 for annual electricity prices.
Biden’s Green New Scam has dominated headlines in Washington since its passage in 2022, but in Maine it’s been nothing but a raw deal.","Mainers have always believed in hard work, independence and doing what’s right without waiting for permission from Washington. For generations, we’ve powered this nation the honest way — through fishing, forestry, manufacturing and farming.

But under former President Joe Biden, those values weren’t just ignored — they were under attack. His so-called Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), pushed through Congress without serious conservative input, was sold as a clean energy plan. In reality, it was a reckless green giveaway that benefited China, rewarded wealthy elites, inflated our national debt and punished working Americans.

Around here, we call it for what it is: Biden’s Green New Scam.

The centerpiece of Biden’s law — $7,500 subsidies for electric vehicles — might sound good to the lobbyists and activists who helped write it. But for the rest of us, it’s a joke.

According to Gallup, only 7% of Americans own an electric vehicle (EV). What’s more concerning for the industry, however, is that nearly half say they never plan to own one, up from 41% the prior year. And fewer say they are likely to consider one in the future. Why would they?

Try hauling lobster traps out of Boothbay Harbor with a Tesla. Try driving through a February snowstorm in Jackman without a real truck. EVs aren’t built for the way Mainers live — or for the weather we face every year.

Meanwhile, the companies that have cashed in on these subsidies aren’t American job creators. They’re Chinese conglomerates, some of which are tied to slave labor and human rights abuses. Biden’s plan hasn’t rebuilt America. It’s bankrolled Beijing.

Some bureaucrats claimed the IRA would help Mainers by funding weatherization projects, heat pumps and energy-efficient appliances. But these so-called savings depend upon families spending thousands of dollars up front — money most working Mainers don’t have.

Even worse, the IRA included a slush fund for radical left-wing nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) that are at odds with Maine values. These groups support defunding the police in the name of “environmental justice.”

And let’s be honest: In Washington, “help” usually means more red tape, more middlemen and more consultants getting rich off taxpayer dollars. Without real conservative reforms, the benefits haven’t reached the families that need them most. They’ve been swallowed up by special interests as Mainers’ heating bills have only gone up.

We know what actually works — strong borders, tough trade deals, American-made energy and lower taxes. President Trump’s policies brought factories back and put our workers first, and we expect that to happen again during his second term.

We don’t need another bloated government program. We need to fix what’s left of the IRA or roll it back entirely by stripping out waste, reversing the disincentives for pharmaceutical innovation, shutting down the China cash-outs and investing in real American energy that respects how we live in Maine.

As Congress repeals the Green New Scam, some bipartisan provisions that were lumped into the Inflation Reduction Act should be kept.

For example, the 45X advanced manufacturing tax credit, which creates the incentive for companies to manufacture here in America, is a core part of an America-first trade policy. A recent poll from the Rainey Center found that 59% of voters support clean energy incentives, but only when the products are made in America by American companies.

Only 16% want these credits to end. However, voters don’t support tax credits going to foreign companies — these policies need to end.

Another key provision of the IRA that makes sense is technology-neutral tax credits. Rather than creating a system where the government picks winners, technology-neutral tax credits let carbon capture, geothermal and clean fossil fuels compete on the same level as solar and wind.

A recent report from the Clean Energy Buyers Association shows why. They found that a full repeal of the technology-neutral investment and production tax credits would lead to an annual average yearly increase of more than $110 for annual electricity prices. Instead, projections suggest these positive aspects of the IRA will boost Maine’s GDP by $200 million in 2030.

Biden’s Green New Scam has dominated headlines in Washington since its passage in 2022, but in Maine it’s been nothing but a raw deal. In fact, recent revelations of waste, fraud and abuse across the whole of federal government has been quite shocking. We deserve better — and we should demand it.",https://www.sunjournal.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2025/06/Biden_Cancer_18315_3db427-1750250647.jpg?w=1000,N,,2025-06-22 12:16:52.061161

A VPP is software that can pull power from your household battery and sell it back to the grid.
For example, to connect an 11.5 kilowatt-hour battery to a VPP would earn a bonus of about $850.
Some networks, such as Ausgrid, are now charging to feed in solar power during the day.
Solar Citizens chief executive Heidi Lee Douglas says her organisation, which advocates for solar consumers, was disappointed by the NSW decision.","For decades Australia has led the world in rooftop solar. Government incentives to encourage uptake have been so successful that panels now adorn the roofs of more than 4 million homes around the country.

Then came the push to install household batteries to save more of the solar power generated by day for use in the evening. There are now more than 300,000 households with batteries in Australia, and the number is growing rapidly.

Now some states and territories have new incentives to encourage uptake of virtual power plants, or VPPs.

But what is a VPP, and why might households want to join one?

A VPP is software that can pull power from your household battery and sell it back to the grid. It is a “power plant” in the sense that the software bundles the energy from several households to emulate a single producer.

When demand for electricity is high, the VPP pulls excess power stored in batteries, to increase the stability of the grid and reduce the need for big generators or what some call “baseload power”.

In theory, it will lower power bills for everyone and reduce reliance on ageing coal-fired power stations.

Smart Energy Council acting chief executive Wayne Smith said recently that it was important to integrate individual whole batteries into a bigger collective system.

“There’s a private benefit and a public good,” Smith said.

Households are giving up some control over their system when they consent to be in a VPP, so what’s in it for them?

First, they will be paid for it. There are VPPs available in all Australian states and territories. Consumers are either simply paid for participation in the VPP, or paid for the energy they feed into the grid.

In NSW, there is an additional sweetener: the government will pay a household to join a VPP based on the size of its battery. For example, to connect an 11.5 kilowatt-hour battery to a VPP would earn a bonus of about $850. The state is ending its separate incentive for the purchase of the actual battery, deeming the new Commonwealth Cheaper Home Batteries scheme to be enough.

Solar households would be familiar with the dwindling feed-in tariffs for selling electricity to the grid, which are set to get even worse with new pricing from July 1. This is because there is now so much cheap solar energy in the electricity network during the day – when the sun is shining and the panels are pumping out the power – that it far exceeds demand.

Some networks, such as Ausgrid, are now charging to feed in solar power during the day. This doesn’t come as a direct fee to the solar households because the energy retailer sits in the middle, but the cost is deducted from the feed-in tariffs available to consumers.

Most electricity retailers have drastically reduced feed-in tariffs or even taken them to zero, and in some cases, they’re choking off households from being able to feed in at all.

Electricity retailers would be willing to pay significantly more if the time is right. In the evening – when no solar is being produced and demand is high because most people are home from work – retailers are paying a higher wholesale price and would be keen to pay households for stored power.

Rewiring Australia chief executive Francis Vierboom says consumers need to shop around because the rate you can earn through a VPP varies by electricity retailer.

“If you don’t sign your battery up to a VPP, then it’s a bit like keeping your money under the mattress – it’s the most simple option,” Vierboom says.

“A lot of VPPs will offer you basically a reward, based maybe on a fixed rate that your battery gets paid if they call on it, to export energy to the grid. That’s a bit like putting your money into a savings account that’s got an interest rate.”

Finally, Vierboom says, there are retailers such as Amber Electric that pass the live five-minute changing price of energy through to their customers.

In that case, Vierboom says, “it’s a bit more like putting your money in the stock market ... one of those index funds”.

This is complex and would not suit everyone, but for those who are interested, there is a higher risk and return.

Consumers will need to ask questions about how frequently their batteries will be accessed and whether they can override VPP instructions when they want. Battery owners will want to retain control so they don’t have their electricity taken at one price and then be forced to buy it back at a higher price.

Fortunately, battery owners should always be able to use their own stored energy in the event of an actual blackout, since it is a physical impossibility to feed energy into an offline grid.

Solar Citizens chief executive Heidi Lee Douglas says her organisation, which advocates for solar consumers, was disappointed by the NSW decision. There should have been more public education about VPPs before pulling the pin on the state battery subsidy, she says.",https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.1317%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_110/t_crop_custom/q_86%2Cf_auto/t_smh_analysis_no_age_social_wm/9ea4cf5891e9c9c1c77800cc704d5d0dd3148c1a,N,,2025-06-22 12:15:29.969583

Signed into law by Governor Greg Abbott on Saturday, this bill is an aggressive attempt to shore up reliability on the Texas grid while making large-load customers bear a fair share of the cost.

Texas has always prided itself on doing things big, including maintaining its status as a national energy powerhouse. From leading the shale oil and gas boom, to supporting state-of-the-art ports moving the lion’s share of U.S. crude and LNG exports, to leading the nation in both wind and solar generating capacity, Texas has fueled America’s growth while taking a different path than other large population states like California, New York, and Florida.

SB 6 is a legislative balancing act designed to ensure Texas continues to play a leading national role in hosting the nation’s rapidly expanding AI industry and its associated datacenters while simultaneously achieving a higher level of grid reliability and energy security. Authored by Senator Charles Schwertner and championed by Lt. Governor Dan Patrick, SB 6 targets one of the elephants in the room: massive electricity consumers, defined as those with loads of 75 megawatts or more.

In addition to high tech datacenters, the bill’s provisions will also impact operations like cryptocurrency mining centers and heavy industrial plants. Such industrial giants have flocked to Texas in recent years to take advantage of comparatively cheap electricity and a business-friendly policy structure.

But the Texas grid has at the same time shown clear signs of struggling to maintain reliability amid a rapid economic and population expansion, and recent projections by ERCOT of massive demand growth over the coming decade motivated the legislature to take proactive action. This is a welcome change from past episodes that saw policymakers taking action only after disaster had struck, as was the case with Winter Storm Uri, which devastated the state in February 2021 following a decade of failure to act to address well-known weaknesses in the grid.

How SB 6 Improves Texas Grid Reliability

The bill signed by Gov. Abbott mandates that large-load customers register with ERCOT and the Public Utility Commission (PUC), provide backup generation (like on-site gas or diesel generators), and shoulder new transmission fees to fund grid upgrades. The new law also greenlights proprietary, behind-the-meter power generation for these facilities, reducing their draw on the grid. Such generation will consist mainly of natural gas plants in the near term, with aspirations for more nuclear generation in the longer term.

SB 6 also gives ERCOT enhanced tools for large load forecasting, enabling both ERCOT and the PUC to review large load projects which involve taking existing generation off the grid. It establishes a process for curtailing large loads before residential and small business customers during emergency situations, a key step that would require backups for large load customers and thus let ERCOT curtail the load during emergencies without centers powering down. The legislature also tossed in a provision which lets water and sewer corporations generate power in hopes of enhancing rural resilience.

“Texas is open for business, but we won’t let unchecked growth crash our grid,” Lt. Gov. Patrick declared when he unveiled his 40 priority bills for the 2025 session in March, with SB 6 near the top. His point is hard to argue with: ERCOT projected in April that Texas power demand will double by 2030, to as high as 208,000 megawatts, driven largely by data centers and industrial loads.

A Pillsbury Law analysis notes that “SB 6 ensures large-load customers contribute to the infrastructure they rely on, protecting residential ratepayers from footing the bill.” The math is compelling: Data centers alone could account for 20% of ERCOT’s peak load by 2030. Without proactive policy intervention like SB 6, the grid would be at higher blackout risk during major weather events.

The Outlook Ahead For The Texas Grid

The legislature’s embrace of behind-the-meter natural gas and nuclear power is a pragmatic nod to both the need to enhance reliability and to the state’s resource abundance. Texas ranks as far and away the largest natural gas producing state in the country. A recent study published by the Environmental Integrity Project reports that the state is in the early stages of a significant gas plant boom, with at least 130 projects either already in the queue or in the planning stage. Altogether, the plants would combine for 58 gigawatts of new 24/7 power generation.

Nuclear appears poised for a national comeback spurred by rising public confidence and favorability and by the rapidly shifting energy policy direction under the Trump administration. Last week, the Department of Energy led by Secretary Chris Wright rolled out a new initiative to reform the system for nuclear reactor testing and spur development of new generation reactors on the site of the DOE National Labs.

Critics will no doubt argue that Texas policymakers should encourage big new industrial power users to focus on wind and solar for their behind-the-meter generation. But, as I’ve detailed here in prior pieces, a consensus has formed among the big datacenter developers that renewables alone can’t handle the 24/7 demands of data centers, and SB 6’s critics consistently ignore that wind and solar lean on gas peaking plants when lack of wind, bad weather and the setting sun render them dormant.

The bill’s supporters argue that SB 6 is less about ideology and more about fairness, centered on the principle that residential customers shouldn’t subsidize grid upgrades for tech giants. As Schwertner put it during Senate debates, “This bill ensures those who strain the system invest in its stability.”

All in all, SB 6 represents a straightforward move by Texas policymakers to ensure that ERCOT and the PUC have the appropriate tools to incorporate large loads onto the grid and ensure minimal risk from a cost and reliability standpoint while maintaining the state’s ability to lead the country in the kinds of large industrial power users. It is a pro-market, pro-development, proactive approach to high-grading the Texas grid, a welcome change from the reactive, disaster-driven processes of the past.",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/685808d4fd5600d9df0c178f/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,N,,2025-06-22 12:17:01.568571

Ted Cruz deserves credit for saying what too many in Washington are unwilling to admit. American energy security is under coordinated attack, and it is not just coming from progressive environmental activists. It’s being encouraged and in some cases funded by our top geopolitical rival.

On Wednesday, Sen. Cruz’s Judiciary oversight subcommittee will hold a hearing to examine how China and America’s climate litigation movement are working in parallel to undermine U.S. energy dominance. These efforts are being carried out under the banner of environmental protection and the clean energy transition, but the real goal is to weaken America’s energy sector and give the advantage to China in global energy and manufacturing markets.

Climate cases brought by plaintiff firms like Sher Edling are supported by a network of well-funded foundations and nonprofits that are unwittingly advancing the strategic interests of America’s adversaries by weakening domestic energy production and increasing our dependence on foreign-controlled supply chains—particularly those dominated by China.

There is growing recognition that this is a national security problem. The U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission has warned that the Chinese Communist Party is actively working to “directly and malignly influence state and local leaders to promote China’s global agenda.”

A recent report by national security nonprofit State Armor outlines how China has co-opted elements of the U.S. climate lobby to drive a transition away from fossil fuels. The result is greater U.S. reliance on Chinese-controlled technologies, minerals, and supply chains. China dominates the global markets for lithium, cobalt, solar panels, and battery components. It stands to gain enormously from U.S. policies that force a premature shift away from traditional energy sources.

The report spotlights Energy Foundation China (EFC) which claims to be a nonprofit headquartered in San Francisco. In reality, its staff are mostly based in Beijing, and its operations align closely with the Chinese Communist Party’s interests. EFC has spent millions supporting anti-fossil fuel groups in the United States, including the Rocky Mountain Institute and the Natural Resources Defense Council. NRDC was the subject of a 2018 congressional inquiry over whether it should register as a foreign agent due to its ties to China.

House Energy and Commerce Committee leaders last year warned that “China has already attempted to influence United States policy and opinion through covert influence and by exploiting perceived societal divisions.” Their letter raised concerns about China-affiliated organizations influencing U.S. energy policy.

A number of foundations have played a role in financing climate litigation efforts nationwide. A decade of litigation that most likely would not have happened without their financial backing. Major donors to this network include some of the largest philanthropic institutions in the country, including the Children’s Investment Fund, MacArthur, Rockefeller, and Hewlett foundations. Yet few of these donors have accounted for the risk of foreign manipulation embedded in the organizations they fund.

The influence campaign also extends into U.S. academic institutions. The National Natural Science Foundation of China, a government-run research entity, has published articles in American journals criticizing fossil fuels and accusing U.S. companies of deceptive practices. One of EFC’s top communications directors previously held a position at that same Chinese foundation.

At the same time, the revolving door between activist nonprofits and government agencies is raising serious ethical and legal questions. Ann Carlson, a senior official in the Biden administration, previously sat on the board of the Environmental Law Institute while also consulting for Sher Edling. This institute has hosted multiple educational events with Chinese organizations on “climate litigation capacity building” aimed at influencing judges and shaping the legal landscape in both countries.

Sen. Cruz is right to shine a spotlight on these connections. There is no shortage of outside forces fueling this wave of litigation, and his subcommittee is well positioned to expose them. The American people deserve transparency about who is bankrolling the litigation assault on domestic energy and to what end. This is not simply the work of environmentalists who believe they are saving the planet. It includes adversarial foreign actors with a vested interest in weakening U.S. energy leadership and shifting global influence away from the United States.

President Trump’s energy dominance agenda is helping restore American strength by unleashing domestic production and lowering energy prices. But the progress made is at risk. Foreign interference, opaque litigation funding, and activist-driven policy by lawsuit are undermining U.S. energy security. Prior administrations allowed this framework to take hold by ceding policymaking authority to the courts.

China is more than happy to watch us tie our economy in regulatory knots while it builds new coal-fired power plants, locks in oil and gas contracts with OPEC+ members, and consolidates control over clean energy technologies. If we let this trend continue, we are handing Beijing exactly what it wants.

We need stronger congressional oversight, new transparency requirements for nonprofits that receive foreign-linked funding, and a renewed national focus on producing energy here at home. That starts by recognizing that this is not just a political disagreement. It’s a strategic threat to our country’s future.",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/6857f55ce140cec67134bb7a/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,N,,2025-06-22 12:15:33.494129

I spoke at Lobby Day at the State House on June 3 to help pass medical aid in dying legislation in Massachusetts.

I support the option after watching my brother, Chuck, die last year of an aggressive cancer. Six days after entering hospice care. I saw how the ever-increasing doses of morphine and anti-anxiety medications could not keep up with his suffering. Previously, he cared for his partner as she died an extremely painful death from cancer. This was not the end he wanted.

Those final tortuous days for Chuck deepened my conviction that we need the option of medical aid in dying that would allow mentally capable, terminally ill adults the option to request and self-ingest prescription medication to peacefully end their suffering.

The bill has a wide range of safeguards that ensure the patient and medical provider are protected throughout the process.

I urge Massachusetts legislators to seize this historic opportunity to demonstrate compassion for their dying constituents who desire this option and pass end-of-life options legislation (S.1486/H.2505) this year. I want people in Massachusetts to avoid protracted suffering in their last days and gently die on their own terms instead of from the illness that will end their lives anyway, give them the peace of mind to know what the end will look like, and focus on living their lives to the fullest in the days that remain.

Battery storage for clean energy

Joe Curtatone makes many good points in his column (Battery storage part of path to clean energy, June 15). Battery storage is a proven technology for storing clean energy from wind and solar. It can also be used to store energy generated by any source off-peak to be delivered during peak demand hours. These systems are safe and cost-effective alternatives to additional fossil fuel infrastructure.

Mr. Curtatone also points out that Massachusetts customers are getting walloped by energy bills because fossil fuel prices can swing due to various market effects. Clean, renewable energy is not subject to such events and is therefore less volatile.

Massachusetts residents are already bankrolling a crumbling $40 billion pipeline network through utility bills. Every delay in clean energy transition means more money flowing to maintain costly and environmentally damaging fossil fuel infrastructure.

Electricity demand continues to grow and the utilities are barely able to keep up. This is the right time to add new capacity to the electrical grid via renewable energy sources backed up by battery storage systems.

Proud to stand with devout Jews opposing Israeli policy

During a June 10 rally at Newton Square for City Councilor Etel Haxhiaj, a driver called Etel and me antisemites, ostensibly because of our support for free delivery of humanitarian aid and ceasefire in Gaza.

On Yom Kippur, the Jewish Day of Atonement, in 1985, Jewish friends invited me to join a prayer/protest against the launching of a Trident submarine. Wearing prayer shawls and yarmulkes we knelt in the road to block busloads of dignitaries. After blowing a shofar (ram's horn) lent to me for this protest by the rabbi of Temple Emanuel, we chanted in Hebrew the central prayer of Judaism: ""Hear, O Israel! The Lord our God, the Lord is one!""

Jesus cited this prayer when asked, ""Rabbi, which is the greatest commandment in the Law?” and said that the second-greatest commandment is to ""love your neighbor as yourself.""

God's gift of the promised land to the Jewish people flowed out of obedience to these two commands. When the community worshipped other gods and oppressed strangers, God exiled them to Babylon.

Members of groups, like Jewish Voice for Peace, draw on their faith to oppose Israeli policy. They and other faithful Jews do not support blockading humanitarian aid to Gaza, detaining thousands of Palestinians without charges, and certainly not perpetrating genocide. Etel and I are proud to stand with devout Jews like them, as we did at Newton Square.

Preserving role Clark has played in community

We write in response to your June 3 article on Clark University’s plans for restructuring.

The challenges Clark is facing are not unique; many universities in New England and throughout the country face enrollment challenges due to changing demographics and threats to international students. One thing that does make Clark unique, however, is its connection to the city of Worcester.

We have been on the faculty at Clark for nearly two decades. Like many faculty members, we live in Worcester and our children have attended Worcester schools. Many of our students are from Worcester or have chosen to make Worcester their home after graduation. Clark graduates make important contributions to the city as teachers, lawyers, small business owners and members of many other professions.

Many details of Clark’s plan still need to be worked out. While it highlights areas of strategic strength — such as climate, health and human behavior, and media arts — Clark’s strategic plan does not discontinue the range of majors that have also made a Clark education exciting and valuable for our students and for the community. Clark has historically been a university where the faculty (including us) play a major role in university governance. We, like many others on the faculty, are prepared to work with the administration on this plan to make these restructuring decisions carefully and compassionately, and to ensure that the quality and breadth of education that Clark has historically offered to our students and the role Clark has played in the community are preserved.

Muir Mhòr Offshore Wind Farm’s onshore consent application was approved by Aberdeenshire Council today, in a big step forward for the project.

The decision was taken at a meeting of the local authority’s Infrastructure Services Committee, with councillors backing the plans to connect the project to the National Grid.

It means that planning permission has now been granted in principle for the wind farm’s onshore infrastructure, which includes underground cabling and a substation.

A separate offshore consent application covering the wind farm itself was submitted at the end of last year, and is currently being considered by the Scottish Government.

Muir Mhòr is the first fully floating offshore wind farm from the ScotWind leasing process to achieve onshore planning consent, following extensive consultation with local communities and stakeholders.

If its offshore application is approved, the project is set to start generating clean and renewable power in the early 2030s, bringing huge economic benefits to Aberdeenshire in the process.

These include the creation of a significant number of jobs during its construction, operation and maintenance phases, and a supply chain contributing millions of pounds to the region’s economy.

A community benefit fund will also be established, developed in partnership with local communities and focusing on their priorities.

Once operational, the wind farm will be able to generate up to 1GW of clean power, enough to provide electricity for the equivalent of up to 1.2 million homes every year.

This will in turn make the country’s energy supplies more secure, as well as aiding with the UK Government’s clean power mission.

As well as bringing economic benefits, the project is committed to enhancing the skills of the Scottish offshore wind workforce at all levels, beginning in schools.

Muir Mhòr is a 50/50 joint venture between Fred. Olsen Seawind and Vattenfall, both having an established track record in Scotland. Working together, both companies are committed to securing Scotland’s energy future and green economy.

The wind farm – whose name means ‘Great Sea’ in Gaelic – will be located off the east coast of Scotland, approximately 63km from the coast of Peterhead.

David Hinshelwood, project director for Muir Mhòr Offshore Wind Farm, said:

'The granting of onshore planning consent is a very important moment for our project, and we are delighted that Aberdeenshire Council has decided to give the go-ahead.

'Our submission followed a long period of consultation where we listened carefully to those impacted by our development, took on board their feedback, and made adjustments.

'Muir Mhòr is leading the way to a clean energy future, becoming the first fully floating offshore wind farm from the 2022 ScotWind leasing round to be granted onshore consent.

'In doing so, we are supporting?the ambitions of governments in Scotland and the UK to be a world leader in floating offshore wind, and a clean energy superpower.

“Our focus is now on gaining approval for our offshore consent application from the Scottish Government, so our project can move ahead and bolster the UK’s energy security.'

Rachel Baird, onshore consents manager for Muir Mhòr Offshore Wind Farm, said:

'Today’s decision is the culmination of a lot of hard work by our team, and we are very grateful to the councillors in Aberdeenshire for taking the time to consider our application carefully.

'Throughout the process we have sought to be as transparent as possible about our plans, holding multiple consultation events in Peterhead and Longside, speaking to residents and businesses, answering their questions, and gathering their feedback.

'We then used this to adjust our application, because we understand the importance of listening to local communities.

'We’d like to thank everyone who participated in this process and look forward to continuing these conversations as the project moves forward.'

Tesla, the Elon Musk-led EV brand, is all set to inaugurate its first showroom in India by mid-July. Of late, we have been hearing about the world’s biggest electric car company making entry into the Indian market and now sources tell us that Tesla will finally start sales and operations in the coming 2-3 weeks. The dealerships in Mumbai and Delhi will start retailing Model Y as the first Tesla EV available for Indian buyers. The first set of Model Y electric SUVs have been imported in India from the company’s factory in China.

Apart from a few units of the rear-wheel-drive Model Y, Tesla has also shipped a few components of its Supercharger network in India from the US, China and Netherlands. Further, spare parts, accessories and merchandise have also been imported into our country so that it can kick start sales operations in the next one month or so.

Tesla has always been reluctant regarding its entry in India due to disagreements with the government over local manufacturing and import tariffs. Earlier this year in Feb, Tesla CEO Elon Musk had met Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi in the US. Post that, the Union Government in India had laid out a new EV policy with lesser import duties, if the automaker commits to set up a factory in India within three years and start local production.

The documents accessed by Bloomberg revealed that five units of Tesla Model Y have been shipped from the Shanghai factory to Mumbai, India. The cost of these electric cars is claimed as 2.77 million rupees ($31,988). The import tariff attracted by these SUVs is valued at 2.1 million rupees. Just so you know, Model Y is the world’s highest-sold electric car till date.

Tesla Model Y price in India is expected to be around $56,000 (Around Rs 49 lakh). However, the eventual pricing will be decided by the company closer to the launch date, but its likely to be around Rs 50 lakh (ex-showroom), more or less. The Model Y is sold at $44,990 (Around Rs 39 lakh) in the American market. Moreover, after the government subsidies and tax credits, the buyers pay around $37,490 (Around Rs 32 lakh).

The process of making beer requires a lot of steam, which is usually made by burning natural gas, exposing brewers to volatile price spikes. Fortunately, New Belgium found a solution with AtmosZero, a company specializing in industrial electric boilers which swap out expensive and dirty fossil fuels for clean electrons with stable prices.

Industry – everything from making steel and cement to chemicals and beer – is the world’s largest energy consumer, and its energy demand has soared 70% since 2000. To help protect against price volatility and cut climate pollution, industries around the world are embracing electric technologies in lieu of burning fossil fuels —also called industrial electrification—to create truly cleaner products.

That’s critical for manufacturers looking to succeed: Industrial producers won’t remain competitive in a global marketplace that increasingly values clean products, so countries and companies that don’t evolve will get left behind by those who do.

Until recently, cutting industrial emissions was considered difficult because of the sector’s reliance on burning fossil fuels for various processes. Fortunately, all-electric technologies—many already commercially available and ready to deploy at scale—can meet industry’s heat needs without compromising performance, while providing secondary benefits including cleaner air, a stable climate, and improved worker health.

Electric technologies are to poised power the next industrial revolution, but overcoming all barriers to industrial electrification requires policy leadership and industry’s embrace of technological innovation.

Electrifying industrial heat is the next step in manufacturing innovation

Industry is integral to our daily lives, economic health, and quality of life. The industrial sector produces nearly everything in our lives—from beverages and food to paper products and plastics, and even electric vehicles and solar panels. Manufacturing uses enormous amounts of fossil fuels to create those products, making industry the largest energy consumer in the world and responsible for a third of greenhouse gas emissions.

These energy demands fall into three primary categories:

Process uses, which is the energy used directly in industrial equipment, such as in boilers that generate steam for heating materials or distilling liquids or in kilns and blast furnaces that make cement and steel

Feedstocks used as chemical inputs that cannot be replaced with electricity directly, such as ammonia in fertilizer

Non-process uses required for industry to operate but not part of manufacturing, such as building heating, cooling, and lighting, or transportation equipment.

Process uses account for 84% of industrial non-feedstock fossil fuel use globally, and each industrial subsector requires different temperatures for their bespoke processes.

Today, industries rely on burning large volumes of fossil fuels to achieve these temperatures.

Fortunately, many untapped opportunities exist to reduce industrial energy demands by improving the overall efficiency of industrial operations. This can be done through energy and material efficiency measures, as well as reducing demand for new products. However, sizable industrial heat needs require scalable technology solutions to mitigate the sector’s outsized impact on climate change and air pollution. Fortunately, viable technologies and policy solutions are primed to tackle this challenge.

Powering industrial heat with electric technologies and a clean grid

Because electricity can be generated from carbon-free resources—like solar, wind, batteries, and geothermal—swapping electric technologies for burning fossil fuels can reduce and ultimately displace emissions. Though no one-size-fits-all solution exists for industrial heat, electrified technologies can meet nearly all industrial heating demands, including industrial heat pumps, electric boilers, thermal batteries, electric arc or induction furnaces, electric resistance heating, dielectric (radio or microwave) heating, and infrared heating.

However, shifting industrial processes from dirty fuels to clean electrons requires overcoming three primary categories of barriers—economics, grid readiness, and technology maturity and awareness—with a suite of policy solutions.

Primary barriers to industrial electrification and policy solutions to overcome them

Electrification can deliver many long-term economic, environmental, and societal benefits, but the higher cost of electricity relative to fossil fuels in many places and the capital expenditures needed to switch to electric technologies can be a deterrent to change. In addition, the costs to connect to the grid can add expenses.

Policymakers can pursue a combination of incentives to increase deployment of renewable and carbon-free electricity and create incentives to encourage clean industry and electrification. Creative financing tools will help fill market gaps, and clean heat emissions standards will help level the playing field for industrial electrification technologies, allowing them to compete with fossil fuel alternatives.

Widespread industrial electrification will also require a robust and reliable electricity grid capable of supporting more demand. New capacity additions must be carbon-free, alongside new transmission and distribution infrastructure. Slow and costly interconnection processes and outmoded grid planning can prevent meaningful progress. In order to overcome grid readiness barriers, policymakers should pursue greater energy efficiency as well as flexible industrial demand. This combined with interconnection and grid planning reforms that can reduce demand on the grid, while also reducing the costs for other ratepayers.

Finally, many electric technologies have been commercially available and in use in specific applications for decades, but not all have been deployed at scale or applied to traditionally fossil-fueled industrial processes. Industries, the workforce, and investors need experience with these technologies to gain confidence in industrial electrification. Government officials should support foundational research development and demonstration policies to ensure continued technology evolution and support for projects that yield cost and performance improvements across different geographies and jurisdictions. Workforce training and education programs are also necessary to attract, train, and support the people charged with their effective deployment and maintenance.

Catalyzing industrial electrification today

No one-size-fits-all policy package exists to electrify the industrial sector, and each sub-industry and jurisdiction faces unique challenges and priorities. Overcoming all barriers to industrial electrification can help government officials revitalize and modernize their region’s industrial base—one that is cleaner, more economically competitive, and aligned with a stable climate future.",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/6852f4b0b44d9de0b133ce1e/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,N,,2025-06-22 11:09:25.824900

While this announcement may seem like a form of sensationalism, China is pursuing safer and far more efficient generation of energy utilizing nuclear technology. With this nuclear technology, China may very well achieve all of its set net-zero goals.

Understanding SMRs and noting the focus on SMRs

So, what may initially seem like a hyperbole may very well be a shift in a new direction in terms of global energy technology. The big revelation came with progress made on a novel small nuclear reactor called the Small Modular Reactor (SMR), which is a compact and highly advanced system. The first-ever commercial above-ground SMR has been created in Hainan province and is known as Linglong-1. China will thus test this SMR technology beyond the borders and will begin testing in Southeast Asia.

SMRs are said to be nuclear reactors able to produce up to 300 megawatts of electricity (MWe), which is one-third of the capacity of traditional nuclear plants. Despite producing less power, the SMRs offer advantages in safety and flexibility. What makes SMRs so attractive is their integrated design that contains the fuel system and the steam generation in a compact, singular module. The beauty part is that most SMRs can shut down and still continue programming even without any electricity.

The uranium fuel that is used by these reactors is rather widely available. With the fuel, the SMR can continuously operate for 24 months before another refueling is needed. While output may fall short in comparison to other energy generators, the output concerning its size must be commended. This output produced has earned the SMRs the endearment, “extreme energy”.

Testing to start in Thailand first

Thailand has stood out as one of the key players to put China’s SMR technology to the test. It was a recent announcement from Thailand’s Electricity Generating Authority (EGAT) that mentioned the country is looking at several SMR options as per its energy transformation strategy. As has been stated by the EGAT governor, Thepparat Theppitak, these SMRs may very well be key in securing a low-carbon future for Thailand and ensuring that sustainable yet affordable energy is produced.

Thailand understands that since natural gas reserves are on the decline, power sources need to be diversified as much as possible. In opting for diversification of energy, SMRs stand central to the equation. While the focus remains on green hydrogen (and not at all on black hydrogen), the core premise of SMRs has been included in all of the green technology discussions thus far.

SMRs demand a mere 1km space for emergency planning and hence serve as an urban and industrial solution where space limitation is not considered a factor.

China’s collaboration with Thailand: A stepping stone towards a cleaner energy future

With the interest in SMRs increasing, it is Thailand that is looking forward to a future that entails relying on SMRs. Thailand’s nuclear program, which got delayed, has paved new avenues towards finding nuclear solutions, and Thailand’s collaboration with China may show advancement being made towards nuclear technology adoption.

China is looking to export its SMR solution, but China is also looking to become the leader of nuclear innovations. While SMRs are in the early stages of development, they prove to be more expensive to build in comparison to gas-powered plants. However, the advantages of SMRs surely do outweigh the cost factor incurred in manufacturing them. SMRs offer a lifetime of operational costs, performance for up to 10 years, and low emissions.",https://www.ecoticias.com/en/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Screenshot_16-6-2025_52254_www.jpg,N,,2025-06-22 11:09:28.848562

Details about the company’s robotaxi service have been scant since its unveiling in October of last year, and its launch has been delayed.
Just two days before that supposed launch, Musk reposted a video on X, the social media platform he owns, showing a driverless Tesla passing through an intersection in Austin.
Despite a launch that Musk has described as scaled back, Tesla is already facing opposition from Texas lawmakers.
Federal authorities have likewise taken note of the robotaxi launch.","Austin, Texas is set to be the first city worldwide to see Tesla’s self-driving robotaxi service on its roads. Elon Musk, CEO of the electric carmaker, has said he is “tentatively” planning to roll out a small number of these autonomous vehicles on the streets of the Texas state capital on Sunday.

Details about the company’s robotaxi service have been scant since its unveiling in October of last year, and its launch has been delayed. Musk has told reporters that there may be fewer than a dozen cars in Austin on Sunday and that the vehicles will stick to specific neighborhoods. Some analysts believe that the robotaxis will only be available to employees and invitees initially.

For the CEO, Tesla’s rollout is slow. “We could start with 1,000 or 10,000 [robotaxis] on day one, but I don’t think that would be prudent,” he told CNBC in May. “So, we will start with probably 10 for a week, then increase it to 20, 30, 40.”

The billionaire has said the driverless cars will be monitored remotely, but it is unclear if a safety driver will accompany the vehicles – as is standard practice when other robotaxi companies have launched in new cities.

Musk has been touting the Austin rollout since last summer, but the debut date has been a moving target. Over the past few months, the billionaire indicated the launch would be some time in June.

Then, news reports floated that it would happen on 12 June. Just two days before that supposed launch, Musk reposted a video on X, the social media platform he owns, showing a driverless Tesla passing through an intersection in Austin. In response to questions about the video on X, Musk said the date was “tentatively” 22 June but that this launch date would be “not real self-driving”, which would have to wait nearly another week.

“We are being super paranoid about safety, so the date could shift,” Musk added. “First Tesla that drives itself from factory end of line all the way to a customer house is 28 June.”

Musk said he plans to have one thousand Tesla robotaxis on Austin roads “within a few months” and then he’ll expand to other cities in Texas and California.

Despite a launch that Musk has described as scaled back, Tesla is already facing opposition from Texas lawmakers. A group of Democratic state senators and members of the house sent Tesla a letter last week asking the company to delay the debut until a new autonomous vehicle law takes effect in September.

“We believe this is in the best interest of both public safety and building public trust in Tesla’s operations,” the lawmakers wrote. It is unlikely their objections will throw up lasting roadblocks, though, as Republicans hold majorities in both chambers of the Texas legislature.

Federal authorities have likewise taken note of the robotaxi launch. In May, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration sent Tesla a list of questions about its robotaxi launch in Austin, which included how the company would intervene if something went wrong, how it would handle crash reporting and how it would deal with adverse weather conditions.

An NHTSA spokesperson told the Guardian that the agency has received a response from Tesla and it is in the process of reviewing it.

Tesla has been the subject of numerous investigations and lawsuits over the safety of the software that allows owners of its vehicles to drive hands-free, which the company calls Full Self-Driving and which is closely related to the technology used in its robotaxis.

There have been at least 17 deaths and five serious injuries involving the technology, according to the Washington Post. The NHTSA is looking into numerous crashes in which the agency says Full Self-Driving software was impeded by weather conditions like sun glare, fog, dust and darkness, including one crash that resulted in the death of a pedestrian.

Tesla will be joining a crowded robotaxi market in the Texas city, which already has services from Waymo, owned by Google parent Alphabet.

Amazon and Volkswagen are also testing driverless taxis in Austin. These companies have taken a slower approach in developing their autonomous vehicle technology by driving hundreds of thousands of miles to map city streets and working to train their software to avoid pedestrians, cyclists and unexpected happenings on the road.

A year later, he promised to deliver them the next year, but that didn’t happen either.

Despite the empty pledges the promises kept coming. Last year in January, Musk said, “Next year for sure, we’ll have over a million robotaxis.”

Would you settle for 10 or 12?

Musk appears to be on the verge of making his robotaxi vision a reality with a test run of a small squad of self-driving cabs in Austin, Texas, starting Sunday. Reaching a million may take a year or more, however, although the billionaire should be able to expand the service this year if the Austin demo is a success.

The stakes couldn't be higher, nor the challenges.

While Musk was making those “next year” promises, rival Waymo was busy deploying driverless taxis in Los Angeles, San Diego, Austin and other cities by using a different technology that allowed it to get to market faster. It just completed its 10 millionth paid ride.

Boycotts related to Musk's politics have tanked Tesla's sales. Rival electric vehicle makers with newly competitive models have stolen market share. And investors are on edge after a $150 billion stock wipeout when Musk picked a social media fight with a U.S. president overseeing federal car regulators who could make the robotaxi rollout much more difficult. The stock has recovered somewhat after Musk said he regretted some of his remarks.

Tesla shareholders have stood by Musk over the years because he’s defied the odds by building a successful standalone electric vehicle company — self-driving car promises aside — and making them a lot of money in the process. A decade ago, Tesla shares traded for around $18. The shares closed Friday at $322.

Musk says the Austin test will begin modestly enough, with just 10 or 12 vehicles picking up passengers in a limited area. But then it will quickly ramp up and spread to other cities, eventually reaching hundreds of thousands if not a million vehicles next year.

Some Musk watchers on Wall Street are skeptical.

“How quickly can he expand the fleet?” asks Garrett Nelson, an analyst at CFRA. “We're talking maybe a dozen vehicles initially. It's very small.""

Morningstar's Seth Goldstein says Musk is being classic Musk: Promising too much, too quickly.

“When anyone in Austin can download the app and use a robotaxi, that will be a success, but I don't think that will happen until 2028,"" he says. “Testing is going to take a while.”

Musk's tendency to push up the stock high with a bit of hyperbole is well known among investors.

In 2018, he told Tesla stockholders he had “funding secured” to buy all their shares at a massive premium and take the company private. But he not only lacked a written commitment from financiers, according to federal stock regulators who fined him, he hadn't discussed the loan amount or other details with them.

More recently, Musk told CNBC in May that Tesla was experiencing a “major rebound” in demand. A week later an auto trade group in Europe announced sales had plunged by half.

Musk has come under fire for allegedly exaggerating the ability of the system used for its cars to drive themselves, starting with the name. Full Self-Driving is a misnomer. The system still requires drivers to keep their eyes on the road because they may need to intervene and take control at any moment.

Federal highway safety regulators opened an investigation into FSD last year after several accidents, and the Department of Justice has conducted its own probe, though the status of that is not known. Tesla has also faced lawsuits over the feature, some resulting in settlements, other dismissed. In one case, a judge ruled against the plaintiffs but only because they hadn't proved Musk “knowingly” made false statements.

Musk says the robotaxis will be running on an improved version of Full Self-Driving and the cabs will be safe.

He also says the service will be able to expand rapidly around the country. His secret weapon: Millions of Tesla owners now on the roads. He says an over-the-air software update will soon allow them to turn their cars into driverless cabs and start a side business while stuck at the office for eight hours or on vacation for a week.

“Instead of having your car sit in the parking lot, your car could be earning money,” Musk said earlier this year, calling it an Airbnb model for cars. “You will be able to add or subtract your car to the fleet.”

Musk says Tesla also can move fast to deploy taxis now because of his decision to rely only on cameras for the cars to navigate, unlike Waymo, which has gone a more expensive route by supplementing its cameras with lasers and radar.

“Tesla will have, I don’t know,” Musk mused in an conference call with investors, ”99% market share or something ridiculous.” Given Waymo's head start and potential competition from Amazon and others, dominating the driverless market to that extent could be a reach.

But Dan Ives, a Wedbush Securities analyst and big Musk fan, says this time Musk may actually pull it off because of Tesla's ability to scale up quickly. And even skeptics like Morningstar's Goldstein acknowledge that Musk occasionally does gets things right, and spectacularly so.

He upended the car industry by getting people to buy expensive electric vehicles, brought his Starlink satellite internet service to rural areas and, more recently, performed a gee-whiz trick of landing an unmanned SpaceX rocket on a platform back on earth.

“Maybe his timelines aren’t realistic,"" Goldstein says, “but he can develop futuristic technology products.”",https://images.wral.com/asset/news/technology/2025/06/22/22060027/6857d44050278-media_6fe8677645b245b386a61bf067c2adcb-DMID1-67e2zktiq-640x480.jpg,N,,2025-06-22 08:59:29.297064

The climate change debate, hoax or real, is about whether human activity or natural planetary cycles are the cause of global warming.
The current U.S. climate resiliency policy has no chance to protect us from ever-worsening, billion-dollar-plus severe weather events.
Unfortunately, the public places their trust in elected leaders and feels reassured that appropriate action is being taken regarding climate change.
The climate change threat can be a revenue-generating opportunity because America’s greatest asset is our innovative people.","Robert ""Jaz"" Jastremski, founder of Mystic Innovations Group, Inc., and a former project manager at Electric Boat, believes applying holistic engineering principles could help mitigate our climate crisis. But he says U.S. policies both past and present are not in tune with current realities and are only delaying long-term solutions. He believes focusing on climate resiliency is the key to forging a better future, and his nonprofit Climate Adaptive Solutions is dedicated to shifting public perception away from accepting carbon reduction policies as the key to fighting climate change.

Early in his career, as the team leader at Electric Boat responsible for developing design and performance specifications for the Trident submarine, Jastremski underwent specialized government training in holistic assessment methods. He also served as the senior vice president for strategic planning and business development at Analysis & Technology, formerly headquartered in North Stonington and now dispersed into several companies. His Mystic Innovations company demonstrated the feasibility of all-electric submarines, a potential major cost saver.

As a systems engineer, Jastremski approaches problems from a holistic, big-picture perspective, integrating information from technical, financial and other relevant fields to devise creative solutions verified by rigorous testing. He likens this approach to the Romans' use of holistic engineering to create their enduring marvels, such as the aqueduct system. Jastremski believes that a similar methodology could address current national challenges and empower citizens to demand action or accountability from political leaders. He asserts that the processes established by the Founding Fathers are outdated, contributing to public dissatisfaction demonstrated in the consistently poor performance ratings for Congress and the White House.

Jastremski is also the author of ""Working World Mentor,"" offering specific advice focused on achieving career success and dealing with inter-personal challenges. The Day's Business Editor, Lee Howard, conducted a series of interviews with Jastremski over recent months, covering significant issues facing the United States, including climate change, Congress, the national debt and China's effect on the U.S. manufacturing industry. These interviews will be published in a series over the coming months.

What makes you so sure that climate change is a real problem and not a hoax, as some seem to believe?

The climate change debate, hoax or real, is about whether human activity or natural planetary cycles are the cause of global warming. To me, it is irrelevant because the issue the U.S. needs to immediately address is the growing frequency of severe weather catastrophes. Regardless of the root cause of worsening weather events, it is a national responsibility to implement defensive measures to mitigate the effects of rapidly increasing severe weather impacts, including flooding, wildfires, unbearable heat, water shortages and high windstorm damage. It should be a national imperative to prioritize the development of technology and new methods to adapt to this current undeniable reality. Had all world air pollution and rain forest clear-cutting ended 75 years ago as scientists warned, it might have slowed global warming. But it did not happen, and the predicted consequences came true.

Our atmosphere already retains centuries of pollutants to form the greenhouse gas layer that 97% of scientists believe causes global warming. The analogy would be akin to merely slowing down the amount of water entering an already-flooded basement and expecting it will help the basement dry out, which makes no sense. In 2022, our politicians made a technically naive climate resiliency policy targeting zero U.S. carbon emissions by 2050. It assumes, without supporting technical and financial analysis, that it is practical and affordable to replace all fossil fuel use with alternative energy. This policy misleads the American public and makes it harder to focus on the only strategy that makes sense which is a national goal to develop innovations to adapt and survive worsening SWIs (sever weather impacts).

The current U.S. climate resiliency policy has no chance to protect us from ever-worsening, billion-dollar-plus severe weather events. Unfortunately, the public places their trust in elected leaders and feels reassured that appropriate action is being taken regarding climate change. Politicians have chosen to select a carbon reduction strategy, where validation of expected benefit cannot be measured for lifetimes, even centuries. A risk avoidance approach involves planning for worst-case scenarios based on the assumption that slowing global warming is unrealistic because it depends on unattainable worldwide cooperation. It is crucial to develop innovative adaptations to mitigate severe weather impacts. Evidence supports this strategy over reducing emissions, which has not demonstrated measurable deterrence but rather represents wishful thinking.

Wouldn't your approach be more expensive, more all-encompassing and possibly a greater burden on taxpayers than the green policies that are now often mentioned to try to cut down on carbon emissions?

Absolutely not! Investing in carbon reduction through wind and solar farms, with the expectation of widespread adoption of electric vehicles and replacement of gas and diesel engines across the country, is impractical. Certainly, reducing energy costs with solar panels or windmills makes sense for individual situations, just not on scale for eliminating everything that emits carbon pollution. For example, consider the substantial cost required to convert 175,000 filling stations and their half-million employees to charging stations. Consumers are unlikely to abandon functional fossil fuel vehicles in favor of entirely electric replacements. Oil-producing countries such as Saudi Arabia, which possess over a century's worth of supply and established extraction facilities, can reduce prices to encourage the continued use of gasoline vehicles. Adaptation technology provides a significant return on investment while green policies are insufficient to reverse the severe-weather trend.

An example of effective innovation is New York City's flood protection system developed after Superstorm Sandy caused $34 billion in damage to underground infrastructure. With an investment of $1.5 billion, the city now has available Kevlar tunnel and subway entrance-sized inflatable ""plugs."" This preventive measure may yield a return on investment of $50-200 billion in cost avoidance, depending on the frequency of future flooding events. This idea was proposed by a citizen shortly after the storm and I read about it then in the New York Times.

Relying on green policies to mitigate severe weather impacts dangerously provides false reassurance and misguides younger generations into pursuing green careers instead of focusing on adaptation solutions.

One of your arguments for your approach is that the United States alone cannot stop climate change; wouldn't your ideas to seek engineered solutions still have to assume that other countries buy in as well?

Our focus should be on defending the U.S. from severe weather events without needing global coordination. The Paris Accord demonstrates the difficulty in achieving global cooperation. Some economies still rely on fossil fuels, and green policies will not effectively stop climate change within a few lifetimes. Climate change is unstoppable.

Currently, our political leaders will not work hard to do what every family must do, which is if your income does not support essential expenses, figure out how to earn more. Creating innovations to mitigate or prevent growing cost of severe weather impacts will generate economic growth. The climate change threat can be a revenue-generating opportunity because America’s greatest asset is our innovative people.

Defending against climate change depends on each country's priorities and affordability. Other countries lead in adaptation solutions: the Netherlands manages sea level rise, China built an 800-mile aqueduct, Australia uses drones for early fire detection and immediate fire suppression, and several countries excel in seawater desalination.

Who would be responsible for implementing your policy ideas? How would they be turned into laws? Do you have any estimate of the cost, and over what time period these policies would be in effect? Is there any place in your policy prescriptions for encouraging electric cars, reducing greenhouse gases, or de-emphasizing fossil fuels, among other issues?

I, with others, drafted a national action plan to safeguard against global warming harm. The Constitution requires government by and for the people, but elected officials often prioritize personal agendas over public concerns. Adaptation policy success may require significant public demand for action to mitigate severe weather impacts. The initial objective is to raise public awareness of a national threat and prompt officials to understand the urgency of adaptation innovation.

The plan includes establishing an adaptation innovations industry with tasking, timing, phased cost estimates, ROI measures and public engagement. A suggestion is to allocate a small fraction of the remaining $600 billion or so from the Inflation Reduction Act to start developing climate adaptation solutions. Collaboration with experts from federal and state agencies, first responders, severe weather impact victims and academia will establish innovation requirements. I believe that climate resiliency funding for 20,000 Climate Corps jobs exists, and this initiative would leverage that workforce to the adaptation goal. Any organization with solution ideas will be able to bid on government solicitations.

A White House or Congressional special project, named the “Climate Adaptation Industry Development Initiative,” should evolve independently to find optimal solutions. It must be streamlined and free from bureaucratic delays, as severe weather impact recovery costs increase by $2 billion weekly. Phase One involves planning project tasks, identifying participants, assigning responsibilities and focusing on one severe weather topic for the quickest path to promising innovation investments. Over the long term this project team would dissolve and coordination between companies that innovate protective products and services would be done through a professional association like exists for many industries.

Efforts to inform senators, the White House, and others have been ignored. Attempts to contact President Biden and Senators Murphy and Whitehouse received deflective responses and/or donation requests. Summaries sent to President Trump, Elon Musk and Stephen Miller have gone unanswered.

Homeowners, schools, communities or businesses should adopt alternative energy methods or use EVs where economically or otherwise beneficial for themselves, just do not believe it will help solve global warming.

How do you feel about wind energy, solar power and nuclear solutions? Are there other energy gamechangers on the way?

The challenge of scale is often misunderstood. Wind, solar, hydropower and fuel cells can supplement traditional electric generation for small entities using clean energy sources. However, large projects like the Northern Atlantic 16,000-generator offshore wind farm have doubled electric rates due to high startup costs, making grid-size alternate energy less attractive compared to nuclear power. There are 440 commercial nuclear power plants operating in 30 countries. China and Russia are both committed to producing about 30 nuclear plants each. Nuclear power has been proven to be safe after 50 years of service for naval submarines and aircraft carriers as well as the 54 commercial nuclear power plants across the U.S. Lessons were learned from the Three Mile Island near disaster in 1979, in an NRC-sponsored contract to optimize operator training. My colleague, Mitch Henderson, led the operator task analysis team which resulted in much better operator confidence and that course is used today.

Distant future electricity needs may be met by safer nuclear options like thorium. Bill Gates is investing in this research. ExxonMobil explores hydrogen from water as clean fuel, though scaling remains a challenge. These novel energy innovations are unlikely to deploy within the next 20 years or later and cannot be relied on until proven.

Many recent climate policies have been at the whim of various administrations. How do we get both parties onboard, so this becomes less of a political hot potato?

Uniting political parties on climate policy requires unrelenting public demand for immediate action. Citizens should be informed about national climate policy misdirection and demand adaptation technology development support. Gen Z must lead the charge to pressure members of Congress as they will inherit the results, but I do not know how to reach them via social media.

Financial control is also a concern. Current policies reduce tax revenue, but eliminating debt requires more revenue. Immediate investment in adaptation innovation is crucial to reduce recovery expenses, averaging $2 billion per week and projected to escalate by 2050. Past urgency shows the need for focus on adaptation rather than emissions reduction alone. Emphasizing adaptation with younger generations and that what they inherit is a good reason to influence bipartisan support now. Using funds from the Inflation Reduction Act for adaptation projects could unify climate defense efforts. Public figures could help raise awareness and drive demand for action from Congress and the president.

You have mentioned your deep concern for the future as you recently reached your 80th birthday. Discuss the sense of urgency you feel and why others should share this sentiment.

I want every American to act urgently to address our country's shortcomings. Dysfunction among elected officials has hindered financial control and accountability, leading to a perilous future. Warnings that would have prevented 9/11 were ignored, and now we face harmful, severe weather patterns due to global warming. Despite decades of scientific warnings and literature like ""Disaster Resilience: A National Imperative,"" a 2012 call to national action by findings of a National Academy of Sciences investigative team, there has been no legislative action on meaningful climate resilience adaptation. Our leaders tend to react to disasters rather than prevent them. Severe weather patterns are worsening, and we must shift investment from emission reduction to adaptation defenses.

With my experience in military technology innovation and lobbying Congress, I understand the inner workings of Congress better than most. Our national leaders lack the expertise to tackle complex engineering challenges, risking a catastrophic future without immediate action. Future generations deserve our best efforts to leave America in optimal condition. Urgent public demand is crucial in addressing this clear national threat.

Personal note: In the mid-1990s, my daughter taught MIT's graduate course on the global environment during summers at a retreat facility in Switzerland.

'So until we see more exploration successes (with geologic hydrogen) it's going to be a very small process.","Emerging science shows geologic hydrogen, created under the Earth's crust naturally, may exist in pools that can be extracted for clean energy.

A U.S. Geological Survey study of where geologic hydrogen could potentially be found shows Michigan as a particularly promising site.

Imagine an abundant form of energy that's so clean, when you burn it, it doesn't create carbon or greenhouse gases, it creates water. Imagine that, unlike oil and gas, where when you take it out of the ground it's gone, this underground energy source can be stimulated to keep reproducing itself, creating wells that never run out.

Now imagine that energy source being abundant beneath the surface of the United States — and that Michigan, in particular, is teeming with it.

Emerging science is showing all of the above appears true, but there is a lot more work to do before this potentially revolutionary energy source can be unlocked on a large scale.

It's not some exotic, newly discovered element, but the most ubiquitous one in the universe: hydrogen. It's been used for years in producing metals, in hydrogenating cooking oils for better shelf life, and in the creation of ammonia for nitrogen-based fertilizers used on farm fields across the globe. But that hydrogen comes at a cost, from applying electricity to water — H₂O, two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom — to separate the two elements and retain the hydrogen. Natural gas is often used to provide the energy for that process, but that's expensive and, while better than coal or oil, still pollutes the atmosphere. Renewable energy sources such as wind and solar are also being applied to this hydrogen extraction process, but it's difficult and costly to do at scale.

Hydrogen is created naturally underground through a reaction between water and certain iron-rich rocks, a process known as serpentinization, or through radiolysis, where natural radiation deep in the Earth breaks down water molecules to produce hydrogen. But scientists for generations — to the extent they thought about geologic hydrogen at all — considered it so diffusive and reactive they believed most was dissipated or converted to some other compound. Historically, when hydrogen pockets were discovered in drilling or mining, it wasn't identified or quantified. Rather, it was often considered a nuisance to remove so that miners and drillers could get what they really were after: oil, gas, and minerals.

Scientists only recently discovered that geologic hydrogen potentially remains trapped in rock layers in pools that could be tapped, maybe even on a commercial scale.

An old water well drilling in the late 1980s in the African nation of Mali, capped after flammable hydrogen exploded, was tested by an exploration company as a potential energy source many years later — and ended up powering a nearby village for years, carbon-free. That discovery, along with others around the world and in the United States, has enthusiasm on the rise.

In a study published earlier this year, geologists with the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) developed a multifaceted map of the prospectivity of geologic hydrogen in the continental United States. They looked for areas with all the right ingredients: a source of sufficient hydrogen generation — iron-rich rock is an important catalyst; porous underground reservoirs for storage, and a sufficient layer of sealing cap rock to contain the hydrogen pools and prevent leaking.

The study found that a large swath through the middle of the country has great potential to contain collected pools of geologic hydrogen — and Michigan, in particular, was one of the areas that really showed promise.

""The source of the hydrogen, the reservoir and the seal, Michigan, in particular, happens to have all of these ingredients all overlaid with one another, plus a handful of other things that we mapped out,"" said Jane Hearon, a USGS geologist and co-author of the study.

""It was kind of interesting and fun to see Michigan light up that way because you don't think of it as like a Texas, one of these states that has a long-standing tradition of energy production.""

And while one path of research is looking into where geologic hydrogen may be naturally occurring, another is looking into places with the right rock formations and other ingredients where the gas may be stimulated into existence and produced, through injection of water into rock and perhaps with some catalysts such as other elements and microbes, said USGS geologist Sarah Gelman, a co-author on the prospectivity mapping study.

Then-President Joe Biden's Department of Energy, in February 2024, announced $20 million in grants to 16 institutions looking into geologic hydrogen's energy potential, including 10 institutions working on stimulated hydrogen projects.

""It's a bit simpler versus finding the accumulations, because you just go where the right rocks are,"" Gelman said. ""But it's got a lot of engineering challenges, and that's where that body of research (is needed).""

Stimulated hydrogen holds promise for iron-rich regions without natural underground reservoirs for accumulating naturally created hydrogen, such as ""the Upper Peninsula and into Minnesota,"" she said.

""It doesn't mean all hope is lost there,"" Gelman said. ""There is some good, good potential (for stimulated hydrogen production).""

170,000 years' worth of energy, created by the Earth

The Earth has produced enough hydrogen under its crust to meet the entire planet's energy needs for 170,000 years — but most of it is lost or inaccessible, said Christopher Ballentine, a professor of geochemistry at the University of Oxford in England.

""But what it does mean is we only need to find a small amount of it for it to be useful societally,"" he said.

Ballentine pointed to USGS studies showing there's potentially enough geologic hydrogen which ""has the potential to be found and discovered and produced"" to meet society's increasing hydrogen demands for the next 200 years.

That has piqued the interest of the oil, gas and mineral extraction world.

[ Help us improve the Free Press experience! Take our short survey. ]

""The industry is following the money,"" Ballentine said. ""About five years ago, there were zero companies in this space. Two years ago, there were 40. There are probably double that today.""

But prospectivity means places where stored, naturally occurring underground hydrogen may be, where the conditions are ripe for it. But it's not a certainty, and searching for it is a costly process that oil and gas production companies approach carefully.

""There are a lot of smaller startups, a lot of independent new companies that are interested in this,"" Gelman said. ""The oil majors are often interested and sitting back and watching a little bit, but they will be the fast followers.""

""We want to get to the wells — that's the exciting part; they actually call it the rotary lie detector, where you figure out what's down there. But there is a lot of groundwork and geology that we're trying to provide to American industry and American policymakers to try and help ease this initial stage.""

Interest, but not much activity so far in Michigan

Current U.S. exploration and drilling for geologic hydrogen occurs most intensely in Kansas, Nebraska, and Iowa, along the Midcontinent Rift, a geologic formation in the middle United States, where the Earth's crust began to pull apart millions of years ago, a formation that also runs through Michigan as well and contributes to its prospectivity.

HyTerra, a Subiaco, Washington-based subsidiary of an Australian exploration company seeking natural hydrogen and helium, is drilling above and near the Midcontinent Rift in eastern Kansas, in areas where hydrogen was observed in historic oil and gas wells. They've found both elements and are now adding more wells to appraise and define the potential resource, said Avon McIntyre, the company's executive director and chief technical officer.

""We are excited by what we are seeing so far,"" he said.

While it's still very early on, there is rapidly growing interest in geologic hydrogen — sometimes called white hydrogen, McIntyre said.

""The possibility of an extremely useful, low-carbon commodity naturally occurring in places we have not properly looked is a compelling one,"" he said.

""Hydrogen is used for so many purposes, from industrial feedstock through to an energy source, that wherever it may be found, it is likely there will be someone nearby to whom it will be useful.""

But even exploratory drilling for geologic hydrogen hasn't occurred in Michigan — yet.

""We’ve been following the increased attention on geologic hydrogen, and the prospectivity map certainly shows Michigan in the darkest blues for prospectivity,"" said Adam Wygant, director of the Geologic Resources Management Division of the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality.

""Our sense is there is a fair amount of research going on and companies looking at potential in Michigan,"" both for naturally occurring underground pools and for stimulated hydrogen production.

State officials are encouraging any companies doing geologic testing to include hydrogen in their tests, to better learn where it's found and help zero in on those more costly exploration methods, Wygant said.

Michigan is prepared to regulate any hydrogen production activities through its existing laws, and is monitoring other states where geologic hydrogen exploration is farther along to help identify administrative rules and procedures, he said. The actual extraction process would not be remarkably different from an oil or natural gas well.

""But the hydrogen molecule is a little different from a methane molecule — it’s pesky; it doesn’t like to be contained,"" Wygant said.

""There are specialty products that would be used in well construction, in cements, in surface infrastructure, to properly maintain it.""

Finding the recipe for reproducing hydrogen underground

Multiple avenues of geologic hydrogen research are under pursuit at Sandia National Laboratories, a federally owned facility in Albuquerque, New Mexico, operated by a subsidiary of Honeywell International that works on advancing science on energy, national security and other issues.

The lab is participating in a research project experimenting with certain rock types and characterizing how much hydrogen they produce under different conditions, the keys to producing stimulated hydrogen.

""They're doing microbes, catalysts, different chemicals, steam, working at different temperatures,"" said Sandia geologist Franek Hasiuk. ""Right now, the race is to find the right recipe, and there have been early positive results with some of these techniques.""

""We can either do those chemical reactions down in a well deep underground, or we can even do it at a mine, and it's actually a way we could use old mine tailings and mine waste to produce new energy and new revenue streams that can help clean up those mine wastes.""

Sandia is also funding an internal research and development project on the molecular and atomic processes involved in geologic production of hydrogen.

""There is a long way to go; there is still a lot to discover,"" said Donald Conley, acting senior manager of the Geosciences Research and Applications Group at Sandia.

""We are guiding the conversation to what's next for geologic hydrogen. Once we find all these discoveries, how do we make it a viable part of the U.S. energy economy?""

An accidental find helps an African village meet its power needs

Workers drilling a water well in the village of Bourakėbougou in the African nation of Mali in 1987 accidentally hit a vein of geologic hydrogen — a discovery confirmed after a worker lit a cigarette and the gas exploded. The well hole was capped with cement for safety reasons and forgotten until 2012, when Hydroma, a company based in Canada, began a pilot project combusting the hydrogen from the well to produce electricity for the village.

""For more than 7 years, the village of Bourakébougou benefited from free electricity without CO₂ emissions,"" the company states on its website. The company has since proven the existence of other nearby pools of geologic hydrogen, has expanded its footprint in other parts of Africa, and has opened a U.S. division.

A reservoir of geologic hydrogen discovered at an abandoned chromium mine in Albania, and reserves discovered in France's Lorraine region, have also sparked development interest.

While geologic hydrogen discoveries and their benefits may be at first localized, that's not a new story, Hasiuk said.

""When the oil and gas industry started, it was also just like that, very localized pockets where you had oil seeping out of the ground,"" he said. ""In one place, they would use it to line the outside of ships to make them waterproof, or they'd use it in making patent medicines and things like that. It was really when we started moving from collecting it from places where it seeped out of the ground to drilling nearby that we were able to unlock these larger volumes.""

Drilling is very expensive, and companies today generally do it only when they have really good information, he said.

'So until we see more exploration successes (with geologic hydrogen) it's going to be a very small process. But just like with the start of the oil industry, once people started being very successful, then the exploration activities spread rapidly across the country and across the world.""

The cautions and tempered expectations are repeatedly cited, but the excitement about geologic hydrogen's possibilities is undeniable.

""If we can prove this concept and reproducibly find natural hydrogen, it will be a game-changer,"" Ballentine said. ""It will potentially provide a transition of green energy from wind, from solar to a hydrogen economy.""

170,000 years' worth of energy, created by the Earth

The Earth has produced enough hydrogen under its crust to meet the entire planet's energy needs for 170,000 years — but most of it is lost or inaccessible, said Christopher Ballentine, a professor of geochemistry at the University of Oxford in England.

""But what it does mean is we only need to find a small amount of it for it to be useful societally,"" he said.

Ballentine pointed to USGS studies showing there's potentially enough geologic hydrogen which ""has the potential to be found and discovered and produced"" to meet society's increasing hydrogen demands for the next 200 years.

That has piqued the interest of the oil, gas and mineral extraction world.

[ Help us improve the Free Press experience! Take our short survey. ]

""The industry is following the money,"" Ballentine said. ""About five years ago, there were zero companies in this space. Two years ago, there were 40. There are probably double that today.""

But prospectivity means places where stored, naturally occurring underground hydrogen may be, where the conditions are ripe for it. But it's not a certainty, and searching for it is a costly process that oil and gas production companies approach carefully.

""There are a lot of smaller startups, a lot of independent new companies that are interested in this,"" Gelman said. ""The oil majors are often interested and sitting back and watching a little bit, but they will be the fast followers.""

""We want to get to the wells — that's the exciting part; they actually call it the rotary lie detector, where you figure out what's down there. But there is a lot of groundwork and geology that we're trying to provide to American industry and American policymakers to try and help ease this initial stage.""

Interest, but not much activity so far in Michigan

Current U.S. exploration and drilling for geologic hydrogen occurs most intensely in Kansas, Nebraska, and Iowa, along the Midcontinent Rift, a geologic formation in the middle United States, where the Earth's crust began to pull apart millions of years ago, a formation that also runs through Michigan as well and contributes to its prospectivity.

HyTerra, a Subiaco, Washington-based subsidiary of an Australian exploration company seeking natural hydrogen and helium, is drilling above and near the Midcontinent Rift in eastern Kansas, in areas where hydrogen was observed in historic oil and gas wells. They've found both elements and are now adding more wells to appraise and define the potential resource, said Avon McIntyre, the company's executive director and chief technical officer.

""We are excited by what we are seeing so far,"" he said.

While it's still very early on, there is rapidly growing interest in geologic hydrogen — sometimes called white hydrogen, McIntyre said.

""The possibility of an extremely useful, low-carbon commodity naturally occurring in places we have not properly looked is a compelling one,"" he said.

""Hydrogen is used for so many purposes, from industrial feedstock through to an energy source, that wherever it may be found, it is likely there will be someone nearby to whom it will be useful.""

But even exploratory drilling for geologic hydrogen hasn't occurred in Michigan — yet.

""We’ve been following the increased attention on geologic hydrogen, and the prospectivity map certainly shows Michigan in the darkest blues for prospectivity,"" said Adam Wygant, director of the Geologic Resources Management Division of the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality.

""Our sense is there is a fair amount of research going on and companies looking at potential in Michigan,"" both for naturally occurring underground pools and for stimulated hydrogen production.

State officials are encouraging any companies doing geologic testing to include hydrogen in their tests, to better learn where it's found and help zero in on those more costly exploration methods, Wygant said.

Michigan is prepared to regulate any hydrogen production activities through its existing laws, and is monitoring other states where geologic hydrogen exploration is farther along to help identify administrative rules and procedures, he said. The actual extraction process would not be remarkably different from an oil or natural gas well.

""But the hydrogen molecule is a little different from a methane molecule — it’s pesky; it doesn’t like to be contained,"" Wygant said.

""There are specialty products that would be used in well construction, in cements, in surface infrastructure, to properly maintain it.""

Finding the recipe for reproducing hydrogen underground

Multiple avenues of geologic hydrogen research are under pursuit at Sandia National Laboratories, a federally owned facility in Albuquerque, New Mexico, operated by a subsidiary of Honeywell International that works on advancing science on energy, national security and other issues.

The lab is participating in a research project experimenting with certain rock types and characterizing how much hydrogen they produce under different conditions, the keys to producing stimulated hydrogen.

""They're doing microbes, catalysts, different chemicals, steam, working at different temperatures,"" said Sandia geologist Franek Hasiuk. ""Right now, the race is to find the right recipe, and there have been early positive results with some of these techniques.""

""We can either do those chemical reactions down in a well deep underground, or we can even do it at a mine, and it's actually a way we could use old mine tailings and mine waste to produce new energy and new revenue streams that can help clean up those mine wastes.""

Sandia is also funding an internal research and development project on the molecular and atomic processes involved in geologic production of hydrogen.

""There is a long way to go; there is still a lot to discover,"" said Donald Conley, acting senior manager of the Geosciences Research and Applications Group at Sandia.

""We are guiding the conversation to what's next for geologic hydrogen. Once we find all these discoveries, how do we make it a viable part of the U.S. energy economy?""

An accidental find helps an African village meet its power needs

Workers drilling a water well in the village of Bourakėbougou in the African nation of Mali in 1987 accidentally hit a vein of geologic hydrogen — a discovery confirmed after a worker lit a cigarette and the gas exploded. The well hole was capped with cement for safety reasons and forgotten until 2012, when Hydroma, a company based in Canada, began a pilot project combusting the hydrogen from the well to produce electricity for the village.

""For more than 7 years, the village of Bourakébougou benefited from free electricity without CO₂ emissions,"" the company states on its website. The company has since proven the existence of other nearby pools of geologic hydrogen, has expanded its footprint in other parts of Africa, and has opened a U.S. division.

A reservoir of geologic hydrogen discovered at an abandoned chromium mine in Albania, and reserves discovered in France's Lorraine region, have also sparked development interest.

While geologic hydrogen discoveries and their benefits may be at first localized, that's not a new story, Hasiuk said.

""When the oil and gas industry started, it was also just like that, very localized pockets where you had oil seeping out of the ground,"" he said. ""In one place, they would use it to line the outside of ships to make them waterproof, or they'd use it in making patent medicines and things like that. It was really when we started moving from collecting it from places where it seeped out of the ground to drilling nearby that we were able to unlock these larger volumes.""

Drilling is very expensive, and companies today generally do it only when they have really good information, he said.

'So until we see more exploration successes (with geologic hydrogen) it's going to be a very small process. But just like with the start of the oil industry, once people started being very successful, then the exploration activities spread rapidly across the country and across the world.""

The cautions and tempered expectations are repeatedly cited, but the excitement about geologic hydrogen's possibilities is undeniable.

""If we can prove this concept and reproducibly find natural hydrogen, it will be a game-changer,"" Ballentine said. ""It will potentially provide a transition of green energy from wind, from solar to a hydrogen economy.""

What's happening?

Federal lawmakers are currently discussing a budget bill proposed by Congressional Republicans that could dismantle, among other things, huge portions of the Inflation Reduction Act — perhaps most notably, the tax breaks and incentives available for solar-energy projects.

EnergySage, a solar energy consulting company and independent source of industry information, has reported on the massive impact this could have on green-energy jobs.

Nowhere might this be more evident than in Nevada. If the bill passes as is, the company warns, Nevada could lose nearly 22,000 clean-energy jobs.

""From solar production to lithium mining, Nevada is at the forefront of the clean energy revolution,"" Senator Catherine Cortez Masto said in a statement to EnergySage. ""Dismantling the IRA tax credits will destroy thousands of good-paying, union jobs, raise energy costs for working families, and shrink the Silver State's [gross domestic product].""

Nevada is a clean-energy leader and has the highest solar generation per capita among all states, according to EnergySage.

Nevada Senator Jacky Rosen, the company also noted, posted on social media in mid-May that the passage of the current proposal could mean that ""NV will lose thousands of good-paying jobs and families will see higher energy bills.""

In mid-June, the Indianapolis Star reported that data from the Solar Energy Industries Association indicates that ""roughly 4,000 solar jobs in Indiana that could be at risk"" if the bill were to be approved in its current form. In their own mid-May statement, the SEAI said the budget, as drafted at the time, could ""result in nearly 300,000 current and future American jobs to be lost, including 86,000 in solar manufacturing.""

Why does this matter?

In April, Nevada had the highest unemployment rate of all U.S. states. Big hits to major employers could be another blow for residents and especially families, who could lose out on income and employment benefits like health insurance.

As the drafted budget bill is also currently poised to roll back the government-funded insurance programs Medicare and Medicaid, the effects could be compounding. Those compounding effects could also show up for consumers who had planned to lower their utility bills by installing clean-energy options like home solar systems, which can bring energy costs down to nearly $0 a month in some cases.

Among the many proposed cuts in the GOP's ""Big Beautiful Bill"" are those aimed at the Investment Tax Credit, also known as the Solar Credit, which currently covers 30% of installed solar-panel system installation costs.

As PV Magazine has reported, the draft from the Senate Finance Committee would cut the ITC to 60% of its current value by the end of 2026, to 20% by the end of 2027, and scrap it altogether for projects beginning in or after 2028.

Solar is the fastest-growing electricity source in the U.S., and with new breakthroughs happening all the time to make solar panels even more efficient, anything that slows its growth could spell bad news for the economy domestically and the environment worldwide.

What can I do about this?

With the future of renewable-energy credits uncertain, anyone interested in getting solar panels may want to act quickly.

Purchasing solar panels before the credits are cut back by Congressional action could mean thousands of dollars saved in your household budget. In fact, EnergySage estimates that, by using its free services, the average person can shave up to $10,000 of installation costs.

EnergySage even has a free mapping tool that shows, for each state, the average cost of a home solar-panel system, as well as available incentives. By using the free map, listed incentives, and installation-comparison tools, consumers can ensure they find the best price from a trusted company.

As the bill has not yet been passed, those wishing to voice their thoughts about the budget proposal and its potential effects still have time to reach out to their elected officials.",https://www.thecooldown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/clean-energy-jobsimage-rec5WzCPwhxPXPqWM.jpg,N,,2025-06-22 05:01:30.486801

These strategic investments in advanced energy manufacturing, electric transportation, and electric grid resilience are powering job creation, revitalizing rural areas, and positioning South Carolina as a national leader in American-made energy. These clean energy tax credits are critical for businesses, like mine, here in South Carolina in order to maintain investment and continue growing the manufacturing base within the Palmetto State.

South Carolina’s power grid — like much of the nation’s — is aging and under rising pressure.

Demand from data centers, manufacturing expansions, and electric vehicles is expected to surge over the next decade. In South Carolina, the commercial and industrial electricity rates are 10.97 cents/kWh and 7.01 cents/kWh, respectively, and both are below the national average.

However, electricity rates are up almost 6% from the year prior. Reduced incentivized investment in clean energy infrastructure could lead to even higher prices due to a reliance on more expensive, traditional power sources. Strategic energy investments, supported by stable tax policies, will help us avoid future grid shortfalls, prevent the risk of rolling blackouts, and reduce long-term energy costs for South Carolina families and businesses.

Tax credits are not a new concept — they have been a bipartisan policy tool used for decades to support emerging technologies. From artificial intelligence to biotechnology, to government investments driving technologies like GPS and the internet, these investments have repeatedly demonstrated their value. Clean energy technologies are no exception.

In 2024, over 2,600 megawatts of solar energy capacity came online in South Carolina, equating to enough power to supply 325,640 homes.

Over the next five years, South Carolina is projected to add over 2,500 megawatts of solar capacity.

Retaining the existing energy tax credits will allow businesses in South Carolina to continue to develop and deploy renewable energy technologies which are vital to improve grid resiliency, promote greater efficiency that results in lower energy costs for everyone, and foster economic opportunities in our rural communities.

Energy diversification mirrors a sound investment portfolio. Just as diverse assets protect against market volatility, multiple energy sources safeguard against physical and cyber threats. In addition, if we’re manufacturing these technologies here in South Carolina, we are securing our energy independence by growing our ability to produce what we need at home and having greater control over our supply chain.

Businesses have planned with these tax incentives in mind and rely upon them for capital allocation, planning, and project commitments — all of which would be threatened by the whiplash of major changes to these credits or further restrictions.

We’ve already seen a taste of what this disruption can do.

Recent federal changes and uncertainty have led to an indefinite pause in the construction of the AESC manufacturing facility in Florence, a $1.6 billion investment that promised to create 1,600 jobs in the Pee Dee.

A full repeal of these vital credits would undermine significant progress made in clean energy innovation, economic growth, and national security, and likely cede jobs and progress to China.

Now it’s up to our elected officials on Capitol Hill to decide whether these clean energy tax credits continue as Congress intended in 2022.

These private and public investments will spur domestic production of clean energy technologies which will set the United States up to compete in the global clean energy economy and create thousands more in clean energy jobs that will benefit all South Carolinians.

South Carolina businesses are ready to build — ready to invest in local workers, modern energy systems, and secure supply chains. But we need policy certainty to stay competitive.

Keeping these energy tax credits will empower American enterprise, protect ratepayers, and secure South Carolina’s leadership in 21st-century manufacturing.

Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) quickly said that wind energy is a key energy source in his state — and cheap.
“Iowans get 60% of their electricity frm wind energy It’s an important tool for America’s energy independence &2 keep Iowans’ utility bills low,” he posted on X. Grassley, who is even older than Trump, has been a champion of wind energy since he pushed legislation incentivizing wind energy in 1993.
When we get energy down, you know … this was caused by their horrible energy — wind.
You tell me that one, OK?” “I hate wind,” Trump reportedly said at Mar-A-Lago last year.
Trending Stories Trump’s attitude toward wind energy has had a palpable effect in the industry, E&E News reported.","President Donald Trump is ranting about wind power again, and a top Republican lawmaker is pushing back.

“Windmills, and the rest of this ‘JUNK,’ are the most expensive and inefficient energy in the world, is destroying the beauty of the environment, and is 10 times more costly than any other energy,” Trump posted on Truth Social. He added that renewables are mostly made in China. “It is time to break away, finally, from this craziness!!!” he wrote.

Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) quickly said that wind energy is a key energy source in his state — and cheap. “Iowans get 60% of their electricity frm wind energy It’s an important tool for America’s energy independence &2 keep Iowans’ utility bills low,” he posted on X.

Grassley, who is even older than Trump, has been a champion of wind energy since he pushed legislation incentivizing wind energy in 1993.

As Senate Judiciary Chair, Grassley plays a key role in advancing Trump’s agenda in Congress. Republicans hold a 53-47 majority in the upper chamber.

Grassley also pushed back on Trump in April when the president called windmills “stupid” at a rally in Michigan. “I like to tell him, when he talks about wind energy killing birds, there are more birds that fly into the glass towers in Washington, D.C., including his, that kill more birds than wind energy does,” Grassley told Iowa station KCCI.

Despite Trump’s claims that windmills and other renewable energy sources are expensive, in real life, wind energy is a cheap source of power. Both wind and solar energy cost less than fossil fuels. Any increased prices are likely due to inflation.

Wind energy seems to occupy a lot of space in Trump’s mind. At a campaign event in Wisconsin last year, Trump appears to have said people aren’t eating bacon because wind energy is expensive.

“You take a look at bacon and some of these products — and some people don’t eat bacon any more,” Trump said. “We are going to get the energy prices down. When we get energy down, you know … this was caused by their horrible energy — wind. They want wind all over the place. But when it doesn’t blow, we have a little problem.”

Editor’s picks

In 2019, Trump claimed at a speech to the National Republican Congressional Committee that the noise from windmills causes cancer. “If you have a windmill anywhere near your house, congratulations, your house just went down 75 percent in value. And they say the noise causes cancer. You tell me that one, OK?”

“I hate wind,” Trump reportedly said at Mar-A-Lago last year.

At a rally last year in New Jersey, Trump made the false claim that aquatic wind turbines “cause tremendous problems with the fish and the whales.” He then compared a dead beached whale to former New Jersey Governor Chris Christie.

In 2023, he claimed windmills are driving whales “crazy” and killing them. According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, there is “no scientific evidence” that windmills are killing whales.

“The windmills are killing our country by the way,” Trump said earlier this month. He called them “the greatest scam in history. It’s the most expensive energy you can buy. They’re ugly.”

On Trump’s first day in office, he issued an executive order halting wind energy projects. More than a dozen attorneys general then sued the administration over the executive order. The Trump administration moved to dismiss the suit. Then, earlier this week, a judge said he plans to deny that motion, allowing the case to proceed.

State Rep. John Resman, an Olathe Republican, represents a district near the Panasonic plant.","Slumping Tesla sales, uncertainty around auto tariffs and proposed cuts to electric vehicle incentives could have serious implications for the new $4 billion Panasonic factory in De Soto, Kansas.

The sprawling complex is being built to make batteries for electric vehicles — specifically Teslas and other brands. As the factory nears completion, industry observers are watching worrisome changes in the market.

“There is cause for concern,” said John Higham, vice president of communications and media outreach for the Electric Vehicle Association.

Kansas lawmakers approved $829 million in tax incentives to lure the plant to the Kansas City suburbs. When the deal was announced in 2023, Panasonic promised as many as 4,000 jobs with an average salary of $50,000.

But the contract the company ultimately signed with Kansas doesn’t have any job or pay requirements. A local incentive deal with De Soto did include hiring quotas, but they are much lower than the number of jobs originally touted.

Critics warned when the deal was signed that the company was not required to follow through on its initial hiring promises. Now, there’s growing concern Panasonic will tap the brakes on hiring amid economic uncertainty.

“Are (jobs) at risk?” Higham said. “The only possible answer that anyone can give you is, yeah, maybe.”

Projections of a slumping EV market

The Beacon spoke with multiple people who said short-term hiring could be at risk, but most added that the Panasonic plant should be secure for the long haul. The company has already made substantial investments and the plant will ramp up production over a period of years.

Even so, there are several signs the EV market may not meet expectations in the coming years.

Notably, first-quarter revenue at Tesla was down 9% and net income was down 71%.

“Uncertainty in the automotive and energy markets continues to increase as rapidly evolving trade policy adversely impacts the global supply chain and cost structure of Tesla and our peers,” the company said in an earnings presentation. “This dynamic, along with changing political sentiment, could have a meaningful impact on demand for our products in the near-term.”

The company’s reference to “changing political sentiment” was widely seen as an acknowledgement of the impact of Tesla CEO Elon Musk’s high-profile relationship with President Donald Trump, and a backlash from prospective customers who might otherwise buy the company’s vehicles.

Tesla sales dropped for the fifth straight month in Italy, Germany and Britain in May. In Britain, Tesla sales dropped 45% in May. Fewer U.S. customers are buying Teslas as well.

Tesla’s poor sales results come amid federal proposals that would discourage people from buying electric vehicles. Notably, Trump wants to eliminate the $7,500 tax credit that makes EVs cheaper.

A Harvard University study projects that future EV sales will fall if the tax credit goes away. Under existing law, EV sales could be 48% of new car sales by 2030. But that would drop to 42% of the market if the tax credit disappears. In the most extreme scenario, Harvard economists said EVs could plunge to 32% of new car sales by 2030.

There’s also federal legislation proposing to charge EV owners an additional $250 annually. Hybrid car owners would be charged an additional $100 annually.

That comes in addition to a pause on spending $3 billion to build new charging stations. Finally, there is ongoing uncertainty around tariffs — which can make batteries with foreign components more expensive to produce.

“It’s a … shame that the current administration has politicized it to the point that they’re ready to decimate this part of auto manufacturing … for political points,” Higham said.

Businesses rely on regulatory certainty to make plans, Higham said. Right now, he said fears of a recession and cuts at the federal level create uncertainty, “and businesses are going to respond to that with fear and trepidation.”

That means fewer capital investments and slower hiring, he said.

Joshua Jefferson, deputy secretary of business development with the Kansas Department of Commerce, said that Panasonic has diversified its battery offerings in response to the evolving market. The plant was initially touted as a Tesla and Toyota manufacturing plant. Now the company makes batteries for Lucid, Hexagon Purus and Harbinger Motors.

What can Kansas do?

The Kansas City Star reported in 2022 that the state’s contract with Panasonic didn’t include job and pay requirements. But Panasonic has things it needs to do to get more than $800 million in state-approved tax incentives:

Spend $4 billion on the factory to get an estimated $500 million in incentives, by far the largest requirement for taxpayer dollars.

Stay in Kansas for at least 15 years.

Have an annual payroll of $234 million. It’ll then get $234 million in rebates over 10 years.

The Star reported in 2022 that Panasonic promised up to 4,000 jobs but refused to answer questions about an exact number of openings and pay. The De Soto City Council offered an estimated $229 million in tax-increment financing incentives if the company hired 2,500 full-time employees and invested $1 billion.

Panasonic has hired 660 people so far, Jefferson said. The company is planning a grand opening event on July 14, and Jefferson said the 660 figure is about right for a factory that hasn’t made a single battery.

Jefferson emphasized that these incentives are only given if Panasonic invests in Kansas and hires locally. He also noted that the incentives aren’t handed out in one big chunk. It’ll take years for every dollar to be awarded.

Jefferson said the investment is already paying off — De Soto was able to lower its taxes because of the additional sales tax brought in during the plant’s construction.

He stands by the contract the state signed.

“If we would have changed one thing in this package,” Jefferson said, “the deal would have gone somewhere else … These types of deals unfold in a very real, intentional way.”

Greg LeRoy, executive director of Good Jobs First, has been sounding the alarm for years about what he sees as a poorly written contract.

LeRoy said if he could, he’d go back in time and tell Kansas to make the agreement all about jobs. He wants Panasonic to only get the taxpayer dollars if they hired enough people with good benefits at full-time hours and local hiring preferences and apprenticeship training programs.

The contract does require an average salary at the plant, but averages are not the perfect measure.

“Performance-based incentives just make more sense,” LeRoy said. “They’re more precise, they’re more calibrated, they’re more politically feasible.”

Reasons for optimism

As for Tesla, Musk said the EV market will turn around.

“I encourage people to look beyond the bumps and potholes of the road immediately ahead of us,” Musk said to Axios. “Lift your gaze to the bright shining citadel on the hill — I don’t know, some Reaganesque imagery — and that’s where we’re headed.”

Panasonic, which is in line to receive billions of dollars in federal tax incentives by 2032, declined interview requests for this story.

A February presentation from the company said it is harder to make money on battery sales because the EV market growth is slow, but battery development remains a top priority.

Top Panasonic officials did answer questions about U.S. tariffs and the De Soto plant during a recent investor call.

Yuki Kusumi, CEO of Panasonic, said he expects difficulties manufacturing batteries using Chinese components in American factories, but there’s no major financial concern.

There’s been no significant slowdown in demand, Kusumi said. Panasonic estimates U.S. tariffs will cost the company’s energy segment $540 million, but that’s just 1% of group sales.

The company’s larger concern is a potential recession that will discourage buying electric vehicles. Panasonic’s investor presentation said sales will pick up because of more affordable vehicles.

The Toyota Corolla Hybrid and Prius are both on the more affordable end. But Teslas are not affordable for working-class Americans, said economist Chris Kuehl.

Kuehl said that a few things are working against Tesla sales and EV sales.

Owning a Tesla signals certain political opinions that can scare off some customers. There are also concerns about the range of EVs and ability to find charging stations.

But the Panasonic plant doesn’t have to tie itself to Tesla forever. Both Kuehl and Higham said the factory could pivot to make batteries for other cars, energy storage devices or something else.

State Rep. John Resman, an Olathe Republican, represents a district near the Panasonic plant. He said the plant will create a strong workforce in the long run. Panasonic is a multinational corporation that can attract other businesses to the area. That’ll help.

And projected EV sales may drop in the short term, but not forever.

“EVs are not going away,” Resman said. “Every day you read about companies that have expanded the amount of miles that batteries can take a car, and they can recharge even quicker now than they have in the past. So the technology is there.”",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/ddf04f4/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1200x630+0+23/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fthebeaconnews.org%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2025%2F03%2FUntitled-design-2.png,N,,2025-06-22 02:01:25.203168

SB 1420 aims to incentivize clean hydrogen projects and renewable energy projects by making more qualifying projects eligible for permit streamlining benefits, expedited review under the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA), and expedited judicial review of CEQA challenges.","The first quarter of 2025 has been marked by a turbulent transition between presidential administrations as indicated by regulatory course reversals, and clean energy regulations have been no exception. On January 20, 2025, President Trump issued an executive order entitled Unleashing American Energy, which instructed federal agencies to immediately pause disbursement of funds provided by the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 and the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act and to submit a report to the Director of the National Economic Council analyzing its consistency with the order, which included funds set aside for clean energy projects. In the wake of the executive order, there is a widespread sense of uncertainty in the regulatory future of the clean energy industry under the current administration.

Amidst federal backstepping on clean energy, the state of California remains committed to promoting a clean energy transition. California has set ambitious greenhouse gas emissions reduction goals with the overarching goal to shift away from reliance on fossil fuels and towards increased reliance on renewable energy resources. Specifically, California has a goal of cutting greenhouse gas emissions by 48% below 1990 levels by 2030 and 85% below 1990 levels by 2045. Progress towards these decarbonization goals on the state level will require the passage of new laws to incentivize renewable energy projects, encourage research into the viability of cleaner sources of energy, and promote a just transition. One source of energy that has become increasingly prominent is hydrogen, particularly green hydrogen, which is the process by which hydrogen is produced by using renewable energy sources to drive the electrolysis process by which water is broken down into its component parts — hydrogen and oxygen.

Senate Bill (SB) 1420 (Caballero) is a relatively new state law, which Governor Newsom signed into law on September 25, 2024, intended to incentivize green hydrogen projects. The bill was introduced by Senator Anna Caballero during the 2024 Legislative Session. Senator Caballero is currently serving her second term representing the 14th State Senate district, which includes the majority of Merced, Madera, and Fresno Counties. Senator Caballero also serves as the Chair of the Appropriations Committee and a member of the Housing, Public Safety, Insurance, Judiciary, Energy, Utilities, and Communications Committee. SB 1420 aims to incentivize clean hydrogen projects and renewable energy projects by making more qualifying projects eligible for permit streamlining benefits, expedited review under the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA), and expedited judicial review of CEQA challenges.

The bill adds qualifying hydrogen projects as eligible for centralized permitting by the California Energy Commission (CEC) under its Opt-In Certification Program by expanding the definition of a “facility” to include qualifying hydrogen production or storage and processing facilities.

The bill makes more qualifying hydrogen projects eligible for expedited judicial review of CEQA litigation by expanding the definition of “energy infrastructure project” as defined in the Public Resources Code in two significant ways. First, SB 1420 expands the definition of “energy infrastructure project” by excluding “resources that combust biomass fuels” rather than all “resources that use biomass fuels.” Second, SB 1420 extends the definition of “energy infrastructure project” to include qualifying hydrogen production facilities and associated storage and processing facilities among the projects eligible for expedited review under CEQA. Prior to this bill, all “projects utilizing hydrogen as a fuel” were specifically excluded.

Under SB 1420, to qualify for expedited judicial review or the centralized permitting under the CEC Opt-In Certification Program, the hydrogen production or storage and processing facility must meet the following two criteria: the Facility must “not derive hydrogen from a fossil fuel stock” and the Project must have received funding from a listed funding source. The first requirement reflects the fact that the overall environmental impact of hydrogen as an energy source largely depends on the source of energy that drives its production. Modern technological advancements have led to the development of production processes that utilize renewable resources — instead of fossil fuels — in the hydrogen production process.

The second requirement is that the project must have received funding from one of the following three sources: (1) the state-funded Hydrogen Program under Public Resources Code Section 25664.1; (2) the 2024 climate bond approved by voters in the November 2024 election; or (3) the Alliance for Renewable Clean Hydrogen Energy Systems (ARCHES) as awarded by the United States Department of Energy (DOE).

The latter of these funding sources has been in the news and is, as of the date of this article, in jeopardy as the current administration reconsiders funding awarded by the prior administration. In 2022, the federal government passed the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, which set aside $7 billion in funding for the creation of the Regional Clean Hydrogen Hubs Program (H2Hubs) to be awarded by the DOE. The purpose of the program funding was to encourage the creation of regional clean hydrogen hubs to create a national network that will ultimately lead to the formation of a national hydrogen economy. The California Hydrogen Hub, which proposed various hydrogen projects across the state, was among the projects selected to receive the H2Hubs designation and a $1.2 billion slice of the federal funding. On March 26, 2025, Politico reported that a list circulating within the DOE indicates that the California Hydrogen Hub is among the four H2Hubs that may face funding cuts related to the President’s executive order.

FORWARD LOOKING: PENDING BILLS IN THE 2025 LEGISLATIVE SESSION

AB 35 (Alvarez) would allow for limited CEQA review of an application for a discretionary permit or authorization for a clean hydrogen transportation project, which is defined as “a pipeline project composed of a system that transports hydrogen, and any associated facilities necessary for the system’s operation,” that meets stated criteria in the bill. The limited CEQA review involves completing a clean hydrogen environmental assessment rather than a full environmental impact report or mitigated negative declaration as is typically required by CEQA. The bill would also expedite the review process by requiring that the lead agency make its determination about whether to approve the clean hydrogen environmental assessment and issue the discretionary permit or authorization within 270 days of when the application is deemed complete. AB 35 has becme a two-year bill and will be re-considered by the Legislature in 2026.

SB 88 (Caballero) would require the State Energy Resources Conservation and Development Commission to consider the potential of using biomass to produce low and negative carbon fuels, including hydrogen, in its reports and documents.

SB 714 (Archuletta) would state the intent of the Legislature to enact legislation to establish a Clean Energy Workforce Training Council to analyze the workforce and infrastructure needs as well as the needs of hydrogen and other clean energy technologies and a Zero-Emission Vehicle Workforce Development Pilot Project for use at community colleges. These programs would be under the purview of the Deputy Secretary for Climate within the Labor and Workforce Development Agency. SB 714 has become a two-year bill and will be re-considered by the Legislature in 2026.",https://natlawreview.com/sites/default/files/styles/article_image/public/2025-06/California%20folded%20map%20graphic_0.jpg?h=9ccdcaa6&itok=UGN4Eiaq,N,,2025-06-22 00:00:19.324821

The concept of the “last mile” in logistics highlights the final stage of delivery, where goods are transported from a distribution hub to their ultimate destination. This phase is increasingly recognized as a critical component for wholesale distributors, as it directly impacts customer satisfaction and operational efficiency. The term encapsulates the challenges and complexities involved in ensuring timely and accurate deliveries, particularly in an era where consumer expectations for speed and reliability continue to rise.

Industry experts emphasize that optimizing the last mile is essential for maintaining competitiveness in wholesale distribution. Factors such as route planning, technology integration, and real-time tracking play pivotal roles in addressing logistical hurdles during this stage. Additionally, distributors face growing pressure to balance cost-effectiveness with environmental sustainability, often requiring innovative solutions like electric vehicles or advanced software systems to streamline operations. As businesses adapt to these demands, the focus on improving last-mile delivery remains central to meeting market needs effectively.

But PHEVs are not the same, and as I’ve written, their limited EV range has held them back.","The U.S. market has seen Extended Range Electric Vehicles (EREVs) before. The BMW i3 was technically the first, though many consider the Chevy Volt the pioneer of the general concept. That concept being: You drive in electric mode until the battery dies, then a gas engine-generator charges the battery so you can go farther. But despite these two having existed in the U.S. market, we still have no idea how America is going to react to EREVs, which is wild to think about given that yet another automaker is looking to head that route according to a new report.

I was recently on a call with Bank of America’s senior analyst John Murphy, who was explaining to a group of journalists the contents of the company’s latest annual “Car Wars” market report. At the end of the call, I asked Murphy what his thoughts are on EREVs. Here’s what he replied:

“I think it’s an odd setup for a powertrain. I certainly think in some use cases — pickups and large SUVs, but in general I don’t think it’s going to become that pervasive.”

I’m not saying I think Murphy is wrong, but it seems to me that, at this point, it’s hard to know what’s going to happen. To be completely fair, I wrote “The Future Of The Auto Industry Is Electric, With A Gasoline Backup,” so I, too, am making guesses about how well the technology will do, but I have to admit that I just don’t know for sure.

What I do know is that the technology is awesome to live with day-to-day; I’ve been driving a BMW i3 Range Extender for years now, and it’s simply amazing. The reality is that America’s EV infrastructure isn’t good enough, and that people don’t want low-range EVs. As Murphy said on the all “[EV Range anxiety] is very real.” A Range Extender is a way to solve both problems without jamming a heavy, expensive battery under the floor.

I’m not the only one saying this; lots of automakers are heading down the EREV path. And I mean lots. Ford, Hyundai, Volkswagen, Jeep, Lotus, Scout, Ram and now BMW have indicated interest in bringing EREV technology to the marketplace.

I say “now” BMW, because there’s a new report from Automobilewoche that states that BMW — once the authority when it came to EREVs – has changed its mind on EREVs. From Automotive News:

BMW plans to revive its range extender technology, starting with a variant of the iX5 SUV, which is already in testing and could arrive in 2026, according to a report in Automotive News Europe sibling publication Automobilwoche.

The news signals a shift for BMW. In 2019 a leading executive was quoted as saying that there was “no future” for range extenders.

The comment came as BMW was looking to shift beyond its i3, which was offered as either a full-electric model or with a range extender in the early days of the transition to vehicles powered only by electricity. The aim of offering the system was to ease range anxiety.

The world watches as the Ram Ramcharger is expected to become the first EREV to enter the U.S. market since the BMW i3 bowed out in 2021. But the question is: How will it fare?

The BMW i3 and Chevy Volt were both relatively slow sellers, but we really shouldn’t draw any conclusions from that. Not only were these two vehicles part of a market segment that America just doesn’t care about anymore (small cars), but because they’re small cars they don’t really stand to benefit as much from EREV technology. Let’s be honest: The Volt and i3 would have probably been 40 MPG cars had they been powered solely by gas.

But as Murphy mentioned: Trucks and SUVs are a different ballgame. Getting an 18 MPG pickup truck to drive on electric power while offering significantly improved acceleration, plus plenty of range for towing — that’s a massive improvement for the buyer.

But at what cost?

That’s really the big question here. If I can buy a gasoline SUV for $40 grand, and — especially if EV tax credits go away as it seems they might — I have to spend $60 grand for an equivalent EREV, what’s the value to me as a consumer? Gasoline is fairly cheap, so it could take over a decade to make up $20 grand in fuel costs. Maintenance costs will help fill the gap, but it’ll take time, and I’m not sure any consumers think that far out. They want the car to bring them value now.

EREVs do promise to offer a cost advantage over full BEVs with similar capabilities (particularly in truck/SUV applications), so I can absolutely see them appealing to those who are already on the fence about buying a BEV. But will automakers actually price them below BEVs? I spoke with a Ram representative who said it’s possible they will price their EREV higher because technically it offers more performance than the BEV (basically, an EREV truck offers EV acceleration with gasoline truck-range: The best of all worlds — with maintenance being significantly less than a regular gas truck). I think not leveraging EV’s potential cost-savings over a BEV would be a mistake.

Then there’s the whole marketing element. EV diehards think EREVs are bad simply because they involve some amount of reliance on gasoline, and gasoline diehards basically just see EREVs as EVs (so many folks in the comments of Scout’s EREV social media posts say “This is cool, but too bad it’s electric!”). It will be challenging to solve that. Add to that the fact that “EREV” is just not sexy at all, and you’ve got a product with an uphill marketing battle. I’ve written about this before:

The term “EREV” needs to be out of the equation. It’s a jargon-y term, and it will not resonate with the public. I won’t pretend to know what the answer is exactly, but I’ve come up with a few fun terms. “Long-range plug-in hybrid” is one option. “Gasoline-Assisted EV” is another. The common thread between these two is: I don’t think shying away from the fact that gasoline is involved is the move. I think many people find comfort in gasoline propulsion, and using a name that implies there’s gasoline is a good thing.

We can look at the success of EREVs in China, but I don’t think we really have a great analog right now that helps us understand how EREVs are going to do stateside. Maybe we can look at plug-in hybrids? But PHEVs are not the same, and as I’ve written, their limited EV range has held them back. Toyota is still heading down the PHEV path, but it’s planning to crank up the range, per CNBC:

“We are going to grow our PHEV volume through the lineup over the next few years,” David Christ, head of the Toyota brand in North America, told CNBC during a visit to the company’s North American headquarters. “We love the PHEV powertrain. We’re working to increase, perpetually increase, the amount of miles you can drive on EV-only range.”

Company sources said Toyota plans to increase PHEVs from 2.4% of its U.S. sales volume last year to roughly 20% by 2030. However, they said that could change based on regulations, customer acceptance of electrified technologies and affordability, among other factors.

Toyota has been right about a lot of things, so I could see higher-range PHEVs catching on, and if so, I could see EREVs doing the same (note that the path to higher-range PHEVs is one that automakers, including Toyota, are traveling carefully). But there are just so many factors in play — fuel prices, EV incentives, marketing, product execution, infrastructure developments, MSRPs and on and on.

With so many factors in play, it just makes it that much more important for automakers to make a great product. Build an excellent vehicle that meets customers’ needs and exceeds their expectations, at a price that they feel is competitive with vehicles that offer similar performance, and I believe it will sell. All this potential confusion about how EREVs work and infrastructure implications and EV incentives and cost savings over gas cars and on and on can largely be thrown out the window if you can get the world to think your vehicle is extremely badass and a good value.

I’m rooting for EREVs solely because I want others to experience the unmatched combination of EV performance and gasoline convenience that I get to enjoy everyday while driving my BMW i3. But in truth, I don’t know how it’s going to shake out; I don’t think anyone really knows at this point.

The Senate bill doesn’t include such a provision.
The Senate bill excludes the proposed fees.","WASHINGTON (AP) — House and Senate Republicans are taking slightly different approaches when it comes to the tax cuts that lawmakers are looking to include in their massive tax and spending cuts bill.

Republicans in the two chambers don’t agree on the size of a deduction for state and local taxes. And they are at odds on such things as allowing people to use their health savings accounts to help pay for their gym membership, or whether electric vehicle and hybrid owners should have to pay an annual fee.

The House passed its version shortly before Memorial Day. Now the Senate is looking to pass its version.

While the two bills are similar on the major tax provisions, how they work out their differences in the coming weeks will determine how quickly they can get a final product over the finish line. President Donald Trump is pushing to have the legislation on his desk by July 4th.

Here’s a look at some of the key differences between the two bills:

Tax break for families

The child tax credit currently stands at $2,000 per child.

The House bill temporarily boosts the child tax credit to $2,500 for the 2025 through 2028 tax years, roughly the length of President Donald Trump’s second term. It also indexes the credit amount for inflation beginning in 2027.

The Senate bill provides a smaller, initial bump-up to $2,200, but the bump is permanent, with the credit amount indexed for inflation beginning next year.

Trump campaign promises

Trump promised on the campaign trail that he would seek to end income taxes on tips, overtime and Social Security benefits. Also, he would give car buyers a new tax break by allowing them to deduct the interest paid on auto loans.

The House and Senate bills incorporate those promises with temporary deductions lasting from the 2025 through 2028 tax years, but with some differences.

The House bill creates a deduction on tips for those working in jobs that have customarily received tips. The House also provides for a deduction for overtime that’s equal to the amount of OT a worker has earned.

The Senate bill comes with more restrictions. The deduction for tips is limited to $25,000 per taxpayer and the deduction for overtime is limited to $12,500 per taxpayer.

The House and Senate bills both provide a deduction of up to $10,000 for interest paid on loans for vehicles made in the United States.

And on Social Security, the bills don’t directly touch the program. Instead, they grant a larger tax deduction for Americans age 65 and older. The House sets the deduction at $4,000. The Senate sets it at $6,000.

Both chambers include income limits over which the new deductions begin to phase out.

More SALT

The caps on state and local tax deductions, known in Washington as the SALT cap, now stand at $10,000.

The House bill, in a bid to win over Republicans from New York, California and New Jersey, lifts the cap to $40,000 per household with incomes of less than $500,000. The credit phases down for households earning more than $500,000.

The Senate bill keeps the cap at $10,000. That’s a non-starter in the House, but Republicans in the two chambers will look to negotiate a final number over the coming weeks that both sides can accept.

Medicaid providers

The House bill prohibits states from establishing new provider taxes or increasing existing taxes. These are taxes that Medicaid providers, such as hospitals, pay to help states finance their share of Medicaid costs. In turn, the taxes allow states to receive increased federal matching funds while generally holding providers harmless through higher reimbursements that offset the taxes paid.

Such taxes now are effectively capped at 6%. The Senate looks to gradually lower that threshold for states that have expanded their Medicaid populations under the Affordable Care Act, or “Obamacare,” until it reaches 3.5% in 2031, with exceptions for nursing homes and intermediate care facilities.

Industry groups have warned that limiting the ability of states to tax providers may lead to some states making significant cuts to their Medicaid programs as they make up for the lost revenue in other ways. The Medicaid provision could be a flashpoint in the coming House and Senate negotiations. Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., was highly critical of the proposed Senate changes.

“This needs a lot of work. It’s really concerning and I’m really surprised by it,” he said. “Rural hospitals are going to be in bad shape.”

Tax breaks for business

The House bill would allow companies for five years to fully deduct equipment purchases and domestic research and development expenses. The Senate bill includes no sunset, making the tax breaks permanent, which was a key priority of powerful trade groups such as the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.

Clean energy tax credits

Republicans in both chambers are looking to scale back the clean energy tax credits enacted through then-President Joe Biden’s climate law. It aimed to boost the nation’s transition away from planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions toward renewable energy such as wind and solar power.

Under the Senate bill, the tax credits for clean energy and home energy efficiency would still be phased out, but less quickly than under the House bill. Still, advocacy groups fear that the final measure will threaten hundreds of thousands of jobs and drive up household energy costs.

Odds and ends

The House bill would allow millions of Americans to use their health savings accounts to pay for gym memberships, with a cap of $500 for single taxpayers and $1,000 for joint filers. The Senate bill doesn’t include such a provision.

The House reinstates a charitable deduction for non-itemizers of $150 per taxpayer. The Senate bill increases that deduction for donations to $1,000 per taxpayer.

Republicans in the House bill included a new annual fee of $250 for EV owners and $100 for hybrid owners that would be collected by state motor vehicle departments. The Senate bill excludes the proposed fees.

Why build gas plants that may rarely run when cheaper, cleaner, and domestically produced solar energy is so readily available?
China’s recent experience during periods of high global gas prices when gas plants simply shut down due to fuel costs further underscores this fundamental weakness.","Last Updated on:

In recent remarks, John Ketchum, CEO of NextEra Energy, laid out a curious and somewhat baffling narrative: renewables should serve as a transition solution toward expanding natural gas generation. Yes, you read that correctly. After decades of framing gas as a so-called “bridge fuel” to a renewable future, the argument has seemingly flipped on its head. We are now being asked to consider the most rapidly deployable, clean, cost-effective energy sources — wind, solar, and storage — as nothing more than a stopgap solution until we can build more expensive, slower-to-deploy fossil-fuel infrastructure. This logic would be amusing if it weren’t deeply troubling.

“We need a bridge to get ourselves to 2032 when that gas shows up,” Ketchum said. “And when that gas shows up, it’s going to be three times more expensive than it’s ever been.

In his defence, Ketchum’s comments came during the Politico Energy Summit in Washington, D.C., in June 2025, where he was responding to mounting political pressure from Republican-led efforts to roll back clean energy incentives and reinstate fossil fuels as the backbone of U.S. electricity policy. Speaking to an audience of policymakers and industry leaders, Ketchum was not advocating for gas over renewables per se, but rather highlighting that America needs new electricity in the next couple of years, not in the 2030s.

With electricity demand rising rapidly — driven by AI data centers, electric vehicles, and broader electrification — he argued that solar, wind, and storage are the only technologies capable of being deployed quickly enough to avoid reliability crises. While the framing was clumsy and widely criticized, his intent was to underscore that the real constraint isn’t ideology but timeline. Renewables are the only tools fast enough to respond to near-term demand.

So what’s going on with America’s ‘cheap’ gas generation. Right now, gas turbines face extended delivery times, often ranging from five to seven years due to global manufacturing backlogs. This may seem puzzling given that global gas demand growth is sluggish or declining in many key markets.

The primary driver of these delays isn’t surging worldwide demand for new plants, but rather a combination of limited manufacturing capacity, aging production infrastructure, and supply chain disruptions still lingering from the COVID-19 pandemic and geopolitical tensions. Many turbine manufacturers reduced or consolidated their production capabilities in the past decade, anticipating a market shift toward renewables. The remaining factories operate at reduced throughput, struggling with workforce shortages, supply bottlenecks, and rising costs for critical materials. Ironically, this manufacturing crunch is partly the consequence of the market’s long-term move away from gas.

By contrast, large-scale solar installations and substantial battery storage facilities regularly come online in under two years. In essence, by the time your ordered gas turbine is finally delivered, permitted, constructed, and connected to the grid, the solar facility built simultaneously would have been generating electricity and revenue for several years. Investing in gas infrastructure under these conditions is akin to choosing dial-up internet service in an era of fiber optics: it might technically work, but the opportunity cost is enormous and the rationale dubious at best.

A closer look at the economics underscores the questionable logic behind new gas projects. Even in the historically gas-friendly U.S. market, renewable power and battery storage consistently offer lower levelized costs than new gas-fired plants. Lazard’s latest analysis shows utility-scale solar and wind projects frequently coming in well under the cost of combined-cycle gas generation. Beyond cost, renewables offer price certainty. Gas prices, on the other hand, remain volatile, swinging with global geopolitical events and commodity markets. Locking consumers and investors into this volatility seems not just financially imprudent, but borderline reckless.

The cost of new gas turbines has climbed sharply in recent years, compounding the case against new gas-fired generation. While solar panels and battery packs continue to decline in cost thanks to manufacturing scale and technological improvements, gas turbine prices have moved in the opposite direction. Supply chain disruptions, inflation in materials like steel and rare alloys, and constrained manufacturing capacity have pushed up the price of large turbines by up to 2.5 times what they were a few years ago.

What used to be a relatively economical technology for bulk power is now burdened with capital costs that often exceed $2,000 per kilowatt for combined-cycle installations. These increases make it harder for gas plants to compete with renewables on levelized cost of electricity, especially as storage fills in the flexibility role once held exclusively by gas. The notion that we should wait several years and pay a premium for a technology that is slower, dirtier, and more expensive than the alternatives already scaling today defies both logic and economics.

The rationale further crumbles when we examine headwinds for new gas generation region by region. In the United States, despite recent rollbacks by the Trump administration of EPA’s carbon capture requirements, gas plants still face significant resistance. Many states have adopted aggressive climate targets that implicitly or explicitly discourage new fossil fuel investment. Additionally, social license issues are intensifying. Communities and environmental advocacy groups routinely oppose new gas infrastructure, using litigation and public campaigns to stall or halt projects. Banks and institutional investors are likewise wary of backing gas plants due to increasing pressure from ESG (environmental, social, and governance) criteria, effectively choking off capital for gas development.

Europe is even less hospitable to new gas investment. With carbon prices under the EU Emissions Trading System hovering around €90 per ton, gas plants incur significant financial penalties merely for operating. Even without a formal ban, this carbon tax significantly diminishes the economic viability of gas generation compared to zero-carbon sources. European Union policies explicitly direct investment toward renewables and storage, creating strong economic disincentives for new gas plants. Germany’s abrupt reversal of its planned gas expansion in 2024 provides a stark example. Despite a perceived near-term need, German policymakers backed away from a major gas investment due to mounting economic risks, policy uncertainties, and vocal public opposition. Building more gas capacity in Europe today increasingly looks like trying to swim upstream against both regulatory currents and market realities.

India’s experience highlights yet another dimension of gas’s inherent drawbacks. High LNG import prices have rendered the majority of India’s existing gas power fleet uneconomic and idle. Utilization rates have plummeted to historically low levels, often hovering below 15%. With abundant and affordable solar power rapidly expanding across India, policymakers increasingly see little reason to prioritize gas. Plans for future gas capacity additions are minimal at best, as the country leapfrogs directly into large-scale renewable and storage solutions. Why build gas plants that may rarely run when cheaper, cleaner, and domestically produced solar energy is so readily available?

China provides perhaps the clearest illustration of gas generation’s flawed economic logic. Although China continues to add gas-fired capacity at significant scale, most new plants run at extremely low capacity factors. The reason is straightforward: imported gas is expensive, renewables are abundant and increasingly cheap, and coal remains economically preferable in many regions (although China is burning less coal in 2025). Despite official goals to boost gas usage for cleaner urban air, plants often sit largely idle, used only sporadically to meet peak demand. Building gas infrastructure with no clear economic viability, simply as an occasional backup, makes questionable sense when grid-scale battery storage, pumped hydro, and other alternatives can deliver similar peaking services more reliably and economically. China’s recent experience during periods of high global gas prices when gas plants simply shut down due to fuel costs further underscores this fundamental weakness.

At this point, one must pause to ask a very basic question: why exactly would we build more gas plants after deploying extensive renewable infrastructure? The arguments for gas typically emphasize its flexibility, grid reliability, and energy security. Yet battery storage technologies and advanced grid management are rapidly eroding these supposed advantages. Batteries provide instantaneous response and frequency regulation far superior to gas turbines. Storage solutions require no volatile fuel supply chains and produce no direct emissions. The flexibility once cited as gas’s key advantage is quickly becoming irrelevant.

From a climate perspective, expanding gas infrastructure after investing heavily in renewables is even more illogical. The International Energy Agency has explicitly cautioned that meeting global climate goals means halting new fossil fuel infrastructure immediately. Even ignoring emissions, stranded asset risk looms large. With renewables and storage prices continuing to plummet, gas plants built today may become economically obsolete long before their design lifetimes expire. Institutional investors are increasingly aware of this, shifting portfolios away from new gas exposure. Investing in gas now may soon feel like having poured money into coal plants ten years ago, regrettable, costly, and ultimately avoidable.

Viewed in totality, the notion of renewables as a mere stepping stone toward future gas expansion is economically backward and environmentally misguided. It defies common sense. Renewables and storage are not interim solutions, they are already economically superior, technologically viable, and widely deployable options that have reshaped the energy landscape. The question is not whether renewables can bridge us to a gas-dominated future, but rather why anyone would seriously consider reversing progress to revisit fossil fuels at all. It is time to recognize renewables and storage as the destination, not a convenient short term gap filler.",https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/ChatGPT-Image-Jun-21-2025-03_52_00-PM-800x426.png,N,,2025-06-21 22:00:29.079399

Newsweek has reached out the White House via email on Saturday for comment.

Why It Matters

Trump's opposition to green tax credits represents a dramatic shift from renewable energy policies that have driven hundreds of billions in U.S. clean energy investments since 2022 during former President Joe Biden's administration.

Industry analysts warn that eliminating these incentives could cede America's competitive edge in clean technology manufacturing to China, potentially impacting national security and economic competitiveness.

The budget reconciliation bill's passage could fundamentally reshape America's energy landscape and manufacturing priorities.

What To Know

The president specifically targeted wind energy, claiming windmills are ""the most expensive and inefficient energy in the world"" and are ""destroying the beauty of the environment.""

The budget bill, currently moving through the Senate, would extend Trump's first-term tax cuts while eliminating or limiting clean energy incentives. The proposed legislation would phase out tax credits for electric vehicles, home energy efficiency improvements, and wind and solar farm development.

In his post, Trump claimed windmills are ""10 times more costly than any other energy"" and criticized government subsidies supporting renewable projects. However, Department of Energy (DOE) data contradicts these claims, showing wind and solar projects have become more economically competitive than gas, coal, or nuclear facilities.

The International Renewable Energy Agency reported that onshore wind costs fell 68 percent in 2021, with capacity increasing four-fold from 2010 to 2021.

Trump's windmill criticism extends beyond economics to aesthetics and environmental concerns, though his previous claims about turbines killing whales lack scientific evidence. The president has vowed not to subsidize new windmill farms during his second term, stating he doesn't ""want even one built.""

What People Are Saying

President Donald Trump on Truth Social on Saturday: ""I HATE 'GREEN TAX CREDITS' IN THE GREAT, BIG, BEAUTIFUL BILL. They are largely a giant SCAM. I would much prefer that this money be used somewhere else, including reductions. 'Anywhere' would be preferable! Windmills, and the rest of this 'JUNK,' are the most expensive and inefficient energy in the world, is destroying the beauty of the environment, and is 10 times more costly than any other energy.""

He added: ""None of it works without massive government subsidy (energy should NOT NEED SUBSIDY!). Also, it is almost exclusively made in China!!! It is time to break away, finally, from this craziness!!!

Elon Musk, in a post X, reposted his company Tesla Energy's post that warns against ending the energy tax credits in May: ""Abruptly ending the energy tax credits would threaten America's energy independence and the reliability of our grid - we urge the senate to enact legislation with a sensible wind down of 25D and 48e. This will ensure continued speedy deployment of over 60 GW capacity per year to support AI and domestic manufacturing growth.""

Mike Carr, Solar Energy Manufacturers for America, previously told Newsweek: ""A vote for this bill was a vote to close U.S. factories and concede manufacturing jobs of the most important energy resource of the 21st century to China.""

Abigail Ross Hopper, Solar Energy Industries Association, previously told Newsweek: ""If this bill becomes law, America will effectively surrender the AI race to China and communities nationwide will face blackouts.""

What Happens Next?

The Senate will consider the budget reconciliation bill, with clean energy advocates mobilizing opposition to the proposed cuts.

The bill details Trump’s intentions to use these “savings” to assist in making his 2017 tax cuts permanent, while also increasing military spending and supporting his crackdown on immigration. Additionally, Trump’s administration has sought to weaken limits on greenhouse gas emissions to encourage more production of oil, gas, and coal domestically, putting real commitment behind his famous slogan, “drill, baby, drill.”

On Monday, Senate Finance Committee Republicans released their revised version of Trump’s bill, cutting federal money for renewable energy, electric vehicles, and hydrogen fuel, while increasing subsidies for fossil fuels. In reference to the Republican package, Senator Brian Schatz, Democrat of Hawaii, said the bill “will cook the planet and increase prices.” The Senate’s proposal comes two weeks after the House passed its own version of Trump’s bill that would roll back clean energy incentives entirely. It could take several months for the Senate version to pass. Rhodium Group, an independent research firm, says that the proposed legislation will “raise energy costs for American households by as much as 7% in 2035, stifle energy technology innovation, increase pollution, and could put a meaningful portion of half a trillion dollars of new manufacturing, industrial, and clean electricity investments across the country at risk.”

Scientists warn that this undoing of policies in the IRA will have detrimental effects on the climate, including an increase in the Earth’s average temperature by up to 3 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels by the end of this century. Last year was the first year in which the global average temperature exceeded 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. That rise is already having major consequences, and is tied to increasingly frequent and extreme weather events, rising sea levels, melting glaciers, and major ecosystem shifts.

The fruit crop losses affect not just growers but also sellers, transporters, and packagers.

What happened?

Besides mango farmers, apple orchard owners face erratic weather patterns disrupting India's agriculture. On June 2, a hailstorm damaged 45-90% of potential apple harvests in at least 12 villages of Shopian district.

Locals said marble- or chickpea-size hail fell during a 15- to 35-minute downpour. ""My sister is getting married next month, and I had pinned all my hopes on this harvest. We are left with nothing,"" one farmer said, per Greater Kashmir.

In a FairPlanet interview, locals said hailstorms have become more common in Kashmir since 2022.

Why are erratic weather patterns concerning?

Rising global temperatures drive unpredictable weather that can wipe out harvests, ruin produce, and put pressure on both farmers and consumers. Meanwhile, lower yields and disruptions in produce storage and transport often lead to higher prices for consumers.

In the United States, producers of various fruits have also experienced weather-related crop failures. These include grapes in California ($272 million in losses), blueberries in Georgia and North Carolina ($49 million and $13 million), and strawberries in Florida ($7 million).

Around the world, extreme weather is affecting food supply chains. In Nepal and Côte d'Ivoire, prolonged drought has put livelihoods, nutrition, and mental health at risk with rising food costs.

Meanwhile, flooding in storm-battered Queensland and New South Wales led to steep hikes in produce prices.

What's being done to support farmers in the aftermath of hailstorms?

Jammu and Kashmir's agriculture minister pledged quick relief for affected Shopian farmers and proposed a weather-based insurance scheme after visiting the region.

However, the Kashmir Valley Fruit Growers Cum Dealers Union has long called for a comprehensive policy. The group wants the government to subsidize nets similar to what farmers use in Spain to protect crops from intense hailstorms.

Some environment-focused companies are monitoring hail events, which have become ""silent threats"" to global agriculture, including Kisters, which developed HailSens IoT for that purpose.

Individuals can support food security by choosing products grown through environmentally friendly farming or weather-resilient food systems that feature smarter irrigation, rotating crops, and planting drought-tolerant seeds.

Also, exploring public transportation options and modernizing homes can help reduce harmful pollution that fuels severe hail events. Staying informed about critical climate issues is another way to manage weather challenges.",https://www.thecooldown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/apple-crop-lossimage-recn3Vla5NyIlI9HC-1.jpg,N,,2025-06-21 21:02:11.108118

In the evening of April 8, more than 11% of Texas electricity was coming from batteries, a record.
Meanwhile, NERC expects batteries to juice roughly one-quarter of California’s peak power demand in coming months.
Rosenow, at Oxford’s Environmental Change Institute, said big batteries are surging and affordable enough that their adoption will steepen quickly.
Trump’s spending plan also threatens to throttle big batteries and green energy projects.","In any other year, May 14 may well have been a disaster in Texas.

Temperatures climbed to seasonal levels not seen in over a century: 92 degrees in Dallas, 95 in Houston and 104 in Laredo. Air conditioners hummed en masse and power demand surged. Meanwhile, scores of natural-gas powered generators were offline, getting tuned up for summer.

But Texas skies were pretty sunny and windy and startups had spent the preceding months building big banks of batteries to store electricity. When power demand peaked around 4:30 in the afternoon, almost half of the electricity on the grid was coming from renewables, according to the energy analytics platform GridStatus.IO. As the sun set, battery banks that had been soaking up electrons in the heat of the day stepped up to cover 8% of demand, keeping power flowing.

“Batteries are very good at handling these types of events,” said Andrew Gilligan, director of commercial strategy at Fluence Energy Inc., a battery developer with three storage sites in Texas. “Things have gotten a lot better than a couple years ago.”

This summer will be an energy doozy in the US as climate change exacerbates heat waves and a rash of new data centers and crypto mines come online. But these new power vacuums arrive in concert with a stack of big batteries. America, particularly its Sun Belt, has been a gusher of renewable energy for years; now, utilities will be able to bottle up much of that sun and wind and discharge it around the clock.

In the 12 months through April – the most recent data available – energy storage in the U.S. surged from roughly 18 gigawatts to 25 gigawatts, a 41% increase, according to a Bloomberg Green analysis of federal data. In Arizona, battery bandwidth nearly tripled; in Texas, it has almost doubled. In the evening of April 8, more than 11% of Texas electricity was coming from batteries, a record.

If the U.S. is able to reach the Biden Administration’s goal of emissions-free electricity by 2035 – or even get close – batteries will be a big reason why. Renewable electricity is setting records every few days and comprised almost one-third of all U.S. power generation in March. Batteries can make sure those electrons hit at the most opportune time – or at least that they don’t go to waste. Along the way, they’ll drag electricity prices down, speed the retirement of fossil fuel plants and preclude plans for new ones, according to Jan Rosenow, head of the energy program at Oxford University’s Environmental Change Institute.

“Twenty years ago, the main problem with renewables was that they were so expensive,” Rosenow saod. “Now, renewables are cheap, but we need to be able to match that supply to demand. For that, battery storage is clearly one of the best tools in the box.”

104 million face outages

Summer is always a fraught time for grids and utilities. Cooling takes more electricity than heating and with a fast-changing climate, Americans are doing it more and more. Annual cooling degree days, an indicator of AC use, have increased 17% compared with the 1990-1999 average, according to BloombergNEF. Last summer was the fourth hottest on record in North America and meteorologists are forecasting a similarly sweaty sequel.

“An increase in heat extremes is the most obvious symptom of climate change,” Karen McKinnon, a professor who studies the statistics behind climate change at UCLA. “Even seemingly small changes in temperatures of a few degrees can make summers feel substantially more extreme.”

As a result, three of the continent’s six major power grids are at risk of power outages this summer, according to the North American Electric Reliability Corp. (NERC), a Washington, D.C.-based nonprofit. All told, 104 million Americans – roughly 1 in 3 – live in areas where extreme heat and rising demand could shut out the lights, though NERC says the risk would be far higher without the new banks of batteries.

In Texas, for example, NERC’s odds of an energy emergency this summer have dropped from roughly 15% a few months ago to 3.6% thanks to battery capacity. Meanwhile, NERC expects batteries to juice roughly one-quarter of California’s peak power demand in coming months.

“Reliability is the ability to react to sudden changes in the grid,” said Chris McKissack, chief executive officer of Fullmark Energy, which is building two storage sites in Texas. “And when it comes to reacting, nothing moves faster than battery storage.”

Homeowners have realized as much, adding their own small battery systems to keep the lights on and avoid time-of-use electric price peaks. Last year, residential storage surged by 64%, systems that also help lower summer demand peaks and stabilize the grid.

Last summer, there were no major power outages in the U.S., a success the Department of Energy primarily attributed to new solar generation and storage.

Officials who run the Texas grid say batteries have also been critical in lowering prices, particularly in the summer. They expect storage in the state to triple over the next five years.

Where solar was

To be sure, it’s still early days for storage. In 2024, it represented just 2% of U.S. power capacity, but that’s ramping quickly. BNEF expects utility-scale battery storage to nearly double again this year regardless of how much the Trump administration manages to dial down green incentives, with some 18 gigawatts of new capacity.

Utilities and developers are building battery stacks because they are often the most affordable way to add capacity, essentially by stretching power generation that’s already built. The average price for stationary storage systems in 2024 was $125 per kWh, 19% lower than in 2023, according to BNEF.

Storage systems are also getting more resilient. A decade ago, industrial batteries generally discharged all of their electrons in 30 minutes or less. Today, the average system can put out energy for four hours straight, and some are tuned for cycles as high as eight hours. This means, they can kick in more frequently and stay on for longer, not just during brief windows in the morning and evening.

Rosenow, at Oxford’s Environmental Change Institute, said big batteries are surging and affordable enough that their adoption will steepen quickly.

“Storage is now where solar was maybe 10 years ago,” Rosenow said. “That’s kind of how it feels to me. It’s really mind-blowing.”

As the battery blitz evolves, Rosenow said, people will pay less for electricity, outages will abate and the largest energy hogs, including AI data centers, will spool up with minimal added emissions. But there are diminishing returns.

Storage systems thrive on being able to sock in electrons when they are cheap and sell them when power prices surge.

As storage capacity ramps up, those arbitrage opportunities narrow. McKissack at Fullmark said battery executives are becoming much more strategic about what they build and where.

“The race for quantity is over,” he said. “At this point, very few of us want to bolster up the number of dots on a map.”

What’s more, recent federal tariffs will likely raise the cost of big battery projects from 12% to 50%, depending on how high the levies go and how long they stay elevated, according to Woods Mackenzie. While American battery factories are booting up, it will be a long time before domestic supply meets even more than a small fraction of U.S. demand, the company says.

Trump’s spending plan also threatens to throttle big batteries and green energy projects. Sabah Bayatli, chief executive officer of solar and battery developer OCI Industries, traveled to Washington, D.C., this week to encourage senators to maintain Inflation Reduction Act incentives or, at the very least, step them down gradually.

“If (the ‘big, beautiful bill’) passes as is, it’s an overnight kill for the solar industry,” he said.

Bayatli may more easily make his case after a summer of heat-wave drama and power outages, but the solar and storage that’s already been built could preclude all that.

McKissack at Fullmark concedes that most people and businesses won’t realize how big of a part renewables and batteries will play in keeping the grid healthy in coming months. Charts of disaster averted because of them aren’t all that powerful, he explained.

“It’s almost easier to talk about when there’s a blackout, but then people’s lives are at risk,” he said.",https://thumb.spokesman.com/BaiTcNJC7D-IGMDNRsKzv1IIgb0=/1200x630/smart/media.spokesman.com/photos/2025/06/21/68574440848aa.hires.jpg,N,,2025-06-21 21:01:35.385480

Republicans in the two chambers don’t agree on the size of a deduction for state and local taxes. And they are at odds on such things as allowing people to use their health savings accounts to help pay for their gym membership, or whether electric vehicle and hybrid owners should have to pay an annual fee.

The House passed its version shortly before Memorial Day. Now the Senate is looking to pass its version.

While the two bills are similar on the major tax provisions, how they work out their differences in the coming weeks will determine how quickly they can get a final product over the finish line. President Donald Trump is pushing to have the legislation on his desk by July 4th.

Here’s a look at some of the key differences between the two bills:

Tax break for families

The child tax credit currently stands at $2,000 per child.

The House bill temporarily boosts the child tax credit to $2,500 for the 2025 through 2028 tax years, roughly the length of President Donald Trump’s second term. It also indexes the credit amount for inflation beginning in 2027.

The Senate bill provides a smaller, initial bump-up to $2,200, but the bump is permanent, with the credit amount indexed for inflation beginning next year.

Trump campaign promises

Trump promised on the campaign trail that he would seek to end income taxes on tips, overtime and Social Security benefits. Also, he would give car buyers a new tax break by allowing them to deduct the interest paid on auto loans.

The House and Senate bills incorporate those promises with temporary deductions lasting from the 2025 through 2028 tax years, but with some differences.

The House bill creates a deduction on tips for those working in jobs that have customarily received tips. The House also provides for a deduction for overtime that’s equal to the amount of OT a worker has earned.

The Senate bill comes with more restrictions. The deduction for tips is limited to $25,000 per taxpayer and the deduction for overtime is limited to $12,500 per taxpayer.

The House and Senate bills both provide a deduction of up to $10,000 for interest paid on loans for vehicles made in the United States.

And on Social Security, the bills don’t directly touch the program. Instead, they grant a larger tax deduction for Americans age 65 and older. The House sets the deduction at $4,000. The Senate sets it at $6,000.

Both chambers include income limits over which the new deductions begin to phase out.

More SALT

The caps on state and local tax deductions, known in Washington as the SALT cap, now stand at $10,000.

The House bill, in a bid to win over Republicans from New York, California and New Jersey, lifts the cap to $40,000 per household with incomes of less than $500,000. The credit phases down for households earning more than $500,000.

The Senate bill keeps the cap at $10,000. That’s a non-starter in the House, but Republicans in the two chambers will look to negotiate a final number over the coming weeks that both sides can accept.

Medicaid providers

The House bill prohibits states from establishing new provider taxes or increasing existing taxes. These are taxes that Medicaid providers, such as hospitals, pay to help states finance their share of Medicaid costs. In turn, the taxes allow states to receive increased federal matching funds while generally holding providers harmless through higher reimbursements that offset the taxes paid.

Such taxes now are effectively capped at 6%. The Senate looks to gradually lower that threshold for states that have expanded their Medicaid populations under the Affordable Care Act, or “Obamacare,” until it reaches 3.5% in 2031, with exceptions for nursing homes and intermediate care facilities.

Industry groups have warned that limiting the ability of states to tax providers may lead to some states making significant cuts to their Medicaid programs as they make up for the lost revenue in other ways. The Medicaid provision could be a flashpoint in the coming House and Senate negotiations. Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., was highly critical of the proposed Senate changes.

“This needs a lot of work. It’s really concerning and I’m really surprised by it,” he said. “Rural hospitals are going to be in bad shape.”

Tax breaks for business

The House bill would allow companies for five years to fully deduct equipment purchases and domestic research and development expenses. The Senate bill includes no sunset, making the tax breaks permanent, which was a key priority of powerful trade groups such as the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.

Clean energy tax credits

Republicans in both chambers are looking to scale back the clean energy tax credits enacted through then-President Joe Biden’s climate law. It aimed to boost the nation’s transition away from planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions toward renewable energy such as wind and solar power.

Under the Senate bill, the tax credits for clean energy and home energy efficiency would still be phased out, but less quickly than under the House bill. Still, advocacy groups fear that the final measure will threaten hundreds of thousands of jobs and drive up household energy costs.

Odds and ends

The House bill would allow millions of Americans to use their health savings accounts to pay for gym memberships, with a cap of $500 for single taxpayers and $1,000 for joint filers. The Senate bill doesn’t include such a provision.

The House reinstates a charitable deduction for non-itemizers of $150 per taxpayer. The Senate bill increases that deduction for donations to $1,000 per taxpayer.

Republicans in the House bill included a new annual fee of $250 for EV owners and $100 for hybrid owners that would be collected by state motor vehicle departments. The Senate bill excludes the proposed fees.

The other thing is that the cost of battery storage is just declining so rapidly and it’s continuing to decline.
Earlier this month, BLM updated the project timeline for another Nevada solar project – EDF’s Bonanza – to say it would come out imminently, too, but nothing’s been released.
For Shaaron Netherton, executive director of the conservation group Friends of the Nevada Wilderness, these solar project permitting delays mean an uncertain future.
I really don’t think Trump’s going to just start saying no to these energy projects.”","How do you approach working in this field given all the macro uncertainties?

It’s a really fair question. One, macro uncertainties aside, when you look at the levelized cost of energy report Lazard releases it is clear that there are forms of clean energy that are by far the cheapest to deploy. There are all kinds of reasons to do decarbonizing projects that aren’t clean energy generation: storage, resiliency, energy efficiency – this is massively cost saving. Like, a lot of the methane industry [exists] because there’s value in not leaking methane. There’s all sorts of stuff you can do that you don’t need policy incentives for.

That said, the policy questions are unavoidable. You can’t really ignore them and I don’t want to say they don’t matter to the industry – they do. It’s just, my belief in this being an investable asset class and incredibly important from a humanity perspective is unwavering. That’s the perspective I’ve been taking. This maybe isn’t going to be the most fun market, investing in decarbonizing things, but the sense of purpose and the belief in the underlying drivers of the industry outweigh that.

With respect to clean energy development, and the investment class working in development, how have things changed since January and the introduction of these bills that would pare back the IRA?

Both investors and companies are worried. There’s a lot more political and policy engagement. We’re seeing a lot of firms and organizations getting involved. I think companies are really trying to find ways to structure around the incentives. Companies and developers, I think everybody is trying to – for lack of a better term – future-proof themselves against the worst eventuality.

One of the things I’ve been personally thinking about is that the way developers generally make money is, you have a financier that’s going to buy a project from them, and the financier is going to have a certain investment rate of return, or IRR. So ITC [investment tax credit] or no ITC, that IRR is going to be the same. And the developer captures the difference.

My guess – and I’m not incredibly confident yet – but I think the industry just focuses on being less ITC dependent. Finding the projects that are juicier regardless of the ITC.

The other thing is that as drafts come out for what we’re expecting to see, it’s gone from bad to terrible to a little bit better. We’ll see what else happens as we see other iterations.

How are you evaluating companies and projects differently today, compared to how you were maybe before it was clear the IRA would be targeted?

Let’s say that we’re looking at a project developer and they have a series of projects. Right now we’re thinking about a few things. First, what assets are these? It’s not all ITC and PTC. A lot of it is other credits. Going through and asking, how at risk are these credits? And then, once we know how at risk those credits are we apply it at a project level.

This also raises a question of whether you’re going to be able to find as many projects. Is there going to be as much demand if you’re not able to get to an IRR? Is the industry going to pay that?

What gives you optimism in this moment?

I’ll just look at the levelized cost of energy and looking at the unsubsidized tables say these are the projects that make sense and will still get built. Utility-scale solar? Really attractive. Some of these next-gen geothermal projects, I think those are going to be cost effective.

The other thing is that the cost of battery storage is just declining so rapidly and it’s continuing to decline. We are as a country expected to compare the current price of these technologies in perpetuity to the current price of oil and gas, which is challenging and where the technologies have not changed materially. So we’re not going to see the cost decline we’re going to see in renewables.

But the biggest indicator of Trump’s thinking on solar out west was Esmeralda 7, a compilation of solar project proposals in western Nevada from NextEra, Invenergy, Arevia, ConnectGen, and other developers that would, if constructed, produce at least 6 gigawatts of power. My colleague Matthew Zeitlin was first to report that BLM officials updated the timetable for fully permitting the expansive project to say it would complete its environmental review by late April and be completely finished with the federal bureaucratic process by mid-July. BLM told Matthew that the final environmental impact statement – the official study completing the environmental review – would be published “in the coming days or week or so.”

More than two months later, it’s crickets from BLM on Esmeralda 7. BLM never released the study that its website as of today still says should’ve come out in late April. I asked BLM for comment on this and a spokesperson simply told me the agency “does not have any updates to share on this project at this time.”

This state of quiet stasis is not unique to Esmeralda; for example, Leeward has yet to receive a final environmental impact statement for its 700 mega-watt Copper Rays solar project in Nevada’s Pahrump Valley that BLM records state was to be published in early May. Earlier this month, BLM updated the project timeline for another Nevada solar project – EDF’s Bonanza – to say it would come out imminently, too, but nothing’s been released.

Delays happen in the federal government and timelines aren’t always met. But on its face, it is hard for stakeholders I speak with out in Nevada to take these months-long stutters as simply good faith bureaucratic hold-ups. And it’s even making work fighting solar for activists out in the desert much more confusing.

For Shaaron Netherton, executive director of the conservation group Friends of the Nevada Wilderness, these solar project permitting delays mean an uncertain future. Friends of the Nevada Wilderness is a volunteer group of ecology protection activists that is opposing Esmeralda 7 and filed its first lawsuit against Greenlink West, a transmission project that will connect the massive solar constellation to the energy grid. Netherton told me her group may sue against the approval of Esmeralda 7… but that the next phase of their battle against the project is a hazy unknown.

“It’s just kind of a black hole,” she told me of the Esmeralda 7 permitting process. “We will litigate Esmeralda 7 if we have to, and we were hoping that with this administration there would be a little bit of a pause. There may be. That’s still up in the air.”

I’d like to note that Netherton’s organization has different reasons for opposition than I normally write about in The Fight. Instead of concerns about property values or conspiracies about battery fires, her organization and a multitude of other desert ecosystem advocates are trying to avoid a future where large industries of any type harm or damage one of the nation’s most biodiverse and undeveloped areas.

This concern for nature has historically motivated environmental activism. But it’s also precisely the sort of advocacy that Trump officials have opposed tooth-and-nail, dating back to the president’s previous term, when advocates successfully opposed his rewrite of Endangered Species Act regulations. This reason – a motivation to hippie-punch, so to speak – is a reason why I hardly expect species protection to be enough of a concern to stop solar projects in their tracks under Trump, at least for now. There’s also the whole “energy dominance” thing, though Trump has been wishy-washy on adhering to that goal.

Patrick Donnelly, great basin director at the Center for Biological Diversity, agrees that this is a period of confusion but not necessarily an end to solar permitting on BLM land.

“[Solar] is moving a lot slower than it was six months ago, when it was coming at a breakneck pace,” said Patrick Donnelly of the Center for Biological Diversity. “How much of that is ideological versus 15-20% of the agencies taking early retirement and utter chaos inside the agencies? I’m not sure. But my feeling is it’s less ideological. I really don’t think Trump’s going to just start saying no to these energy projects.”",https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy82MTA4MTM0OS9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc2OTUyNTcyN30.EeDFgqlVqkN_g3WDa5aGUzo01ktTyCfOZTknst50qxo/image.jpg?width=1200&height=600&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C286,N,,2025-06-21 20:05:02.859061

Longtime scientists Lewis Ross Brown and Shamira A. Brown created Virginia Environmental Action Network (VEAN) to help individuals and organizations apply for environmental grants and to raise awareness about pressing ecological issues in local communities.

With environmental issues increasingly sidelined at the national level, the pair are moving forward with a new program to monitor local waterways for contaminants that are toxic to community members. They believe their findings will help to hold government officials accountable for enforcing environmental protections.

“The state of Virginia needed an unbiased, detailed water pollution and quality analysis program designed to combat the ever-growing pollution problems caused by harmful algal blooms, organic and inorganic pesticides, organic waste and heavy metals,” said Shamira A. Brown. “Lewis and I felt that the creation of VEAN would be the answer to the water pollution issues from these contaminants. Additionally, we feel that VEAN will be able to make sure federal regulations, like the Clean Water Act and Safe Drinking Act, are followed throughout the state of Virginia— a duty that the EPA does not do nor has a desire to do under the new administration.”

Two priority areas for the scientists are per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, or PFAS and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). These man-made, persistent and toxic chemicals have been widely used to resist heat, water and oil, making them ideal for products, like non-stick cookware, firefighting foam and waterproof fabrics.

PFAS and PFBs enter waterways through industrial discharge, firefighting foam runoff, landfill leakage and wastewater systems that can’t filter them out. Once in the water, these chemicals can persist for years without breaking down, accumulating in fish, wildlife and, eventually, human bodies through drinking water and food consumption.

“Generally speaking, PFAS chemicals are known to interfere with human immune systems in a negative manner, rendering humans exposed to them with a very weakened and compromised immune system,” said Shamira A. Brown.

Perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) are two prominent PFAS. Shamira A. Brown explained that exposure to PFOA can result in significantly elevated cholesterol levels and changes in liver function. Exposure to PFOS leads can increase the risk of several types of cancer, including kidney, testicular, anal, breast and prostate. She said there is also a strong connection between PFOS exposure and changes in hormone levels in men and women between the ages of 16 and 67.

PCBs can also cause a range of health problems.

“Furthermore, we have shown that high exposure levels of PCBs can induce severe liver and kidney damage in humans, as well as developmental effects in children born to mothers with high PCB exposure levels,” said Shamira A. Brown.

The researchers will also be analyzing waterways for lead, arsenic and mercury. They will also collect tissue samples from fish and birds. They plan to publicize the information and to enable community members to learn more about the hazards these contaminants pose to both environmental and human health.

A special focus will be put on aiding underserved communities, who typically bear the brunt of environmental harms.

“We’re going to hold meetings where people can tune in and ask all of the questions they want to ask. We are going to come to your community to help because that’s our job,” said Lewis Ross Brown. “If we don’t help, nobody is going to help us.”

Lewis Ross Brown’s background is in environmental toxicology, researching how exposure to pesticides and chemical pollutants affect living organisms and, in particular, humans. Shamira A. Brown specializes in environmental chemistry and oncology.

The pair met when they were paired up for a biological research project while attending Dillard University, a historically Black college in Louisiana. They previously worked with the Louisiana Environmental Action Network before coming to D.C. to work for the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).

They left the government agency during the 47th president’s first term, as he sought to reduce support for the EPA and roll back protections for the first time. Now that he is back in office, they are also stepping up to support scientists and researchers who have lost their jobs or fear they may be terminated.

“The biggest fight we have on our hands right now is getting these federal workers to work again and back to doing the things that they love to do, which is to help our society,” said Lewis Ross Brown. “When he laid those people off, it was nothing short of stupid because it’s going to cost a lot of money to build that government agency back up.”

The researchers are helping to connect displaced federal environmental workers with consulting jobs. Lewis Ross Brown noted that these positions offer flexible hours and wages that exceed those from government jobs.

They have set up a hotline for people who are in need of employment. Individuals can call 703-594-2302 for help. Once they must submit a current resume, they will be connected with a range of consulting opportunities.

As the 47th president and his administration continue to defund climate initiatives and research, Lewis Ross Brown and Shamira A. Brown are uneasy. But, through VEAN, they plan to hold institutions accountable for their environmental impact.

“Under the Trump administration, we are mainly concerned about the elimination of research grants in the sciences, especially medical, environmental health, toxicology and chemistry,” said Shamira A.

(VDN) – The Mississippi Public Service Commission has approved Entergy Mississippi’s annual rate plan, which aims to keep electricity rates stable and customer bills approximately 20% below the national average. The updated plan will take effect with the July billing cycle, as rising summer temperatures are expected to increase energy usage.

Under the plan, a typical residential customer using 1,000 kilowatt-hours (kWh) per month will see a slight bill decrease of $0.04 beginning in July. Despite growing costs to generate power, maintain infrastructure, and provide service, the plan is designed to keep rates as flat as possible during peak demand.

Entergy Mississippi President and CEO Haley Fisackerly credited strategic planning and oversight from the Public Service Commission for supporting affordability and reliability efforts.

“We’re thankful for the Mississippi Public Service Commission’s continued oversight and support of our efforts to keep rates affordable while making critical reliability improvements and addressing increased challenges caused by vegetation,” Fisackerly said.

Key strategies supporting the rate plan include:

Recruiting new power partners: Entergy is expanding its customer base by attracting large commercial users, helping to distribute infrastructure investment costs more broadly.

Diversifying power sources: A balanced energy mix shields customers from fuel price volatility and enhances grid resilience.

Modernizing generation systems: Upgrades to cleaner, more efficient technology are aimed at long-term cost savings.

Managing fuel costs: Customers pay the actual fuel price without markups, with continuous efforts to secure the lowest available rates.

The plan includes about $525 million for power quality and reliability improvements, and outlines customer-focused programs in 2025 such as energy efficiency rebates and savings incentives.

According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, cooling makes up more than 52% of the average electric bill during summer months. Entergy urges customers to explore energy-saving tips and tools at billtoolkit.entergy.com/mississippi to manage usage and reduce costs.

Fisackerly emphasized the company’s commitment to affordability. “We’re balancing fuel prices and modernizing generation resources because we know both can fluctuate.

Reasons Why The Mega Bill Would Handicap Wind And Solar Energy.","Green Technologies At Risk In Current Mega Bill

As it was written, the Big, Beautiful Bill (Mega Bill) passed by The House of Representatives in May would handicap certain green projects (solar, wind, and batteries) that are in line to receive tax credits made available by the Biden government. The handicap is hard to understand because in the U.S. over 90% of new energy projects in 2023 and 2024 was generated by solar, wind, and batteries.

What is the handicap? The Mega Bill mandates that such projects must begin within two months of passage of the bill, and would have to be completed, and in service, by the last day of 2028, or the tax credits would be canceled.

To see what impact this would have on green projects, one analysis looked at clean electrical projects that are currently in the interconnection queue, and due to go online during 2028 or later (it wouldn’t be uncommon for projects slated to complete in 2028 to spill over to 2029, which would cancel the tax credits.)

The total for all these at-risk projects in Figure 1 amounts to 600 GW (gigawatts). The largest three projects are CAISO of California at 183 GW, ERCOT of Texas at 128 GW, and MISO (Midwest and South) at 111 GW.

The truth is, current electrical production in U.S. is 1200 GW, and this will need to grow rapidly to power new AI data centers. So, if all these seven green projects lost their tax credits and dropped out of the interconnection queue, it would represent a huge loss that is 50% of current electrical production in the U.S. This loss would be like tossing away 600 traditional power plants that added up to 50% of current U.S. electricity supply.

Granted, a number of projects in Figure 1 would drop out of the queue anyway, due to other factors such as financial commitments that fall through. But still, a loss of remaining projects that would stand to boost current U.S. power by 30% or 40% or 50% would be an unforgiveable loss—especially since solar, wind and battery projects have all the market momentum in the past few years.

Speaking of momentum, in 2023 and 2024 in the U.S., the vast majority (93%--94%) of new energy sources were solar, wind, and batteries. The only commercially proven competitor is gas-fired power plants, which are facing serious delays, and they cost more.

What if projects that lost their tax credits were to go ahead to completion? They might, but it’s obvious this would translate to higher cost of electricity for consumers.

Mega Bill Changes Suggested By Senate.

The House Mega Bill has gone to the Senate, and on Monday June 16 they have proposed some changes.

UtilityDive reports that the harsh “start by – complete by” House requirement to access the tax credits has been removed. In one box, nuclear, geothermal and hydropower can claim the tax credits so long as they start construction by 2033.

But in another box, wind and solar can obtain only 60% of the tax credits and only if they break ground by 2026. Or 20% if by 2027. Or zero if after that. This is a serious handicap for the frontrunners, solar and wind, that have provided over 93% of new electrical capacity in 2023 and 2024. And it comes at a crucial time, because the U.S. needs to quickly boost its power capability by a massive amount to supply AI data centers.

One positive: battery storage or BESS (battery energy storage systems) can access tax credits until 2036, although the credits will be tapered down, according to Canary Media. Also, some solar and wind projects would be able to keep the tax credits beyond the end of 2028—provided they exist on federal land, generate 1 GW or more power, and have obtained right-of-way approval from the BLM (Bureau of Land Management).

The next steps are: the Senate as a whole has to pass these changes, and then attempt to reconcile with the House. The timeline is short as the goal is to get the final version of the Mega Bill to President Trump’s desk by July 4.

Coming out of all the discussion and debate, it seems the Mega Bill wants to handicap wind and solar and batteries. But why?

Reasons Why The Mega Bill Would Handicap Wind And Solar Energy.

First, the Bill will cause electricity prices to rise. If cheap wind, solar and batteries are handicapped in preference to expensive almost-defunct coal power plants, commercially unproven SMRs (small modular nuclear reactors), and next-gen geothermal methods, then prices of electricity will rise. Table 1 lays this out, using the most recent LCOE data from Lazard.

With tax credits and based on a utility scale, solar PV + BESS and wind + BESS are cheaper than geothermal with tax credits, and much cheaper than gas-fired power, nuclear, and coal. If the Mega Bill handicaps wind and solar in the race, electrical costs will zoom upwards.

Second, the Bill seems to be unaware of green energy success in Australia. In the state of South Australia renewables plus batteries have been providing 72% of grid electricity continuously for three years, and this is expected to rise to 100% by 2027. Solar, wind, and batteries have proven the stability and reliability of renewables commercially.

The first grid-scale BESS was started in 2017 by Elon Musk in South Australia, and BESS are expanding rapidly in the U.S. as well as in Australia. Intermittent power is no longer a reason to dismiss renewables, despite what the Energy Secretary says, because BESS have solved this problem and electricity from solar and wind renewables with BESS is dispatchable.

Third, the Bill assumes new investments in old energy (coal, natural gas, and nuclear) will be embraced by the U.S. population. However, global spending on low-carbon power has doubled in the past five years. Solar PV is the leader in this space, with investments that will reach $450 billion in 2025.

Coal is too dirty when it burns, and in the U.S. the market share has dropped from 50% in 2011 to 11% in 2024. Natural gas burns cleaner than coal, but the market for new gas-fired power plants has dropped out in the past two years, due to cost and delays in permitting and supply chains.

The cost of new nuclear reactors, whether traditional reactors or SMRs, is substantially higher than renewable energies (Table 1). There is also the ubiquitous threat of being exposed to nuclear radiation, either from nuclear accidents or from underground storage of nuclear waste.

It has been reported that U.S. nuclear reactors that were decommissioned some time ago can be recommissioned, but at a heavy cost of around $1 billion per unit.

Fourth, the Bill enables China to forge ahead with a green energy economy, while the U.S. goes backward.

Energy from solar, wind, and batteries is cheap, and has a short new-build time. It will continue to provide jobs and grow the economy, and benefits include lower electricity prices and less pollution. A key advantage is already-commercialized power for data centers that will enable the U.S. to compete with China in the race for AI. The handicap and setbacks of a thriving clean industry in the U.S. would be China’s gain.

Fifth, the Bill will force job losses by handicapping green industries.

If projects in the above list of seven in Figure 1 were to be canceled due to the Mega Bill handicaps, there could be serious job losses. To illustrate by results in 2024, one report quotes $80 billion invested in clean power in 2024, which supported 1.4 million jobs in the U.S.

Another answer is that current tax credits would enable strong economic growth by 2035: almost $2 trillion of monetary growth and almost 14 million jobs. This amounts to a return on the federal investment by four-times.

The green energy benefits and financial returns of wind and solar with battery storage apply to both Republican and Democratic states in the U.S.. But so do the losses, if Congress decides to handicap wind and solar renewables.

The biggest losses may be soaring electricity costs in the U.S., and the U.S. bending to China’s clean energy boom of surging solar and BESS projects that will reliably service their AI data center programs.",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/6857235e09c68e8305c375dc/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,N,,2025-06-21 19:05:13.725652

The LG Energy Solution, the South Korea's top battery manufacturer, has recently established joint ventures in both Europe and the United States -- partnering with France's Derichebourg and Toyota Tsusho Co., respectively.

These initiatives mark LG's first direct entry into recycling operations in these key global markets.

Meanwhile, SK Ecoplant, the construction and engineering arm of SK Group, is expanding its European operations in the Netherlands.

The facility will add an annual processing capacity of 25,000 metric tons of black mass, with the expansion slated for completion in 2025, the South Korean English-language daily newspaper added.

Going further, Posco-GS Eco Materials -- a joint venture between Posco Holdings and GS Energy, with ownership split 51:49 -- has also made a notable move by acquiring full ownership of its recycling unit, Posco HY Clean Metal.

This was achieved by purchasing the 35 percent stake held by China's Huayou Cobalt in April, the South Korea's news platform added.

These strategic shifts come amid a prolonged downturn in the battery recycling sector, fueled by weakened EV demand and falling prices of core battery minerals such as nickel, lithium, and manganese.

Lithium carbonate prices, which exceeded 450 Chinese yuan (USD 63) per kilogram in January 2023, have plummeted to about 50 yuan. Nickel has also seen a steep drop from over USD 31,000 per ton to around USD 20,000.

As a result, SungEel HiTech -- one of only two battery recycling companies listed on Korea's tech-heavy Kosdaq -- has faced falling profitability and declining free cash flow for two consecutive years.

A joint recycling venture between SungEel HiTech and SK Innovation, announced in 2022, has been postponed indefinitely. Additionally, SK Ecoplant's planned facilities in Gyeongju, North Gyeongsang Province, and in Kentucky have shown little to no progress for several years.

The news report added that the Korean industry watchers expect a sharp rise in used EV batteries reaching end-of-life status, generally around 10 years after initial use -- a timeline that aligns with the global EV sales boom in the 2010s, which topped one million units by 2015.

With global EV adoption continuing to rise, the battery recycling market -- valued at USD 8 billion in 2022 -- is forecast to grow to as much as USD 53.57 billion by 2030, according to SNE Research.

Experts argue that participating in the recycling segment is becoming crucial for maintaining competitiveness in the battery industry, especially as regulatory pressure mounts globally for the use of recycled materials.

The European Union, for instance, mandates that EV batteries sold in the region must contain minimum percentages of recycled metals by 2031: 16 percent for cobalt, 85 percent for lead, 6 percent for lithium, and 6 percent for nickel. These thresholds will increase by 2036.

Moosa highlighted that the decade from 2020 to 2030 had been globally recognised as a pivotal era for transitioning to clean energy.
He cautioned, however, that Pakistan's local industry was not yet sufficiently developed to meet the growing demand for advanced solar panels in adequate quantity.
He also highlighted the immense untapped potential for solar energy adoption among off-grid rural households.","The imposition of general sales tax (GST) on imported solar panels, regardless of the final tax rate decided by the federal government, will not slow down Pakistan’s accelerating transition towards renewable energy.

This was the collective view expressed by clean energy experts, academics, industrialists, climate activists and renewable energy traders during a webinar examining the federal government’s recent budgetary proposal to impose GST on imported solar panels. The proposed measure aims to encourage domestic manufacturing of renewable energy equipment.

The webinar, titled ‘Taxing the Sun: Will Solar Still Shine in Pakistan?’, was jointly organised by the Energy Update and Pakistan Solar Association (PSA). PSA Chairman Waqas Moosa opened the discussion by thanking environmental advocates and non-governmental organisations for their continued support of solar energy adoption by households and commercial users. He emphasised that shifting to solar power was a critical means to reduce dependence on polluting fossil fuels.

Moosa highlighted that the decade from 2020 to 2030 had been globally recognised as a pivotal era for transitioning to clean energy. He predicted that Pakistani consumers would persist in embracing solar energy to power their homes and businesses, regardless of the added cost from the GST.

He cautioned, however, that Pakistan's local industry was not yet sufficiently developed to meet the growing demand for advanced solar panels in adequate quantity. As such, relying solely on local production at this stage could risk stalling progress.

He criticised the proposal to tax imported solar panels, calling it a serious setback to Pakistan’s efforts in combating the climate crisis. ""Whether or not a tax is implemented"", he said, ""domestic consumers will continue shifting to solar energy due to persistent power shortages and unaffordable electricity tariffs.""

Muhammad Zakar Ali, chief executive officer of the Inverex Solar Energy, echoed this sentiment. He said that the vast majority of electricity users in Pakistan now understood the long-term value of clean energy and would continue to transition away from grid-supplied electricity, regardless of tax implications.

He argued that Pakistan needed a minimum of 18 to 24 months to establish a viable local industry capable of producing clean energy equipment at scale. Imposing a tax prematurely, he warned, could deter both domestic and international investors.

He noted that high electricity tariffs for industrial users could discourage investment in solar panel manufacturing plants. He, however, predicted that prospective Chinese investors would soon launch joint ventures with Pakistani industrialists to set up such facilities.

Ali explained that establishing local solar panel manufacturing plants could lead to the development of five supporting vendor industries, significantly boosting the clean energy supply chain in Pakistan.

Former Karachi Chamber of Commerce and Industry (KCCI) office-bearer Tanveer Ahmed Barry stated that industries had little choice but to transition to renewable energy due to the unreliable and unstable power supply from the national grid.

He pointed out that while Pakistan’s installed electricity generation capacity exceeded 45,000 megawatts, only around 27,000 megawatts were currently deliverable to end-users due to the outdated transmission infrastructure. He also highlighted the immense untapped potential for solar energy adoption among off-grid rural households.",https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/uploads/akhbar/2025-06-22/l_1323646_023413_updates.jpg,N,,2025-06-21 19:05:17.997532

What Has Trump Said About Windmills ?

Shortly after taking office, the president said the government would not subsidize new windmill farms and added he doesn’t “want even one built” during his second term. Trump called wind turbines the “most expensive energy” that only works “with massive government subsidies, which we will no longer pay.” Trump could potentially impact windmill production on federal lands, but not on privately owned plots. Trump has also falsely claimed windmills kill whales, though there is no evidence supporting the claim about the mammals and offshore turbines.

Are Windmills The Most Expensive Form Of Energy Production?

Not likely. The Department of Energy has said “wind and solar projects are now more economically competitive than gas, geothermal, coal, or nuclear facilities,” though windmills in locations lacking wind could be an exception. Onshore wind turbines saw global costs of energy production fall by 68% in 2021, according to a report from the International Renewable Energy Agency, which noted onshore capacity increased four-fold from 2010 to 2021. The agency also reported onshore wind project costs fell by 13% while offshore wind projects fell by 9% in 2020.

Key Background

Trump once lost a legal battle in which he sought to block the construction of an offshore wind farm in view of a golf course project of his in Scotland. The president lost in court and was required to pay over $290,000 in legal fees to the Scottish government. His scrutiny of windmills is a change from his first term, when former Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke said he was “very bullish on offshore wind,” adding the harnessing of the energy source was “a big part of the Trump Administration’s made in America energy strategy.”

The clean energy tax credits, many of which were created or expanded as part of President Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act, have been a point of tension for congressional Republicans as they craft the massive budget reconciliation package carrying Mr. Trump’s legislative agenda.

Fiscal conservatives have pushed to fully repeal the credits and quickly, while more centrist Republicans want to retain some of the tax breaks and phase others out over a slower period of time.

Mr. Trump on Saturday decided to take a side, and he believes the credits need to go.

“I HATE ‘GREEN TAX CREDITS’ IN THE GREAT, BIG, BEAUTIFUL BILL,” the president posted on social media. “They are largely a giant SCAM.”

Mr. Trump said he would prefer the federal dollars being spent on the tax subsidies “be used somewhere else, including [deficit] reductions.”

“Windmills, and the rest of this ‘JUNK,’ are the most expensive and inefficient energy in the world,” he said.

The president said none of the green energy technologies – “almost exclusively made in China” – work without massive government subsidies.

“It is time to break away, finally, from this craziness!!!” Mr. Trump said.

Neither the House nor Senate versions of the “big, beautiful bill” fully repeal all of Mr. Biden’s clean energy credits. Many are phased out, although more quickly in the House-passed version of the bill than in the Senate’s draft.

The House used a stricter deadline, requiring most clean energy projects to be “placed in service” by certain dates if they are to qualify for the subsidies. The Senate lowered the standard to a “commence construction” deadline for many projects, which effectively extends their credit-qualifying lifespan by years.

Conservative Republicans in both chambers amplified Mr. Trump’s social media post to emphasize their support for fully repealing the clean energy credits.

House Freedom Caucus Chairman Andy Harris posted that he 100% agrees with Mr. Trump.

“We should never allow foreign owned offshore wind companies to control our energy supply — much less harm our marine life while doing it,” he said.

Sen. Josh Hawley, Missouri Republican, said the president is “100% correct.”

“Get rid of the Green New Scam credits, protect rural hospitals,” he said, referring to a priority of his that has yet to be included in the measure. “And let’s PASS THIS BILL.”

Alex Epstein, an outside energy expert who has conducted research on the clean energy credits and advises politicians, spoke to Senate Republicans this week and argued for the use of the “placed in service” standard if lawmakers want to see the IRA subsidies end during Mr. Trump’s presidency.

Mr. Trump, 79, campaigned on terminating the “Green New Scam,” as he’s dubbed the IRA.

But in a “best-case scenario,” the Senate’s proposal would keep wind subsidies in place through the president’s 94th birthday, Mr. Epstein said.

“The more likely scenario is the subsidies continue forever because their expiration has been delayed until after the Trump administration,” he said.

Fully repealing the clean energy credits, as Mr. Trump is requesting, will not be an easy task, given several have support from Republicans whose constituencies have benefited from projects the subsidies helped fund.

Sen. Chuck Grassley, Iowa Republican, posted on social media, without directly referencing Mr. Trump’s post, that his state gets 60% of its electricity from wind energy.

“It’s an important tool for America’s energy independence [and to] keep Iowans’ utility bills low,” he said.",https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2025/06/20/Trump_27843_c0-219-5257-3285_s1200x700.jpg?890a74869aecf7cb7cb5bb60d29e8cff1a392519,N,,2025-06-21 18:08:17.749116

Extending the lifespan of lithium-ion batteries used in electric vehicles would be a major boon for making electric vehicles more endurable and cost-effective, help mitigate skyrocketing lithium demand, and slow the flow of critical – not to mention toxic – minerals into landfills.

The China-based scientists wanted to discover a molecule that could re-infuse a dead cell with lithium ions, replenishing its capacity. An electric vehicle battery is considered dead when its capacity dips below 80 percent of its original value. This usually is about eight to ten years after the battery is manufactured. But by pumping lithium ions back into a cell after it reaches the end of its life cycle, batteries could be brought back from the dead.

The question was what molecules would be able to achieve this re-infusion. The possible combinations are enormous and would require enormous amounts of time and resources to test in a lab. So the researchers decided to employ artificial intelligence to figure it out for them. “We had no idea what kinds of molecules could do that job or what their chemical structures would be, so we used machine learning to help us,” Chihao Zhao, part of the research team at Fudan University, was recently quoted by Scientific American.

The artificial intelligence model determined that three different molecules would fulfill all of the requirements outlined by the scientists. Of those three, the researchers determined one to be the best fit – a salt called lithium trifluoromethanesulfinate (LiSO2CF3). In the researchers’ study paper, published in Nature earlier this year, they describe how the identified lithium salt could help to break past traditional battery lifespan limitations “by means of a cell-level Li supply strategy.”

“This involves externally adding an organic Li salt into an assembled cell, which decomposes during cell formation, liberating Li ions and expelling organic ligands as gases,” the paper goes on to say. “This non-invasive and rapid process preserves cell integrity without necessitating disassembly.”

The result is a lithium-ion battery capable of being recharged for 11,818 cycles while still retaining a capacity of 96 percent – an amazing feat with the potential to increase the lifespan of commercial electric vehicle batteries by orders of magnitude. “These systems exhibit improved energy density, enhanced sustainability, and reduced cost compared with conventional Li-ion batteries,” the paper states.

While the research is extremely nascent, it could prove disruptive to the EV sector if refined and scaled. Making electric vehicle batteries less expensive could have a major impact on what remains a cost-prohibitive transition for many would-be consumers. The battery alone represents about 40 percent of the cost of an electric vehicle. Making batteries more cost-effective, efficient, and durable could therefore make a big difference in EV markets.

Plus, it will offer a reprieve to the mounting issue of battery waste. A mini-report from the United Nations Development Program (UNDP) says that by 2040, the world will reach 20,500 kilotons of dead lithium-ion batteries, mostly from electric vehicles. But current global battery recycling capacities are just around 350,000 tons per year, with capacities concentrated in China.

Scientists have looked to AI to improve lithium-ion battery recycling capacities as well, motivated in part by a drive to break China’s stranglehold on the sector. A Hong Kong startup is employing artificial intelligence to refine a portable lithium-ion battery recycling system that uses a robot-assisted pilot line to sort, shred, and filter desirable materials from used batteries. Notably, this system does not include electric vehicle batteries, but could provide a launch pad for similar systems geared at the growing EV waste problem.

Redefining “Green” and Risking the Grid Under HB692, “green energy” is redefined to include any energy source that meets National Ambient Air Quality Standards when combusted.
Proponents, including Rep. Landry, argue that natural gas is necessary to meet the state’s rising industrial demands.
HB692 mandates that Louisiana utilities “shall… use energy generated by hydrocarbons” and grants gas projects access to state funds previously reserved for green initiatives.","In a move drawing sharp criticism from environmentalists and energy policy experts alike, Louisiana lawmakers have passed HB692, a bill that reclassifies natural gas a fossil fuel as “green energy.” The bill, expected to be signed into law by Gov. Jeff Landry, has ignited debate over the state’s energy future, with opponents warning it could entrench fossil fuel dominance at the expense of renewable energy development and grid reliability.

Louisiana has long depended on the oil and gas industry to fuel its economy. While the sector once contributed up to 60% of the state’s revenues, that number has plummeted to just 4.5% as global energy markets shift and environmental concerns grow. Yet HB692 takes a starkly different approach than what experts recommend for a sustainable transition.

Spearheaded by Rep. Jacob Landry (R-Erath), the bill codifies hydrocarbons specifically natural gas and nuclear energy as forms of “green” or “clean” energy. It directs state utilities to prioritize energy generated by hydrocarbons, citing affordability, reliability, and energy security. Critics argue this approach is not only misleading but also harmful.

“There’s nothing clean or green about continued extraction of carbon from underground,” said James Hiatt, a former oil and gas worker and founder of For a Better Bayou.

The National Origins of a State Law

Although marketed as a Louisiana-specific solution, HB692 appears to originate from a national effort backed by fossil fuel lobbyists and dark money groups. Its language mirrors a model bill from the American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC), a Koch-funded lobbying group. ALEC’s model legislation promotes natural gas as an equivalent to renewables under the guise of “clean” energy.

The Empowerment Alliance, another gas advocacy group, celebrated Louisiana’s move, framing it as part of a larger campaign. “That’s three down, 47 more states to go,” the group wrote, referencing similar laws passed in Ohio, Tennessee, and Indiana.

Redefining “Green” and Risking the Grid

Under HB692, “green energy” is redefined to include any energy source that meets National Ambient Air Quality Standards when combusted. This includes gas, despite its high methane emissions a greenhouse gas over 80 times more potent than CO₂ over a 20-year period.

Critics note that the bill ignores the environmental and public health costs of burning gas and fails to define how “affordable” energy should be calculated. The vagueness of the bill, paired with a clear emphasis on hydrocarbons, has left consumer advocates deeply concerned.

“The rest of the bill skews toward fossil fuels,” said Jackson Voss, climate policy coordinator for the Alliance for Affordable Energy. “It implies utilities should have a strong preference for things that use hydrocarbons, at the very least.”

HB692 doesn’t explicitly override municipal regulations, but renewable energy supporters fear it will undercut local efforts. New Orleans, which regulates Entergy New Orleans independently, has a goal of reaching 100% carbon-free energy by 2050. If HB692 is used as a rationale to slow down or reject solar and wind investments, New Orleans’ clean energy goals may be jeopardized.

Similar legislation in Tennessee went further, requiring municipalities to accept gas as a renewable source effectively overriding local standards.

Proponents, including Rep. Landry, argue that natural gas is necessary to meet the state’s rising industrial demands. He cites major infrastructure projects like Meta’s $10 billion data center in Richland Parish and CF Industries’ $4 billion “blue” ammonia facility. Both projects have enormous energy demands, and Entergy has proposed building three new gas plants to meet the load.

However, the cost of this fossil-heavy expansion will fall on ratepayers. Entergy customers are expected to shoulder $470 million in upfront costs for the new power plants. Meanwhile, studies show that Louisianans already pay some of the highest utility bills in the country and suffer some of the longest and most frequent outages.

Louisiana is on the front lines of climate change. Rising sea levels, severe storms, and extreme heat are escalating in both frequency and severity. The state’s overreliance on gas, environmentalists argue, is a major contributor to this crisis.

Gas plants not only emit CO₂ but also spew hazardous pollutants that contribute to poor air quality, exacerbating public health issues in communities already vulnerable due to industrial exposure.

In 2018, a new Entergy gas plant in New Orleans failed during a storm casting doubt on the reliability claims made by gas proponents. Yet, HB692 frames gas as the only dependable option, dismissing storage-enhanced solar and wind as unreliable.

HB692 mandates that Louisiana utilities “shall… use energy generated by hydrocarbons” and grants gas projects access to state funds previously reserved for green initiatives. It also directs the Department of Energy and Natural Resources to collaborate with regulators on enforcing these priorities.

While the bill includes a clause about ensuring a sufficient supply of renewable sources, the emphasis on gas is clear. Rep. Edmond Jordan and others warn that the legislation could face constitutional challenges for encroaching on the regulatory authority of the Louisiana Public Service Commission.

Despite public support for renewables highlighted in recent LSU surveys Louisiana’s political leadership appears to be steering the state in the opposite direction. HB692 represents not just a policy shift but a philosophical one: from planning for a low-carbon future to doubling down on fossil fuels in the face of mounting climate and economic risks.

For environmentalists and consumer advocates, the new law is a dangerous detour on Louisiana’s path toward a sustainable, reliable, and affordable energy future.",https://techstory.in/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/20230313-5068_VG-flare-2-12-23-1827-hrs-1.jpg,N,,2025-06-21 18:08:48.287503

From a study that tracks just how American your vehicle is to changing consumer sentiments around electric vehicles to a new Honda delivery vehicle, that’s a lot of news that slipped through the cracks this week. Here’s a roundup of some important stories you may not find elsewhere.

Red, White And Who?

First up, Cars.com just released its American-Made Index, a study that “analyzes five major factors to determine just how American your prospective car or truck might be.” OK, cool. Surprisingly, performative patriotism, fast food drive-thru compatibility, and integrated firearms holsters were not factors considered in this study. This is the 20th year the list has been published.

So, what are the most-American vehicles you can buy today? Well, the lineup might shock you. The top four positions are occupied by Teslas: the Model 3, Model Y, Model S, and Model X, respectively. That makes sense, Tesla is American and builds cars right here. And so does Jeep; the off-road brand’s Gladiator landed in spot No. 5. But after that, it’s a whole bunch of Korean and Japanese vehicles, with models like the EV6, Ridgeline, Pilot and Integra landing in higher positions. Products built by the traditional Detroit Three automakers generally fall much farther down the list, which is always a surprise to see, even though it shouldn’t be.

Abbey Road (Studios) Mode

If you love the Beatles, Volvo and the closely related Polestar brand have you covered. Both automakers just announced a new Abbey Road Studios Mode for their optional Bowers & Wilkins audio systems. Soon, this new amenity will be pushed out to vehicles via an over-the-air software update.

The Swedish/Chinese (Swedinese?) company describes this as “a sound technology designed to capture the essence of the iconic recording studio’s unique environment.” Abbey Road Studios is the famous location where the Beatles recorded many of their songs.

Volvo explains this new listening mode “comes with several presets that provide a selection of sounds, optimized for different listening styles. And for those ready to explore new ways of enjoying their favorite tracks, the Producer Mode allows you to engineer your own sound.” Adding a little more meat to that statement, Polestar explains this system comes with four different listening presets: Intimate, Open, Energized, and Expansive. All this provides “a distinct audio experience inspired by the studio’s spaces and equipment.” OK then.

Abbey Road Studios Mode will debut in the all-electric Volvo EX90 utility vehicle. The Polestar 3 EV will also gain this feature. How useful this listening mode will actually and whether drivers even care about fripperies like this remains to be seen.

EVs Keep Losing Their Luster… Or Are They?

Electric vehicles are hugely popular in China, with millions upon millions of battery-bolstered cars and trucks getting snapped up by drivers each year. EVs, however, are proving to be much less popular in other markets, particularly Western countries, something that is underscored by a report from oil company Shell.

According to a recent survey, which includes responses from more than 15,000 motorists in China, Europe, and the U.S., drivers are turned off by the high upfront costs of electric vehicles, and are choosing instead to stick with vehicles powered by traditional combustion engines. Folks that currently own EVs are increasingly satisfied, but affordability is still a top concern of 43 percent of non-EV owners in Europe.

Interest in switching to an electric is waning in the U.S. and Europe. Among drivers that currently own a combustion-powered vehicle, 31 percent would consider an EV compared to 34 percent in 2024. Similarly, in Europe, this decreased from 48 percent last year to just 41 percent now. In comparison, Chinese drivers that own a single vehicle saw a huge jump in EV interest, going from 72 to 89 percent.

Countering Shell’s narrative, however, is another study, one published by the BMW Group. American motorists still have very real concerns about the affordability of EVs as well as the nation’s questionable charging infrastructure, but 92 percent of them still believe that innovation in the electric vehicle field is important. Of that total, 30 percent describe this as very important.

As for hybrids and plug-in hybrids, 66 percent of participants in this BMW study noted that they would consider one of these electrified vehicles before purchasing a pure EV, which makes sense. Plug-ins are a great steppingstone between conventional vehicles and electrics.

Moving in a slightly different but closely related direction, 58 percent of Americans “are open to hydrogen fuel cell vehicles,” which is interesting. If drivers are concerned about the public charging network, good luck finding hydrogen anywhere. Some 44 percent of those folks are open to hydrogen and 14 percent are very open.

Race To The Clouds

Next up, Honda will be the first manufacturer to run a hydrogen fuel cell-powered vehicle up Pikes (non-possessive) Peak in Colorado. The Japanese automaker will field its CR-V e:FCEV in The Broadmoor Pikes Peak International Hill Climb (brought to you by Gran Turismo, because apparently that’s important enough to mention in the media release).

The vehicle will compete in the exhibition class and has no powertrain modifications. The CR-V e:FCEV is motivated by one electric motor mounted up front, though the vehicle also has a fuel cell stack that was manufactured in Michigan, as well as two high-pressure hydrogen tanks and a 17.7-kilowatt-hour battery pack. Hopefully this CR-V has enough juice to make it up the nearly 12.5-mile course, which also has a whopping 156 turns and climbs to an altitude of 14,115 feet. Sounds like they’ll need more oxygen than hydrogen.

To see how well the CR-V e:FCEV performs in this Pikes Peak race, the competition is scheduled to take place on June 22, so mark your calendar… or just remember that it’s Sunday.

Rickshaw Of The Future

Aside from all that jazz – or whatever musical genre you prefer, perhaps bluegrass – Honda is making more headlines this week. The company also announced a new last-mile delivery vehicle business called Fastport. This division will provide so-called “micromobility solutions” if you’re an enjoyer of needlessly jargony buzzwords. Resembling a sci-fi motor rickshaw or some sort of futuristic tuktuk, the Fastport eQuad electric quadracycle prototype will make its global debut at the Eurobike conference in Frankfurt Germany next week.

This amusingly odd-looking vehicle is designed for densely congested urban areas and can be driven (or ridden?) in bike lanes. Accordingly, the eQuad has a pedal-assisted powertrain and batteries that can be easily swapped out, so there’s no need to fret about lengthy recharge times.

How large is this 21st century rickshaw? Well, the length clocks in at up to 144 inches, the width a manageable 48 and the height 84 inches. A smaller version will also be offered, and it’s a little trimmer in all dimensions. The large model’s maximum payload is 650 pounds (the small model tops out at 320) and the vehicle can hit a heady top speed of 12 mph.

As with any electric vehicle, range is highly variable, depending on factors like payload, temperatures and weather conditions. Still, Honda estimates the eQuad should be able to travel up to 23 miles with full batteries.

The Fastport eQuad will be built in Ohio of all places at Honda’s Performance Manufacturing Center, the facility that used to be home to the NSX supercar. Initial deliveries of the eQuad are expected to commence in late 2025, with mass production coming online next summer.

Medium-Rare Earths

And finally, rare-earth elements are materials most people have probably never heard of, but are absolutely critical to the functioning of modern society. These metals are used in certain aerospace applications and are particularly useful in powerful electric motors. Unfortunately, China has this market almost completely cornered. As reported by one source, they control 92 percent of global refined rare earth materials and produce up to 90 percent of the world’s permanent-magnet electric motors. Beijing’s supremacy in this field is nearly total.

Breaking this metals hegemony will not be easy, and according to a report from Bloomberg, it’s going to take Western nations years to make any dent in China’s dominance. And this is an obvious problem as the Asian country limits exports, particularly to the U.S.

Fortunately, some folks realize the issue and are working to correct it. According to that Bloomberg story, Mark Smith, CEO of NioCorp Developments Ltd. said this situation is clearly a wake-up call. “We need to have capabilities so that we have something more than zero,” he added. Accordingly, he and the company he runs are “developing a new mine in Nebraska, which could produce rare earth elements as byproducts, including terbium and dysprosium.”

Currently, NioCorp has the necessary permits, a grant from the U.S. Department of Defense and even loans. “Building” of the mine should start later in 2025, a process that is expected to take about three years. Production of rare-earth materials will likely commence in 2029. Getting this stuff up and running domestically is clearly no easy task, so it’s good at least one company is investing in this stuff.",https://static1.topspeedimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/honda-fastport-equad-prototype-front-three-quarter.jpg,N,,2025-06-21 18:07:41.846163

In 2024, state Sen. Celina Villanueva, D-Chicago, proposed a bill to ban natural gas in new buildings. A Chicago alderman, Maria Hadden, introduced similar legislation backed by Mayor Brandon Johnson around the same time.

Marc Brown, vice president of state affairs for the Consumer Energy Alliance, said forced electrification would cost $55,000 for the average single-family home.

“That includes when you’re redoing your panel, heat pumps, changing out a gas furnace, all your appliances,” Brown told The Center Square.

Citing data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration, the CEA said forced electrification could increase Illinois utility bills by $7.6 billion statewide or about $2,631 per household.

“When it comes to electric heating, it’s a little bit more expensive than gas, so that drives up energy bills,” Brown added.

Brown said the move to ban natural gas is ideological, but most people do not support it.

“They don’t want to be told what to do. I think it just comes from the fringe when it comes to these draconian mandates,” Brown said.

Brown said costs would rise even more if proposed bans were expanded to include the manufacturing and agricultural sectors.

According to the CEA, Illinois manufacturers consume over 25% of the state’s natural gas. The state’s agricultural community relies on natural gas for crop drying.

Brown said other issues include rising electricity demand and warnings about grid reliability.

“Adding this layer of increased electricity load on top of that, we’re seeing a little too much for the electricity grid,” Brown said.

According to regional grid operator PJM, energy is getting more expensive.

“The reason is very simple: Supply is decreasing on the system and demand is increasing. This is happening not just in PJM but all over the country,” PJM told The Center Square in a statement last month.

PJM said the decreased supply is primarily due to state and federal decarbonization policies and some economics, including the proliferation of data centers and the advancement of artificial intelligence.

Brown said gas industry improvements have fueled decreasing energy-related carbon emissions in the U.S. while other countries experienced increases.

“Natural gas is very clean. Companies have drastically reduced methane leakage on the distribution pipeline system like 80-90% over the past 20-30 years,” Brown said.

The Environmental Defense Fund and Sierra Club Illinois chapter did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

The CEA said banning or restricting natural gas could deepen energy poverty and compromise grid reliability.

“Instead of eliminating energy choice, Illinois should embrace a diverse and balanced approach to powering Illinois’ families, farmers and businesses,” the report concluded.",https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/thecentersquare.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/d/a0/da053c04-eaf5-11ee-b713-a34b9f6e20c2/6601f8c5cb7fc.image.jpg,N,,2025-06-21 18:08:25.508260

Tim Mathern, D-Fargo.
The repeal effort includes officials from Colorado, Indiana, Iowa, Montana, New Mexico, North Dakota, South Dakota and Wyoming.
South Dakota state Sen. Joy Hohn, R-Hartford, described the tax credits as wasteful spending.
Mathern said repealing the tax credits would put projects like Summit Carbon Solutions’ proposed five-state carbon dioxide pipeline “in dire danger.” “And that’s really positive,” he said.
The House recently passed its version of the bill without a repeal of the 45Q tax credits.","PIERRE, S.D. – Over 100 state and local officials from the Midwest and West are asking the U.S. Senate to eliminate tax credits for carbon capture and sequestration as part of a federal budget reconciliation bill.

Established by Congress and then-President George W. Bush in 2008, the 45Q tax credits incentivize companies to capture carbon dioxide from processes such as ethanol production and sequester it underground, so it won’t contribute to climate change by acting as a greenhouse gas in the atmosphere. The carbon can also be sequestered as part of enhanced oil recovery, in which pressurized gas is used to push more oil to the surface.

Opponents say the credits don’t work as intended.

“The 45Q tax credits really only make sense to the industries that are poised to make billions of dollars from them,” said North Dakota state Sen. Tim Mathern, D-Fargo. “They are supposedly intended to reduce carbon emissions, but in fact, 45Q tax credits pay polluters for polluting and subsidize private oil production at the expense of the taxpayer.”

Companies receive up to $85 per metric ton for regular sequestration and up to $60 per metric ton for sequestration via enhanced oil recovery — though there is a provision in a draft portion of the Senate reconciliation bill that would raise the maximum oil recovery credit to $85.

The repeal effort includes officials from Colorado, Indiana, Iowa, Montana, New Mexico, North Dakota, South Dakota and Wyoming. A few of those officials held a virtual press conference Wednesday.

South Dakota state Sen. Joy Hohn, R-Hartford, described the tax credits as wasteful spending.

“We are concerned about preserving taxpayer dollars, and that’s the main gist of our conference today,” Hohn said.

Mathern said repealing the tax credits would put projects like Summit Carbon Solutions’ proposed five-state carbon dioxide pipeline “in dire danger.”

“And that’s really positive,” he said.

Summit’s project alone could qualify for more than $1 billion annually from 45Q credits. It aims to capture some of the CO2 emitted by dozens of ethanol plants and ship the carbon via pipeline to a sequestration area southeast of the oilfields in western North Dakota.

Earlier this year, South Dakota’s legislators and governor adopted a law banning the use of a legal process known as eminent domain to acquire land access for carbon dioxide pipelines. South Dakota regulators also rejected Summit’s project application, saying there was no path forward for the project under the eminent domain ban.

Those moves came after several years of anti-pipeline activism by landowners focused on property rights and the danger from potential leaks of toxic carbon dioxide plumes. The project has permits in other states, but some of those are being challenged in court.

Congressional Republicans are using the complex reconciliation process to move a budget package through Congress with simple majority votes in each chamber, avoiding the Senate’s 60-vote legislative filibuster. The House recently passed its version of the bill without a repeal of the 45Q tax credits. U.S. Rep. Dusty Johnson, R-South Dakota, voted for the bill.

A spokesperson for Johnson sent a statement when asked via email if the congressman supports repealing the tax credits: “While Dusty wished the reconciliation bill was more conservative, he voted in favor of it when it passed the House. We’ll see what the Senate passes.”

A spokesperson for U.S. Sen. Mike Rounds, R-South Dakota, said Rounds met with a group of South Dakota lawmakers when they traveled to D.C. to voice opposition to the 45Q tax credits.

“Senator Rounds has long held the belief that many industry specific tax credits should not be perpetual, a belief which this group of landowners shares,” the statement said. “However, he has not had a chance to hear details of President Trump’s interest in this program. While many in South Dakota may oppose 45Q, it has been a popular proposal for other states for almost two decades and was included in the House-passed reconciliation bill.”

The office of Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-South Dakota, sent a similar reply that did not disclose his position on the tax credits.

“As congressional Republicans work with President Trump to pass legislation that will create long-term strength, safety, and prosperity for America, Sen. Thune appreciated the opportunity to meet with and hear firsthand from state legislators who have been on the front lines of this issue.”

Anti-pipeline activists are also concerned about a provision in an early draft of the House budget reconciliation bill that they said would have allowed federal regulators to approve natural gas and carbon dioxide pipelines over prohibitions in state law. That provision was removed before the bill passed the House. The rest of the statement from Thune’s office appeared to address that issue: “He understands their concerns, and he conveyed that the provision removed by the House is unlikely to be included in the final bill.”

The Senate bill excludes the proposed fees.","WASHINGTON (AP) — House and Senate Republicans are taking slightly different approaches when it comes to the tax cuts that lawmakers are looking to include in their massive tax and spending cuts bill.

Republicans in the two chambers don’t agree on the size of a deduction for state and local taxes. And they are at odds on such things as allowing people to use their health savings accounts to help pay for their gym membership, or whether electric vehicle and hybrid owners should have to pay an annual fee.

The House passed its version shortly before Memorial Day. Now the Senate is looking to pass its version.

While the two bills are similar on the major tax provisions, how they work out their differences in the coming weeks will determine how quickly they can get a final product over the finish line. President Donald Trump is pushing to have the legislation on his desk by July 4th.

Here’s a look at some of the key differences between the two bills:

Tax break for families

The child tax credit currently stands at $2,000 per child.

The House bill temporarily boosts the child tax credit to $2,500 for the 2025 through 2028 tax years, roughly the length of President Donald Trump’s second term. It also indexes the credit amount for inflation beginning in 2027.

The Senate bill provides a smaller, initial bump-up to $2,200, but the bump is permanent, with the credit amount indexed for inflation beginning next year.

Trump campaign promises

Trump promised on the campaign trail that he would seek to end income taxes on tips, overtime and Social Security benefits. Also, he would give car buyers a new tax break by allowing them to deduct the interest paid on auto loans.

The House and Senate bills incorporate those promises with temporary deductions lasting from the 2025 through 2028 tax years, but with some differences.

The House bill creates a deduction on tips for those working in jobs that have customarily received tips. The House also provides for a deduction for overtime that’s equal to the amount of OT a worker has earned.

The Senate bill comes with more restrictions. The deduction for tips is limited to $25,000 per taxpayer and the deduction for overtime is limited to $12,500 per taxpayer.

The House and Senate bills both provide a deduction of up to $10,000 for interest paid on loans for vehicles made in the United States.

And on Social Security, the bills don’t directly touch the program. Instead, they grant a larger tax deduction for Americans age 65 and older. The House sets the deduction at $4,000. The Senate sets it at $6,000.

Both chambers include income limits over which the new deductions begin to phase out.

More SALT

The caps on state and local tax deductions, known in Washington as the SALT cap, now stand at $10,000.

The House bill, in a bid to win over Republicans from New York, California and New Jersey, lifts the cap to $40,000 per household with incomes of less than $500,000. The credit phases down for households earning more than $500,000.

The Senate bill keeps the cap at $10,000. That’s a non-starter in the House, but Republicans in the two chambers will look to negotiate a final number over the coming weeks that both sides can accept.

Medicaid providers

The House bill prohibits states from establishing new provider taxes or increasing existing taxes. These are taxes that Medicaid providers, such as hospitals, pay to help states finance their share of Medicaid costs. In turn, the taxes allow states to receive increased federal matching funds while generally holding providers harmless through higher reimbursements that offset the taxes paid.

Such taxes now are effectively capped at 6%. The Senate looks to gradually lower that threshold for states that have expanded their Medicaid populations under the Affordable Care Act, or “Obamacare,” until it reaches 3.5% in 2031, with exceptions for nursing homes and intermediate care facilities.

Industry groups have warned that limiting the ability of states to tax providers may lead to some states making significant cuts to their Medicaid programs as they make up for the lost revenue in other ways. The Medicaid provision could be a flashpoint in the coming House and Senate negotiations. Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., was highly critical of the proposed Senate changes.

“This needs a lot of work. It’s really concerning and I’m really surprised by it,” he said. “Rural hospitals are going to be in bad shape.”

Tax breaks for business

The House bill would allow companies for five years to fully deduct equipment purchases and domestic research and development expenses. The Senate bill includes no sunset, making the tax breaks permanent, which was a key priority of powerful trade groups such as the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.

Clean energy tax credits

Republicans in both chambers are looking to scale back the clean energy tax credits enacted through then-President Joe Biden’s climate law. It aimed to boost the nation’s transition away from planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions toward renewable energy such as wind and solar power.

Under the Senate bill, the tax credits for clean energy and home energy efficiency would still be phased out, but less quickly than under the House bill. Still, advocacy groups fear that the final measure will threaten hundreds of thousands of jobs and drive up household energy costs.

Odds and ends

The House bill would allow millions of Americans to use their health savings accounts to pay for gym memberships, with a cap of $500 for single taxpayers and $1,000 for joint filers. The Senate bill doesn’t include such a provision.

The House reinstates a charitable deduction for non-itemizers of $150 per taxpayer. The Senate bill increases that deduction for donations to $1,000 per taxpayer.

Republicans in the House bill included a new annual fee of $250 for EV owners and $100 for hybrid owners that would be collected by state motor vehicle departments. The Senate bill excludes the proposed fees.

The LG Energy Solution, the South Korea’s top battery manufacturer, has recently established joint ventures in both Europe and the United States — partnering with France’s Derichebourg and Toyota Tsusho Co., respectively.

These initiatives mark LG’s first direct entry into recycling operations in these key global markets.

Meanwhile, SK Ecoplant, the construction and engineering arm of SK Group, is expanding its European operations in the Netherlands.

The facility will add an annual processing capacity of 25,000 metric tons of black mass, with the expansion slated for completion in 2025, the South Korean English-language daily newspaper added.

Going further, Posco-GS Eco Materials — a joint venture between Posco Holdings and GS Energy, with ownership split 51:49 — has also made a notable move by acquiring full ownership of its recycling unit, Posco HY Clean Metal.

This was achieved by purchasing the 35 percent stake held by China’s Huayou Cobalt in April, the South Korea’s news platform added.

These strategic shifts come amid a prolonged downturn in the battery recycling sector, fueled by weakened EV demand and falling prices of core battery minerals such as nickel, lithium, and manganese.

Lithium carbonate prices, which exceeded 450 Chinese yuan (USD 63) per kilogram in January 2023, have plummeted to about 50 yuan. Nickel has also seen a steep drop from over USD 31,000 per ton to around USD 20,000.

As a result, SungEel HiTech — one of only two battery recycling companies listed on Korea’s tech-heavy Kosdaq — has faced falling profitability and declining free cash flow for two consecutive years.

A joint recycling venture between SungEel HiTech and SK Innovation, announced in 2022, has been postponed indefinitely. Additionally, SK Ecoplant’s planned facilities in Gyeongju, North Gyeongsang Province, and in Kentucky have shown little to no progress for several years.

The news report added that the Korean industry watchers expect a sharp rise in used EV batteries reaching end-of-life status, generally around 10 years after initial use — a timeline that aligns with the global EV sales boom in the 2010s, which topped one million units by 2015.

With global EV adoption continuing to rise, the battery recycling market — valued at USD 8 billion in 2022 — is forecast to grow to as much as USD 53.57 billion by 2030, according to SNE Research.

Experts argue that participating in the recycling segment is becoming crucial for maintaining competitiveness in the battery industry, especially as regulatory pressure mounts globally for the use of recycled materials.

The European Union, for instance, mandates that EV batteries sold in the region must contain minimum percentages of recycled metals by 2031: 16 percent for cobalt, 85 percent for lead, 6 percent for lithium, and 6 percent for nickel. These thresholds will increase by 2036.

In the United States, the Inflation Reduction Act excludes EVs from tax credits if key battery materials are sourced from “foreign entities of concern,” further pushing manufacturers to procure materials domestically — often through recycling.",https://www.takeonedigitalnetwork.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/ANI-20250621074548-1.jpg,N,,2025-06-21 17:05:47.479084

“At the current pace, we are projecting a shortfall of energy,” said David Souder, executive director of PJM operations.
This summer, grid operators expect electricity demand could reach 154,000 megawatts, enough to power more than hundreds of millions of homes.
But in the event of an extreme heat wave, demand could spike to 166,000 megawatts.
“That’s when we look at potentially becoming short our reserves and the need to load what we call demand response,” Souder said.","COLUMBUS, Ohio — The country’s largest electric grid operator is issuing a warning that could directly impact central Ohio, as extreme summer heat and surging electricity demand from massive new developments may push the region’s energy supply to a tipping point.

Officials with PJM Interconnection, which manages the flow of electricity across 13 states, including Ohio, say rising demand from large-scale projects like the Intel chip plant, Google data center and Anduril facility — combined with intensifying summer heat—are straining the grid.

“At the current pace, we are projecting a shortfall of energy,” said David Souder, executive director of PJM operations.

The warning comes as PJM faces a growing challenge: aging power plants are retiring faster than new energy sources can come online. Souder emphasized the need to keep existing generators running longer to avoid outages.

“We really need to keep the generation that is scheduled to retire online until we can basically serve the load reliably,” Souder added.

This summer, grid operators expect electricity demand could reach 154,000 megawatts, enough to power more than hundreds of millions of homes. But in the event of an extreme heat wave, demand could spike to 166,000 megawatts. At that level, PJM says the system could start experiencing reserve shortfalls.

“That’s when we look at potentially becoming short our reserves and the need to load what we call demand response,” Souder said. “Demand response is a product where we will pay in-use customers, whether they be residential or commercial customers, to actually reduce their load and demand to maintain reliable systems.”

Relief may be coming, but not soon enough.

A new natural gas-fired power plant approved for construction in New Albany is expected to help offset central Ohio’s growing energy needs. However, the facility isn’t built yet. It’s unknown when it will be online to help offset PJM’s projected energy shortfall two years from now.

Despite the challenges, Souder said Ohio is in relatively good shape for this summer.

The bill now heads to the Senate, where it faces a final vote, expected next week, before becoming law.
Carney’s goal is to see big projects approved within two years, creating more certainty for companies and investors.
Not all Indigenous groups oppose the bill.
“We know that failing to uphold our legal responsibilities stopped projects, delayed projects, and we’re looking to advance projects.” She also said the major projects office would include an Indigenous advisory council.","Canada’s House of Commons cleared a bill to accelerate the building of major projects such as pipelines, but Indigenous groups are threatening to force a legal battle over it.

The legislation drafted by Prime Minister Mark Carney’s government aims to fast-track construction by allowing projects that are deemed in the “national interest” to receive a quicker review for environmental and other impacts. The bill now heads to the Senate, where it faces a final vote, expected next week, before becoming law.

Carney’s goal is to see big projects approved within two years, creating more certainty for companies and investors. The legislation, which meets an election campaign promise, creates a new federal office to handle the work of approvals.

“The process to build in this country, which has become too arduous, has taken too long, and has been holding us back, is changing,” he said at a news conference late Friday. “In the past, with every year that a proposal to build a port, a wind energy farm or a highway sat on an official’s desk, we were leaving investment, prosperity and jobs — people’s careers — on the table.”

But some Indigenous groups say they’re concerned the law gives the government power to ram projects through their territories without proper consultation.

If the bill passes, “nothing’s off the table” when it comes to legal challenges, Cindy Woodhouse Nepinak, national chief of the Assembly of First Nations, told lawmakers earlier this week. “You’re going to have legal wrangling right up the ying-yang if you don’t do the right thing and do this bill in a proper, respectful and good way. I think Canada can save itself years of litigation if it does that.”

Much of Carney’s news conference after the vote was devoted to addressing these concerns. He was joined by Indigenous Services Minister Mandy Gull-Masty.

“Through Indigenous equity and resource management, these projects will be built with Indigenous nations and communities,” Carney said, mentioning a C$10 billion ($7.3 billion) federal loan guarantee program which he doubled the size of and which has just started to underwrite deals.

Carney also said he’d meet First Nations on July 17, with more meetings afterward. Indigenous groups in Canada are playing a growing role in public and business affairs, following court victories as well as a cultural and political reckoning in the wake of Canada’s 2015 Truth and Reconciliation Commission, which advised 94 actions to redress historical wrongs done to them.

The Chiefs of Ontario, representing the province’s 133 First Nations, also pushed back against the bill. “Bill C-5 is a direct attack against the sovereignty and the jurisdiction of every First Nation in Ontario,” Ontario Regional Chief Abram Benedict told reporters this week.

The conflict evokes past controversies over large projects such as Northern Gateway, a proposed oil pipeline in western Canada that ran into significant opposition from Indigenous groups and was ultimately rejected in 2016 by the government of Justin Trudeau.

‘Turning Point’

Carney’s aim with the law is to signal a different approach to his Liberal predecessor. Some energy companies and other investors pulled back on infrastructure plans under Trudeau, citing long approval timelines and regulatory barriers.

First Nations are “not against development” but want to be included in the planning, said Alvin Fiddler, grand chief of the Nishnawbe Aski Nation in northern Ontario. He added that the legislation “will not apply in our territories” if it passes.

Not all Indigenous groups oppose the bill. The First Nations Major Projects Coalition, which has more than 170 members across Canada, said the bill may be “a turning point if it is designed and administered in true partnership.”

Dominic LeBlanc, the minister who would be responsible for designating projects as in the “national interest” under the legislation, and Rebecca Alty, the minister of Crown-Indigenous relations, defended the bill earlier this week in the Senate.

Ministers pointed out that one of the five criteria for a designating a project to be in the “national interest” is that it advances the interests of Indigenous people.

“I can appreciate where people are coming from, because to say, ‘Trust us, here’s the legislation’ — there’s been a lot of broken trust over the years,” Alty said. “We know that failing to uphold our legal responsibilities stopped projects, delayed projects, and we’re looking to advance projects.”

She also said the major projects office would include an Indigenous advisory council.

The bill, which includes a requirement that it be reviewed every five years, received the support of the Conservative Party. But some opposition lawmakers raised concerns and environmental groups have criticized the bill. One Liberal lawmaker voted against it, while one member of Carney’s cabinet — Minister of Canadian Identity and Culture Steven Guilbeault, a long-time environmentalist — did not vote.

The New Democratic Party successfully put forward a motion to split the bill, so that less contentious provisions that dismantle internal trade barriers could be voted on separately. That part of the legislation cleared the House as well.

That money will come from ratepayers instead — for example, as much as 3 cents more per kilowatt hour for a project using the production tax credit.
Alaska’s largest solar developer pulled out of all their planned projects based on uncertainty over tax credits.
If energy projects are canceled now, or infrastructure can’t be replaced, it locks our communities into volatile diesel and imported gas.
We need reasonable ‘start of construction’ eligibility, a more realistic phase out schedule for the production tax credit, investment tax credit and residential clean energy credit, and to replace the impossible paperwork mess of the “prohibited foreign entity” requirements with a workable sourcing rule.","For decades, federal support for renewable energy largely excluded Alaska while building new energy opportunities and capacity in the Lower 48. Nonprofit cooperatives, which generate nearly all of Alaska’s power, didn’t qualify. Hydropower, which is an important energy source in many communities, also didn’t qualify, or received a lesser credit.

Legislation passed in 2022 finally reformed these credits to work for Alaska. Today, the ‘elective pay’ provision allows not-for-profit entities like our electric cooperatives and governments to take the credit in cash, putting them on equal footing with the rest of the country. The new credit is technology-neutral, so hydro and geothermal can qualify. And the entire state of Alaska receives a 10% bonus on top of the 30% baseline.

As the U.S. Senate works on President Trump’s comprehensive budget reconciliation package – his ‘One Big Beautiful Bill’ – we urge Sen. Dan Sullivan and Sen. Lisa Murkowksi, as well as Rep. Nick Begich, to safeguard the federal investment tax credit and the production tax credit provisions. The House budget bill stripped the most important parts for Alaska before we can even benefit, and would drive up electric rates. Early Senate edits may soften some of these changes, but most Alaska projects won’t be able to access the incentives before they phase out.

Depending on the final text, the Railbelt stands to lose hundreds of millions of dollars, from the state’s proposed Dixon Diversion hydro expansion, planned wind farms, and solar on the Kenai Peninsula. That money will come from ratepayers instead — for example, as much as 3 cents more per kilowatt hour for a project using the production tax credit. This comes as fuel costs are driving up our already high rates, which have risen 10% in the past 18 months. Rural Alaska faces even steeper increases.

That’s if the projects happen at all. Alaska’s largest solar developer pulled out of all their planned projects based on uncertainty over tax credits. It takes years to get projects to the start line, and the state and federal grants that kickstarted them are disappearing. Ratepayers in other communities, like Kodiak, that have already made the move to renewables but must maintain and eventually replace their equipment, will also lose if these incentives are taken away. If energy projects are canceled now, or infrastructure can’t be replaced, it locks our communities into volatile diesel and imported gas. With the Senate expected to vote on final language for these provisions within the next few weeks, Alaska’s window to defend these benefits is rapidly closing.

Draft Senate language means many projects would have to start construction almost immediately to access the full credits, and phases them out fully over several years. Alaska’s remote logistics, long supply chains and short building seasons mean that a single delayed barge could make ratepayer costs jump. Slower-to-build projects like hydro plants don’t have a hope of meeting the schedule.

“Prohibited foreign entity” rules demand that utilities prove that no wire or microchip ever touched a blacklisted country. A small rural co-op has no chance of tracking this and could see money clawed back years later for an honest mistake.

Alaska needs our congressional delegation to help keep the elective pay option, technology neutrality, the 30% baseline, and Alaska’s 10% energy community bonus.

It is also important to fix the parts of this bill that don’t work for Alaska. We need reasonable ‘start of construction’ eligibility, a more realistic phase out schedule for the production tax credit, investment tax credit and residential clean energy credit, and to replace the impossible paperwork mess of the “prohibited foreign entity” requirements with a workable sourcing rule.

Our state has waited decades to benefit from federal clean energy incentives. These credits are our chance to finally diversify our energy system and build a more stable, affordable future. Let’s not eliminate Alaska’s opportunity before we can use it.",https://alaskabeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/51208-97b2bee208048313c0765f30b9ec55337b175a3e69dc7f98352e5738b28c4e94-2048x1367.jpg,N,,2025-06-21 16:07:03.238534

Average monthly payments have soared to around $745. A record share of Americans—nearly one in five—now shell out more than $1,000 per month for their cars.

Trump and his allies in Congress say they’re working to make cars affordable again. But experts who have examined the policies they've both proposed and enacted say the problem is likely to get even worse.

“It does not appear like any of the policies will result in people paying less to buy and own vehicles in 2028 or 2029 than they do today,” said Chris Harto, a senior policy analyst at Consumer Reports.

Take tariffs, for example. When Trump announced 25% tariffs on imported cars and car parts in April, he audaciously said: “You’re going to see prices go down.” While record-high post-pandemic inflation is finally cooling off, this promise ignores the very basics of what a tariff is. The whole point is to make the domestic industry more competitive by driving up the costs of importing a particular good.

Despite some automakers’ vows to keep prices low, any economist will tell you that vehicle prices will increase over time. It may not happen immediately—prices have remained remarkably stable this spring so far—but it will happen sooner or later.

U.S. tariffs will cost the auto industry $30 billion in 2026, the consulting firm AlixPartners estimates. Car companies will not absorb the hit for the good of the American consumer. Rather, AlixPartners expects them to pass on about 80% of those increased costs to buyers, with the ultimate price hike depending on where in the world a vehicle is made.

Vehicles produced outside of North America will be hit the hardest; prices for those cars will increase by approximately $4,400. AlixPartners expects the average vehicle sold in the U.S. to get $1,760 pricier. Repair bills will go up too, as the cost of car components increases.

At Trump’s direction, federal agencies are preparing to relax the standards that were pushing automakers to boost fuel economy and cut tailpipe emissions over time. The heads of the Environmental Protection Agency and Department of Transportation have cheered these rollbacks as a win for consumers, who will see vehicle prices drop as automakers are freed from onerous regulations.

Likewise, Senate Republicans have proposed dropping the fines for noncompliance with Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) rules to zero. They say their measure “Brings down automobile prices modestly by eliminating CAFE penalties on automakers that design cars to conform to the wishes of DC bureaucrats rather than consumers.”

The reality is that more fuel-efficient cars—the EVs and hybrids that these rules push automakers to produce—save people tons of money on gas over time. That’s part of why Americans have been flocking to hybrid cars in unprecedented numbers in the last few years.

“There’s almost a 0% chance—as close to a 0% chance as you can have—that eliminating these standards will reduce the cost of vehicles to consumers,” Harto said. “What it is going to do is drive up the fuel cost for consumers.”

If left to run their course, the Biden-era vehicle rules would deliver $6,000 in lifetime fuel savings for buyers of new vehicles, according to a Consumer Reports analysis.

Meanwhile, repealing tax credits for Americans who buy plug-in hybrids and EVs will inflate the upfront cost to get into some of the country’s cleanest vehicles.The Republicans’ sweeping budget reconciliation package is still making its way through Congress. But the death of EV tax credits seems to be a question of “when,” not “if.” The latest proposal from the Senate Finance Committee would eliminate the $4,000 rebate for buyers of used EVs within 90 days and end the $7,500 program for new EVs after 180 days.

Moreover, the one-two punch of tariffs and ending the EV tax credits threatens a new crop of more affordable electric cars coming soon—not all of which automakers planned to build in America. That leaves people stuck buying more expensive gas-guzzling options when they could have had cheaper alternatives.

Policy changes such as these that derail EV adoption will also increase demand for gasoline, inflating prices at the pump for all Americans. The Rhodium Group, a research firm, projects that gas prices will go up by between 25 and 37 cents per gallon by 2035 as a result of the House’s sweeping domestic policy bill, passed last month.

It may get more expensive to charge up your EV, too. Congress is on track to prematurely torpedo tax credits in the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act that subsidize the production of clean energy, as well as investments in new clean energy projects. And removing a tax credit is effectively a tax hike. The reversal could add up to $400 to some Americans’ annual electricity bills by 2035, one analysis found.

There are more direct cost increases on the table, too. The House’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act includes a $250 annual tax on owners of EVs and $100 fee for hybrids. The ostensible goal is to raise money for highway improvements by targeting people who pay less in federal gas taxes. But the fee is out of whack with what most Americans pay in gas taxes; Consumer Reports found that the average driver of a gas-guzzling V8 pickup truck only pays around $100 per year in gas taxes, while many other drivers pay far less.

To be sure, Trump also promised on the campaign trail to allow Americans to deduct car-loan interest from their taxable income. That could save some car buyers a few hundred dollars per year.

But, given the mountain of forces acting to drive costs up, that may be cold comfort for America’s drivers.",https://images.inkl.com/s3/article/lead_image/22153515/trump-car-prices.jpg,N,,2025-06-21 22:01:28.011200

Why it matters: This includes some of the state's most popular hiking, skiing and camping areas across the Western Slope.

The big picture: The Republican-led proposal would require the U.S. Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management to put up to 3.3 million acres on the market for housing development.

The bill's focus is on parcels outside of protected lands (like national parks, monuments or wilderness areas, which are exempt) but near roads and other development deemed suitable by local and state lawmakers.

The Wilderness Society estimates more than 250 million acres across 11 Western states could be eligible for sale.

Zoom in: In Colorado, that means some of its most prized public lands could be up for grabs, including sweeping sections of the Arapaho, San Juan and Rio Grande national forests.

Also on the line are iconic stretches of the Million Dollar Highway and beloved hiking spots near Kenosha and Guanella passes, especially popular during fall leaf-peeping season.

Follow the money: Most of the revenue — projected between $5 billion and $10 billion over the next decade — would go to the U.S. Treasury. Just 5% would trickle down to local governments.

It's unclear how much the sale of public lands would negatively impact the outdoor recreation economy, which generated $1.2 trillion in economic output and supported 5 million jobs nationwide in 2023.

Reality check: A recent Headwaters Economics report found less than 2% of public lands in the West near housing-hungry towns are actually suitable for development, and could be complicated due to high wildfire risk.

The fine print: For the first decade, the land could only be sold for housing or related infrastructure — but after 10 years, that restriction vanishes, opening the door to virtually any kind of development, from strip malls to oil rigs.

What they're saying: Colorado Democratic U.S. Sen. John Hickenlooper, who sits on the Senate Energy and Natural Resources committee, told CPR no Democrats on the committee were given advance notice or could offer input, despite their states being on the list.

""I was shocked,"" Hickenlooper said. ""That's not the way government's supposed to work.""

Now it’s time for policy and investment to catch up.” Battery Storage Grew 41 Percent In 12 Months When it comes to battery storage, Bloomberg agrees.
In 2024, battery storage represented just 2 percent of power capacity in the US.
BNEF expects utility-scale battery storage to nearly double this year despite how hostile to renewables the failed administration in Washington tries to be.
In all, about 18 gigawatts of new battery storage capacity is expected to be added in the US in 2025.","June 21 is the longest day of the year in the northern hemisphere. Tomorrow, the days start getting shorter again. What better time for Ember, the clean energy advocacy folks, to release its latest battery report. Here’s the headline: “Batteries are now cheap enough to unleash solar’s full potential, getting as close as 97% of the way to delivering constant electricity supply 24 hours across 365 days cost-effectively in the sunniest places.” OK. First things first. Obviously not everywhere on Earth qualifies as one of the planet’s “sunniest places.” To explain that further, Ember has supplied this helpful graphic.

The Ember report focuses primarily on generating enough solar power to operate a typical residence. What is typical, of course, varies a great deal depending on where you are the world. Ember says, “On an average day in a sunny city like Las Vegas, providing 1 kW of stable, round-the-clock power requires 5 kW of fixed solar panels paired with a 17 kWh battery. This combination can deliver a constant 1 kW of solar electricity every hour over a full 24-hour period — and this amount of battery will be sufficient for most regions across the world.”

CleanTechnica readers, being well above average, will instantly realize that many homes, especially in wealthy societies, consume far more than 1 kW of electricity during many hours of the day. According to Google, the typical home on the US uses about 30 kW of electricity a day, which is more than the 24 kW Ember is projecting. But let’s not get lost in the weeds here. What Ember is really saying is that the levelized cost of electricity from solar plus storage is now the lowest of all available energy sources and that solar is getting closer to being dispatchable — meaning it will be there when needed — with every passing month and year. Here’s the synopsis of the report:

The emergence of 24-hour solar generation marks a fundamental shift in how solar fits into the broader power system. With the ability to deliver electricity around-the-clock, solar can now support 24/7 clean energy contracts (PPAs) for industries which require continuous power, not just daytime supply. This is extremely valuable for emerging economies, where solar-powered industrial and economic zones can emerge in sunny areas far from existing grid infrastructure. At the same time, it can also bring substantial potential savings on grid expansion costs – allowing up to five times as much solar capacity to be installed behind the same grid connection, maximizing existing assets and deferring costly upgrades.

As costs continue to fall and deployment accelerates, solar-plus-storage is emerging as the default model for clean power in the sunniest parts of the world — both on and off the grid. To fully realize its potential, energy policy must now catch up, by integrating 24 hour solar generation into planning frameworks, electricity market design, and infrastructure development strategies.

“This is a turning point in the clean energy transition,” say Kostantsa Rangelova, a ‍global electricity analyst at Ember. “Around-the-clock solar is no longer just a technical possibility and distant dream, but an economic reality. It unlocks game changing opportunities for energy-hungry industries like data centers and manufacturing. Solar will be unleashed. The change is new — the costs and quality of grid batteries have improved so much in the last 12 months. Now it’s time for policy and investment to catch up.”

Battery Storage Grew 41 Percent In 12 Months

When it comes to battery storage, Bloomberg agrees. It says that from April 2024 through April 2025, energy storage in the US surged from 18 gigawatts to 25 gigawatts, a 41 percent increase, according to federal data. In Arizona, battery capacity nearly tripled; in Texas, it has almost doubled.

“Renewable electricity is setting records every few days and comprised almost one-third of all US power generation in March. Batteries can make sure those electrons hit at the most opportune time – or at least that they don’t go to waste. Along the way, they’ll drag electricity prices down, speed the retirement of fossil fuel plants and preclude plans for new ones,” Bloomberg says.

Jan Rosenow, head of the energy program at the Oxford Environmental Change Institute, told Bloomberg, “Twenty years ago, the main problem with renewables was that they were so expensive. Now renewables are cheap, but we need to be able to match that supply to demand. For that, battery storage is clearly one of the best tools in the box.” He says there is a surge in grid-scale battery installations and because costs are dropping, more utilities will adopt storage as their default strategy for increasing the capacity of their grids. “Storage is now where solar was maybe 10 years ago,” he said. “That’s kind of how it feels to me. It’s really mind blowing.”

According to the North American Electric Reliability Corporation, three of the six US major power grids are at risk of power outages this summer. That could place about a third of all Americans at risk of power failures this summer. NERC told Bloomberg this week that the odds of an energy emergency in Texas this summer are down from about 15 percent a few months ago to 3.6 percent today, thanks to increased storage battery capacity.

“Reliability is the ability to react to sudden changes in the grid,” said Chris McKissack, chief executive officer of Fullmark Energy, which is building two storage sites in Texas. “And when it comes to reacting, nothing moves faster than battery storage.”

Last summer, there were no major power outages in the US, a success the Department of Energy primarily attributed to new solar generation and storage. Officials at ERCOT in Texas say batteries have played a critical role in lowering retail prices of electricity, especially in the summer. They expect storage in the state to triple over the next five years.

In 2024, battery storage represented just 2 percent of power capacity in the US. BNEF expects utility-scale battery storage to nearly double this year despite how hostile to renewables the failed administration in Washington tries to be. In all, about 18 gigawatts of new battery storage capacity is expected to be added in the US in 2025. Those batteries are often the most affordable way for utility companies to add capacity. The average price for stationary storage systems in 2024 was $125 per kWh — 19% lower than in 2023 according to BNEF.

All of this good news about storage batteries — both residential and grid scale — does not mention what the source is of the millions of battery cells needed to construct those storage systems. But the answer is clear. China dominates not only the manufacturing of battery cells but also the supply chains for the raw materials that go into making them. China is also by far the largest supplier of solar panels. In the age of tariff diplomacy (which is really the opposite of diplomacy), the implications for the US could be enormous.",https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Prevalon_Media-e1712014901623.jpg,N,,2025-06-21 16:06:57.310516

The U.K.’s five existing nuclear power reactors contributed 14 percent of the country’s electricity in 2024, marking a decrease from the peak production of the 1990s, when 18 nuclear reactors provided over a quarter of the country’s power.

This is part of a Labour government plan to accelerate the country’s green transition by expanding its clean energy capacity and shifting away from a reliance on fossil fuels.

For decades, the U.K. stopped developing its nuclear energy capacity, due to poor public perception of the energy source, the high costs involved with developing new projects, and a focus on other energy sources, predominantly fossil fuels. The U.K.’s five existing nuclear power reactors contributed 14 percent of the country’s electricity in 2024, marking a decrease from the peak production of the 1990s, when 18 nuclear reactors provided over a quarter of the country’s power. Four of the operational plants are due to close before 2030, even with plans to expand their lifetimes. However, in recent months, there has been talk of a nuclear renaissance in the U.K.

Britain’s energy secretary, Ed Miliband, who has long backed nuclear power, announced plans this month for a $19 billion investment to develop a conventional new nuclear power station, and further funding to support the small modular reactor industry and advance nuclear energy research. The nuclear programme will “get Britain off the fossil fuel rollercoaster”, according to Miliband. The energy secretary said that supporting nuclear power was the only way to achieve the government’s net-zero emissions pledges by mid-century, especially with the U.K. energy demand set to rise. He also stressed the government’s unwavering support for renewable energy.

“I’m doing this because of my belief that climate change is the biggest long-term threat facing us… The truth is that we have this massive challenge to get off fossil fuels. That is the central driving ambition of the government’s clean energy superpower mission. We know that we’re going to have to see electricity demand at least double, by 2050,” said Miliband. “All of the expert advice says nuclear has a really important role to play in the energy system. In any sensible reckoning, this is essential to get to our clean power and net zero ambitions.”

The government will spend billions on the completion of the Sizewell C nuclear plant on England’s south Suffolk coast. The development is expected to support the creation of 10,000 jobs and, once operational, the plant will power up to 6 million homes. The long-awaited investment decision quashes the uncertainty surrounding Sizewell C, where the French operator EDF has been looking to secure funding for 15 years. The government hopes the funding will allow Sizewell C to be developed under a different model to Hinkley Point C, to avoid unnecessary delays and spiralling costs.

The government has also earmarked almost $3.4 billion in funding for the development of the U.K.’s first SMRs, with Great British Energy (GBN) – Nuclear choosing Rolls-Royce as the preferred company to construct one of Europe’s first SMR programmes. Rolls-Royce beat the U.S. companies Holtec and GE Hitachi to win the bid. The U.K. firm has been in wait-and-see mode, as GBN delayed its nuclear competition again and again in recent years, which Rolls-Royce said held them back when it came to SMR development.

Rolls-Royce hopes that the programme will attract higher levels of private investment once established. There are no SMR sites currently operational anywhere in the world, although several countries are investing in developing the technology. It is not clear where Rolls-Royce will develop its first SMRs, although some believe they will be on the site of retired nuclear power stations, such as Oldbury in Gloucestershire and Wylfa in north Wales.

Another $3.4 billion over five years will go to research and development into nuclear fusion energy. The fusion investment in Nottinghamshire will support development on the site of the old West Burton coal-fired power station. The government hopes the investment will support its Just Transition aims by creating new jobs in traditional energy-producing regions.

Critics of nuclear energy say the funds could be better used to expand the U.K.’s renewable energy capacity, which is far cheaper and faster to develop than nuclear power plants. However, the government and those in the nuclear sector point out that nuclear power plants deliver stable power 24 hours a day, compared to solar and wind farms, which require battery storage to achieve this. In addition, the reactors being developed “will produce low-carbon electricity for 80 or possibly 100 years, 24/7, providing around a 10th of the current UK electricity needs”, according to Mark Wenman at Imperial College London.

The U.K. government is supporting a nuclear renaissance, after years of stagnation, which it hopes will help Britain to achieve its net-zero pledges by 2050. In addition to expanding the country’s renewable energy capacity, the government will invest billions in the development of new conventional nuclear reactors and SMR technology to accelerate the U.K.’s green transition.

What's happening?

Mosaic and SunPower also met this fate within the last year, as EnergySage detailed, prompting the question: ""Will more major solar companies follow suit?""

The move was no surprise because of ""an unpredictable political and regulatory landscape, high interest rates, and persistent inflation,"" according to the independent clean energy advocate. These factors have slowed demand for solar energy and financing, particularly among residential customers. From 2023 to 2024, Americans installed 32% fewer solar systems on their homes.

""This model thrived when interest rates were low — particularly in 2020 when the Federal Reserve slashed rates to near zero,"" EnergySage reported. ""But as rates climbed in recent years, the cost of borrowing money skyrocketed, shrinking profit margins for solar companies reliant on financing. Sunnova, SunPower, and others found themselves caught between rising capital costs and slowing customer demand, a squeeze that led to financial distress.""

Why is this important?

The platform highlighted the necessity of government policies and subsidies in the industry's development, noting California solar installations dropped by 45% after a 2023 rule reduced net metering credit values by 75%.

This move may have helped utilities, but it significantly cut residents' ability to benefit from their investments by selling energy back to the grid. Installing solar panels also lowers utility bills to or near $0 and eliminates the production of heat-trapping gases from the use of dirty energy sources. It helped to topple SunPower, too, EnergySage stated.

The high upfront cost of solar systems — about $29,000 — also means many customers take out loans to pay for the infrastructure. But with costs and interest rates rising since the coronavirus pandemic, those circumstances have become untenable.

What's being done about solar adoption?

The Trump administration's push to end Inflation Reduction Act incentives and tax breaks for clean energy investments has had a chilling effect on the solar industry and renewable energy in general, EnergySage said. Those subsidies could be gone next year with an act of Congress, but they are still available now.

EnergySage offers free services that can help you land nearly $10,000 for a solar installation. Enter basic information about your home and situation, and then compare quotes from vetted installers. It has a helpful mapping tool, too, showing state-by-state costs as well as incentive details.

“It does not appear like any of the policies will result in people paying less to buy and own vehicles in 2028 or 2029 than they do today,” said Chris Harto, a senior policy analyst at Consumer Reports.

Take tariffs, for example. When Trump announced 25% tariffs on imported cars and car parts in April, he audaciously said: “You’re going to see prices go down.” While record-high post-pandemic inflation is finally cooling off, this promise ignores the very basics of what a tariff is. The whole point is to make the domestic industry more competitive by driving up the costs of importing a particular good.

Despite some automakers’ vows to keep prices low, any economist will tell you that vehicle prices will increase over time. It may not happen immediately—prices have remained remarkably stable this spring so far—but it will happen sooner or later.

U.S. tariffs will cost the auto industry $30 billion in 2026, the consulting firm AlixPartners estimates. Car companies will not absorb the hit for the good of the American consumer. Rather, AlixPartners expects them to pass on about 80% of those increased costs to buyers, with the ultimate price hike depending on where in the world a vehicle is made.

Vehicles produced outside of North America will be hit the hardest; prices for those cars will increase by approximately $4,400. AlixPartners expects the average vehicle sold in the U.S. to get $1,760 pricier. Repair bills will go up too, as the cost of car components increases.

At Trump’s direction, federal agencies are preparing to relax the standards that were pushing automakers to boost fuel economy and cut tailpipe emissions over time. The heads of the Environmental Protection Agency and Department of Transportation have cheered these rollbacks as a win for consumers, who will see vehicle prices drop as automakers are freed from onerous regulations.

Likewise, Senate Republicans have proposed dropping the fines for noncompliance with Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) rules to zero. They say their measure “Brings down automobile prices modestly by eliminating CAFE penalties on automakers that design cars to conform to the wishes of DC bureaucrats rather than consumers.”

The reality is that more fuel-efficient cars—the EVs and hybrids that these rules push automakers to produce—save people tons of money on gas over time. That’s part of why Americans have been flocking to hybrid cars in unprecedented numbers in the last few years.

“There’s almost a 0% chance—as close to a 0% chance as you can have—that eliminating these standards will reduce the cost of vehicles to consumers,” Harto said. “What it is going to do is drive up the fuel cost for consumers.”

If left to run their course, the Biden-era vehicle rules would deliver $6,000 in lifetime fuel savings for buyers of new vehicles, according to a Consumer Reports analysis.

Meanwhile, repealing tax credits for Americans who buy plug-in hybrids and EVs will inflate the upfront cost to get into some of the country’s cleanest vehicles.The Republicans’ sweeping budget reconciliation package is still making its way through Congress. But the death of EV tax credits seems to be a question of “when,” not “if.” The latest proposal from the Senate Finance Committee would eliminate the $4,000 rebate for buyers of used EVs within 90 days and end the $7,500 program for new EVs after 180 days.

Moreover, the one-two punch of tariffs and ending the EV tax credits threatens a new crop of more affordable electric cars coming soon—not all of which automakers planned to build in America. That leaves people stuck buying more expensive gas-guzzling options when they could have had cheaper alternatives.

Policy changes such as these that derail EV adoption will also increase demand for gasoline, inflating prices at the pump for all Americans. The Rhodium Group, a research firm, projects that gas prices will go up by between 25 and 37 cents per gallon by 2035 as a result of the House’s sweeping domestic policy bill, passed last month.

It may get more expensive to charge up your EV, too. Congress is on track to prematurely torpedo tax credits in the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act that subsidize the production of clean energy, as well as investments in new clean energy projects. And removing a tax credit is effectively a tax hike. The reversal could add up to $400 to some Americans’ annual electricity bills by 2035, one analysis found.

There are more direct cost increases on the table, too. The House’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act includes a $250 annual tax on owners of EVs and $100 fee for hybrids. The ostensible goal is to raise money for highway improvements by targeting people who pay less in federal gas taxes. But the fee is out of whack with what most Americans pay in gas taxes; Consumer Reports found that the average driver of a gas-guzzling V8 pickup truck only pays around $100 per year in gas taxes, while many other drivers pay far less.

To be sure, Trump also promised on the campaign trail to allow Americans to deduct car-loan interest from their taxable income. That could save some car buyers a few hundred dollars per year.

But, given the mountain of forces acting to drive costs up, that may be cold comfort for America’s drivers.",https://cdn.motor1.com/images/mgl/KbYKEM/s1/trump-car-prices.jpg,N,,2025-06-21 16:06:53.153311

Our seasons have shifted — just last winter, it still felt like summer well into November. This isn’t normal. It’s a warning sign of a growing public health crisis.

Arizona is heating up faster than much of the country. Our “hot season” now lasts for months, and escaping the heat can be a matter of life or death. For seniors, kids, outdoor workers and those with chronic illnesses, extreme heat combined with aging homes and high energy costs poses a deadly threat.

Arizona’s deadly duo: Extreme heat and air pollution

The health impacts of extreme heat are well-documented. Heat can trigger a heart failure exacerbation, dehydration, heatstroke and worsen respiratory issues. On my floor at the hospital, we often see heart failure cases surge in summer as heat, dehydration and stress all play a role in sending people to the ER. And when patients arrive with multiple health issues — like chronic conditions paired with heat-related exposures — their hospital stays are often longer and their recoveries more difficult.

The threat is worse for those without stable housing. Living outdoors with no shade, water or air-conditioning can be fatal. In Phoenix, over 28,000 people and in Tucson, over 66,000 people, often low-income families and communities of color facing poor infrastructure and limited cooling, live in these hotter zones. This disparity is also evident in our hospitals: those who are hardest hit often have the fewest resources.

But it’s not just the thermometer we need to worry about. Our heat crisis is exacerbated by dangerously high air pollution levels. High temperatures accelerate the formation of ozone, a harmful pollutant that inflames the lungs and exacerbates heart and respiratory issues. The American Lung Association gave Gila, Maricopa, Pima and Pinal counties “F” grades for their high number of unhealthy ozone days, highlighting the urgent need for solutions that address both climate and public health.

Clean energy incentives: A health solution hiding in plain sight

Thanks to investments from the Inflation Reduction Act and the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, there’s new hope for families struggling to stay cool and safe. Programs funded by these laws are helping Arizonans weatherize their homes, install energy-efficient cooling systems, and reduce their utility bills. For example, installing a heat pump A/C system could come with a $2,000 tax credit, resulting in an estimated $500 reduction in annual energy costs.

But for too many, the danger doesn’t end indoors. Older homes with poor insulation and outdated cooling systems can quickly turn into ovens. High electricity costs make it difficult for families to run their A/C as often as needed. On average, low-income households spend nearly 14% of their income on energy, compared to just 3% for higher-income families. For seniors on fixed incomes, it can mean an impossible choice: keep the air conditioning on or afford essential medication.

With nearly 1,000 Arizonans lost to heat-related deaths between 2012 and 2022, we need every tool to make homes safer, and Arizona’s newly launched Home Electrification and Appliance Rebates Program is one of the strongest tools we’ve got.

Led by the Governor’s Office of Resiliency and funded through the IRA, HEAR offers up to $14,000 in rebates to help low- and moderate-income families upgrade appliances, insulation and electric panels, covering up to 100% of costs for low-income households and 50% for moderate-income ones. HEAR helps families save money, stay cool, breathe easier and avoid dangerous heat exposure — all while easing strain on the electrical grid.

Arizona is leading, but our progress is at risk

Arizona has already seen the benefits of clean energy investment. Thanks to the IRA, our state has attracted over $12.75 billion and created nearly 13,000 new jobs, building a sustainable economy rooted in community health.

But this progress isn’t guaranteed. Repealing clean energy incentives could raise energy costs by nearly $400 per household and stall momentum. Recent Executive Orders and the recent reconciliation bill, which could cut or pause key federal grants, are putting lives and hard-earned progress at risk. Here in Tucson, it felt like the rug was pulled out from under our community when we learned that a $20 million Community Change Grant, meant to help low-income neighborhoods cope with extreme heat, may be canceled.

As a nurse, I treat the symptoms of extreme heat daily. But if we want real change, we need to address the root causes — and that means doubling down on clean energy solutions. I would ask any policymaker delaying or rolling back these investments: What’s the plan to keep people safe as our summers grow hotter and more dangerous?

This isn’t just about climate. It’s about saving lives.

If we want a healthier, safer Arizona, we must protect the programs and policies that make that possible.

In a landmark move that could redefine the roadmap for hardware and manufacturing startups in the cooling sector, Daikin Airconditioning India Pvt. Ltd. has inked a strategic partnership with the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT), Government of India.

This collaboration isn’t just another corporate MoU. It signals the coming together of two forces: a global air-conditioning powerhouse and a national vision to empower Indian innovators in climate-smart technology.

Daikin-DPIIT - What’s the Big Idea Behind the Partnership?

At its core, the agreement aims to nurture product-centric Indian startups working in key areas like:

Energy optimization

Climate-resilient technologies

Cooling innovations tailored for rural India

While the air-conditioning industry has long been dominated by established players, the need of the hour is innovation that is not just efficient but also sustainable and localized. That’s where this partnership steps in—to bridge the gap between market-ready climate solutions and early-stage manufacturing talent.

Daikin India has committed to offering mentorship, pilot project support, and technical incubation to startups that align with these priorities. The initiative will focus on creating an ecosystem where young Indian companies can thrive with the right backing—technically and commercially.

The Cooling Sector’s Startup Moment

India's air-conditioning market is booming, with growth projections estimating exponential demand—both in urban metros and rural hinterlands. As access to modern amenities becomes more equitable, the need for low-cost, energy-efficient, and sustainable cooling becomes non-negotiable.

“India’s air-conditioning market is poised for robust growth, and this partnership is a timely step to empower Indian startups that are driving innovation in climate tech and localized manufacturing,” the DPIIT said in a statement.

This sentiment finds resonance with the ‘Make in India’ and ‘Startup India’ campaigns, which have consistently pushed for the development of resilient, self-sustaining, and globally competitive manufacturing ecosystems.

For hardware startups in the cooling and climate tech space—traditionally sidelined by software-dominated startup narratives—this partnership could be a game changer.

Why This Partnership Matters

This is not the first time a multinational has joined hands with the Indian government to support local innovation. But Daikin’s focused attention on hardware-led manufacturing startups, particularly in an essential and under-tapped segment like cooling, makes it especially significant.

Let’s look at what makes this collaboration unique:

Bringing Deep Expertise to the Table: As a 100% subsidiary of Japan’s Daikin Industries Ltd., Daikin India brings decades of global experience and cutting-edge R&D in the HVAC (heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning) space.

From Pilot to Product: Startups often struggle to move from idea to scale due to lack of access to real-world testing and market pilots. Daikin’s involvement can give these innovators access to live environments, customer feedback loops, and possibly even procurement opportunities.

Focus on Rural Innovation: In a country where rural India is still underserved in terms of reliable and affordable cooling solutions, this initiative puts much-needed spotlight on rural-first innovations. These could range from solar-powered cooling devices to low-GWP (Global Warming Potential) refrigerant systems tailored for low-energy usage.

Building the Climate-Tech Value Chain: With the climate-tech sector gradually finding its footing in India, this kind of government-industry collaboration adds muscle to the value chain. From concept to commercialization, such partnerships could provide the missing links.

The Larger Context: Climate Urgency Meets Startup Energy

Climate change isn’t knocking at the door—it’s already in. From heatwaves in Delhi to water crises in Bengaluru, India is experiencing the brunt of global warming. Cooling is no longer a luxury; it’s a climate necessity. Yet, the solutions can’t come at the cost of increased carbon footprints.

This is where climate-conscious cooling startups—working on green refrigerants, off-grid cooling, and efficient energy management systems—have a crucial role to play. And with the backing of industry leaders like Daikin and policymakers from DPIIT, they now have the ecosystem to experiment, grow, and scale.

This move is also expected to create ripple effects across related sectors like electronics, clean energy, smart manufacturing, and IoT, fostering a broader innovation culture around sustainable infrastructure.

What’s Next for Startups?

If you’re a startup innovating in climate cooling, rural tech, or green manufacturing, this could be your moment. While the full details of selection criteria and engagement models are yet to be rolled out, DPIIT’s involvement suggests a structured and transparent approach.

We can also expect further announcements in terms of:

Calls for applications and startup cohorts

Industry roundtables and mentoring sessions

Pilots for product validation

Opportunities for co-development and possible procurement

The Daikin-DPIIT collaboration isn’t just about air-conditioning. It’s about building a cooler, greener, and more startup-driven India. It opens up a vital corridor between global industrial knowledge and Indian grassroots innovation.

As India aspires to become a global manufacturing hub and lead the charge in climate action, such partnerships serve as crucial proof points. The next big idea in cooling may well come from a small lab in Bengaluru or a workshop in Pune—with Daikin’s lab doors and DPIIT’s policy windows wide open to help it succeed.",https://img-cdn.publive.online/fit-in/1200x675/tice-news-prod/media/media_files/2025/06/21/daikin-india-joins-hands-with-dpiit-to-boost-startup-led-innovation-2025-06-21-12-21-34.jpg,N,,2025-06-21 19:05:27.111604

The full text of the Senate Finance Committee’s 549-page version of the massive tax and spending bill would make permanent a number of business-friendly tax cuts from President Donald Trump’s first term before they expire, including a trio dubbed the “big three.”

Tucked into the lengthy text, the Senate committee proposed to permanently allow 100% corporate bonus depreciation related to capital investments, as well as expensing for corporate research and development costs and the use of more favorable calculations related to interest expenses deductions, according to Marc Gerson, a partner who specializes in tax policy at the law firm of Miller & Chevalier. The House has proposed to extend the relief through 2029, he said.

Dive Insight:

The budget legislation lays the foundation for much of President Trump’s domestic agenda, encompassing defense, border security and other priorities.

The Senate language is now going through a process known as the “Byrd Bath,” Gerson said, through which the Senate parliamentarian considers arguments from lawmakers for pulling pieces of the bill out that don’t align with the Byrd rule, which requires that reconciliation bills be focused on fiscal issues.

“You could see extraneous provisions pulled out of the bill just to make sure it doesn’t face procedural problems on the Senate floor,” Gerson said. For example, the Senate parliamentarian blocked a proposal to fold the PCAOB into the SEC due to budget reconciliation rule violations, The Wall Street Journal reported Friday.

To pay for their projects, Entergy Louisiana forecasts a potential $8 rate hike for residential customers over the next five years.
Entergy also recently proposed a suite of demand response programs with the Louisiana Public Service Commission to help reduce the pressure.
For industrial and commercial users, companies like Enel X will manage large-scale power reductions.","(The Center Square) – The Midcontinent Independent System Operator is warning that “immediate action” is needed to address rising risks to resource adequacy as electricity demand across the region accelerates sharply due to artificial intelligence, electric vehicles and industrial expansion.

“Load growth is accelerating, driven by economic development such as data centers, onshoring and new industries,” the report states. The survey “calls for immediate action on capacity additions, strategic retirements and reliability reforms amid increasingly complex seasonal and load growth challenges.”

MISO, which oversees the power grid in 15 U.S. states including Louisiana, released new projections showing demand could surge by more than 400 terawatt-hours by 2044. This includes up to 241 TWh from data centers alone, 91 TWh from electric vehicles, 105 TWh from industrial electrification and 43 TWh from building electrification.

“At least 3.1 gigawatts of additional capacity beyond the committed capacity will be needed to meet the projected planning reserve margin forecast,” the survey said.

Aubrey Johnson, MISO’s vice president of system planning and competitive transmission said that there were sufficient resources for the current planning year (2025 to 2026), “but beyond that, there are some challenges.”

Tom Butz from Minnesota Power said in a MISO webinar that he was still not totally convinced the planned demand capacity would be enough.

“There is a lot of things coming our way,” Butz said. “And I’m not in the hyper-convinced zone of saying ‘that new generation is going to be able to keep up with all of this.'”

There is currently 100 gigawatts sitting in MISO’s queue,” Casey Baker, senior program manager at GridLab, told The Center Square. “If even a fraction of this generation came online it would greatly improve MISO’s position.”

In Louisiana, some of the most high-profile projects contributing to demand growth are already underway. Entergy Louisiana, the state’s largest utility, has submitted more than $3 billion in transmission and infrastructure upgrades to MISO to accommodate new industrial customers, including Meta’s data center in Richland Parish and Hyundai’s new steel plant in Ascension Parish.

Entergy submitted 14 projects to MISO in 2025 total more than $3 billion, including $498 million in upgrades for two industrial loads at the RiverPlex MegaPark in Ascension Parish, where the Hyundai facility will be located.

“If new resource additions are not made promptly or retirements are delayed, resource adequacy risk will continue to grow,” the MISO report concludes.

Entergy is indeed adding such resources, including new and upgraded transmission lines and substations.

Entergy will construct a new substation in Iberville Parish, called Commodore, that will connect two major voltage systems and help manage large amounts of electricity.

A new 60-mile high-voltage line will be also built between the Waterford and Commodore substations.

MISO, on the other hand, is pursuing a range of grid reforms, including changes to its capacity accreditation rules, resource adequacy modeling, and project deployment timelines, according to the survey. A new accreditation system, Direct Loss of Load is expected by the 2028/29 planning year to better reflect each power source’s actual reliability during high-stress events.

Accreditation refers to the process MISO uses to assign a reliability value to each power resource — such as a power plant — based on how dependable that resource is during times of high electricity demand or grid stress.

To pay for their projects, Entergy Louisiana forecasts a potential $8 rate hike for residential customers over the next five years. Entergy noted that this is an incomplete estimate.

Entergy also recently proposed a suite of demand response programs with the Louisiana Public Service Commission to help reduce the pressure.

“Some items that will increase the cost of rates on one part of the bill, may in fact reduce the cost of total bills in the end,” Logan Burke, executive director of the Alliance For Affordable Energy told The Center Square. “For example, if a demand response program is effective, it may reduce congestion costs related to energy markets, or it can even reduce the needed and costs for other generation investments in future. This can also be true for transmission investments.”

Demand response programs offer incentives to customers who reduce or shift their electricity use during peak periods. For residential customers, Entergy is rolling out smart thermostat and EV charging programs. For industrial and commercial users, companies like Enel X will manage large-scale power reductions.

Entergy estimates the demand-side programs could reduce consumption by 95 megawatts in year two and up to 155 megawatts by year five.",https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/thecentersquare.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/7/d2/7d22ac8a-061f-4a2a-b9bb-031c00452207/6855c0b352ad3.image.jpg,N,,2025-06-21 19:06:13.540712

The Senate bill doesn’t include such a provision.
The Senate bill excludes the proposed fees.","WASHINGTON (AP) — House and Senate Republicans are taking slightly different approaches when it comes to the tax cuts that lawmakers are looking to include in their massive tax and spending cuts bill.

Republicans in the two chambers don’t agree on the size of a deduction for state and local taxes. And they are at odds on such things as allowing people to use their health savings accounts to help pay for their gym membership, or whether electric vehicle and hybrid owners should have to pay an annual fee.

The House passed its version shortly before Memorial Day. Now the Senate is looking to pass its version.

While the two bills are similar on the major tax provisions, how they work out their differences in the coming weeks will determine how quickly they can get a final product over the finish line. President Donald Trump is pushing to have the legislation on his desk by July 4th.

Here’s a look at some of the key differences between the two bills:

Tax break for families

The child tax credit currently stands at $2,000 per child.

The House bill temporarily boosts the child tax credit to $2,500 for the 2025 through 2028 tax years, roughly the length of President Donald Trump’s second term. It also indexes the credit amount for inflation beginning in 2027.

The Senate bill provides a smaller, initial bump-up to $2,200, but the bump is permanent, with the credit amount indexed for inflation beginning next year.

Trump campaign promises

Trump promised on the campaign trail that he would seek to end income taxes on tips, overtime and Social Security benefits. Also, he would give car buyers a new tax break by allowing them to deduct the interest paid on auto loans.

The House and Senate bills incorporate those promises with temporary deductions lasting from the 2025 through 2028 tax years, but with some differences.

The House bill creates a deduction on tips for those working in jobs that have customarily received tips. The House also provides for a deduction for overtime that’s equal to the amount of OT a worker has earned.

The Senate bill comes with more restrictions. The deduction for tips is limited to $25,000 per taxpayer and the deduction for overtime is limited to $12,500 per taxpayer.

The House and Senate bills both provide a deduction of up to $10,000 for interest paid on loans for vehicles made in the United States.

And on Social Security, the bills don’t directly touch the program. Instead, they grant a larger tax deduction for Americans age 65 and older. The House sets the deduction at $4,000. The Senate sets it at $6,000.

Both chambers include income limits over which the new deductions begin to phase out.

More SALT

The caps on state and local tax deductions, known in Washington as the SALT cap, now stand at $10,000.

The House bill, in a bid to win over Republicans from New York, California and New Jersey, lifts the cap to $40,000 per household with incomes of less than $500,000. The credit phases down for households earning more than $500,000.

The Senate bill keeps the cap at $10,000. That’s a non-starter in the House, but Republicans in the two chambers will look to negotiate a final number over the coming weeks that both sides can accept.

Medicaid providers

The House bill prohibits states from establishing new provider taxes or increasing existing taxes. These are taxes that Medicaid providers, such as hospitals, pay to help states finance their share of Medicaid costs. In turn, the taxes allow states to receive increased federal matching funds while generally holding providers harmless through higher reimbursements that offset the taxes paid.

Such taxes now are effectively capped at 6%. The Senate looks to gradually lower that threshold for states that have expanded their Medicaid populations under the Affordable Care Act, or “Obamacare,” until it reaches 3.5% in 2031, with exceptions for nursing homes and intermediate care facilities.

Industry groups have warned that limiting the ability of states to tax providers may lead to some states making significant cuts to their Medicaid programs as they make up for the lost revenue in other ways. The Medicaid provision could be a flashpoint in the coming House and Senate negotiations. Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., was highly critical of the proposed Senate changes.

“This needs a lot of work. It’s really concerning and I’m really surprised by it,” he said. “Rural hospitals are going to be in bad shape.”

Tax breaks for business

The House bill would allow companies for five years to fully deduct equipment purchases and domestic research and development expenses. The Senate bill includes no sunset, making the tax breaks permanent, which was a key priority of powerful trade groups such as the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.

Clean energy tax credits

Republicans in both chambers are looking to scale back the clean energy tax credits enacted through then-President Joe Biden’s climate law. It aimed to boost the nation’s transition away from planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions toward renewable energy such as wind and solar power.

Under the Senate bill, the tax credits for clean energy and home energy efficiency would still be phased out, but less quickly than under the House bill. Still, advocacy groups fear that the final measure will threaten hundreds of thousands of jobs and drive up household energy costs.

Odds and ends

The House bill would allow millions of Americans to use their health savings accounts to pay for gym memberships, with a cap of $500 for single taxpayers and $1,000 for joint filers. The Senate bill doesn’t include such a provision.

The House reinstates a charitable deduction for non-itemizers of $150 per taxpayer. The Senate bill increases that deduction for donations to $1,000 per taxpayer.

Republicans in the House bill included a new annual fee of $250 for EV owners and $100 for hybrid owners that would be collected by state motor vehicle departments. The Senate bill excludes the proposed fees.

S.C. charts early course on artificial intelligence

By Jack O’Toole and Damian Bertrand | Terrifying threats. Unprecedented opportunities. Change at the speed of a microprocessor. Across the country — and here in rural South Carolina — that’s how experts and leaders are talking about the rapid emergence of artificial intelligence, or AI.

Driving that conversation, experts say, are technological breakthroughs that have placed generative AI chatbots, such as ChatGPT, Claude and Gemini, in the hands of people and businesses across the world over the past three years.

But amid sensational headlines and breathless predictions of super-intelligent machines, governments, businesses and even everyday citizens are scrambling to prepare for — something. Even experts struggle to say exactly what.

As Statehouse Report learned in a series of interviews this week, South Carolina is no exception.

An emerging state strategy: Opportunity with guardrails

At a March 24 AI event sponsored by the nonprofit S.C. Council on Competitiveness, Beaufort County Republican Rep. Jeff Bradley, chair of the House Regulations, Administrative Procedures, Artificial Intelligence and Cybersecurity Committee, talked up the state’s efforts to get government, business and educational institutions pulling in the same direction on AI.

“This collaborative effort marks a pivotal moment in our state’s technological advancement,” Bradley told attendees. “By leveraging our research institutions and fostering cross-sector collaboration, we can drive applied AI innovation, train and retain a competitive AI workforce, and position South Carolina as AI-ready.”

That effort produced its first tangible result in March 2024, when the S.C. Department of Administration (Admin) released its AI Strategy, which aims to promote and responsibly regulate the use of AI in the delivery of state government services.

At the time, Admin spokesperson Brooke Bailey told Statehouse Report that safety, not speed, would be the agency’s goal as it moved forward. This week, she said Admin is currently tracking 29 proposed use-cases for AI from various agencies, ranging from internal chatbots and image-recognition tools to off-the-shelf software.

“Admin reviews each use case for security, risk, potential benefit and efficiencies, and continuously collaborates and engages with agencies as they implement approved use cases,” Bailey said.

What’s more, she says, the agency has established a Center of Excellence to provide oversight and governance to state agencies using AI, with subgroups focused on risk, compliance, and procurement.

“Additionally, the agency is seeking to initiate statewide pilot programs … for ChatGPT and Microsoft Co-pilot,” she said.

Legislative initiatives: Protecting progress — and people

Lawmakers say they’ve focused early AI legislation on keeping South Carolina business- and consumer-friendly, while cracking down on predators who misuse the technology — an approach Gov. Henry McMaster has lauded.

In particular, he cited the importance of recent legislation to protect minors from AI-enabled abuse in a May social media post.

“I’ve signed two bills into law that combat the creation, possession, and distribution of AI-generated child sexual abuse material,” McMaster said. “These laws will give prosecutors the tools they need to go after predators who use technology to harm and exploit our children.”

Protecting people from AI risk will also be the top priority of the S.C. House AI Regulations subcommittee when it begins meeting next year, according to Chairman Brandon Guffey, R-York. In 2022, Guffey lost his 17-year-old son to suicide after he was victimized by an online predator’s scam.

“The last thing we want to do is stifle innovation,” Guffey said in a June 18 interview. “But we have to be quick to react [to new developments] to ensure we’re protecting people.”

That’s why he’s carefully watching proposed federal legislation that would prevent states from regulating AI for the next 10 years, he said.

“I don’t believe the federal government has any right to tell us we can’t protect our citizens,” he said. “But if the goal is to keep states from stifling a specific industry, then yeah, I would agree states should not have that right.”

Looking ahead to 2026, Guffey said he wants to begin with a bill aimed at preventing companies from exploiting people’s personal information or likeness using AI.

“One of my primary goals is to make sure that people aren’t profiting off your voice or your image just because it’s [generated by] AI,” he said.

Beyond that, he said, he’d like to see a shift in the way AI is understood and regulated.

“Ultimately, I believe if we simply started looking at technology and the tech industry as products instead of services, then a lot of this stuff could be handled through [existing] consumer protection laws,” he said.

Businesses and citizens try to understand — and prepare

While lawmakers and state experts craft policies, Palmetto State businesses and residents are already navigating AI’s real-world impacts.

Charleston attorney and digital forensics examiner Steve Abrams told Statehouse Report this week that AI is already reshaping day-to-day legal work.

“It basically does what a clerk would do,” Abrams said. “If you had a practice with a big enough system to support a law clerk, you’d send them for a couple of days to [prepare a] legal memorandum, and here the AI tool does it in about five minutes.”

But with the ongoing issue of AI “hallucinations” — put simply, made-up facts that popular chatbots sometimes invent out of whole cloth — Abrams noted that it’s not a “set it and forget it” solution. Lawyers need to carefully review every AI-generated document they intend to present.

Less excited about the technology is Jonathan Boncek, a freelance Charleston photographer who’s watching the rise of AI with concern.

“Clients might not want to spend their money to pay me, when they can just do some AI generative fill-in,” Boncek said. “While it’s not massive yet, I do understand how AI is [moving] really quickly. So I’m just trying to prepare myself for what could be next.”

To that end, Boncek said he’s become a certified rapid transformational therapist — if not directly because of AI, at least with a wary eye cast in that direction.

“I’ve moved into a space that I believe AI won’t be able to touch, which is that human interaction and mental health space,” Boncek said. “I don’t think that AI is going to be able to help with mental health.”

But regardless of whether you’re inclined to view the technology with enthusiasm or alarm, experts like College of Charleston Associate Professor of Literacy Education Ian O’Byrne advise against getting ahead of the technology — or the facts.

“I feel like we fall into this trap of hyperbole and hysteria,” he said this week. “And I think a lot of the time, people don’t even understand what AI even is.”

Every day, and at every level, South Carolinians are working to close that AI understanding gap. And maybe, in the process, dispelling just a bit of the hyperbole and hysteria.

McMaster says energy bill will keep ACs blowing

Staff reports | On a hot June day this week, Gov. Henry McMaster ceremonially signed a new energy law aimed at ramping up Palmetto State power production. In addition to regulatory changes, the law clears the way for Dominion Energy and state-owned Santee Cooper to build a 2,000-megawatt natural gas plant in rural Colleton County.

McMaster signed the bill into law more than a month ago, but Wednesday’s ceremony brought utility executives and other workers together with lawmakers to show solidarity and support between the groups.

“This is of course to celebrate a great step for South Carolina,” McMaster said at the ceremony, which lasted less than 15 minutes before most everyone went back into the air-conditioned mansion.

The law took effect immediately. Utilities now can appeal state Public Service Commission rulings directly to the S.C. Supreme Court, meaning projects or rate cases won’t be in limbo for years as they wind through the courts. They can also now ask for smaller rate increases every year instead of hitting customers with what was sometimes a double-digit increase to cover inflation and rising costs after four or five years.

Meanwhile, lawmakers recently cleared the way for private companies to take over the long-abandoned project to build two new nuclear reactors at the defunct V.C. Summer site near Jenkinsville. Ratepayers paid billions of dollars on the failed project, which was abandoned in 2017, well before it generated even a watt of power.

The bill did not get unanimous support. Some legislators from both sides of the aisle worried the state didn’t set limits on data centers and that would allow the computer farms to suck up massive amounts of the new energy and raise costs to homeowners and others while providing few local benefits. – Skyler Baldwin

Let’s not make S.C.’s child poverty worse

By Andy Brack | A recent report on child poverty in South Carolina showed the rate dropped slightly – from 20% of the state’s children in poverty in 2019 to 19% two years ago. On its face, that sounds promising.

But storm clouds are on the horizon with tight-fisted federal fiscal policies from a Trump administration that seems to want to make the rich richer at the expense of the poor and middle class.

Threatened are the very kinds of government programs that reduced child poverty from about one in three kids two decades ago to one in five now – food stamps, special tax credits for the working poor, housing subsidies and the dread of the Republican Party – Obamacare.

If federal safety net programs are cut in South Carolina – and all over the country – tougher, hungrier days are ahead for too many families. The new KidsCount report by the Annie E. Casey Foundation found 215,000 children under 18 are in poverty in the Palmetto State. The study found South Carolina ranked 38th in child well-being, a slight improvement over previous years.

“With too many children lacking health insurance and too many living in areas of concentrated poverty, children and their families are vulnerable in our state,” said Sue Williams, CEO of Children’s Trust of South Carolina, in a statement earlier this month.

During the Obama administration, there was a big statistical drop in what was considered the number of children in poverty because analysts reframed how they measured it. As highlighted in a 2015 Statehouse Report column, the feds implemented the new measure to more accurately reflect reality of the safety net – but all of this came with a caveat:

“The lower number, it seems, reflects the impact of state and federal intervention programs on the poverty rate. In other words, it shows that programs like food stamps, housing assistance, the federal Earned Income Tax Credit for working families and other social interventions are working. Without them, the true child poverty rate would be about one in three kids [in South Carolina] — approximately the same level as has been reported for years.

“‘Tax credits alone have decreased the child poverty rate by nearly one-third. Social Security, SNAP (food stamps) and housing subsidies also have contributed to significantly fewer children living in poverty,’” the report said.

What brought all of this on is that the standard, outdated Federal Poverty Level (FPL) used for years as a basis for distributing aid came under fire when conservatives complained that the nation’s 50-year battle with poverty had done little to cut the poverty rate. So in 2011, the Obama administration set out to measure the impact of assistance programs on people receiving help. This new measure, called the Supplemental Poverty Measure, found that aid programs really do make life better for people — not by giving them cell phones or microwaves, but by providing help with housing or food or credits for working.

But then as now, what all of this means is that today’s policymakers need to understand that what’s slowly working – the intervention programs – don’t need to be cut. In fact, child poverty likely would be reduced more if the state would expand Medicaid, build more affordable housing and boost nutrition programs.

The clear warning here is that if the Trump administration cuts safety net programs that impact more than 200,000 children in South Carolina, more will go hungry and live in poverty.

Fighting poverty in America isn’t easy. And to implement policies that will encourage it to expand would be fiscally and morally wrong.

Policy actions have impacts. Let’s not go down any path that cuts the safety net more. Investments in anti-poverty programs are smart over the long run, not a waste of taxpayer money like some of the talking heads claim.

If you can’t get past the notion of keeping and expanding anti-poverty programs based on your checkbook, take a look at the good book and see what it might suggest.

Remember “we the people”

To the editor:

After reading the S.C. attorney general’s “public warning” concerning June 14 No Kings protests, I was again incensed by the language. The second paragraph of his statement begins, “radical anti-American groups are organizing…”. Who does he think he is referring to peaceful protesters as anti-American.

To Andy Brack: Thank you for having the guts to call out the AG on his aggressive attempt to silence Americans, who simply want to defend the Constitution of the United States of America and all that it provides for its people, people being the key word as in the preamble [of the Constitution] – “We the people.”

This is the first time in my life I have ever publicly and formally spoken out about the state of OUR union. I have been telling my family, since January, how fortunate we have been to live in a country and not have tanks rolling through the streets of our neighborhoods. I’ve told them how great it is that we go to sleep at night with absolutely no fear of chaos or invasion.

That is no longer the peace of mind I, and they, have known our entire lives. Thank you Mr. Brack for your words, and the words of those who also understood what “We the PEOPLE” truly means. My thoughts today are not just with protesters, who can and should peacefully speak out. I also think of the co-equal branches of OUR government. I implore them, all of them, regardless of party affiliation, to stop and think about what they are really tasked to do… “Support and Defend the Constitution, against ALL enemies, foreign and domestic!

– Donna M. Scholl, Master Sergeant, USAF Retired, Lexington, S.C.

The California-based startup intends to build the factory at Greensboro’s airport, investing $4.7 billion. The planned hiring commitments from 2027 through 2036 would be the largest in North Carolina’s history, according to Gov. Josh Stein.

The company previously identified Greensboro as one of three finalists for the factory to build its fixed-wing — also known as all-wing or blended-wing — Z4 aircraft, which JetZero says will be up to 50% more fuel-efficient than traditional tube-and-wing airliners.

JetZero said it’s already raised about $300 million toward investment in the Z4 project, including a U.S. Air Force grant to build and fly a demonstrator model by 2027.

United Airlines and Alaska Airlines also are project investors and have made conditional purchase agreements for their fleets, the company said. JetZero aims for the planes to go into service in the early 2030s, with a goal of completing 20 airplanes per month at full production.

Stein, on hand with JetZero executives and other officials for the formal announcement at Piedmont Triad International Airport in Greensboro, cited North Carolina’s robust aerospace industry and the first manned powered flights at Kitty Hawk by the Wright brothers in 1903.

“North Carolina is the perfect location,” Stein said. “North Carolina was first in flight. We are also the future of flight.”

The jobs would pay minimum average salaries of more than $89,000, according to the state Department of Commerce, which provided details of the project discussed earlier last Thursday by a state committee that awards economic incentives.

State and local monetary and training incentives for JetZero and the project described at the committee meeting could exceed $2.35 billion by the 2060s, provided that investment and job-creation thresholds and other requirements are met.

A portion of state incentives awarded by the committee — more than $1 billion over 37 years — is based on a percentage of income taxes withheld from plant workers’ paychecks. The incentives also include up to $785 million from Guilford County and Greensboro and up to $450 million from the General Assembly in part to help with infrastructure, officials said. The project includes a research facility for composite structures.

A commerce department official said JetZero, headquartered in Long Beach, California, looked for more than a year for a plant location, examining 25 sites in 17 states.

JetZero, currently with 225 workers, enters a jet purchasing market dominated by industry behemoths U.S.-based Boeing and European Airbus.

“We have already shown strong commercial interest and momentum to meet the real airline demand for this aircraft,” CEO Tom O’Leary said. “So this is more than just a factory. It’s a launchpad for a new chapter of American aerospace.”

While a variant of the Z4 would have tanker and transport uses in the military, JetZero has said that it would focus first on building a commercial jetliner with about 250 seats and a range of 5,000 nautical miles.

The five-year-old company says the plane’s shape will reduce drag, and the mounting of engines on the top and back of the plane will make it much quieter than traditional airliners. The Z4 would run on conventional jet fuel but could be converted to hydrogen fuel, according to JetZero.

JetZero says Z4 travelers will board through larger doors and into shorter but wider cabins, and aisles will be less congested, as bathrooms will be located far away from the galleys where meals are prepared.

“It’s going to deliver a better passenger experience than you’ve ever had before on any other plane,” O’Leary said.

Stein said the state is already home to more than 400 aerospace companies. The Piedmont Triad airport has emerged as an industry hot spot, with Honda Aircraft placing its headquarters there and Boom Supersonic building its first full-scale manufacturing plant for next-generation supersonic passenger jets.

The central location and easy access to interstates also lured Toyota to build an electric battery plant in adjoining Randolph County.

In an analysis of hundreds of renewable projects around the country, Soluna estimates upwards of 30 to 40 percent of renewable energy goes unused.
One data center developer using curtailed renewable power in Texas is IREN.
It developed a 7.5-gigawatt facility in Childress and broke ground on a 1.4-gigawatt data center in Sweetwater.
The data centers can ramp down their computing when the grid needs more energy and ramp up when there’s excess energy to take.","This article originally appeared on Inside Climate News, a nonprofit, non-partisan news organization that covers climate, energy, and the environment. Sign up for their newsletter here.

John Belizaire says he has a secret hiding in plain sight. But before revealing it, the CEO of Soluna, a green data center development firm headquartered in Albany, New York, asks people to picture the last time they drove through a gusty stretch of countryside and saw wind turbines in the distance. But when they zoom into that frame, he asks, did they notice that not all of those turbines were spinning despite it being windy?

It’s not typically because they’re broken, Belizaire said. It’s because they’ve been turned off.

Electric grids across the country don’t always have the capacity to carry all of the energy an intermittent power plant can produce. So while at times there’s more than enough wind to produce more power, Belizaire said, there’s no place for that power to go due to aging transmission systems and a lack of local load.

That’s how we end up with stranded renewable energy—available energy going to waste because there isn’t a user for it. In an analysis of hundreds of renewable projects around the country, Soluna estimates upwards of 30 to 40 percent of renewable energy goes unused.

That’s the secret. There’s power already generated and ready to use, it’s just being curtailed, Belizaire said.

As power demand surges, largely due to data centers servicing artificial intelligence products and cryptocurrency, interested developers, power plant operators and environmentalists are trying to sort out how to use the full capabilities of existing renewable power plants. These decisions are playing out as more data center developers supply their own gas plants to secure onsite power and bypass lengthy wait times to connect to the grid.

More than a third of data centers are expected to adopt onsite power generation by 2030, according to a new survey of data center operators, utility companies, and service providers from Bloom Energy, a fuel cell technology company. By 2035, that figure climbs to nearly half.

Data center developers want to have control over their timelines and have immediate access to power, said Aman Joshi, Bloom Energy’s chief commercial officer. The firm’s survey found there’s a one-to-two-year gap between when developers expect grid power and when utilities can realistically deliver it.

“Decisions around where data centers get built have shifted dramatically over the last six months, with access to power now playing the most significant role in location scouting,” Joshi said. “The grid can’t keep pace with AI demands, so the industry is taking control with onsite power generation.”

Soluna, like other data center developers looking to rely on renewable energy, buys the excess power from wind, hydro, and solar plants that they can’t sell to the grid. By the end of the year, Soluna will have three facilities totaling 123 megawatts of capacity in Kentucky and Texas and seven projects in the works with upwards of 800 total megawatts.

Belizaire and I talked about how in Texas, where I report from, there’s plenty of curtailed energy from wind and solar farms because of the region’s transmission capacity. In West Texas, other data center developers are also taking advantage of the unused wind energy, far from major load centers like Dallas and Houston, by co-locating their giant warehouses full of advanced computers and high-powered cooling systems with the excess energy.

One data center developer using curtailed renewable power in Texas is IREN. The firm owns and operates facilities optimized for Bitcoin mining and AI. It developed a 7.5-gigawatt facility in Childress and broke ground on a 1.4-gigawatt data center in Sweetwater.

IREN purchases power through the state grid’s wholesale market during periods of oversupply, said Kent Draper, the company’s chief commercial officer, and reduces its consumption when prices are high. It’s able to do that by turning off its computers and minimizing power demand from its data centers.

But curtailment is an issue all over the world, Belizaire said, from Oklahoma, North Dakota, South Dakota, California, and Arizona in the US, to Northern Ireland, Germany, Portugal, and Australia.

“Anywhere where you have large utility-scale renewable development that’s been built out, you’re going to find it,” Belizaire said.

In a March analysis, the US Energy Information Administration reported that solar and wind power curtailments are increasing in California. In 2024, the grid operator for most of California curtailed 3.4 million megawatt hours of utility-scale wind and solar output, a 29 percent increase from the amount of electricity curtailed in 2023.

A Soluna report, using data from regional transmission organizations and independent system operators, estimated that at the end of 2021 there were 14.9 terawatt hours of wind and solar generation curtailed, or the equivalent of $610 million in lost revenue. The renewable electricity wasted in 2021 was enough to power 1.3 million households for a year, the report found.

So how does Soluna go about using curtailed energy?

The firm co-locates its data centers at a renewable energy plant and signs a power purchase agreement with the plant for a portion of its capacity. That way, the power producer can still satisfy its other obligations, like to the grid. The contracts used to be for around five years, but now they average about 10.

Soluna’s behind-the-meter strategy allows the company to source power in three ways. Its officials can buy it directly from the source at a low fixed price. It’s a cheap rate as that power would have been otherwise wasted. Or Soluna can use subtractive energy, paying for electrons directly from the wind farm that would have been sold to the grid. As a last resort, they can buy power directly from the grid. (It’s a less ideal option because depending on the makeup of the grid, it’s a mix of renewable and fossil fuel sources.)

This distributed generation approach has allowed Soluna to score some of the lowest prices for power this kind of data center has seen, Belizaire said, and source upwards of 75 percent of its energy from green sources.

Because of the intermittent nature of renewables, grids are grappling with how to maintain stability and reliability as they become more reliant on variable energy sources. Battery storage technology has made meaningful contributions but is still working to scale and upgrading transmission lines infamously takes a long time.

Soluna sees its flexible load data centers as a solution. The data centers can ramp down their computing when the grid needs more energy and ramp up when there’s excess energy to take.

“We’ve become almost like a battery,” Belizaire said. “I like to say computing is a better battery than battery systems.”",https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/GettyImages-2203288771-2560x1440.jpg,N,,2025-06-21 14:05:46.487987

The North Carolina legislature has retreated from its aggressive targets to reduced hydrocarbon-fueled electricity in the state, eliminating the goal of being 70% carbon free by 2030. Strong Republican majorities in both chambers supported Senate Bill 266 last week, but so did some Democratic legislators.

That smattering of Democratic support could weigh on Democratic Governor Josh Stein as he considers a veto. The final version of the bill leaves in place the ultimate target of the full elimination of carbon dioxide emissions by 2050, and there are other important regulatory changes in the bill, touted by supporters as the Power Bill Reduction Act.

This follows a decision in Maryland, approved by its Democratic governor, to authorize additional use of natural gas for generation in that state. There are glimmers of energy sanity in both Virginia’s northern and southern neighbors. Virginia retains its laws mandating expensive wind and solar energy buildouts and prohibiting new natural gas. The weather in the next two weeks is going to prove again that reliable hydrocarbon plants keep the air conditioning running, not solar.

North Carolina’s legislature passed the emissions reduction targets in 2021, one year after the Virginia General Assembly placed similar mandates in the Virginia Code. The North Carolina target for 2030 of 70% is far more aggressive than those for that year in the Virginia Clean Economy Act (VCEA).

An Associated Press report on the North Carolina bill indicated North Carolina and Virginia are the only two southern states among the 18 states with laws mandating electricity emission reductions targets or deadlines.

Under VCEA, Virginia’s major utility, Dominion Energy Virginia, must reach a carbon free target of 49% by 2032, with the smaller Appalachian Power’s targets on a slower timeline. In Dominion’s case, its nuclear reactors count as non-carbon sources, so the 49% target is just for the other forms of generation, coming from non-nuclear sources.

The Virginia non-CO2 target rises higher year by year. Failure to meet the goals internally carries financial costs to the utility, which are simply passed on to its customers. The North Carolina law has only the 2030 and 2050 targets.

Even before this recent action by its legislature, North Carolina’s carbon emission regulations did not include a prohibition on building new natural gas generation, and the North Carolina Utilities Commission (NCUC) had approved additional natural gas assets in its most recent integrated resource plan. But advocates for removing the 2030 target argued it was creating a major constraint on the choices available to North Carolina’s power provider. Reliability and low cost were being sacrificed, even though its law makes them the paramount considerations.

Dominion, on the other hand, is having to battle to get permission to plan any new natural gas generation, both in its pending integrated resource plan and in an application for a certificate of public convenience and necessity for a gas-powered Chesterfield facility. To get permission for new gas use the utility must prove that energy reliability is threatened and gas is the only choice to maintain it. Other hurdles are created by the VCEA, which is hostile to all hydrocarbon fuels.

The free-market John Locke Foundation in North Carolina was a major proponent of the legislation now pending with its governor. It argued that the looming 70% target was forcing the utilities and the utilities commission to make more expensive choices, adding billions to ultimate consumer costs. It backed that up by paying for its own generation model, less expensive to consumers but also not constrained by the 70% 2030 target, which it presented to NCUC and to the legislature.

“When the General Assembly passed the Carbon Plan law (House Bill 951) in 2021, we warned that it could work only by strict adherence to the law’s least cost and reliable guardrails,” wrote Jon Sanders of the Locke Foundation. “Early Carbon Plan orders have strayed far from affordable and reliable resources, and it turns out the modeling was aimed at reaching the plan’s interim goal of 70 percent reduction in CO2 emissions regardless of affordability and reliability.”

The Locke Foundation’s alternative, however, also eliminated coal and natural gas by 2050 and replaced them with nuclear plants. The legislation just passed also makes is easier for the utility to finance future nuclear plants by charging consumers for them during construction, something already allowed in Virginia.

In Virginia, the integrated resource plan presented by the Dominion did not really include a low cost, “what if we just ignored carbon targets” alternative. But as was pointed out by critics, its generation models also ignored the hard target of 2045 set by the VCEA for the elimination of all hydrocarbon plants. Dominion set only a 15-year time window on its models and cost estimates and offered no outline for how it would transition five years later. The integrated resource plan case before the State Corporation Commission appears to completed, and simply awaiting a final decision.",,N,,2025-06-21 18:08:33.887317

The Senate’s draft represents a substantial cut to the existing climate-friendly energy tax credits, but some Republicans are pursuing a less aggressive rollback than their House counterparts, according to a report from The Hill.

Several GOP senators who oppose a full repeal argue that even the Senate’s scaled-back proposal goes too far in dismantling the clean energy tax credits established under the Biden Inflation Reduction Act of 2022. (RELATED: Green Energy Think Tank Reportedly Cuts Staff After DOE Grant Cancellations)

Republican Senators who have voiced concerns or pushed back against a “full-scale” repeal of energy tax credits include Alaska Sen. Lisa Murkowski, North Carolina Sen. Thom Tillis, Kansas Sen. Jerry Moran, Utah Sen. John Curtis and West Virginia Sen. Shelley Moore Capito.

Republican West Virginia Sen. Shelley Moore Capito, whose state hosts one of the “hydrogen hubs” created under the Biden administration, expressed concern over the bill’s deadline requiring projects to begin construction by the end of the year to qualify for tax credits.

Capito said she’s working to delay that deadline, calling it “a pretty tight timeline,” and adding, “I’m trying to get the date pushed back. I don’t know if I’ll be successful,” according to another report from The Hill.

She has also received $49,200 in campaign contributions from Williams, a Tulsa, Oklahoma-based energy company with significant investments in hydrogen infrastructure during the 2024 election cycle, according to OpenSecrets data.

Oklahoma Sen. James Lankford likewise received $54,500 in contributions from Williams during the same time period.

Capito also took $45,325 during the 2024 election cycle from First Energy, an electric utility that has pledged to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050.

A group of four Republicans — Sens. Murkowski, Curtis, Moran and Tillis — have jointly cautioned against a “full-scale” repeal of the energy tax credits enacted by Democrats in 2022.

In their message, they called for each credit to be assessed based on its potential to boost U.S. manufacturing, lower utility costs — particularly in rural communities — and provide stability for businesses that have already made investments under the current framework.

“The United States produces some of the cleanest and most efficient energy in the world, and an all-of-the-above approach — including support for traditional and renewable energy sources — has long been a hallmark of our energy strategy,” the senators wrote.

“To that end, many American companies have made substantial investments in domestic energy production and infrastructure based on the current energy tax framework. A wholesale repeal, or the termination of certain individual credits, would create uncertainty, jeopardizing capital allocation, long-term project planning, and job creation in the energy sector and across our broader economy,” their letter read.

Tillis, has advocated for a “targeted, pragmatic approach” to the energy tax credits, rather than supporting a full repeal.

He also received hundreds of thousands of dollars in campaign contributions during the 2022 and 2024 election cycles — both individually and through political action committees — from major financial institutions including Blackstone Group, Apollo Global Management, Truist Financial and Goldman Sachs, according to OpenSecrets (OS).

The firms have collectively invested millions of dollars in clean energy initiatives and companies in recent years.

Collins received tens of thousands of dollars in contributions during the 2022 and 2024 cycles from Blackstone, Goldman and Nextra Energy, which reports to have 55% of its portfolio invested in renewable energy.

Capito also received tens of thousands of dollars from Blackstone during the 2022 and 2024 election cycles.

OpenSecrets also shows Murkowski received tens of thousands of dollars through PACs or individually over the same two cycles from companies like ConocoPhillips, a company dedicated to be the first in the U.S. oil and gas company to set a goal of reaching net-zero operational emissions.

This follows Capital Group Companies‘ announcement in March that it was committing $30.57 million to fossil fuel investments, including a stake in ConocoPhillips.

Curtis has likewise received $59,700 in contributions during the 2024 election cycle from Sunrun, which markets itself as “the #1 home solar and battery company in America.”

“I think that Senator Crapo did a really good job, but there’s more work to be done,” Curtis told The Hill when asked about the big beautiful bill, referring to the Idaho Republican who chairs the Senate Finance Committee. Curtis offered no further details.

Moran adjacently received $38,500 in campaign contributions during the 2024 election cycle from Kit Bond Strategies Group, according to OpenSecrets records.

To be eligible for the loan payment, the originators of the renewable energy projects would need to agree to use the funding to finance new green energy projects.","Year after year, the leaders of developing countries across the globe plead with high-income countries to invest in a global green transition. Many low-income countries are open to exploiting their natural resources to develop their renewable energy capacity, through wind and solar, and other energy projects. However, establishing new energy sectors and transitioning away from a reliance on fossil fuels will require significant financing, and many countries simply do not have the funds to invest in green energy. Now, the Inter-American Development Bank (IADB) may offer the financial plan needed to help expand the global renewable energy capacity.

In 2024, the UN Trade and Development (UNCTAD) established a new collective quantified goal, or NCQG, of at least $300 billion annually for developing countries' climate action by 2035 and the aim of working toward mobilising $1.3 trillion in international climate finance over the same timeframe. The funding includes bilateral finance (country to country), multilateral finance (from multilateral development banks (MDBs) and multilateral climate funds), and private finance mobilised by public funds. However, achieving this level of financing is no easy feat, as many high-income countries fail to live up to their climate pledges.

At COP29, MDBs pledged to provide $120 billion in climate finance to low- and middle-income countries by 2030, around double the amount they contributed in 2022. “Nearly half of the climate finance flowing from developed countries to emerging economies comes from the system of multilateral development banks (MDBs), where developed countries are typically the main shareholders,” said Avinash Persaud, a special adviser on climate change to the president of IADB. However, pushing this financing even higher will be difficult and may require innovative approaches to climate funding.

Persaud has developed a plan aimed at spurring billions of dollars of investment in the green economy of low-income countries worldwide, which is supported by the IADB. The plan may even be able to provide the bulk of the $1.3 trillion in annual climate investment. “This could be an engine for green growth, and produce the trillions needed for climate finance in the future… It could be a transformation,” Persaud stated.

This week, Persaud will present his plan at a UN meeting in Germany that focuses on the November COP30 climate summit to be held in Brazil. He plans to buy up loans for renewable energy projects in the developing world to allow for billions of dollars in private investment to flood into the sector, thereby increasing global climate finance. This would require getting taxpayer-funded development banks to buy existing loans for green energy projects in low-income countries to free up investment from private sector lenders.

The loans are viewed as relatively low risk as they are already performing. However, many private sector investors are prohibited from getting involved in these types of financial agreements, as they are in developing countries, many of which have credit ratings that are too low to meet loan requirements. However, if those loans were to be backed by a development bank, which was willing to provide a guarantee against default, the “repackaged” loan finance could meet private sector criteria.

“The lightbulb moment was realising there was $50 billion in performing green loans in Latin America,” said Persaud. “Why not buy that to enable new projects to be created?” he added.

To be eligible for the loan payment, the originators of the renewable energy projects would need to agree to use the funding to finance new green energy projects. This would allow developers with experience in establishing renewable energy projects to expand their portfolios by investing in new projects, which may attract further private sector investment.

The IADB aims to launch the initiative immediately and send request proposals over the coming months, ahead of COP30. The initial loan portfolio is expected to be between $500 million and $1 billion. The initiative is already gaining traction, as experts in climate financing see the potential in the scheme.

Mattia Romani, a senior partner at the COP30 climate finance consultancy Systemiq, stated, “It is a very powerful initiative, both pragmatic and innovative. Given the constraints we will inevitably face in the coming years, securitisation is one of the few realistic tools to reach [the required financing]. Romani added, “This initiative is designed to unlock institutional capital by leveraging the balance sheets of domestic commercial banks – securitising their loans so that they can meet the fiduciary needs of institutional investors, and turning them into engines for transition finance. What’s new is the direct engagement with local banks – we are starting with a pilot in Latin America.”

Innovative approaches to climate funding could help increase financing for green energy projects across developing countries and tackle some of the institutional hurdles to climate funding. As several high-income countries fall short on their climate pledges, including promises of funding for green energy projects in low-income countries, the repackaging of loan finance could allow private investors to increase their investment in the energy transition.

By Liam Denning / Bloomberg Opinion

Under attack from US President Donald Trump, the cause of greening the US’ power grid now relies to a large degree on some of his most recent converts in Silicon Valley. This has nothing to do with politics; rather wealth, scale and urgent need are working together to advance renewable energy and nuclear power, albeit in different ways.

The Trump tax bill working its way through the US Congress is a huge blow to renewables. Republicans in the US Senate were expected to dilute the zealous anti-greenery in the US House of Representative’s version of the bill, but the latest language out of the Senate Finance Committee is only a little less harsh.

Tax credits supporting wind and solar projects will phase down to zero by the end of 2027. That might pull forward some projects, but it will ultimately bump renewable energy costs up considerably.

For example, removing the investment tax credit raises a typical solar project’s electricity price by about 40 percent, according to Lazard Inc.

Together with regulatory efforts to boost the fortunes of coal and gas-fired electricity, this would ultimately suppress appetite for new renewables projects.

By how much depends on whether pricing is the overriding factor at play. When it comes to Big Tech, it is not. What is more, Big Tech is pretty much the ball game for new renewables projects.

Just four so-called “hyperscalers” — Alphabet Inc, Amazon.com Inc, Meta Platforms Inc and Microsoft Corp — dominate the corporate power purchase agreements (PPA) signed with wind and solar projects in the past half decade, putting in place multi-year contracts to buy their output and thereby providing them with the certainty required to secure financing.

Overall, PPAs for 98 gigawatts of US wind and solar capacity have been signed in that time, according to Bloomberg NEF, a figure equivalent to 74 percent of the new capacity that began operating.

The growing power needs of data centers developing artificial intelligence (AI) tools is well established, even if the ultimate level of those needs is debatable. For the hyperscalers, renewable energy has two attractions: The projects are relatively quick to build and they help with decarbonization pledges. Data centers, nearly always on, clearly are not running anything like 100 percent on intermittent renewable energy, even with batteries in the mix. So, natural gas plants, old and new, also benefit from the AI race, which, in turn, supports more renewable PPAs being signed to offset the emissions from fossil-fuel sources.

Such contracts are also relatively cheap after years of underlying price declines for clean technologies and, of course, federal tax credits.

Corporate PPAs signed in the second half of last year undercut average electricity futures by at least 10 percent, according to estimates from Bloomberg NEF.

Removal of the credits, alongside trade frictions, would upend that, meaning gas will likely account for a larger share of new electricity generation through the second half of this decade than it might have otherwise, although prices and wait times for new gas turbines have also increased significantly.

Yet price might not be the decisive factor for the decisive customer segment.

The four big hyperscalers spent an average 1.6 percent of their revenue on electricity bills last year, analysts at UBS Group AG estimated.

Losing the tax credits would bump that up by an average of just 19 basis points, according to the estimates.

Provided Big Tech does not abandon its ambitions in AI or decarbonization altogether, that rounding error offers some potential insurance for renewables developers.

Of course, a sector built on subsidies will still take a hit if those subsidies are rapidly withdrawn. We saw, analogously, how a jump in interest rates chilled offshore wind power in recent years. Demand for new projects will suffer and, as with any fragmented industry faced with an oligopsony and suddenly souring economics, the field of US renewable energy is poised for potentially brutal consolidation.

The top 10 project developers accounted for only 37 percent of US wind and solar capacity that secured financing or began construction last year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg NEF.

A stronger, more concentrated sector should emerge somewhere down the line.

The other, longer-term bet for a decarbonized grid concerns nuclear power. This gets a relative pass from Republicans, with the latest Senate language improving on the House tax bill by preserving production tax credits for nuclear plants, provided they are not using fuel from the likes of Russia.

Trump has also signaled support through executive orders and is reportedly planning to reorient the US Department of Energy’s Loan Programs Office toward financing new reactor technologies.

Even so, Big Tech’s role is crucial, perhaps decisive. Hyperscalers clearly value the large quantities of dispatchable, carbon-free power that reactors provide. Thus far, though, this has meant contracting with existing nuclear plants or reviving the relative handful of recently closed ones. There is a good reason for this: Building new reactors is costly, risky and often takes a decade or more. The last reactors built in the US were a case study in busted budgets and schedules, leaving utilities reluctant to plunge into a new round.

Federal support helps defray some of the costs and risks involved, but what is really needed are customers with a thirst for emissions-free power that is matched only by the depth of their pockets. Big Tech is the obvious candidate. PPAs signed with nuclear plants at above-market rates by the likes of Amazon and Microsoft demonstrate a willingness to pay up for decarbonized power, which is also an encouraging sign for renewables facing the loss of tax credits.

In addition, several hyperscalers have taken preliminary steps to encourage development of new technologies, such as small modular reactors, but these remain far from committing to the sort of long-term PPA that a nuclear start-up could take to the bank. That would be the difference between talking about new nuclear plants and actually getting them built.

As with renewable power’s resilience, therefore, the prospects for a nuclear revival rest largely with the tech bros. Not the most comforting message in these times, perhaps, but far more hopeful than anything likely to emerge from Capitol Hill.",https://www.taipeitimes.com/assets/images/TaipeiTimesLogo-1200X1200px_new.jpg,N,,2025-06-21 14:05:51.072393

Water provider Veolia is removing toxic PFAS chemicals from drinking water for more than 100,000 New Castle County residents — meeting federal regulations four years before a compliance deadline.

The investor-owned utility unveiled a $35 million treatment facility in Stanton this week, where the so-called “forever chemicals” were previously detected at high levels.

The PFAS treatment facility, which is the size of a regulation hockey rink and boasts 21 towering filters that can treat 30 million gallons of water per day, is Veolia’s largest in the U.S.

“Today starts that new chapter of ensuring that we are providing the highest quality water to the communities that we serve, and I think our customers can rest assured that we’ll be there for generations to come with this new facility,” said Larry Finnicum, regional president of mid- Atlantic operations for Veolia North America.

PFAS — widely used in consumer products such as nonstick cookware and waterproof clothing, as well as in firefighting foam — have been linked to serious health problems, including some cancers, thyroid disease, developmental delays in children and other health conditions.

The health risks associated with PFAS, which can stay in the human bloodstream for years, have sparked numerous lawsuits against chemical manufacturers, such as DuPont and 3M.

About a third of Veolia’s water supply is sourced from the Red Clay Creek, which environmental regulators say is contaminated with high levels of “forever chemicals.” The area is home to chemical companies, but the source of contamination in the creek has not been determined.

PFAS at Veolia’s Stanton plant were previously detected at levels as high as 29 parts per trillion on average, according to the company’s 2024 water quality report. Veolia said it’s partnering with the Delaware Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control to determine the source of contamination at its intakes.

The plant is now reducing PFAS to non-detectable levels by utilizing granular activated carbon, which is the current mainstay for PFAS removal. The technology essentially works by acting like a magnet. Chemicals become attached to the carbon, as the water continues to flow through the system, free of PFAS.

The upgraded facility also includes an on-site pilot system, meaning the company can test different technologies to determine the best means for treating the chemicals.

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency implemented regulations last year requiring water providers to test and treat “forever chemicals” to almost zero by 2029. The agency pivoted last month, proposing to rollback some PFAS restrictions and extend the compliance deadline to 2031.

The proposed changes come after water providers sued the EPA last year, arguing the treatments required to meet the regulations are too costly, and would hit the pockets of ratepayers. While former President Joe Biden set aside billions of dollars to address PFAS, water providers say more resources are needed.

Veolia will attempt to recoup the cost of the new filtration system by raising water bills. The company has asked the Delaware Public Service Commission for a 44% rate increase. If approved, the average monthly bill would increase by about $19 a month. Ratepayers currently pay about $40 a month.

Veolia would not say whether the company is pursuing legal action to help recover the cost of filtering PFAS, as other water providers have done.

Gov. Matt Meyer said public health must remain a top priority. During a ribbon cutting ceremony this week, the governor said Veolia’s new treatment facility is critical for households that can’t afford to install costly filtration systems on their homes.

“With this project, we’ll be able to provide cleaner drinking water to thousands of Delawareans who have been historically underserved,” he said.

The facility, three years in the making, is one of 30 other PFAS treatment sites Veolia operates in the U.S. — with more than 100 total planned.

“Veolia here is the decontaminator. We are part of the solution,” said Estelle Brachlianoff, CEO of Veolia. “The problems come from history and from pollution elsewhere. So we are on the side of trying our best to move the needle in the right direction.”",https://whyy.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/2025-06-18-e-lee-wilmington-del-stanton-water-treatment-plant-new-pfas-treatment-facility-tanks-and-sign.jpeg,N,,2025-06-21 19:05:54.120903

From expediting the licensing process for nuclear reactors to examining the potential for nuclear fuel recycling, Trump addressed a range of issues that had hindered the industry's growth for years.

With enthusiasm for the nuclear energy industry surging through Washington, many are eager to find stocks that can benefit from the industry's apparent renaissance. For these investors, NuScale Power (SMR -4.92%), Constellation Energy (CEG -0.49%), and Cameco (CCJ -2.01%) look like smart choices to power their portfolios.

NuScale Power has a large advantage with its small modular reactors

Long gone are the days of massive nuclear power plants that require enormous capital investments and take years to construct. Nowadays, companies like NuScale Power are developing small modular reactors (SMRs) that offer a variety of advantages over conventional nuclear power plants.

For one, SMRs require considerably smaller footprints, making them more attractive to project developers, which can scale these reactors to their individual site's needs. And SMRs have improved safety profiles including the ability to shut down and self-cool indefinitely, unlike traditional nuclear power plants. Among other advantages, NuScale's SMRs are built in a factory, which helps to keep costs down and expedite project development.

With $491 million in cash and no debt, the company is on strong financial footing, an appealing situation for those looking to balance a quality growth stock that's not rife with risk. To state its competitive advantage over other SMR providers, NuScale Power says that it's the only near-term deployable SMR company with design approval from the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission.

Shoot for the stars with utility powerhouse Constellation Energy

While Constellation Energy's portfolio includes about 10 gigawatts (GWs) of natural gas, oil, hydroelectric, wind, and solar generation assets, it's nuclear energy that represents the lion's share of its generating capacity -- about 21 GWs, or enough power to meet the demands of 16 million homes.

The company's nuclear assets caught the attention of Microsoft in 2024, and the two inked a 20-year power purchase agreement (PPA) that will see the tech company purchase power in support of its data centers, generated from the restart of operations at the Three Mile Island plant, now dubbed the Crane Clean Energy Center.

More recently, Meta Platforms showed its enthusiasm for nuclear energy as a power source for its growing AI-related operations. Earlier this month, Meta and Constellation signed a 20-year PPA for nuclear energy that will be generated at the Clinton Clean Energy Center in Illinois.

The deals that Constellation inked with Microsoft and Meta are merely two small examples of the vast investments that AI companies are making to support their data centers. And it wouldn't be all that surprising if Constellation Energy announces similar deals with AI leaders that recognize the allure of nuclear energy as a route to meeting the steep power demands that AI computing requires.

Fuel your portfolio with uranium producer Cameo

Interest in developing new nuclear power plants is great, but it means little if there's no uranium to fuel said power plants. That's where Cameco comes in. The company is the largest uranium producer based on market capitalization found on American stock exchanges.

Operating throughout the nuclear fuel value chain, Cameco is involved in exploratory activities as well as uranium refining and fuel manufacturing services.

And with one of President Trump's executive orders stating specifically that ""It is the policy of the United States to expedite and promote to the fullest possible extent the production and operation of nuclear energy..."" Cameco clearly stands to benefit as the pathway for developing uranium assets, and other potential regulatory hurdles may be less burdensome now.

In 2024, Cameco reported uranium production of 23.4 million pounds, and it has ample resources to ensure production for years to come. As of the end of 2024, for example, the company reported 457 million pounds of proven and probable reserves.",https://g.foolcdn.com/editorial/images/821063/businesswoman-in-front-of-coolling-tower-at-nuclear-power-plant.jpg,N,,2025-06-21 15:04:19.151618

“These data centers need power — we’re talking about a very significant amount of power, 500 megawatts of power, that these (centers) consume,” he said.
When it’s finished, it looks like right now it (would work for) some sort of a data center development project.
“(But) our board will do anything possible to bring in new opportunities to our county,” Commissioner Tony Morelli said.
ETEM is asking us to go through the process which (involves) commissioners designating it as a priority investment area.","STEUBENVILLE — The current owners of the old Sammis plant property are hoping to bring a data center to Jefferson County — but to make it happen, they need a declaration that it is one of Ohio’s priority investment areas.

House Bill 15, which takes effect in mid-August, authorizes local governments — in this case, the Jefferson County commissioners — to pass resolutions asking the Ohio Director of Development to designate sites in their jurisdictions as priority investment areas. That designation brings with it accelerated permit reviews, brownfield funding for site preparation and development costs plus a utility tax exemption.

Brownfield sites and former coal mines are eligible for the designation.

The Sammis site, acquired by Houston-based Energy Transition and Environmental Management in 2023, is in the demolition and remediation stage, with the structure above state Route 7 in Stratton slated to go in the first quarter 2026.

“We’ve knocked down most of the buildings, and we expect to finish that project in the first quarter of 2027,” Dan McDevitt, co-founder and general counsel, told the Jefferson County commissioners Wednesday. “We’re now starting to think about what happens next at that site.”

Initially, McDevitt said they figured “some kind of industrial development,” perhaps a multi-modal transportation, would be a good site fit, “but the world has changed. What didn’t exist a year ago are these massive data centers … think of them as server farms, thousands and thousands of computers running artificial intelligence algorithms or serving cloud storage functions.”

McDevitt said the property has an on-site switching station and substation, so power can be imported or exported.” There’s water and rail access as well as a large loading and unloading area.

“These data centers need power — we’re talking about a very significant amount of power, 500 megawatts of power, that these (centers) consume,” he said. “We’re not data center developers — our business is buying these difficult properties, we take on all the risks and responsibilities (to clean them up) and then we find someone else to do the forecast. When it’s finished, it looks like right now it (would work for) some sort of a data center development project. And the way they typically work these things is, we would sell it to a developer, they would build out the campus and then they lease it, lease the services from the server farms, to like a Google or an Amazon or something like that.”

McDevitt told commissioners if it happens that way it would be “a significant investment. You’re looking at billions of dollars in investment, jobs during construction … I think we tossed out a number of, say, 1,000 jobs while the thing’s being built, there’d be a couple, three years of construction time then maybe a couple hundred permanent jobs, (with) follow on employment that comes from that.”

McDevitt figures that priority investment designation is critical, saying HB 15 “is basically a reworking of Ohio’s energy policy. The bill was built around the theory of trying to encourage the redevelopment of power in the state.”

“There’s a very specific tax benefit. It’s not a property tax on a real estate tax payment, but it’s a relief from what we call the ‘utility’ tax and a particular part of it — the part of the tax that’s relevant here is building out the infrastructure to either deliver power or natural gas to the site. And one of our plans at this site is to build a natural gas pipeline to come into the site, bring fuel, CCGT (combined cycle gas turbine) or other gas-fired generation, to either sell into the grid, to resell just as a power play or else to power up the data centers. They need power, they’re power hogs.”

McDevitt said the priority investment area designation “will make this site incrementally more attractive than a site that (doesn’t have it).”

“I think it’s a good thing for the county — we’re optimistic about securing a data center development here at the site,” McDevitt said.

Commissioners say they’re intrigued, but said they need to “run it by the prosecutor’s office” first.

“(But) our board will do anything possible to bring in new opportunities to our county,” Commissioner Tony Morelli said. “HB 15 gives renewable energy companies tax relief if the property was used for specific industry, brownfields, abandoned coal or energy companies. The Sammis plant checks the boxes. ETEM is asking us to go through the process which (involves) commissioners designating it as a priority investment area. Once that is completed the site would be marketed for energy development (so they can) use the specific tools the bill was written for.”

Morelli said AI — artificial intelligence — “is one business that needs extreme amounts of energy.”

“Designating this property (as a priority investment area) will open up opportunities to be in the game, right here in our county,” Morelli said.

Commissioner Jake Kleineke said the Sammis site “probably would be a good place for an alternative power source, I think it would be a great opportunity to spark interest in other technology companies to come to our region.

“I see it as a great opportunity for the county to grow,” he said. “I just think it’s a good opportunity for the county to experience some growth versus it just sitting stagnant, growing grass.”

He said similar developments have brought “gigantic growth” already along the Interstate 270 corridor in Franklin County.

“It’s created a lot of opportunity, jobs for people who would like to relocate here,” he said. “And there’s construction benefits as well — we still have vibrant trades here … electrical unions, pipefitters, carpenters, etc., that could benefit from this type of growth.”

Kleineke said they have to be forward-thinking.

“I don’t see a downside to it, honestly,” Kleineke said. “We’re not going to bring coal-fired plants back, we’ve got to do something with that property. I would like to see something more diverse than a server farm. I’d like to see alternative-fueled power generation. Those server farms take up a lot of power to run, but they’ll also put a strain locally on our power grid. These things are happening all over the state of Ohio and consuming more power than we’re making. With the abundance of gas we have here, I would love to see a gas-fired power plant there, and maybe in addition to the dam that’s already there … hydroelectric power generation.",http://d14e0irai0gcaa.cloudfront.net/www.heraldstaronline.com/images/2016/08/19083717/fbLIKE.jpg,N,,2025-06-21 13:08:48.409817

The justices focused solely on whether the companies and trade associations had standing to sue.

A federal appeals court in Washington, D.C., had previously ruled that market forces, rather than California's regulations, were driving the national shift toward electric vehicles.

The court determined that the fuel makers could not proceed with the case.

The argument on both sides of the debate posed skepticism was whether consumers' demand alone was driving the shift to electric vehicles.

The EPA reduction of fossil fuel reliance was a part of the waivers justification.

Justice Jackson, in her dissent, questioned the timing of the court's decision, given the likelihood of Trump withdrawing the waiver if he returns to office.

""President Trump rescinded this exact same waiver the last time he was in office,"" Jackson wrote. ""Because a withdrawal of the waiver would moot this case, an obvious question arises: Why would this court rush to opine on whether the fuel industry’s legal challenge can proceed when all involved – including petitioners themselves – believe that any such 'case' or 'controversy' will soon vanish?""

The study, led by founder Vrushabhraj Tanawade, introduces a bio-integrated insulation method using thermophilic and mesophilic microbial consortia to regulate heat inside battery modules. The results are striking: up to a 22% reduction in internal temperature and a 30% improvement in carbon lifecycle efficiency.

“This innovation is about biology meeting infrastructure,” says Tanawade. “We’ve discovered how nature’s mechanisms can dramatically extend the life of our clean energy systems.”

Unlike conventional synthetic cooling solutions, MountBay’s microbial approach is circular, biodegradable, and scalable—opening up new frontiers for climate resilience and fire-risk reduction in hot environments.

The research aligns perfectly with MountBay’s mission to power the AI economy through clean, sustainable, and advanced infrastructure. It also positions the company as a frontrunner in biological material integration across the energy sector.

Additionally, MountBay has released a preliminary transformative feasibility report for a Lunar Solar Belt—a continuous solar array on the Moon that can beam uninterrupted, clean energy back to Earth.

The report outlines how in-situ resource utilization (ISRU), autonomous lunar robotics, and microwave power transmission could enable the construction of a moon-based solar plant by the 2030s. With an energy return on investment (EROI) of 8:1, the system offers a scalable, emission-free solution to humanity’s growing power demands.

“This is not just an energy project—it’s a civilization-scale investment in global stability,” said Tanawade. “We believe the Moon should be a cooperative utility, not a geopolitical race.”

MountBay is also proposing a new diplomatic framework—The Earth-Moon Energy Accord (EMEA)—to ensure equitable access, safety, and international cooperation.

The concept directly supports MountBay’s mission: to push the frontiers of clean power while securing energy independence for AI-driven economies.

Tanawade is rallying governments, institutions, and innovators to join him. “It’s time for America to lead the most ambitious energy project in human history,” he said.

,Congress,2025-06-21 16:03:49+00:00,The Colorado Sun,What's Working: Rocky Ford was a finalist for an environmental justice grant. Then Trump stepped in.,"Tracy Ross, Tamara Chuang, Tracy Ross Rural",,,,,https://coloradosun.com/2025/06/21/rocky-ford-environment-grant-trump/,"The site in question spans city blocks in Rocky Ford, a town in need of a facelift.
On May 2, Rocky Ford learned its grant was included in the slashing.
But without funding from the federal government, Rocky Ford isn’t getting so much as an assessment of the environmental and health issues the building damage brings as well as the economic impacts.

Despite it all, Rocky Ford tries to remain hopeful.","The site in question spans city blocks in Rocky Ford, a town in need of a facelift.

The city council and Mayor Duane Gurulé knew this, which is why they sent a letter to U.S. Sens. John Hickenlooper and Michael Bennet and U.S. Rep. Jeff Hurd on April 22, following a wave of executive orders from President Donald Trump.

Rocky Ford, in Otero County, was a finalist for a $166,000 grant from the Environmental Protection Agency’s Thriving Communities Grantmaking Program to assess and clean up asbestos-laden buildings in the city that had been damaged by fires. The grant was in danger due to funding freezes, they wrote in the letter.

If they received the money administered through the Mountains and Plains Environmental Grants Hub, it would start planning of the much-needed cleanup and begin the revitalization of 20-plus acres of land for essential commercial space and housing, they added.

That fit perfectly with the goal of the program, which was to fund solutions to serious environmental challenges in underserved communities, including clean drinking water, food access and climate readiness. The program fell under the Biden Administration’s Inflation Reduction Act Environmental and Climate Justice Program, through which Congress had appropriated $2.8 billion for community groups to provide block grants to address pollution that takes a disproportionately heavy toll on communities of color and low-income and rural areas.

But during the first few months of 2025, the EPA teamed up with the Department of Government Efficiency to cut at least $67 million in grant money earmarked for such programs.

On May 2, Rocky Ford learned its grant was included in the slashing. About 550 applications with requests for $137 million were submitted to the program — “a clear sign of both the urgency and the local energy behind this work,” according to Mountains and Plains administrators.

And now every time Gurulé travels U.S. 50 between the Rocky Ford City Hall and the Sonic Drive-In, he’s reminded of the time his town came this close to getting the funding it needed to start addressing its hulking, blackened problems, including the unavoidable eyesore visible down 10th street if he’s driving east, which some Rocky Ford locals have to look at it every day whether they want to or not.

It’s the Brewer Construction burn site, which went up in flames in April 2024.

What’s left — thousands of pounds of contaminated rubble — looks like it could live in a “Mad Max” film. But even worse than how it looks is how toxic it is, Gurulé said. It’s full of asbestos that breaks free when the wind blows. Pieces of tin and shingles fly through the community. And there’s a good chance the patients walking into the doctor’s office nearby are breathing in toxic chemicals, he said.

Spoiler alert: This story has no happy ending.

But that’s why Gurulé wants it told “loudly and clearly,” starting with the fire.

Or fires.

Two blazes in one year and no cleanup

The second fire, in December, burned a hole through the middle of Liberty Elementary School, built in 1950 to accommodate the post-World War II baby boom, by then in grades 1 through 6, according to the Kiowa County Independent. It bustled for a while, but as schools in some rural towns sometimes do, enrollment dwindled until it was forced to close in 2011.

The fire inside it was bad, but two wings remained after it was extinguished. The town council had big plans for it in part because of its location: “It’s more or less connected to the fairgrounds,” which each August hosts the Arkansas Valley Fair, the “oldest continuous in Colorado,” and Crystal Lake, which along with the fairgrounds is undergoing an ambitious transformation with planned parking, a nature trail, a mountain bike park and playgrounds, thanks to a grant from Great Outdoors Colorado.

Rocky Ford will continue to develop this project, for which they received $150,000 in 2022 to begin community engagement and assessment, and another $400,000 in 2024 for planning and design, Gurulé said. They’re applying for $21 million from GOCO and numerous other funders to bring the project to life.

While the Brewer burn site, if demolished, decontaminated and cleaned up, would be perfect for mixed residential and commercial use, the Liberty School site could house a hotel or other lodging, something the city desperately needs, Gurulé said.

But without funding from the federal government, Rocky Ford isn’t getting so much as an assessment of the environmental and health issues the building damage brings as well as the economic impacts. That means the eyesore stays, the asbestos particles float and the sorely needed facelift for the commercial district and north side of Rocky Ford won’t likely happen in the near future. “It’s hurting us in several different ways,” Gurulé said.

Now what?

Despite it all, Rocky Ford tries to remain hopeful.

“We’re waiting to see what new programs the EPA will release and we’re working with the Colorado Department of Local Affairs and Colorado Department of Public Heath and Environment to identify funding we can use,” said Gurulé.

In an ideal scenario, Rocky Ford “receives technical assistance to apply for funding from the EPA to address this cleanup, is able to support and attract new business expansion or growth, and has development of homes that meet the needs of our region across all housing types and all income levels,” he added. “We nurture the growth of a Rocky Ford for the next generations.”

But hope becomes challenging when Gurulé thinks about Trump terminating the program that could have helped them, with the grant that “was more than just dollars, it was a rare opportunity for a small city with limited staff and resources to finally address long-standing environmental hazards.

“It didn’t just cancel a funding stream. It sent a message that rural communities like Rocky Ford — where people pay federal taxes just like folks in big cities, but don’t have full-time grant writers or million-dollar budgets to chase federal funds – don’t matter. That our health, our environment and our future are not a priority.”

So Gurulé keeps telling the story. “Because when policies are made without rural voices at the table, we are the ones left cleaning up the mess, sometimes literally, like with asbestos in our neighborhoods. And if we don’t speak up, these decisions will keep happening in D.C., while our communities are left to ‘make do’ with less and less.”

On Tuesday, a tiny stroke of luck may have arrived, when a federal judge ruled that cancelling $600 million in environmental justice grants, including those administered through the Thriving Communities Grantmaking Program, was illegal.

More Colorado Safeway stores go on strike

Safeway stores in Boulder, Brighton and Lone Tree joined the ongoing labor strike on Thursday, even as negotiations between the union and Safeway management resumed this week.

But in a note to members of United Food and Commercial Workers International Union Local 7 late Thursday, President Kim Cordova said, “the company remains unwilling to offer an agreement that meets the needs of workers.”

Negotiations have ended for the week and more stores are expected to join the strike in a staggered rollout to keep the company guessing which store will need temporary workers next.

Stores in Pueblo, Fountain and Estes Park first hit the picket lines on Sunday. And nearly every day since, more stores joined, including locations in Grand Junction, Littleton and Castle Rock.

Union workers are asking for management to address the issue of understaffed stores. They’re also concerned about reduced benefits, especially to retired workers.

Safeway spokesperson Heather Halpape said in an email that the company is trying to “achieve a balanced agreement that rewards our associates, benefits our customers, and is sustainable for our company in the competitive grocery industry.”

➔ April hiring in Colorado saw largest one-month drop in the U.S. Local employers eased up on hiring in April, compared with March, more so than any other state nationwide, according to the latest Job Openings and Labor Turnover summary from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. But that may be due to a hiring spree in March, when the state had the highest one-month increase in the U.S.

In April, Colorado employers hired an estimated 113,000 people, down from the 146,000 in March. On the other hand, the number of layoffs saw a sharp decline, dropping to 23,000, from 39,000 in March. The change was the second-largest decline in layoffs.

The employees apparently love their jobs and their boss but, Winkler said, there’s concern that O’Brien is on his third and final term and “this glaring fact had been noticed by the workers and they wanted to form a Union to maintain the conditions and culture they are currently in, knowing that that could change through leadership in the future.”

Location: Las Cruces, NM

Today, U.S. Representative Gabe Vasquez (NM-02) joined conservation advocates, local leaders, and community members at the Organ Mountains–Desert Peaks National Monument (OMDP) to rally against renewed efforts to sell off federal public lands. The event featured a press conference and community hike, highlighting the cultural, economic, and environmental importance of public lands to southern New Mexico.

The event comes amidst a revived push by Senate Republicans to advance one of the most extreme public land sell-off proposals in recent history of over 3.3 million acres. While these provisions were blocked in the House thanks to Rep. Vasquez’s leadership in the bipartisan Public Lands Caucus, they have resurfaced in the Senate’s version of the budget reconciliation bill, reigniting concern across the West.

“Standing here at Organ Mountains–Desert Peaks, I’m reminded that what’s at stake isn’t just this monument—it’s the future of millions of acres of public lands across New Mexico and the West that could be sold off because of Republican proposals in Congress,” said Vasquez. “These lands are part of our identity. They support local jobs, protect sacred Tribal sites, and give our kids a chance to connect with the outdoors. Our public lands are not for sale. Period.”

“There are a number of reasons why keeping OMDP intact and untouched is so important. Not only are conservation and preservation instrumental in this argument, but in Las Cruces, our community has embraced this monument because of the hiking and camping, the outdoor recreation opportunities, and so much more,” said Carrie Hamblen, CEO and President of the Las Cruces Green Chamber of Commerce and New Mexico State Senator. “Our local businesses rely on the tourism that brings visitors into our stores and restaurants and creates a memorable experience for all to enjoy. Our monument isn’t for sale, and our community has proven to this administration that it should be left alone.”

“Our community in Southern New Mexico understands that our landscape brings us together. These lands hold so much more than what can be extracted or profited from them. They hold our stories, they are homes to essential wildlife, they improve the health of our communities,” said Patrick Nolan, Executive Director of Friends of Organ Mountains-Desert Peaks. “The value of our lands cannot be summed up by what can be extracted from them. We hope Congress, with the help of Representative Vasquez, understands that the value of our lands cannot be summed up by what can be extracted from them. That these lands hold value as they are protected and conserved for generations to come.”

“New Mexico Wild and our thousands of members object in the strongest possible terms to any attempts to shrink, eliminate, or remove protections for Organ Mountains-Desert Peaks or any other national monument. These monuments were created as a result of local communities working for years to protect these one of a kind places,” said Mark Allison, Executive Director of New Mexico Wild. “Nearly 90% of New Mexicans — people of all political persuasions — support keeping our monuments intact. They are not merely lines on a map but critical ecological havens, sacred cultural sites, and irreplaceable natural treasures that help define our identity. Public lands are the backdrop to our state’s outdoor heritage and way of life. Plans to sell off our children’s inheritance to benefit connected billionaires is a theft of historic proportions and should make all Americans ashamed and outraged.”

“To New Mexicans public lands aren’t some line item on a budget spreadsheet. Public lands are our lifeblood. Wild, public places and the wild things that inhabit those places are integral to the culture, traditions and lifestyle of countless people across the West,” said Jesse Duebel, Executive Director of the New Mexico Wildlife Federation. “Public lands are not just about outdoor recreation and all the health and economic benefits associated with that. These places house our identity. It’s where we go to obtain our food, the firewood to heat our homes, and the solace we need to overcome the challenges of modern society. Public lands are our gym, our church and our grocery store. In short, our public lands are not for sale, they are in our DNA.”

“The broad scheme to sell off our public lands, national heritage, and outdoor access to the wealthy and well-connected will block access to regular Americans for hiking, camping, hunting, and fishing. It also willfully ignores or disrespects the Indigenous, Hispano, and local communities who rely on these lands for cultural, spiritual, economic, and recreational reasons, said Romir Lahiri, Associate Program Director for Conservation Lands Foundation. “These lands are part of what makes New Mexico so special. New Mexico’s national monuments, including Organ Mountains–Desert Peaks and Río Grande del Norte, exist because the people demanded it. From local business owners and family campers to mountain guides and outdoor adventurers, the majority—regardless of political affiliation—want these treasured natural places protected and accessible for generations to come.”

“Our public lands are living landscapes. Any effort to weaken their protections threaten the health, heritage, and well-being of their connected communities and stand in direct opposition to the voices of New Mexicans. Despite overwhelming support for our public lands, the Trump Administration is systematically degrading the laws and agencies that manage these irreplaceable places and jeopardizing the legal duty to engage meaningfully with Tribal leadership,” said Maude Dinan, New Mexico Program Manager for the National Parks Conservation Association.“Prioritizing oil and gas drilling or mining, erasing national monuments, or transferring public lands to states is short-sighted and will cause irrevocable harm to our landscapes and people.”

Earlier this year, Vasquez launched the bipartisan Public Lands Caucus alongside Rep. Ryan Zinke (R-MT-01) to bring together lawmakers from both parties who support the protection of public lands. The caucus has quickly become a driving force behind efforts to conserve our public lands and fight for the outdoor recreation economy.

In addition to fighting against this latest effort to sell public lands in order to pay for tax breaks for billionaires, Vasquez also joined a letter earlier this year to the administration urging the Department of Interior to leave OMDP intact, highlighting its significant landscapes, cultural resources and economic impact.

Shore said it’s heartbreaking to see public servants at the EPA go through these cuts, especially as the administration tries to make the “One Big Beautiful Bill” seem like a win.
“I have never worked with a group of such smart, devoted professionals who had a shared sense of mission as EPA employees,” Shore said.
Within the bill, the White House would also have the ability to cut federal agencies and reduce workforce, Shore said.
McCrady expects public health to worsen as a result of EPA rollbacks.","As President Donald Trump touts a bill currently making its way through Congress as a win for the public, a former regional Environmental Protection Agency administrator is prepared to see devastating cuts to the office that could negatively impact human health.

“It’s proposing severe cuts to both the scientific work that EPA’s Office of Research and Development does and to the agency as a whole,” said Debra Shore, former administrator for EPA Region 5. “It would severely reduce the agency’s ability to fulfill its mission of protecting public health and the environment.”

As the “One Big Beautiful Bill” Act has passed the U.S. House of Representatives and moved to the Senate, activists nationwide have worried about the consequences.

Shore said it’s heartbreaking to see public servants at the EPA go through these cuts, especially as the administration tries to make the “One Big Beautiful Bill” seem like a win.

“I have never worked with a group of such smart, devoted professionals who had a shared sense of mission as EPA employees,” Shore said. “I know that’s the case across the agency. … They could be working for far higher salaries in many cases, but they are dedicated to the foundational mission of the EPA, which is to protect public health and the environment.”

On Tuesday and Wednesday, the EPA posted on Facebook, saying it “delivers for all Americans.”

“One Big Beautiful Bill is putting American workers, taxpayers and families first,” the EPA’s Tuesday post said. “Under (Trump), the U.S. can unleash American energy while ensuring we have the cleanest air, land and water on (Earth).”

The bill eliminates hundreds of billions of dollars in Green New Deal tax credits, repeals former President Joe Biden administration’s electric vehicle mandates, and opens federal lands and waters to oil, gas, coal, geothermal and mineral leasing, according to the EPA’s Tuesday post.

According to the Wednesday post, the bill also “streamlines onerous permitting processes,” refills the Strategic Petroleum reserve and “delivers certainty to energy producers, saves and creates energy jobs, lowers energy costs for families.”

A spokesperson for Sen. Todd Young, R-Indiana, provided a statement about the bill Friday.

“Senator Young continues to have conversations with his colleagues and stakeholders about improving the House-passed bill and addressing our nation’s debt and deficit challenges,” said Leah Selk, spokesperson for Young.

Representatives for Sen. Jim Banks, R-Indiana, did not respond to a request for comment Friday.

Within the bill, the White House would also have the ability to cut federal agencies and reduce workforce, Shore said.

“This is just an utter abrogation of Congress’ authority and power,” Shore said. “It requires an annual report of planned reorganizational moves, and it also streamlines the ability of any future president to rebuild federal agencies because of some of the language in it.”

Susan Thomas, director of policy and press for Just Transition Northwest Indiana, said it’s concerning that EPA is treating the “One Big Beautiful Bill” like a win, especially on social media platforms that are easily accessible.

“No one can take any information for granted anymore,” Thomas said. “You must do your own research with trusted sources because the amount of greenwashing that’s coming down is so dangerous. … This is becoming increasingly difficult, but it’s more important than ever.”

Thomas and Gary Advocates for Responsible Development board member Carolyn McCrady are both worried about the effects that environmental justice communities will face if the bill passes the Senate.

McCrady expects public health to worsen as a result of EPA rollbacks.

An October report from Industrious Labs found that most residents in Gary are in the top 10% of U.S. residents most at-risk for developing asthma and at-risk of low life expectancy. In 2020, Indiana had a lung cancer rate of 72.5 per 100,000 people, with Lake County as one of the state’s counties with the highest cancer mortality rates, according to the American Lung Association.

A 2016 JAMA Network report also found Gary as one of the top five U.S. cities with the lowest life expectancy at one point.

“I think people are going to be sicker faster,” McCrady said. “I don’t think people will be able to be served in the medical community in the same way, because in Indiana, millions of people are going to lose their health insurance because of the Medicaid cuts.”

Although McCrady believes the EPA cuts are devastating, she isn’t surprised to see them included in “One Big Beautiful Bill.”

Cuts will continue to put communities like Gary at a greater disadvantage, McCrady said.

Thomas also believes that Northwest Indiana’s environmental justice communities will struggle as a result of the “One Big Beautiful Bill.”

“They’ve already stripped away all of the environmental justice provisions that had taken years to recognize and acknowledge and to start to put in place,” Thomas said. “This is just a very sad state that we’re in.”",https://www.chicagotribune.com/wp-content/uploads/migration/2023/05/15/AVOQFLH6NRHSFE6WCT2X3ZFTGU.jpg?w=1024&h=670,N,,2025-06-21 13:09:24.411575

The government has given extra funds for the Department for Energy Security and Net Zero to invest between 2026 and 2029, with £14bn set aside for a new nuclear plant at Sizewell C and an industrial strategy set to outline government plans on reducing energy bills.

The oil and gas sites have received heavy criticism from Miliband while courts in Scotland blocked projects on the basis projects were approved without greenhouse gas emissions being considered, putting millions of pounds of investment into jeopardy.

Developing offshore sites

A new draft of guidance on emissions is reportedly set to be unveiled and it will signal how energy giants can regain licences and develop offshore sites.

The shift in policy comes after City AM revealed the government admitted low carbon technologies were more expensive to use than fossil-fuel powered alternatives.

The admission came in the minutes for a PAC report, which is publicly available online, detailing the government’s responses to recommendations made on energy policy.

The statement explains that high electricity prices in the UK may be due to the costs of operating renewable energy such as solar power and offshore wind, as well as other technologies, which may include energy storage methods and energy infrastructure.

“Low carbon technologies can be more expensive to run than fossil-fuel powered alternatives,” the government said in its response to the PAC recommendations on energy bills.

“The price disparity between electricity and gas needs to be addressed to make it more attractive for consumers to install clean technologies like heat pumps.”

Hopes oil and gas sites will ease prices

Recent data showed standard electricity bills reaching £1,067 last year compared to £814 for gas, making average energy bills stand at around £1,881 in 2024.

The previous government supported rolling out projects to boost energy supplies, with Rosebank expected to generate thousands of jobs for construction.

Jackdaw was projected to provide up to six per cent of the UK’s gas demand before it was blocked by judges due to the “interest of members of the public in climate change”.

Miliband would still have to give projects the go-ahead if Shell and Equinor return with proposals.

Confederation of British Industry (CBI) boss Rain Newton-Smith was the latest industry leader to call for the government to tackle high energy costs.

Even before the court's ruling, California's clean air waivers were under threat. Earlier this month, U.S. President Donald Trump signed a measure passed by Congress that would roll back the waivers, though California sued in response.

Justices Sonia Sotomayor and Ketanji Brown Jackson dissented in the case, but offered separate opinions.

RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) — North Carolina legislators finalized a bill Thursday that would eliminate an interim greenhouse gas reduction mandate set in a landmark 2021 law, while still directing regulators to aim to cancel out power plant carbon emissions in the state within the next 25 years.

With some bipartisan support, the state Senate voted to accept the House version that would repeal the 2021 law’s requirement that electric regulators take “all reasonable steps to achieve” reducing carbon dioxide output 70% from 2005 levels by 2030. The law’s directive to take similar steps to meet a carbon neutrality standard by 2050 would remain in place.

The bill’s Republican supporters pushing the new measure say getting rid of the interim goal benefits ratepayers asked to pay for future electric-production construction and is more efficient for Duke Energy, the state’s dominant electric utility.

The bill now goes to Democratic Gov. Josh Stein, who can veto the measure, sign it or let it become law without his signature. Stein previously expressed concerns about the Senate version of the measure, worried that it could hurt electricity users and threaten the state’s clean-energy economy. His office didn’t immediately provide comment after Thursday’s vote.

With over a dozen House and Senate Democrats voting for the final version, the chances that any Stein veto could be overridden are higher. Republicans in charge of the General Assembly are only one House seat shy of a veto-proof majority.

The bill also contains language that would help Duke Energy seek higher electric rates to cover financing costs to build nuclear or gas-powered plants incrementally, rather than wait until the project’s end.

The 2021 greenhouse gas law marked a rare agreement on environmental issues by then-Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper and Republican lawmakers.

At least 17 other states — most controlled by Democrats — have laws setting similar net-zero power plant emissions or 100% renewable energy targets, according to the Natural Resources Defense Council. North Carolina and Virginia are the only ones from the Southeast.

The legislation came about as President Donald Trump’s administration has proposed rolling back federal environmental and climate change policies, which critics say could boost pollution and threaten human health. Republicans are promoting them as ways to reduce the cost of living and boost the economy.

The state Utilities Commission, which regulates rates and services for public utilities, already has pushed back the 2030 deadline — as the 2021 law allows — by at least four years. The panel acknowledged last year it was “no longer reasonable or executable” for Duke Energy to meet the reduction standard by 2030.

Bill supporters say to meet the goal would require expensive types of alternate energy immediately. If the interim standard can be bypassed, GOP bill authors say, Duke Energy can assemble less expensive power sources now and moderate electricity rate increases necessary to reach the 2050 standard.

“Our residents shouldn’t be saddled with higher power bills to satisfy arbitrary targets,” Republican Senate leader Phil Berger said in a news release after the vote.

Citing an analysis performed by a state agency that represents consumers before the commission, GOP lawmakers say removing the interim goal would reduce by at least $13 billion what Duke Energy would have to spend — and pass on to customers — in the next 25 years.

Bill opponents question the savings figure given uncertainty in plant fuel prices, energy demand and construction costs. They say the interim goal still holds an aspirational purpose and was something that Duke Energy had agreed in 2021 to meet.

Provisions in the measure related to recouping plant construction expenses over time would reduce accumulated borrowing interest.

Environmental groups argue the financing option would benefit Duke Energy’s bottom line on expensive projects even if they’re never completed, and the bill broadly would prevent cleaner energy sources from coming online sooner. They also contend another bill section would shift costs to residential customers.

“This bill is bad for all North Carolinians, whether they’re Duke Energy customers or simply people who want to breathe clean air,” North Carolina Sierra Club director Chris Herndon said after the vote while urging Stein to veto the measure.

Bill support came from the North Carolina Chamber and a manufacturers’ group, in addition to Duke Energy.

“We appreciate bipartisan efforts by policymakers to keep costs as low as possible for customers and enable the always-on energy resources our communities need,” the company said this week.

The company and supporters of the bill say the changes will save customers money.

Critics say the state is backing away from its commitment to clean energy, which can slow climate change. And with the shift in the way new power plants would be financed, customers could end up paying for projects Duke Energy may never build or bring online.

Senate Bill 266 was approved on Thursday in the state legislature and now goes to Gov. Josh Stein.

The carbon-emissions component

In 2021, Democrats and Republicans in the legislature worked together to approve House Bill 951 that committed North Carolina to a 70% reduction in carbon dioxide emissions by public electric utilities from 2005 levels by the year 2030. It set a goal of carbon neutrality – meaning for every ton of carbon dioxide power plants emit, an equivalent amount of carbon dioxide emissions is prevented — to achieve by 2050.

Duke Energy, the N.C. Sustainable Energy Association and others helped craft that bill, which favors transitioning to cleaner energy sources such as large-scale solar power as coal plants are retired.

SB 266 leaves in place the 2050 goal of carbon neutrality but drops the requirement of the 70% reduction by 2030.

That comes as a disappointment to clean-energy advocates, including Mel Mackin, director of state policy for Ceres, a Massachusetts-based nonprofit.

“Leading businesses across North Carolina have supported the state’s plan to reduce power sector emissions by 70% by 2030, both to reduce their own exposure to climate risk and to experience the economic benefits of clean energy investment,” Mackin said. “This decision not only delays that goal, but it also sets a worrying precedent.

“While we will continue to push for greater ambition from Duke moving forward, including through increased investment in clean energy resources and transmission upgrades, this outcome is a reminder that achieving our climate, energy, and economic goals will require concerted and aligned effort from all levels of government and the private sector.”

Paying for new power plants

Markin said Friday that North Carolina and other states are expecting a large increase in the demand for electricity with the development of data centers and growth in manufacturing. To compete for new industry, the state must assure businesses they’ll have access to reliable power.

SB 266 would make a major change in how Duke Energy would finance new projects to provide that power. Typically, the utility builds first and recoups the cost of the investment by billing customers later.

Under the new law, the utility would finance new construction in advance, getting the money from rate-payers instead of borrowing it from commercial lenders with interest.

Duke says the method, called Construction While in Progress, or CWIP, saves customers money by avoiding interest charges.

“We appreciate bipartisan efforts by policymakers to keep costs as low as possible for customers and enable the always-on energy resources our communities need,” Garrett Poorman, a Duke spokesman, said Friday. “Policies which build on our state’s strong customer protections while helping meet growing energy demands from population growth, business expansion and a resurgence of manufacturing can play a critical role in supporting North Carolina’s thriving economy.”

Josh Brooks, chief of policy strategy and innovation for the N.C. Sustainable Energy Association, said he’s concerned that customers here could end up like those in South Carolina, who still are paying for two nuclear reactors that were never built, or those in Georgia, where a nuclear plant came online seven years late and more than $17 billion over budget.

Duke’s spokesman said SB 266 “includes important safeguards to protect customers, adding to the strict oversight North Carolina policymakers have granted the Utilities Commission over the construction of new generation resources.”

Brooks disagreed.

“Conceptually there is an argument to be made that CWIP, with guardrails, could help with financing costs as long as the project is actually built and all costs are just and reasonable to provide the best reliable service to the state,” he said. “While (SB) 266 does have some guardrails, they are not sufficient to ensure that happens.”

The bill is headed to Stein, who will have 10 days to make a decision on it. If the Democratic governor decides to veto the bill, SB 266 would go back to the Republican-controlled legislature, where it would likely need support from at least one Democrat to become law.

Published by Canary Media, Renewable Energy World Floodlight is a nonprofit newsroom that investigates the powers stalling climate action.","Republicans and Democrats alike are less likely to support renewable energy than they were five years ago, according to a survey released June 5 by the Pew Research Center. Floodlight examines the survey results, which mirror growing pockets of opposition to solar farms, reignited political support for coal plants and moves by President Donald Trump and congressional Republicans to kill federally funded clean energy projects.

This shift in opinion dates back to when Democratic President Joe Biden took office, said Brian Kennedy, Pew senior researcher and one of the study’s authors. “This isn’t a new trend,” he said.

Still, Kenneth Gillingham, professor of environmental and energy economics at the Yale School of the Environment, was surprised.

“I see this shift … as a successful effort to link climate change and renewable energy to broader culture war issues,” Gillingham said. He added that in the past, “prominent” Republicans supported renewables and sought solutions to climate change, but those stances could now be seen as “disloyal” to Trump.

Pew Research Center

The survey of 5,085 U.S. adults taken April 28 to May 4 revealed that while 79% of Americans favored expanding wind and solar production in 2020, that number has dropped to 60%. And 39% of Americans today support expansion of oil, coal and natural gas — almost double the 20% that supported it in 2020.

Combustion of fossil fuels — in transportation, energy generation and industrial production — is the No. 1 cause of climate change.

Much of the change in opinion is driven by Republicans, whose support of oil and gas grew from 35% in 2020 to 67% today. But Democrats also indicated less support for renewable energy and more for fossil fuels than five years ago.

While many results reflect Trump’s policies opposing most renewables and boosting fossil fuels, Pew found a few notable exceptions: 69% of all respondents favor offshore wind — a technology Trump has specifically targeted.

Both Democrats and Republicans indicated stronger support for nuclear power, with Republicans’ favorable opinions increasing from 53% in 2020 to 69% in 2025. Democrats’ support rose from 37% to 52%. The Trump administration has signaled support for a nuclear renaissance, despite its high cost.

There were wide partisan splits on several topics. In March, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency announced it would scale back environmental regulations. Pew asked whether it was possible to do that and still protect air and water quality: 77% of Republicans said yes and 67% of Democrats said no.

Pew didn’t ask the respondents why their attitudes have shifted. But Kennedy said in Pew’s past surveys, Republicans have expressed concern about the economic impacts of climate change policies and transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy sources.

Mike Murphy, a Republican consultant and electric vehicle backer, said when the environmental benefits of clean technologies are touted, it polarizes Republicans. Instead, Murphy said messages should be about pocketbook issues — like lower fuel costs — and jobs.

“It’s hard for pro-climate people to understand,” said Murphy, who has advised dozens of state and national GOP campaigns including John McCain’s 2008 presidential bid. “(They think) we just need to shout louder and hit people over the head about climate, climate, climate. The key is you want to talk about jobs and national security and other events that naturally resonate a lot more with right-of-center people.”

That’s what Murphy’s groups, the EV Politics Project and the American EV Jobs Alliance, are trying to do to depoliticize electric vehicles. “Whenever electric cars are seen through a climate lens,” Murphy said, “their appeal narrows.”

It’s a strategy also being used by the Electrification Coalition, a left-of-center pro-EV group. Ben Prochazka, the coalition’s executive director, echoed Murphy’s strategy, adding that EVs have “become overly politicized and caught in the culture wars, impacting markets and ultimately hurting our ability to realize their many benefits for all Americans.”

Prochazka noted that once introduced to EVs, consumers support them: “EV drivers love their vehicles, with more than eight out of ten reporting that their next car will also be electric.”

Pew Research Center

Perhaps those practical messages are getting through. In the Pew survey, electric vehicles were the one item that saw an uptick in support — 4 percentage points in the past year.

But popular support might not be enough to stop Congress from killing a $7,500 electric vehicle credit, which Murphy said would be “policy disaster.”

Republicans, he said, are in a “real squeeze,” because “they don’t have enough money for the tax cuts the president has promised.”

Murphy said: “It’s easier for Republicans to cut Biden electric cars … than it is for them to cut more Medicaid.”

Gillingham is still optimistic that solar, wind and other greenhouse gas-reducing technologies will move forward — because they are the cheapest.

“The continued decline in the price of renewable energy and battery technologies, as well as other new technologies, is a reason to continue to have hope that the worst impacts of climate change can be addressed,” he said.

In its current form, that bill would abruptly end most of the Biden-era federal tax credits for low-carbon sources of electricity like wind, solar, batteries and geothermal power. Repealing those credits could increase the average family’s energy bill by as much as $400 per year within a decade, according to several studies published this year.

Indiana wind projects can be a source of revenue through taxes, land leases, and economic development agreements. The latest figures reveal that in 2023, the industry generated $23 million in state and local tax payments. The revenue helps fund areas including schools, hospitals and local businesses, contributing to the overall economic health of the areas. Rural landowners are also benefitting from an additional stream of revenue, sharing in $22 million in annual land lease payments in 2023.

Clean energy manufacturers and advocates say they’re perplexed how the repeal of tax credits in President Donald Trump’s “one big beautiful bill” will keep their domestic production lines humming across the United States, particularly in states that elected him to the Oval Office.

While some Republicans have labeled the billions in tax credits a “green new scam,” statistics reviewed by States Newsroom show the jobs and benefits would boost predominantly GOP-leaning states and congressional districts. Now the industry is already slowing amid Trump’s back-and-forth tariff policy and mixed messaging on energy and manufacturing.

Two Northwest Indiana activism groups joined other environmental groups in sending a petition to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency in objection to an air monitoring permit recently approved for Cleveland-Cliffs’ Indiana Harbor facility.

The petition alleges that a permit recently issued to Cleveland-Cliffs from the Indiana Department of Environmental Management falls “significantly short of basic provisions, including failure to include monitoring, testing and recordkeeping” to ensure compliance with the Clean Air Act.

“If this permit is approved as is, the Cleveland-Cliffs facilities (at Indiana Harbor in East Chicago) will likely release harmful emissions into the air…” Ellis Walton, associate attorney at the Environmental Law and Policy Center, said in a Monday news release. “The communities of East Chicago and Gary suffer many environmental injustices already and shouldn’t be forced to bear even more harms from local industry.”

In 2025, Michigan saw significant progress in solar power development, with new utility-scale projects being built and existing initiatives expanding. The state also saw increased focus on brownfield sites for solar energy.

Michigan is making strides in incorporating solar power into its energy mix, with goals to increase renewable energy sources and phase out coal-fired power plants. The state has seen significant growth in solar capacity, and incentives are available to help homeowners and businesses adopt solar technology.

Currently, Michigan’s electricity is made up of 1.25 percent solar energy, enough to power over 230,000 homes. Michigan’s solar industry employs 4,000 citizens through its 223 solar companies. The solar industry has invested $1.7 billion in the state.

In 2025, Iowa is expected to generate 65% of its electricity from renewable sources, placing it as the state with the highest percentage of renewable energy production in the US. Specifically, wind energy contributes 80.1% of Iowa’s electricity production

The Texas Legislature ended its biennial session without passing a slew of bills that could have killed the state’s booming solar and battery sector, and by extension, the ability to keep the Texas grid running amid extreme weather and surging demand for electricity.

It did pass a law that could strengthen the state’s electricity reliability by encouraging the construction of more microgrids — combinations of small-scale gas-fired power, solar, and batteries that can be built quickly. Last week, Texas lawmakers authorized a long-awaited $1.8 billion fund to support microgrid deployment at hospitals, nursing homes, water treatment plants, police and fire stations, and other critical facilities across the state.",https://wfhb.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/WFHBshowgraphics_square-crop-660x330.jpg,N,,2025-06-21 12:15:59.375898

A sweeping Republican-led proposal, referred to as the “One Big Beautiful Bill,” is charging through Congress and threatens to wipe out the popular electric vehicle (EV) tax credit for most vehicles in 2025.

The credit was originally launched in 2008, but received a major overhaul under former President Joe Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act of 2022. That legislation supercharged incentives, expanding the $7,500 credit for new EVs and rolling out a $4,000 credit for used electric vehicles.

“The purpose of the tax incentives was simply to spur EV adoption by giving a literal ‘incentive’ for people to buy EVs,” says Dave Thomas, director of content marketing and automotive industry analyst at CDK Global, a technology firm serving car dealerships.

However, President Donald Trump and other Republicans have vowed to eliminate the credit, but analysts say the tax credit has been a driving force behind the EV boom.

According to J.D. Power’s E-Vision Intelligence Report, 87 percent of EV shoppers in 2024 took advantage of the tax credit — many citing it as a key reason for their purchase.

That momentum could stall if the bill clears the Senate and makes its way to the president’s desk. Here’s what’s at stake under the “One Big Beautiful Bill.”

Here’s how the EV tax credit works now

Under the current law, which covers cars purchased in 2023 or later, taxpayers can claim the electric vehicle tax credit if they meet specific income and purchase requirements.

For new electric vehicles, you may qualify for a credit of up to $7,500, as long as the vehicle is primarily used in the United States. To be eligible, your modified adjusted gross income (MAGI) must fall below the following limits:

$300,000 for married couples filing jointly or a surviving spouse

$225,000 for head of household filers

$150,000 for all other filers

The IRS allows taxpayers to apply the income limit based on the year they take possession of the vehicle or the prior year — whichever is more favorable.

For used electric vehicles purchased in 2023 or later, the credit is worth up to $4,000 or 30 percent of the purchase price, whichever is less. The vehicle’s purchase price must not exceed $25,000, and you must buy the car from a licensed dealer.

Also, the car must be at least two years old when you purchase it; for example, if you bought the car in 2025, it would have to be a 2023 model or older to qualify for the credit.

Used EVs have lower income limitations than newer EVs as follows:

$150,000 for married couples filing jointly or a surviving spouse

$112,500 for head of household filers

$75,000 for all other filers

Another benefit: You can receive the credit at the time of the purchase instead of waiting until tax time to claim it, by transferring the tax credit to the dealer. If you choose this option at the dealership, you must still meet all the IRS requirements when filing your tax return.

House and Senate agree on ending the credit, but not on when

Much like the House-approved tax bill, the Senate proposal seeks to eliminate the electric vehicle tax credit for both new and used vehicles. But the Senate’s timeline moves even faster.

Here’s how the two versions compare:

EV tax credit: House vs. Senate bills

The main difference between the House-approved bill and the Senate’s version is how quickly the EV tax credit would end.

Under the Senate’s proposal, the $7,500 tax credit for new electric vehicles would expire 180 days after the bill becomes law. The $4,000 credit for used EVs would phase out even sooner — just 90 days after enactment.

By contrast, the House bill would end the EV tax credit for most vehicles at the end of 2025. However, some vehicles could still qualify through the end of 2026.

Plus, the House version includes a manufacturer-based phaseout. Automakers that have sold fewer than 200,000 EVs could still offer the credit until the end of 2026.

“So, Tesla for example will not have any incentives on its vehicles after the bill passes,” Thomas says. “It will likely be hard for car shoppers to track this in real-time, and they will have to rely on research or their local car dealer to keep on top of it.”

New EV fee in House bill dropped in Senate’s plan

While the House-approved bill includes a $250 annual fee, the Senate’s version omits any mention of an annual EV charge. The House’s proposed fee for electric vehicle owners is a measure aimed at ensuring all drivers contribute equally to maintaining the nation’s roadways.

Currently, owners of gas-powered cars help fund highway infrastructure through the 18.4 cents per gallon federal gas tax. But that tax has remained unchanged since 1993, even as the cost of maintaining roadways has skyrocketed. Plus, cars have become more fuel-efficient — and some drivers have switched to electric cars.

But some experts argue the proposed $250 EV fee is excessive. The proposed fee would be nearly three times what the average driver pays annually in gas taxes, according to a Consumer Reports study.

“The proposal of an annual fee for EVs makes sense on its face as those owners don’t pay the federal or local gasoline taxes,” Thomas says. “However, most calculations say the average driver pays around $100 in gas taxes a year and this fee is clearly more than that.”

And EV owners often do pay state and local fees tied to their cars, depending on the tax rules of the state where they live.

Bottom line

While the Senate bill wouldn’t charge EV owners an annual fee and the House includes it, both chambers agree on one thing: Eliminating the federal EV tax credit altogether. With the EV credit potentially ending soon, drivers considering an EV purchase may want to act quickly. Waiting could mean missing out on valuable tax incentives that can help lower the cost.",https://www.bankrate.com/brp/2025/06/21101803/electric-vehicles-at-charging-station-in-california.jpg,N,,2025-06-21 11:08:02.566241

This translates into significant cost savings, particularly for cooling — one of the largest energy loads in commercial buildings during the summer.
Adopting energy storage now helps reduce electricity costs, increases resilience and prepares buildings for coming regulations, just like how parking became a planning standard decades ago.","In the 1940s-1950s, cities across the U.S. started embedding minimum parking requirements into zoning ordinances, mandating that new developments include a set number of off-street parking spaces based on use and square footage.

The City of Los Angeles was among the first major U.S. cities to mandate off-street parking requirements in its zoning code. The 1946 Los Angeles Zoning Plan introduced provisions requiring new developments to include a minimum number of off-street parking spaces tailored to the building’s use and size.

These mandatory parking lots were part of the urban planning zeitgeist of the time. But even as cities reverse the trend in favor of more walkable city centers, it’s worth remembering that the architects of mandatory parking requirements got at least one thing right.

They understood that a city’s commercial and industrial buildings require a great deal of urban infrastructure resources, yet are also uniquely capable of providing resources that benefit both city residents and themselves.

Therefore, in the late 60s, a dramatic mandatory step started rolling out regarding commercial building permitting across the country: a demand to acquire underground car storage capabilities, or underground parking lots.

What seems now like a very natural and reasonable demand for a permit was, at that time, rather extreme. Building a high-rise six levels below ground level was not an ordinary or a natural part of the required investment from the developer’s point of view. But today, we cannot imagine the evolution of big cities without embracing these regulations.

Building owners today face rising electricity costs, growing energy demand and increasing pressure to maintain reliability without compromising budgets. These challenges are especially pronounced during peak hours, when energy prices spike and outages are more likely, putting operations and tenants at risk.

Although lithium-ion battery systems are often discussed as a solution, they are rarely viable for commercial buildings. Safety concerns, along with complex insurance, permitting and regulatory hurdles, prevent this technology from becoming a feasible solution.

But thermal energy storage, in which my company specializes, offers a more practical alternative. By storing energy in the form of ice during off-peak hours, when electricity is cleaner and cheaper, these systems reduce daytime energy use without changing how buildings operate.

This translates into significant cost savings, particularly for cooling — one of the largest energy loads in commercial buildings during the summer. Ice-based systems such as ours can cut cooling costs by 30 to 50 percent.

Unlike lithium-ion batteries, thermal storage is safe, clean and durable and doesn’t require grid-interconnection permits, which can take years, making it easier to deploy and manage.

As energy storage becomes a standard expectation in modern building design, much like parking once did, thermal solutions give “looking-forward” ownership a way to stay ahead of regulatory shifts while gaining immediate operational and financial benefits

Energy storage is quickly becoming a critical part of commercial building strategy, with strong signals that it may soon be mandated in many jurisdictions. Regulatory shifts, such as New York City’s Local Law 97 and California’s Title 24, are pushing buildings toward lower emissions; storage will likely be a required part of compliance in the near future.

Nationally, the House Committee on Ways and Means proposed a draft 2025 Budget Reconciliation bill that could reshape the storage market, further incentivizing behind-the-meter solutions.

Energy storage is increasingly recognized in LEED certification for its role in demand response and energy optimization, and in states like California and New York, qualified systems can participate in wholesale electricity markets, unlocking new revenue and reducing operational costs.

Buildings with accredited systems can now earn resource adequacy credits, as seen in programs by the California Public Utilities Commission, turning passive energy consumers into active market participants.

Adopting energy storage now helps reduce electricity costs, increases resilience and prepares buildings for coming regulations, just like how parking became a planning standard decades ago. For building owners and managers, the time to act is now.",https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/06/commercial_construction_05132025_GettyImages-2214753287.jpg?w=1280,N,,2025-06-21 12:17:06.663028

Prices start at $57,400.

I'm sharing my impressions of vehicles after living with them for a few days or as a make or model evolves. The car this week is the 2025 Volvo XC90 AWD T8.

What is it?

It's a plug-in hybrid version of Volvo’s six- or seven-seat three-row luxury SUV. Volvo calls it a 2025.5 model, but U.S. regulations, which govern model years, don’t recognize half-model years. (Sorry, Mustang fans; there wasn’t a 1964.5 either.)

How much?

I tested an $80,700 XC90 T8 AWD Ultra. Prices start at $57,400. Prices exclude $1,295 destination charge and import tariffs.

How’s it selling?

The XC90 is one of Volvo’s core vehicles. It sold 39,492 in 2024 and 39,920 in 2023. The updated 2025 went on sale in December. Volvo has sold 16.744 XC90s so far in 2025. U.S. tariffs may affect XC90 prices and availability.

What I liked most the first time I drove the XC90

Typical Volvo style and safety. Quiet ride, smooth power.

What does it compete with?

It competes with the Acura MDX hybrid, Cadillac Vistiq EV, Hyundai Ioniq 9, Kia EV9, Lexus TX 550h+ plug-in hybrid and Tesla X EV.

Why I want it

Room, comfort and sustainability. Volvo says owners worldwide average 48% of their miles driven on electric power. The 2.0L turbocharged engine and electric motor deliver 455 horsepower and 523 pound-feet of torque. The interior is roomy, attractive and safe ― Volvo hallmarks. The interior is quiet at highway speeds and the air suspension delivers a smooth ride and commendable handling for a big heavy vehicle.

What needs work

There’s no change to the updated XC90’s range on electric power. The XC90’s price puts it in competition with new EVs like the Cadillac Vistiq and Hyundai Ioniq 9 — improved range wouldn’t hurt.

The lack of wireless connectivity for Apple CarPlay and Android Auto goes in the same file: It wasn’t a big deal in 2015 but constitutes a significant competitive failing today.

By Ren Brabenec | June 21, 2025

Michigan’s natural beauty is no mystery to anyone who’s put their feet in our sand, their hands on our lake stones, or turned their face up toward the summer sunshine that brings it all together. Across the state, several nonprofits operate in quiet reverence of the landscapes we hold dear, advocating tirelessly for Michigan’s water, earth, and air.

We checked in with two, Conservation Resource Alliance (CRA) and the Northern Michigan Environmental Action Council (NMEAC), to hear about their latest projects, wins, and concerns.

Funding Pauses Hamper Important Environmental Projects

Suzie Knoll, executive director of CRA, says her organization has been deeply affected by changes at the federal level.

“We recently finalized a three-year strategic plan in early 2025, less than a month before the U.S. Office of Management and Budget issued the federal funding freeze memo, immediately casting uncertainty over previously-awarded funds from CRA’s largest federal agency partners,” Knoll says.

The funding freeze is already affecting critical environmental projects. Many of CRA’s projects rely on support from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, USDA Forest Service, Natural Resources Conservation Service, and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.

“Millions of dollars in newly awarded grants to CRA—including one large grant that was earmarked for 31 road/stream crossing replacements and bridge projects—are currently on hold,” says Knoll.

Knoll gave two examples of stream crossing replacements in the Cedar River watershed (Leelanau County), funded through the Farm Bill’s Regional Conservation Partnership Program that have been put on hold. The supply ordering window for the projects was missed due to payment uncertainty, resulting in a delay of at least a year.

What Happens Next?

Knoll says continued delays stemming from White House funding freezes could result in increased erosion and sedimentation in critical streams, further degrading habitat for aquatic species.

Even more urgently, some sites involve aging dam infrastructure. Without timely intervention by the CRA and its partners, further deterioration could lead to dam failure.

And it’s not just funding freezes CRA is concerned about. Knoll referenced the current administration’s staffing of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) with pro-deregulation leadership, including EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin, who stated during his confirmation hearing that under his leadership, the EPA would not be required to regulate fossil fuel emissions.

Everything about Michigan’s natural resources is influenced by the human populations who live in and near those resources, and the federal policies governing how humans operate in their environments make all the difference in the world.

For example, Knoll explained that one of CRA’s greatest challenges is balancing rapid population and tourism growth with the need to protect and restore the natural landscapes that draw people to northern Michigan in the first place.

“Federal funding shortfalls will require us to put more time and resources into pursuing private funding sources and will undoubtedly take away from our work on the ground,” Knoll says.

Knoll used a map to show us which 2025-2027 projects are at risk due to funding pauses, revealing that 31 of the 60 projects listed, including dam removals, wetland restorations, and stream crossing repairs, are at risk because of paused federal funding.

Decisions from D.C. Could Have Lasting Effects

Mike Foley, co-chair of the Northern Michigan Environmental Action Council, says he’s most concerned about the Trump Administration’s efforts to clamp down on clean energy initiatives, especially considering Michigan’s strong leadership in this industry.

Foley says that what’s worse is that the current administration is fast-tracking all the wrong energy projects.

“The declaration of an energy emergency by the current administration has led to certain projects that NMEAC strongly opposes [e.g., the proposed Line 5 tunnel under the Straits of Mackinac] being fast-tracked in their permit review process,” says Foley. “We’re working with partner organizations on how best to respond to these accelerated threats. We continue to raise awareness with the public, educate citizens on the dangers inherent with the current Line 5 operations and the proposed tunnel, and contact the governor, the head of the DNR, and our congressional delegations to voice our opposition to this project.”

Foley emphasized that the Line 5 project has implications for the climate, critical ecosystems around the Straits of Mackinac, and the untold thousands of habitats located along the pipeline’s 645-mile-long transit.

“Every bit of effort pushing for the pipeline from the feds to local pipeline supporters is effort that could be put towards clean energy,” Foley adds.

Foley also shared concerns about the pollution of Michigan waterways from the illegal discharge of wastewater, concerns about deregulation, the excessive removal of mature trees and tree canopies in northern Michigan cities, development sprawl with associated increases in impervious surfaces leading to increased stormwater runoff, and an increase in chlorides in local waters from the use of road salt in winter.

Drawing Strength from Victories

It’s never all bad news when a majority of the public supports healthy ecosystems, because even in the face of opposition, concerned residents can still come together and make changes for the better.

On his highlight reel, Foley pointed to several land conservation victories his organization has been involved in.

“We’ve been very happy to support and see some significant land protection by the Grand Traverse Regional Land Conservancy, Leelanau Conservancy, and the Grand Traverse Band of Ottawa and Chippewa Indians,” he says.

Foley also emphasized his hope that the point-of-transfer septic regulations his organization has advocated for—recently approved by the Grand Traverse County Commissioners—will become a first step toward a more comprehensive, uniform septic code for the northern Lower Peninsula, and perhaps for the entire state.

Knoll says she takes hope in the projects her organization was able to secure funding for and begin implementing before the federal funding freeze hit.

“For decades, clogged and undersized culverts degraded the Crystal River’s health, disrupting natural stream flow and fragmenting habitat for fish and wildlife,” she says. “The Crystal River Initiative was launched to address four critical road-stream crossings at the heart of Sleeping Bear Dunes National Lakeshore—one of our region’s most treasured landscapes.”

The initiative will reconnect the Crystal River to Lake Michigan, opening nearly five miles of stream below the watershed’s lowermost sea lamprey barrier.

“Our organization has taken a supporting role, as this work is being led by the Grand Traverse Band of Ottawa and Chippewa Indians in partnership with CRA, the Leelanau County Road Commission, and the National Park Service,” Knoll continues. “Together, we’re restoring natural river function, improving public safety, and helping to deepen cultural and spiritual connections to the land and water.”

Contact. Educate. Volunteer. Donate.

According to Foley and Knoll, the public remains the decision-makers in what happens to Michigan’s natural lands, at least for now. That’s why the theme is always “contact, educate, volunteer, donate.”

“Contact local, state, and federal government representatives about environmental issues that matter to you, your family, friends, and neighbors,” Foley says. “Educate yourself with trusted, verifiable sources on the impact of rising CO2 levels in the atmosphere and the importance of reducing energy consumption and accelerating our transition to a low-carbon energy future. Volunteer and donate if you are able.”

Knoll mirrors Foley’s sentiment. “We urge our supporters to reach out to their congressional representatives, share what they know of CRA’s impactful work in your region, and advocate for federal agencies to expedite their review of conservation programs,” she says.

“Swift action is needed to allow restoration projects to move forward, supporting the rural communities that depend on them.”",https://eyesonly.nyc3.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/images/IMG_9849.jpg,N,,2025-06-21 19:05:58.422387

Some people are saying that’s because the EVs aren’t flying off the shelves anymore.

But the truth is a bit more nuanced than that.

This is the third time in the space of a month that Tesla made headlines for a situation like this.

A life weeks ago, somebody noticed a gaggle of Cybertrucks abandoned in a parking lot near Detroit.

Then, an old story about a similar situation in Missouri went viral again.

Probably because the Google algorithm did its job.

But jokes aside, the same thing happened again, and once again it happened in Michigan.

A few days ago, 100 Tesla Cybertrucks were spotted in a parking lot in Farmington Hills, a northwestern suburb of Detroit.

People are saying that’s because Teslas aren’t selling anymore, but that’s not entirely accurate.

It is true that Tesla is no longer dominating the electric vehicle market like it used to, having lost market share to automakers from China like BYD and Xiaomi.

But it’s also true that the best-selling EVs in the US are still the Tesla Model Y and Tesla Model 3.

As for the Cybertruck, the very thing that made it successful might be the reason why it’s not doing so well now: its styling.

The Tesla CEO’s polarizing political involvement certainly hasn’t helped, but the reality is that Cybertrucks are probably simply too out there to be considered a ‘normal’ vehicle.

The Environmental Protection Agency has proposed new Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) targets for 2026 and 2027, to expand U.S. biofuel production and lessen dependence on foreign energy. If finalized, these would be the highest volume requirements in the program’s history. The proposal prioritizes U.S.-grown biofuels and limits the value of renewable fuel credits (RINs) for imports. The plan also includes eliminating electricity as a qualifying renewable fuel under the RFS and establishing a two-tiered system that gives greater value to biofuels produced in the U.S.

“We are creating a new system that benefits American farmers while mitigating the impact on gas prices and ensuring the continued existence of liquid fuels,” said EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin. “We can no longer afford to continue with the same system where Americans pay for foreign competitors.”

The EPA estimates the Set 2 rule could reduce the need for 150,000 barrels of foreign oil daily and encourage more investment in American biofuel infrastructure.

They had even fewer choices for energy — their best options were burning things like wood or coal.

They’d barely believe their eyes if they saw Beaver County today: From the world’s most advanced geothermal project using fracking technology to tap the Earth’s heat, to massive batteries that strengthen the grid, to solar and wind farms that turn abundant elements into electrons, new energy projects are meeting surging power demand and creating local economic development.

Beaver County is evidence that innovation generates income for communities that could have become ghost towns, but are now thriving with strong schools and public services. Zoom out statewide and you’ll see this dynamic generating jobs and millions in investment.

Just a few weeks ago, Utah beat several states to secure a next-generation small modular nuclear test reactor in Emery County. “To be honest, it was a tight race,” said Governor Spencer Cox. But “Utah is the place where we get to do innovation.”

Unfortunately, our economic engine could grind to a halt if the “One Big Beautiful Bill” working its way through Congress isn’t changed.

The bill, which passed the U.S. House of Representatives by only one vote and is now being debated in the U.S. Senate, would repeal nearly every federal policy like tax credits, grants and loans for the cutting-edge technologies that have sparked our Made-In-America energy boom.

At least one of our federal officials is standing up for Utah. When Sen. John Curtis toured Fluence’s Tooele County battery manufacturing facility in late May, he said proposed energy policy repeals in Congress’ bill is “a problem for the future, and I’ll say not just to clean energy, but for all energy.” His proposed solution is phasing out the clean energy tax credits instead of abruptly ending them — a good compromise so our utilities and the investors building projects here can plan accordingly. Sen. Curtis’ pragmatic stance has drawn attacks from the Washington, D.C.-based political organization Club for Growth, which says his support for our true all-of-the-above energy strategy is a “liberal mistake.” But that out-of-state organization’s attack isn’t the reality for those of us who live here.

These federal policies have attracted more than $13 billion in total announced clean energy and transportation investments across 74 new projects since late 2022, creating thousands of new announced jobs putting Utahns to work building high-tech products that produce homegrown energy. Energy Innovation, the non-partisan research firm where I work, analyzed the economic damage the “One Big Beautiful Bill” could do to our state. Utah would lose 9,400 jobs in 2030 and another 2,900 jobs in 2035, while cumulative statewide GDP would fall $10 billion in a decade. Utahns’ energy bills would increase $230 per household in 2030 and $510 in 2035 — adding up to $2.8 billion in higher statewide energy bills cumulatively through 2034.

These economic losses stem from fossil fuels’ inherently volatile prices, limiting the ability to build all forms of energy cuts off options to cut our energy bills and grow our economy. Natural gas prices could nearly double this year, and the statewide cost of coal-fired power skyrocketed 70% from 2021-2024. Eventually, utilities pass that cost onto families and businesses. Meanwhile wind, solar and geothermal have zero fuel costs once built.

Utahns already dodged one bullet on this front — Rocky Mountain Power’s 2024 request to increase residential power rates 30.5% was cut to about 4% in April by the Utah Public Service Commission, but the utility admitted fossil fuels were the culprit. “These costs are specifically for fuel, for power plants, that’s primarily coal and natural gas,” said a Rocky Mountain Power spokesperson.

Holding back our ability to build diverse energy resources also threatens Utah’s “Operation Gigawatt” goal of doubling power production over the next decade to meet rising demand. Solar power composed 93% of all the energy capacity added statewide since 2015, and clean energy is the fastest available resource we can build to can meet soaring power demand. But if the federal bill passes as currently written, Utah would lose out on 4.3 gigawatts of electricity generation capacity by 2030 and 4.6 gigawatts by 2035.

Building new energy projects takes millions in private investment and years of planning. Repealing federal energy policies would pull the rug out from proposed energy projects and manufacturing facilities across our state, and we may never recover.

There’s so much at stake for Utahns in the “One Big Beautiful Bill,” and energy is no exception. Inflation is rising, and we simply can’t afford being endlessly stuck on the fossil fuel roller coaster.

As Congress deliberates the bill, we deserve an energy future that empowers us to grow. Any other outcome means Utah loses.

But with Ireland now generating a lot more renewable energy nowadays, coal burning is no longer such an urgent need.
Energy think tank Ember data states Ireland generated 37% (11.4 TWh) of its electricity from wind in 2024.
“Ireland has quietly rewritten its energy story, replacing toxic coal with homegrown renewable power,” said Alexandru Mustață, campaigner on coal and gas at Europe’s Beyond Fossil Fuels.
“We also can’t ignore that the government is targeting the installation of at least 2 GW of gas power plants with no strategy to reduce Ireland’s dangerous gas dependency,” he added.","Ireland today (June 20) became the 15th coal-free country in Europe, having ended coal power generation at its 915 MW Moneypoint coal plant in County Clare. Initially commissioned in the mid-1980s by ESB, Moneypoint was intended to help Ireland offset the impact of the oil crises in the 1970s by providing a dependable source of energy.

But with Ireland now generating a lot more renewable energy nowadays, coal burning is no longer such an urgent need. Energy think tank Ember data states Ireland generated 37% (11.4 TWh) of its electricity from wind in 2024. Solar is not near wind levels of generation, (0.97 TWh in 2024) but it has been continuously breaking generation records in recent months and local stakeholders are confident this positive trend will continue.

Following the closure, the Moneypoint plant will continue to serve a limited backup role, burning heavy fuel oil under emergency instruction from Ireland’s transmission system operator EirGrid until 2029.

This strategy is in line with previous plans made by EirGrid and ESB to exit coal-fired generation by the end of 2025, which stipulated that Moneypoint would no longer be active in the wholesale electricity market.

“Ireland has quietly rewritten its energy story, replacing toxic coal with homegrown renewable power,” said Alexandru Mustață, campaigner on coal and gas at Europe’s Beyond Fossil Fuels.

“But this isn’t ‘job done’. The government’s priority now must be building a power system for a renewable future; one with the storage, flexibility, and grid infrastructure needed to run fully on clean, domestic renewable electricity,” Mustață warned.

Jerry Mac Evilly, Campaigns Director at Friends of the Earth Ireland, appealed to the government to ensure oil backup at Moneypoint is kept to an absolute minimum and ultimately decommissioned. He also appealed for the government to prevent further development of data centers, which he said are increasing Ireland’s reliance on fossil gas.

By using drilling technology advanced by the oil and gas industry, Fervo is drilling deeper, drilling sideways and drilling in new places to unlock new reserves of heat energy.
""There's no reason why geothermal energy wells should be using older, more outdated rigs,"" Jewett said.
Traditional geothermal energy relies on finding steam-bearing resources and drilling into them vertically to capture the steam heat.
That made geothermal power geographically limited to those places with just the right combination of factors.","The U.S. oil and gas industry sparked an energy revolution a few decades ago by thinking in a different direction—literally. Horizontal drilling, combined with hydraulic fracturing, unlocked new petroleum reserves and quickly propelled the U.S. to global leadership in oil and gas.

Fervo Energy, a company headquartered in oil capital Houston, is aiming for a similar revolution in geothermal energy by borrowing a page from the oil industry's playbook.

""Drilling is drilling,"" Fervo's Vice President of Strategy Sarah Jewett told Newsweek. ""That is kind of the 'aha' moment that our founders really found when they started this business.""

By using drilling technology advanced by the oil and gas industry, Fervo is drilling deeper, drilling sideways and drilling in new places to unlock new reserves of heat energy.

""There's no reason why geothermal energy wells should be using older, more outdated rigs,"" Jewett said.

Traditional geothermal energy relies on finding steam-bearing resources and drilling into them vertically to capture the steam heat. It requires not only hot rock but also enough permeability in the rock to allow water and heat to come together. That made geothermal power geographically limited to those places with just the right combination of factors.

Fervo is developing an enhanced geothermal system (EGS) that creates some of those conditions by making rock permeable and injecting liquid where hot rock is available.

Instead of just drilling vertical wells, the company uses horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing techniques to harvest naturally occurring heat.

""We are just using the heat from rock under the earth rather than steam directly to create electricity,"" Jewett explained.

The U.S. Department of Energy calls EGS ""the next frontier"" for renewable energy. Because the technology can tap a much wider range of geothermal resources, the DOE estimates that EGS has the potential to power more than 65 million American homes and businesses.

""Really, hot rock is everywhere,"" Jewett said. ""It's just a question of how deep that rock exists and how economic is it to actually get to [that] depth.""

Rock that reaches 400 to 500 degrees Fahrenheit is, generally speaking, closer to the surface in the western U.S. than in the eastern states. Fervo is focusing efforts in southwestern Utah, site of the company's Cape Station development where the company is building three power plants.

Jewett said Fervo's first power plant is scheduled to come online next summer with the first phase delivering 100 megawatts of clean power. An additional 400 megawatts of capacity is scheduled at the same site by 2028, and power purchasers include Shell Energy and Southern California Edison.

Last week the company announced that a new round of funding for the Cape Station development had secured $206 million from investors including Breakthrough Energy Catalyst, founded by Bill Gates.

In another announcement last week, Fervo shared results from one of its exploration wells that pushed the boundaries of geothermal technology. The company's deepest well yet reached more than 15,750 feet, nearly 3 miles beneath the surface. Rock temperature at that depth is greater than 500 degrees, Jewett said, and the company is testing what happens to drill bits, casings and electronics at very high heat.

""One of our paths to innovation we call 'boring is beautiful,'"" she said. As wells reach greater depth and higher heat, companies providing parts and services test the performance of drilling equipment under increasingly harsh conditions. ""That has been a really virtuous cycle of innovation between us and our partners.""

In another parallel with the oil and gas industry, Fervo had the petroleum consulting company DeGolyer & MacNaughton conduct an independent energy reserve estimate for the Cape Station project. Such reserve estimates are common when oil companies develop a new resource, but the practice is new for the geothermal industry, Jewett said.

DeGolyer and MacNaughton applied similar principles from oil analyses to evaluate the thermal energy potential at the site and concluded that Fervo's site could yield 5 gigawatts of power. A gigawatt is enough to power a city of 750,000 homes.

With those positive developments on the technical and financial fronts, Fervo is clearly on a hot streak. But like the rest of the clean energy sector, the company is also closely watching policy developments in Washington.

Tax credits from the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act were a boon for new clean energy technology developers, not only because of the size of the credits but because the 10-year lifespan of the credits provided long-term stability to attract private investors.

The ""one big beautiful"" bill approved by the Republican-controlled House of Representatives late last month would end most of those clean energy credits and debate is underway on a Senate version.

""We're fighting pretty hard to preserve tax credits because for these very early projects, it's incredibly useful to have that that support,"" Jewett said. Fervo's first phase of development would not be affected by the changes, she said, because construction is already underway, but future projects could become more challenging.

Regardless of policy changes, however, she said she is confident that EGS power will find a market as a steady source of electricity to meet surging demand.

""Geothermal energy projects are capable of providing that 'always on' power,"" she said. ""And I think that's why it's become so attractive.""",https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2668095/fervo-energy-geothermal-drill-rig.jpg,N,,2025-06-21 11:08:07.682500

As the world pivots from fossil fuels to sustainable alternatives, companies leading the clean energy revolution are not just solving environmental issues; they’re creating multi-billion-dollar opportunities for investors.

Whether you’re building a retirement portfolio or aiming for financial independence, the renewable energy sector holds promise. As governments, corporations, and consumers commit to a greener future, savvy investors are seeking out long-term renewable energy stocks that offer stability, innovation, and growth. This article highlights eight standout stocks positioned to thrive in the clean energy boom and potentially make you a millionaire.

Why Renewable Energy Stocks Are Booming?

The global transition toward clean energy isn’t a trend; it’s a structural shift. Driven by climate change concerns, rising oil volatility, and supportive policy, renewable energy is now a core pillar of national and corporate strategies alike. The Inflation Reduction Act in the U.S. and similar legislation worldwide have unlocked billions in tax credits and incentives for renewable projects.

These factors have fueled a surge in green investments. But while the sector is hot, not all green energy stocks are created equal. Some companies are speculative, while others are proven leaders with scalable technology, steady cash flows, and growing global footprints. Knowing where to place your bet matters.

8 Best Renewable Energy Stocks to Buy in 2025

As we look toward 2025, several companies stand out for their strong performance, innovation, and potential to deliver lasting gains. Below are eight of the best renewable energy stocks that could build serious wealth over the next decade.

How to Choose the Right Renewable Energy Stocks?

With so many options, how do you pick the winners? Here are a few guiding principles:

1. Look for Consistent Revenue Growth

Companies like NEE and BEP have proven, reliable business models with years of positive earnings.

2. Pay Attention to Policy Tailwinds

U.S. and global subsidies are tilting the playing field. Firms like First Solar are positioned to benefit from American industrial policy.

3. Understand the Tech Curve

Innovators like Enphase and Tesla are pushing the envelope in energy management, storage, and grid tech.

4. Balance Risk and Reward

Mix conservative dividend plays (Clearway) with aggressive growth stocks (Plug Power) to balance your portfolio.

Business Implications: Why Investors Are Paying Attention

The renewable energy sector isn’t just an ethical play; it’s a massive capital rotation story. Institutional investors, pension funds, and sovereign wealth funds are pouring money into long-term renewable energy stocks because they see decades of growth ahead.

Key trends to watch:

Corporate ESG mandates are pressuring companies to decarbonize, boosting demand for clean power.

Grid modernization and energy storage will create new profit centers.

M&A activity may reward early investors in smaller firms acquired by industry giants.

Risks to Consider Before Investing

Every opportunity carries risk. Renewable stocks, particularly smaller or newer firms, can be volatile. Regulatory changes, raw material shortages, and interest rate hikes can affect capital-intensive projects. Also, many clean tech firms are not yet profitable, requiring patience and long-term conviction.

Tip: Diversify across technologies—solar, wind, storage, hydrogen, and business models (manufacturers, utilities, tech platforms) to reduce single-point risk.

House and Senate Republicans are working on a massive tax and spending cuts bill, but they disagree on key provisions. Differences include the size of the child tax credit, state and local tax deductions, and clean energy tax credits. The House and Senate also differ on deductions for tips, overtime, and interest paid on auto loans.

House and Senate Republicans are taking slightly different approaches when it comes to the tax cuts that lawmakers are looking to include in their massive tax and spending cuts bill.

Republicans in the two chambers don't agree on the size of a deduction for state and local taxes. And they are at odds on such things as allowing people to use their health savings accounts to help pay for their gym membership, or whether electric vehicle and hybrid owners should have to pay an annual fee.

The House passed its version shortly before Memorial Day. Now the Senate is looking to pass its version.

While the two bills are similar on the major tax provisions, how they work out their differences in the coming weeks will determine how quickly they can get a final product over the finish line. President Donald Trump is pushing to have the legislation on his desk by July 4th.

Here's a look at some of the key differences between the two bills:

Live Events

Tax break for families

The child tax credit currently stands at $2,000 per child.

The House bill temporarily boosts the child tax credit to $2,500 for the 2025 through 2028 tax years, roughly the length of President Donald Trump's second term. It also indexes the credit amount for inflation beginning in 2027.

The Senate bill provides a smaller, initial bump-up to $2,200, but the bump is permanent, with the credit amount indexed for inflation beginning next year.

Trump campaign promises

Trump promised on the campaign trail that he would seek to end income taxes on tips, overtime and Social Security benefits. Also, he would give car buyers a new tax break by allowing them to deduct the interest paid on auto loans.

The House and Senate bills incorporate those promises with temporary deductions lasting from the 2025 through 2028 tax years, but with some differences.

The House bill creates a deduction on tips for those working in jobs that have customarily received tips. The House also provides for a deduction for overtime that's equal to the amount of OT a worker has earned.

The Senate bill comes with more restrictions. The deduction for tips is limited to $25,000 per taxpayer and the deduction for overtime is limited to $12,500 per taxpayer.

The House and Senate bills both provide a deduction of up to $10,000 for interest paid on loans for vehicles made in the United States.

And on Social Security, the bills don't directly touch the program. Instead, they grant a larger tax deduction for Americans age 65 and older. The House sets the deduction at $4,000. The Senate sets it at $6,000.

Both chambers include income limits over which the new deductions begin to phase out.

More SALT

The caps on state and local tax deductions, known in Washington as the SALT cap, now stand at $10,000.

The House bill, in a bid to win over Republicans from New York, California and New Jersey, lifts the cap to $40,000 per household with incomes of less than $500,000. The credit phases down for households earning more than $500,000.

The Senate bill keeps the cap at $10,000. That's a non-starter in the House, but Republicans in the two chambers will look to negotiate a final number over the coming weeks that both sides can accept.

Medicaid providers

The House bill prohibits states from establishing new provider taxes or increasing existing taxes. These are taxes that Medicaid providers, such as hospitals, pay to help states finance their share of Medicaid costs. In turn, the taxes allow states to receive increased federal matching funds while generally holding providers harmless through higher reimbursements that offset the taxes paid.

Such taxes now are effectively capped at 6%. The Senate looks to gradually lower that threshold for states that have expanded their Medicaid populations under the Affordable Care Act, or ""Obamacare,"" until it reaches 3.5% in 2031, with exceptions for nursing homes and intermediate care facilities.

Industry groups have warned that limiting the ability of states to tax providers may lead to some states making significant cuts to their Medicaid programs as they make up for the lost revenue in other ways. The Medicaid provision could be a flashpoint in the coming House and Senate negotiations. Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., was highly critical of the proposed Senate changes.

""This needs a lot of work. It's really concerning and I'm really surprised by it,"" he said. ""Rural hospitals are going to be in bad shape.""

Tax breaks for business

The House bill would allow companies for five years to fully deduct equipment purchases and domestic research and development expenses. The Senate bill includes no sunset, making the tax breaks permanent, which was a key priority of powerful trade groups such as the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.

Clean energy tax credits

Republicans in both chambers are looking to scale back the clean energy tax credits enacted through then-President Joe Biden's climate law. It aimed to boost the nation's transition away from planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions toward renewable energy such as wind and solar power.

Under the Senate bill, the tax credits for clean energy and home energy efficiency would still be phased out, but less quickly than under the House bill. Still, advocacy groups fear that the final measure will threaten hundreds of thousands of jobs and drive up household energy costs.

Odds and ends

The House bill would allow millions of Americans to use their health savings accounts to pay for gym memberships, with a cap of $500 for single taxpayers and $1,000 for joint filers. The Senate bill doesn't include such a provision.

The House reinstates a charitable deduction for non-itemizers of $150 per taxpayer. The Senate bill increases that deduction for donations to $1,000 per taxpayer.

Republicans in the House bill included a new annual fee of $250 for EV owners and $100 for hybrid owners that would be collected by state motor vehicle departments. The Senate bill excludes the proposed fees.

Acting sooner rather than later is encouraged, as the GOP's proposed ""One Big Beautiful Bill Act"" is seeking to slash tax provisions, including the tax incentives that save you money on improving your home through clean energy.

How it's helping

The IRA offers tax credits and discounts for a slew of energy-efficient improvements from solar panels to electric vehicles.

One particularly high rebate includes $840 for induction ovens and stoves. This figure can even be higher when accounting for the substantial amount of savings that come from slashing your gas bill.

Induction ovens are also known to be better for your health, while they also make cooking seamless by heating up food faster. The benefits are endless; however, it's understandable that some may not be able to completely revitalize their kitchen, especially amid the growing cost of living in the United States. Fittingly, plug-in induction burners are excellent options that start as low as $50 and are also eligible for discounts and rebates.

To know exactly how much you are eligible for, handy tools like this free option from Rewiring America will give you a close estimate.

What everyone's saying

Americans have been ecstatic to benefit from the IRA savings and gain kitchen tools that make their lives easier.

Lauren, from Oregon, told The Cool Down, ""A portable induction cooktop is a great way to try out induction for a low cost and get used to the technology while improving indoor air quality.""

The ruling notes the Advanced Clean Cars I EV requirements in question have been adopted at least in part by 17 states and the District of Columbia, and are in effect through vehicle model year 2025, which for many automakers is already over, while the GHG emissions regulations are indefinite.

With the new ruling remanding the case back to district court, the GHG regulations are set to face a renewed challenge from fuel producers, who have argued the rules will reduce demand for their products.

Advanced Clean Cars II, which was supposed to take effect for model year 2026, was recently overturned after President Donald Trump signed a resolution passed by Congress. Lawmakers used the Congressional Review Act to overturn the Biden administration’s Environmental Protection Agency waiver allowing the regulation to take place.

California Gov. Gavin Newsom has since ordered the state to continue enforcing the Advanced Clean Cars II standard, an act that could violate federal law.

Federal law generally pre-empts state law. But under the Clean Air Act, California was granted the ability to set its own emissions regulations, as the air quality regulations to combat the state’s notorious and toxic smog predated the EPA.

The ruling outlines the history of the EPA waivers, which have to be granted for each California standard that is more stringent than the federal standard. They are supposed to be granted only to meet “compelling and extraordinary conditions.”

“Beginning in 2005, California also attempted to use its unique preemption exception as one means to address global climate change,” wrote Justice Brett Kavanaugh in the official court opinion. “In 2008, under the George W. Bush administration, EPA denied California’s first such request.”

“EPA explained that the Clean Air Act permits California to enact standards to address local and regional pollution where the causal factors are tied to California,” continued Kavanaugh. “But EPA reasoned that the authority granted to California did not extend to efforts to combat global climate change.”

The regulations the fuel producers are challenging were first approved by the Obama administration’s EPA in 2013 and reversed under the first Trump administration in 2019. The rules were re-approved by the Biden administration in 2022, after which the producers filed their case in the District of Columbia.

The producers argued “the regulations did not target a local California air-quality problem — as they say is required by the Clean Air Act — but instead were designed to address global climate change.”

California defended the waiver and sought to intervene, focusing on the importance of selling fewer gasoline-powered vehicles, and selling more electric vehicles. After its motion to intervene was approved, allowing California to be added as a party to the lawsuit, the state’s argument changed course. California said the producers lacked standing because “surging consumer demand” for electric vehicles meant that reversing the regulations would not result in the production of more gasoline-powered vehicles.

The D.C. Circuit sided with California, holding the producers did not have standing, leading to the appeal to the Supreme Court, and now ruling that the producers do have standing to pursue their lawsuit.

Justices Sonia Sotomayor and Ketanji Brown Jackson wrote separate dissenting opinions.

Sotomayor argued the Supreme Court overreached by deciding on the issue of standing, and that the court should have only ruled on the factual error regarding the fact that some of the regulations extend beyond model year 2025, and thus create redresseable issues for producers.

Sotomayor also noted that it’s likely the Trump administration will withdraw the challenged rules.

Jackson’s dissent included many of the same arguments made by Sotomayor, but focused more on the reputational damage to the court from selectively granting standing to producers, while often failing to grant standing to citizens against the government.

“If the Court privileges the interests of one class of litigants over others, even unintentionally, it can damage Americans’ faith in an impartial Judiciary and undermine the long-term credibility of its judgments,” wrote Jackson. “Time will tell if today’s decision portends a broader shift in the Court’s view of Article III standing for all litigants.

“If it does not, and if the Court is not fastidious in maintaining consistency across its certiorari decisions and substantive rulings, its decisions will come to represent, like so many marble façades, another mere facsimile of justice,” concluded Jackson.

American Fuel & Petrochemical Manufacturers, a plaintiff in the case, celebrated the ruling as the opportunity to make their case against California’s regulations in court.

“Today the Supreme Court put to rest any question about whether fuel manufacturers have a right to challenge unlawful electric vehicle mandates,” said Chet Thompson, AFPM President and CEO, in a statement to The Center Square. “We do, and we look forward to finally having our day in court.”

“Congress did not give California special authority to regulate greenhouse gases, mandate electric vehicles or ban new gas car sales — all of which the state has attempted to do through its intentional misreading of statute,” continued Thompson.",https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/thecentersquare.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/a/c7/ac795dcc-7a0d-11ef-a492-fb1649f673b9/66f20abe45824.image.jpg,N,,2025-06-21 17:07:44.116214

However, the commonwealth – thanks to ill-advised policies pushed by Gov. Josh Shapiro – remains ill-equipped to handle this emerging market.

Recently, the governor announced a $20 billion investment by Amazon to develop data centers statewide. Though a laudable investment, the governor’s publicity stunt highlights a glaring issue: State policies make it extremely expensive to set up shop in Pennsylvania and tap into the state’s abundant energy resources.

And the governor’s proposals to address this issue will actually make things worse.

Shapiro’s policies to reduce the amount of reliable electricity are the most concerning.

Even without the new influx of data centers, electricity costs are rising in Pennsylvania. On June 1, utility companies increased rates statewide. These companies regularly adjust rates based on market conditions.

And those conditions aren’t great for ratepayers. In this year’s first quarter, wholesale prices in Pennsylvania were up 44%.

What are driving costs? It’s simple supply-and-demand economics. Supply continues to dwindle as regulations force reliable power plants to retire prematurely and force-feed more unreliable solar and wind energy into the state’s energy portfolio.

Meanwhile, demand – driven by AI – keeps escalating.

AI guzzles electricity. A ChatGPT query devours 10 times more electricity than a conventional Google query. To satiate AI’s growing power needs, conservative estimates suggest the United States needs at least 18 gigawatts of additional grid capacity by 2030 – roughly three times the annual consumption of New York City.

Tech companies have already begun to stake claims for increased energy capacity. Case in point: Microsoft’s recent reboot of Three Mile Island. Partnering with Constellation Energy, the tech giant will commandeer the once-shuttered nuclear power plant to power its growing AI capabilities with around-the-clock energy.

And while such deals are great for Big Tech, Pennsylvania households and small businesses remain stuck with ever-increasing electricity bills. Even before the recent rate hike, new polling reveals 78% of Pennsylvanians report increased energy bills over the past two years.

Meanwhile, misguided lawmakers push policies that only exacerbate the problem. For example, Gov. Shapiro’s Lightning Plan – which includes a carbon-tax scheme and mandates more unreliable “green” energy – will add about $157 billion in statewide electricity costs by 2035, according to a new report by Always On Energy and the Commonwealth Foundation. These added costs will double household electricity bills.

So long as these ill-advised policies continue to throttle capacity and generation, the grid will remain a bottleneck to future innovation in Pennsylvania.

To attract new data centers, lawmakers have also flirted with an age-old yet ineffectual solution: corporate welfare. Despite the political appeal, government favors (i.e., tax incentives and subsidies) to attract new businesses often fail.

Pennsylvania’s Independent Fiscal Office found that the commonwealth’s tax credits netted a lousy return on investment, about 25 cents on the dollar.

Others have proven useless: The Pennsylvania Economic Development for a Growing Economy (EDGE) tax credit, which Shapiro wants to expand. has had no takers since its inception in 2022 – not a single dollar.

The best medicine is regulatory reform. Lawmakers should revise electricity regulations to account for reliability and consider all infrastructure costs associated with electricity generation. Also, energy markets need a more predictable permitting process for energy extraction and power plant construction.

Shapiro alluded to fast-tracking permitting for new data centers. Competing with neighbors like West Virginia, which recently passed a bill allowing “microgrid” districts for data centers with standalone power plants, could be beneficial. But there again, the track record of industry-specific reforms is spotty.

Nearly a year ago, Pennsylvania passed the Streamlining Permits for Economic Expansion and Development (SPEED) program to create an expedited permit review and approval process associated with energy production. Today, SPEED remains under development. Shapiro’s call for expedited permitting for data centers appears to be yet another half-measure that won’t accomplish much.

Pennsylvania can’t afford to stop with just one industry. Regulatory reform must be comprehensive and universal, freeing up all economic sectors from onerous red tape.

Pennsylvania, with more than 160,000 individual regulations and restrictions throttling genuine economic development, is one of the most-regulated states. Research suggests a 36% cut in regulations would yield 1% growth in Pennsylvania’s GDP, according to a report coauthored by the Competitive Enterprise Institute and the Commonwealth Foundation.

Before Pennsylvania’s Wyoming Valley can become the next Silicon Valley, the commonwealth must rethink its strategy. Lawmakers must cut red tape, not blank checks to big corporations. Moreover, they must unleash affordable energy, not shackle it with climate-alarmist policies. Without genuine regulatory and energy reform, the commonwealth won’t be able to power the future and will be left in the dark.

June 16 – Tax and spending plans in President Trump’s ‘One Big Beautiful” bill passed by the House of Representatives on May 22 would hobble the nascent U.S. green hydrogen industry in the United States by removing crucial tax credits earlier than previously planned.

Introduced in the Biden administration’s 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, base 45V production tax credits (PTCs) of up to $3/kg are offered depending on emissions. The credits are available for ‘green’ hydrogen projects, which use electrolyzers powered by renewable energy, and ‘blue’ hydrogen projects using steam methane reformation coupled with carbon capture utilisation and storage (CCUS).

Trump’s tax bill would bring forward the deadline for projects to qualify for the 45V credits, requiring them to begin construction by January 1, 2026 compared with the previous deadline of January 1, 2033 set out by the Biden administration. A revised bill released by the Senate Finance Committee on June 16 retained the changes.

Final guidance on how to qualify for the credits was only published by the U.S. Treasury Department in January 2025 and is complex, requiring projects to source clean power from either nuclear plants “at risk of retirement” or new renewable energy projects, to minimize the impact on wider electricity supply.

Many projects “will not be able to meet the end of 2025 deadline” set out in the proposed tax bill, Lee Beck, Senior Vice President for global policy and commercial strategy at green fuel developer HIF Global, told Reuters Events.

Beck, said:

It takes four to six years to develop large infrastructure projects,

“Having just a few months to make the required project changes, commence construction, and reach financial close is unrealistic in infrastructure timeframes.”

In one example, HIF Global requires until the end of 2027 to begin construction of a green hydrogen plant in Matagorda County, Texas, Beck said. The project will require $7 billion of investment and the company has already spent more than $200 million developing the plant, which would produce 1.4 million tons/year of e-methanol using hydrogen and captured CO2 to supply the automotive, shipping and aviation sectors.

The shortened deadline for the 45V credits Beck, said:

would pull the rug out from under the whole industry,

Many investors would pivot to other regions. HIF Global has plans to develop projects around the world and “will allocate capital to the places that are most competitive,” Beck said.

Economic impact

Approved by a single vote majority in the House of Representatives, the tax bill is currently with the Senate and changes may yet be made. Many Republican states have benefited from the tax credits while some Republicans fear the bill will inflate the federal deficit.

Dozens of stakeholders including the American Petroleum Institute (API) and the FCHEA sent a joint letter to Senate majority leader John Thune and Chairman of the Senate Committee on Finance Mike Crapo on June 5, calling for the retention of the 45V credits for projects that start construction by December 31, 2029.

The early withdrawal of 45V tax credits would “send yet another destabilising signal to the market—stranding investment and halting project development,” FCHEA President and CEO Frank Wolak told Reuters Events.

Eliminating the credits early would impact American job creation and industrial competitiveness, Wolak said.

He, said:

Walking away from the 45V credit would cede our competitive edge to China and Europe, where governments are aggressively supporting their hydrogen industries,

Demand challenge

Current hydrogen production is mostly ‘grey’ hydrogen produced from gas using steam methane reformation processes.

The cost of green hydrogen is currently far higher than the cost of grey hydrogen and the 45V tax credits were introduced to help clean hydrogen developers move from pilot projects to larger commercial facilities and drive down costs. The Biden administration aimed to reduce the cost of clean hydrogen to $1/kg by 2031, compared with around $5/kg in 2022.

,EPA,2025-06-21 12:20:11+00:00,CNN,Supreme Court lets fuel companies sue over California's tough emission standards - CNN,John Fritze,,,,,https://www.cnn.com/2025/06/20/politics/california-emissions-standards-supreme-court,"The Supreme Court on Friday revived a lawsuit from fuel producers challenging California’s strict vehicle emission rules, allowing the companies to fight an on-again, off-again climate policy that President Donald Trump has previously opposed.
While the federal government generally sets vehicle emission standards, the Environmental Protection Agency has at times granted a waiver to California – because of its longstanding air-quality problems – to set tougher standards.
Although the fuel producers challenged the waiver itself, the Supreme Court specifically declined to review that question, denying an appeal in December that raised that issue.
Instead, the only issue before the justices was whether the companies and trade associations had standing to sue.
The conservative Supreme Court has repeatedly sided against the EPA and environmental groups in past cases.","The Supreme Court on Friday revived a lawsuit from fuel producers challenging California’s strict vehicle emission rules, allowing the companies to fight an on-again, off-again climate policy that President Donald Trump has previously opposed.

Justice Brett Kavanaugh wrote the opinion for a 7-2 majority. Liberal Justices Sonia Sotomayor and Ketanji Brown Jackson dissented.

“The government generally may not target a business or industry through stringent and allegedly unlawful regulation, and then evade the resulting lawsuits by claiming that the targets of its regulation should be locked out of court as unaffected bystanders,” Kavanaugh wrote.

While the federal government generally sets vehicle emission standards, the Environmental Protection Agency has at times granted a waiver to California – because of its longstanding air-quality problems – to set tougher standards. Given the state’s size, automakers have long hewed to its tighter emissions controls even for cars sold in other states.

That waiver was challenged by Diamond Alternative Energy, a subsidiary of Valero Energy Corporation, and several other companies and groups that advocate on behalf of fuel manufacturers.

Although the fuel producers challenged the waiver itself, the Supreme Court specifically declined to review that question, denying an appeal in December that raised that issue. Instead, the only issue before the justices was whether the companies and trade associations had standing to sue.

A federal appeals court in Washington, DC, concluded that market forces are driving the national push toward electric vehicles far more than California’s tough regulations. Given that, the court ruled that the fuel makers could not proceed with the case.

One of the factors a party must demonstrate to establish standing is redressability, which essentially means that the court’s order can actually fix the problem the plaintiffs have raised. California said that even if courts eliminate the waiver, it wouldn’t help the fuel producers because consumer demand was motivating people to buy electric vehicles on their own.

During oral arguments, both conservative and liberal justices seemed to be skeptical of that position, noting that the EPA had pointed to a reduced reliance on fossil fuels as part of the justification for the waiver.

Perhaps sensing a win in their case, the fuel producers advocated for a categorical rule that would have made it easier for companies challenging the federal government to sue over similar decisions in the future.

It’s not clear how much practical impact the court’s decision will have. Trump seems almost certain to withdraw the waiver, just as he did during his first administration. The waiver was later reinstated by President Joe Biden.

That is a point that Jackson zeroed in on in her dissent.

“President Trump rescinded this exact same waiver the last time he was in office,” Jackson wrote. “Because a withdrawal of the waiver would moot this case, an obvious question arises: Why would this court rush to opine on whether the fuel industry’s legal challenge” can proceed “when all involved – including petitioners themselves – believe that any such ‘case’ or ‘controversy’ will soon vanish?”

Jackson said she worried that allowing the fuel producers to sue now would make it easier for other groups to challenge the Clean Air Act in the future.

California Attorney General Rob Bonta, a Democrat, said he was disappointed in the decision but will continue fighting the case.

“Congress intended for California to be able to regulate emissions from new vehicles sold in our state, and we remain firmly committed to advancing and implementing strong standards that safeguard public health and reduce climate pollution,” he said.

The conservative Supreme Court has repeatedly sided against the EPA and environmental groups in past cases. Last year, the court upended a Biden administration effort to reduce smog and air pollution wafting across state lines. In 2023, the justices cut back on the EPA’s ability to regulate wetlands under the Clean Water Act.

Rather than hurting the business of crucial American companies like Tandem PV, Republicans should champion clean energy because it aligns with core conservative principles.
Let’s keep our clean energy tax credits—for America’s families, businesses, and future.","Last month, the Republican-led House of Representatives passed the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, or OBBBA, a comprehensive budget reconciliation bill that aims to lengthen major provisions of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act passed during President Donald Trump’s first presidency, currently set to expire by the end of this year. Earlier this week, the Republican-led Senate Finance Committee introduced its version of the bill. Among several provisions intending to reduce the federal government’s deficit, the bill would majorly scale back clean energy tax credits instituted by the Inflation Reduction Act, or IRA, signed into law by President Joe Biden in 2022.

In doing so, the OBBBA would terminate the IRA’s Domestic Content Bonus Credit, which provides an additional 10% refund for clean energy projects that use American-made technology. Over the last three years, this IRA tax credit has boosted American manufacturing, created thousands of jobs here in the United States, and strengthened our domestic energy supply chain.

As our Senators from both sides of the aisle consider the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, those who believe in American economic growth and individual liberty should champion reversing course from the bill introduced by the Senate Finance Committee and keeping the IRA’s clean energy tax credits. The Domestic Content Bonus Credit in particular advances Republican values while enhancing America’s standing in the international energy market. This America-first, market-based policy generates American economic competition and innovation, while giving middle-class homeowners greater choice over their energy systems.

Rather than hurting the business of crucial American companies like Tandem PV, Republicans should champion clean energy because it aligns with core conservative principles.

Most new energy contributing to the American electricity grid is clean—including solar and wind—because of how cheap, fast, and naturally abundant these sources are. Indeed, in 2024 alone, 95% of new capacity to the American electricity grid came from clean energy. Because of this reality, the OBBBA’s impacts on federal clean energy incentives would reduce overall energy additions to the American electricity grid by about half by 2035, undermining American energy growth.

Meanwhile, China continues to maintain a near monopoly over solar energy technology, possessing an over 80% share of the international marketplace and currently on a growth trajectory. In 2023 alone, China installed more solar panels than America has over the course of its history and saw its solar panel exports increase by 38%. How did China come to lead the global solar energy technology market? In part, through government subsidies, including cheaper land for solar panel factories and low-interest loans to solar panel companies to expand these critical, nascent industries and spur their success. It is clear from a comparative perspective that the Domestic Content Bonus Credit is essential to strengthening American global energy leadership: In a market that China dominates, this tax credit helps American solar energy technology manufacturers compete.

I spoke to Scott Wharton, CEO of Tandem PV, an American solar energy technology company focusing on groundbreaking tandem perovskite solar panels, about 30% more efficient and powerful than the typical solar panel. With a perovskite layer 200 times thinner than silicon, the production of tandem perovskite solar panels requires only 10% of the energy needed to make conventional panels—a true testimony to American ingenuity. While in 2022 about 88% of U.S. solar panel shipments industry-wide were imports, primarily from Asia, Tandem PV announced plans in 2025 to construct a commercial-scale tandem perovskite solar panel manufacturing facility in the United States. Scott’s plans will increase American energy independence, growth, and innovation, enabling us to harness the abundant power of the Sun to power our future prosperity.

Scott said that Congress’s intention to scrap the Inflation Reduction Act clean energy tax credits would hurt his business, as American-made tandem perovskite solar energy technology would become less financially attractive to investors looking to support new capacity to the electrical grid. Given that the U.S. has developed the most advanced tandem perovskite technology globally, the current version of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act would adversely impact innovation, jobs, and growth in an emerging American industry. Moreover, Scott emphasized that the bill would undermine individual homeowners’ choice and liberty over their energy systems, as it would reduce their ability to own their energy production and increase their reliance on the greater energy grid.

It’s easy to get caught up in a game of partisan politics that puts emotional loyalty to party over rational best of interest of our country. When we really look underneath the surface, it’s clear that saving the Inflation Reduction Act clean energy tax credits, including the Domestic Content Bonus Credit, would advance Republicans’ own goals: long-term American economic and energy growth and international competitiveness through market-based solutions that promote innovation, create American jobs, and increase individual liberty.

The United States continued to produce more energy than it consumed in 2024. This surplus energy production helped energy exports grow to a record high 30.9 quadrillion British thermal units (quads) in 2024, up 4% from 2023. Energy imports stayed flat at 21.7 quads in 2024, meaning the United States exported 9.3 quads more energy than it imported, the highest net exports in our records, which date back to 1949.

Energy consumption in the United States totaled 94.2 quads in 2024, remaining below the peak of 99.0 quads set in 2007. Petroleum remained the largest source of primary energy consumption in the United States in 2024, totaling 35.3 quads, about the same as in the three previous years. Natural gas consumption reached an all-time high in 2024 at 34.2 quads, driven by growth in natural gas used for electricity generation.

Renewable energy consumption increased by 5% to hit a new record of 8.6 quads in 2024, largely due to growth in biofuels, wind, and solar. Nuclear energy consumption remained flat at 8.2 quads. Coal consumption fell to 7.9 quads, the least in our records dating back to 1949.

Primary energy production in the United States increased to a record 103.3 quads in 2024, the third consecutive year that production has surpassed a previous record. Natural gas, crude oil, natural gas plant liquids, wind, biofuels, and solar all reached or tied record production in 2024.

U.S. exports of petroleum products, crude oil, and natural gas each reached records in 2024. Petroleum product exports totaled 11.5 quads and accounted for 37% of total U.S. exports across all energy sources. Crude oil exports totaled 8.6 quads, making up 28% of the total. Natural gas exports grew to 7.8 quads, driven by continued growth in liquefied natural gas exports. Coal exports totaled 2.6 quads and have increased every year since 2020. Other energy sources such as biomass, electricity, and coal coke combined accounted for 1% of exports.

Crude oil has been the largest source of U.S. energy imports every year on record since 1973, accounting for 67% of energy imports in 2024. Crude oil is often imported and then refined into other petroleum products such as motor gasoline, distillate fuel oil, or jet fuel and then exported as petroleum products.

The study, led by founder Vrushabhraj Tanawade, introduces a bio-integrated insulation method using thermophilic and mesophilic microbial consortia to regulate heat inside battery modules. The results are striking: up to a 22% reduction in internal temperature and a 30% improvement in carbon lifecycle efficiency.

“This innovation is about biology meeting infrastructure,” says Tanawade. “We’ve discovered how nature’s mechanisms can dramatically extend the life of our clean energy systems.”

Unlike conventional synthetic cooling solutions, MountBay’s microbial approach is circular, biodegradable, and scalable—opening up new frontiers for climate resilience and fire-risk reduction in hot environments.

The research aligns perfectly with MountBay’s mission to power the AI economy through clean, sustainable, and advanced infrastructure. It also positions the company as a frontrunner in biological material integration across the energy sector.

Additionally, MountBay has released a preliminary transformative feasibility report for a Lunar Solar Belt—a continuous solar array on the Moon that can beam uninterrupted, clean energy back to Earth.

The report outlines how in-situ resource utilization (ISRU), autonomous lunar robotics, and microwave power transmission could enable the construction of a moon-based solar plant by the 2030s. With an energy return on investment (EROI) of 8:1, the system offers a scalable, emission-free solution to humanity’s growing power demands.

“This is not just an energy project—it’s a civilization-scale investment in global stability,” said Tanawade. “We believe the Moon should be a cooperative utility, not a geopolitical race.”

MountBay is also proposing a new diplomatic framework—The Earth-Moon Energy Accord (EMEA)—to ensure equitable access, safety, and international cooperation.

The concept directly supports MountBay’s mission: to push the frontiers of clean power while securing energy independence for AI-driven economies.

Tanawade is rallying governments, institutions, and innovators to join him. “It’s time for America to lead the most ambitious energy project in human history,” he said.

“The global push for electrification is transforming the automotive landscape,” said Marc Gay, Sales Development Engineer. “It drives increased sales of passenger and commercial battery electric vehicles for the foreseeable future.”

Trelleborg’s CellXPro: EV Battery Sealing Solutions

“Trelleborg is at the forefront of EV sealing technology, developing solutions from the ground up rather than relying on technology derived from the combustion engine era,” Gay said. “With CellXProTM, developed from our advanced battery testing and R&D regime, we are ideally equipped to advise customers on material selection.”

CellXPro sealing materials include ethylene propylene diene monomer (EPDM), fluoropolymer (FKM), and perfluoroalkoxy (PFA) compounds. These are tailored along with various specialist formulations to meet demanding battery cell requirements.

Advanced sealing extends battery performance

A critical factor for battery efficiency and longevity is the quality of cell components, especially the seals within the cell housing. These components must withstand high operational demands and maintain excellent chemical compatibility. Chemical interactions between sealing materials and electrolytes can degrade the chemical makeup and shorten battery life.

Understanding the chemical interplay between electrolytes, seals, metal terminals, and other cell elements is key to optimizing cell performance. Trelleborg supports battery manufacturers with expert material specification and testing focused on EV battery sealing solutions.

“Leveraging our experience, we launched the CellXProTM portfolio,” Gay added. “The range positions Trelleborg as the sealing partner of choice for battery manufacturers. It enables them to select the right materials with confidence.

“Trelleborg has a multi-decade history of working successfully with all the major automotive manufacturers. Customers benefit from our global manufacturing footprint and unsurpassed R&D. But they also have access to local supply options and global flexibility for a robust supply chain, an important asset in times of geopolitical uncertainty.”

In addition to sealing materials, Trelleborg offers thermoplastic cell insulators as standalone parts or integrated components. The multicomponent technology enables part count reduction, Trelleborg said. This approach combines electrical isolation and sealing into a single elastomer-bonded part, produced in high volume through automated lines.",https://s37629.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Trelleborg-Sealing-Solutions-Innovations-Support-the-PFAS-Transition-1400-1.jpg,N,,2025-06-21 12:17:23.763997

Recently we have read about devastation from wildfires and strong storms. Climate scientists say we will see more of this as a result of climate change.

To reduce air pollution that causes climate change we must reduce carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions.

Senator Lindsey Graham said, “CO2 emissions generated by man is creating our greenhouse gas effect that traps heat, and the planet is warming.”

Our government needs to do much more to promote clean energy, such as wind, solar, and geothermal, and reduce our dependence on fossil fuels. This includes maintaining tax credits for clean energy — not reducing them.

I encourage readers to email their U.S. Senators and Representative. Joining Citizens’ Climate Lobby and similar groups is another great way to fight climate change.

Make earth great again. There is no planet B.

When our grandchildren ask what we did about climate change, let’s have an answer.

The Senate bill provides a smaller, initial bump-up to $2,200, but the bump is permanent, with the credit amount indexed for inflation beginning next year.
The Senate bill includes no sunset, making the tax breaks permanent, which was a key priority of powerful trade groups such as the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.
Under the Senate bill, the tax credits for clean energy and home energy efficiency would still be phased out, but less quickly than under the House bill.
The Senate bill excludes the proposed fees.","WASHINGTON — (AP) — House and Senate Republicans are taking slightly different approaches when it comes to the tax cuts that lawmakers are looking to include in their massive tax and spending cuts bill.

Republicans in the two chambers don't agree on the size of a deduction for state and local taxes. And they are at odds on such things as allowing people to use their health savings accounts to help pay for their gym membership, or whether electric vehicle and hybrid owners should have to pay an annual fee.

The House passed its version shortly before Memorial Day. Now the Senate is looking to pass its version.

While the two bills are similar on the major tax provisions, how they work out their differences in the coming weeks will determine how quickly they can get a final product over the finish line. President Donald Trump is pushing to have the legislation on his desk by July 4th.

Here’s a look at some of the key differences between the two bills:

The child tax credit currently stands at $2,000 per child.

The House bill temporarily boosts the child tax credit to $2,500 for the 2025 through 2028 tax years, roughly the length of President Donald Trump's second term. It also indexes the credit amount for inflation beginning in 2027.

The Senate bill provides a smaller, initial bump-up to $2,200, but the bump is permanent, with the credit amount indexed for inflation beginning next year.

Trump promised on the campaign trail that he would seek to end income taxes on tips, overtime and Social Security benefits. Also, he would give car buyers a new tax break by allowing them to deduct the interest paid on auto loans.

The House and Senate bills incorporate those promises with temporary deductions lasting from the 2025 through 2028 tax years, but with some differences.

The House bill creates a deduction on tips for those working in jobs that have customarily received tips. The House also provides for a deduction for overtime that’s equal to the amount of OT a worker has earned.

The Senate bill comes with more restrictions. The deduction for tips is limited to $25,000 per taxpayer and the deduction for overtime is limited to $12,500 per taxpayer.

The House and Senate bills both provide a deduction of up to $10,000 for interest paid on loans for vehicles made in the United States.

And on Social Security, the bills don't directly touch the program. Instead, they grant a larger tax deduction for Americans age 65 and older. The House sets the deduction at $4,000. The Senate sets it at $6,000.

Both chambers include income limits over which the new deductions begin to phase out.

The caps on state and local tax deductions, known in Washington as the SALT cap, now stand at $10,000.

The House bill, in a bid to win over Republicans from New York, California and New Jersey, lifts the cap to $40,000 per household with incomes of less than $500,000. The credit phases down for households earning more than $500,000.

The Senate bill keeps the cap at $10,000. That's a non-starter in the House, but Republicans in the two chambers will look to negotiate a final number over the coming weeks that both sides can accept.

The House bill prohibits states from establishing new provider taxes or increasing existing taxes. These are taxes that Medicaid providers, such as hospitals, pay to help states finance their share of Medicaid costs. In turn, the taxes allow states to receive increased federal matching funds while generally holding providers harmless through higher reimbursements that offset the taxes paid.

Such taxes now are effectively capped at 6%. The Senate looks to gradually lower that threshold for states that have expanded their Medicaid populations under the Affordable Care Act, or “Obamacare,” until it reaches 3.5% in 2031, with exceptions for nursing homes and intermediate care facilities.

Industry groups have warned that limiting the ability of states to tax providers may lead to some states making significant cuts to their Medicaid programs as they make up for the lost revenue in other ways. The Medicaid provision could be a flashpoint in the coming House and Senate negotiations. Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., was highly critical of the proposed Senate changes.

“This needs a lot of work. It’s really concerning and I’m really surprised by it,” he said. “Rural hospitals are going to be in bad shape.”

The House bill would allow companies for five years to fully deduct equipment purchases and domestic research and development expenses. The Senate bill includes no sunset, making the tax breaks permanent, which was a key priority of powerful trade groups such as the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.

Republicans in both chambers are looking to scale back the clean energy tax credits enacted through then-President Joe Biden's climate law. It aimed to boost the nation's transition away from planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions toward renewable energy such as wind and solar power.

Under the Senate bill, the tax credits for clean energy and home energy efficiency would still be phased out, but less quickly than under the House bill. Still, advocacy groups fear that the final measure will threaten hundreds of thousands of jobs and drive up household energy costs.

The House bill would allow millions of Americans to use their health savings accounts to pay for gym memberships, with a cap of $500 for single taxpayers and $1,000 for joint filers. The Senate bill doesn't include such a provision.

The House reinstates a charitable deduction for non-itemizers of $150 per taxpayer. The Senate bill increases that deduction for donations to $1,000 per taxpayer.

Republicans in the House bill included a new annual fee of $250 for EV owners and $100 for hybrid owners that would be collected by state motor vehicle departments. The Senate bill excludes the proposed fees.

A comparison - Marietta Times,Not Available,,,,,https://www.mariettatimes.com/opinion/local-columns/2025/06/mov-climate-corner-why-not-west-virginia-a-comparison/,"With all of its grit, tenacity and work ethic, there’s no reason that West Virginia shouldn’t be a national leader in many respects.
A state that, by comparison, should be in the same category of success as West Virginia.
On the policymaking side, we see more divisions between West Virginia and North Carolina.
Much like West Virginia, North Carolina’s legislature hosts a (near) veto-proof Republican majority.
Griffin Bradley is a lifelong Wood County resident, graduate of West Virginia University, and a contributing author for Mid-Ohio Valley Climate Action.","As a lifelong West Virginian, I have a soft spot for seeing my state succeed. With all of its grit, tenacity and work ethic, there’s no reason that West Virginia shouldn’t be a national leader in many respects. But yet, we see our state struggle to keep up as new opportunities arise, trading in progress for the same old, worn out tagline. We all know the jingle. “Coal is West Virginia,” right?

Over the last four years, America has been at an important moment for innovation and expansion of the clean energy economy. For all its supposed faults, the Inflation Reduction Act produced thousands of jobs, billions of dollars of economic value, and spurred industrial innovations at a rate rarely seen since the Industrial Revolution. But for those of us who call the Mountain State home, we have not reaped much of those benefits. Rather, we’ve seen business after business make their home in other states. States that, frankly, share many characteristics with West Virginia.

So then what gives? Despite the opportunities, West Virginia flounders. In order to get a better understanding of exactly why West Virginia fails to meet the moment, let’s compare to a similar state. Join me as we take a quick trip down I-77 to the Tar Heel State of North Carolina. A state that, by comparison, should be in the same category of success as West Virginia. Nestled in the shadow of the Appalachian Mountains, both states have strong blue-collar roots and a favorable cost-of-living, yet one outdoes the other by leaps and bounds. Why?

Let’s break it down a bit further.

North Carolina has been named in the top 2 of CNBC’s annual “Best States For Business” reports for the last four years, continually trading the #1 and #2 spot with another of West Virginia’s neighbors, Virginia. North Carolina’s spot as a top state for business development is due in no small part to its early support for clean energy growth. Not only does North Carolina benefit from its nearly 110,000-strong clean energy workforce, but it also sees new businesses that manufacture clean energy technologies pouring into the state on what feels like a monthly basis. Not to mention the traditional businesses that have increased their existing footprint in the state due to their supportive clean energy environment.

On the policymaking side, we see more divisions between West Virginia and North Carolina. Much like West Virginia, North Carolina’s legislature hosts a (near) veto-proof Republican majority. The only difference between the two is the latter’s executive branch has been controlled by a Democrat in recent years, with former Gov. Roy Cooper and current Gov. Josh Stein. Despite the many ideological differences of North Carolina’s legislative and executive branches, the legislature and governor(s) have come together in many instances to support policy that creates a conducive environment for the clean energy economy to flourish. As such, North Carolina has been a leader in nearly every sense of the word.

Now, back in West Virginia, we can better outline where we have failed. In terms of clean energy jobs, well, it’s safe to say we are dwarfed by much of the United States with only around 10,000 dedicated jobs. This is all while the supposed backbone of our economy and culture, old “King Coal,” continues to see dwindling jobs numbers and overall economic value amid a volatile international coal market.

Despite the writing being on the wall for most forward-thinking, commonsense folks, we see little policy coming out of Charleston that would suggest West Virginia is headed toward an economic renaissance anytime soon. And to be fair, why would we? In a state where there are presumably more janitors wandering the halls of the Capitol than elected Democrats and a super-duper Republican majority that has long looked at the prospects of the coal industry through rose colored glasses, it’s no surprise that West Virginia hasn’t seen the same success as our neighbors when it comes to the national clean energy boom.

Now more than ever, West Virginians should be angry. Angry that we aren’t a national trendsetter. Angry that our leaders didn’t grasp the enormous opportunity that is now in the rearview mirror. Angry that we are being left in the dust by very comparable states. If economic mediocrity and complacency from leadership is what you want, look no further. As for me, I find inspiration in our neighbors’ successes. I wish those in Charleston did, too.

With dominance in solar panels, wind turbines, and EV batteries, China is positioning itself as the indispensable partner for decarbonization—regardless of trade barriers. This article explores strategic investment opportunities in sectors poised to capitalize on this dynamic, emphasizing urgency driven by policy tailwinds and supply chain leverage.

Solar Manufacturing: China's Unassailable Lead

China's solar industry commands 75% of global manufacturing capacity, with polysilicon production concentrated in Xinjiang (40% of global output). Key players like TW-Solar and JA Solar dominate polysilicon-to-module production, leveraging cost advantages (10-35% lower than rivals) and vertical integration.

Investment angle:

- Polysilicon producers: Companies like GCL-Poly Energy (03800.HK) benefit from rising demand and concentrated supply.

- Module manufacturers: Tongwei Solar (TW-Solar) and LONGi Green Energy are scaling to meet 1.8 TW of global solar capacity by 2025.

-

Wind Power: From Local Dominance to Global Expansion

Chinese wind OEMs like Goldwind and Envision now hold 60% of global wind installations, with Goldwind alone installing 20 GW in 2024. Their advantage lies in technological innovation (e.g., 5.5 MW turbines, medium-speed drivetrains) and cost leadership.

Investment angle:

- Offshore wind: Mingyang Smart Energy leads in 10+ MW turbines, targeting Asia-Pacific and Europe.

- Supply chain plays: Companies like Sinovel Wind Group benefit from rising rotor demand (58% of turbines now exceed 180m rotor diameter).

EV Batteries: CATL and BYD's Unmatched Scale

China's CATL and BYD control 55% of global EV battery production, leveraging lithium iron phosphate (LFP) dominance (66% of China's EV market) and cost leadership. Despite U.S. Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) subsidies, U.S. manufacturers still rely on Chinese expertise: Ford's Michigan plant partners with CATL, while Honda-LG's Ohio venture faces supply chain bottlenecks.

Investment angle:

- CATL (300750.SZ): Its 38% global market share in 2025 and partnerships with automakers make it a cornerstone for EV supply chains.

- BYD (002594.SZ): Battery sales to Tesla and European OEMs highlight its global reach.

-

U.S. Climate Retreat: A Tailwind for Chinese Firms

The IRA's localization requirements have backfired, driving U.S. firms to collaborate with Chinese partners (e.g., Ford-CATL) rather than decouple. Meanwhile, China's control over critical minerals (100% of spherical graphite, 69% of lithium processing) ensures its grip on supply chains.

Geopolitical leverage:

- China's dominance in polysilicon, graphite, and cobalt processing creates monopoly rents, enabling price hikes.

-

Investment Priorities: Where to Deploy Capital Now

Solar and Wind Supply Chains:

Invest in polysilicon and turbine component manufacturers (e.g., JinkoSolar (JKS) for modules, United Wind Force for blades).

Batteries and Critical Minerals:

CATL and BYD remain core holdings.

Mineral plays: Ganfeng Lithium (01772.HK) and Sinomine Resources for lithium and rare earths.

Technology Leaders:

Envision Energy (battery management systems) and Tongwei Solar (cell efficiency innovations).

Geopolitical Arbitrage:

Export-oriented firms like Goldwind targeting Africa and South America.

The Clock Is Ticking

China's clean energy dominance is a self-reinforcing cycle: scale drives cost advantages, which attract global demand, further entrenching market share. With U.S. policies failing to dislodge this structure, investors ignoring Chinese exposure risk missing the energy transition's biggest winners.

Act now: Allocate to China's clean energy leaders before geopolitical tensions force irrational sell-offs. The energy transition is here—and its backbone is Made in China.

The nonprofit Wilderness Society released an analysis and interactive map, showing that even more land could be impacted than originally anticipated. In updated text of the bill obtained by the Wilderness Society on June 14, land with grazing permits would be included as eligible for sale. Around 250 million acres of land would be eligible for sale across eleven Western states, including Colorado, Utah, and Wyoming.

Republicans in the Senate say the sales would be for affordable housing, though nothing in the bill mandates that the sale be for housing, let alone affordable housing. The bill outlines criteria for lands that should be prioritized for sale, but none of those guidelines are mandatory for a sale to take place. It mandates that between 2 and 3 million acres of U.S. Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management lands are sold. National parks, national monuments, wilderness areas, and national recreation areas would be excluded from any sale.

From the bill’s introduction on June 11, the criticism has been swift and plentiful.

Rep. Joe Neguse (D-Colo.) called it “shameful.”

“It is a five-alarm fire for hunters here in Colorado, for fishermen, for conservationists, for recreationists, and for every Coloradan folks who enjoy these lands and who are committed to preserving them for future generations,” he said.

Neguse credited bipartisan cooperation between Democrats and Republicans like Ryan Zinke (R-Mont.) and Jeff Hurd (R-Colo.) for the defeat of a smaller lands sale provision in the House version of the budget bill. In that proposal, several hundreds of thousands of acres would have been sold in Nevada and Utah, but it was axed from the megabill at the last minute.

Sen. Michael Bennet (D-Colo.) said that once these lands are sold, it’s nearly impossible to get them back.

“It's an important part of our obligation as elected officials in our state and in the West to protect the work that our parents and grandparents did for us, much less the legacy that our kids and grandkids are gonna want to embrace,” he said.

148 environmental advocacy groups signed a letter to the Senate, calling on the language outlining the sale of public lands to be struck from the budget bill.

“Selling off public lands is short-sighted, self-serving and irreversible,” the letter reads. “These lands belong to all Americans. Once they’re sold, they’re gone for good — fences go up, access disappears and they are lost to the public forever. Westerners and people across the country overwhelmingly support the protection of public lands and have consistently rejected attempts to sell them off. Time and again, the public has made it clear: our forests, desert lands and open spaces are not and should not be for sale.”

Conservative responses to public land sales

This larger Senate version of the land sale has drawn criticism from both sides of the aisle, including from the conservative American Conservation Coalition, whose founder called it “an anti-American action.”

Isaiah Menning, the ACC’s external affairs director, said there were a few different reasons conservatives weren’t happy with the bill.

“Our concern with the provision in this bill, is that it sets an arbitrary limit or mandate on how much land ought to be sold, and we’re concerned that land could be sold and impair some of the benefits that we get from federal land,” he said. “Our ideal scenario is that broadly, we don’t do mass land sales, but we’d rather equip local communities to help us steward those lands for the benefit of the entire nation.”

“Those benefits are primarily around hunting access, hiking access, recreational access, and then also the great ecosystem benefits that we can get from that land,” he said. “American biodiversity and the wildlife we have, especially big game, is a major part of the American heritage, and we should conserve our sublime landscapes that we have in the West. Theodore Roosevelt identified this.”

Menning said public lands with grazing permits was another aspect that was especially concerning for the ACC.

“Now there are ranching families who, for generations, have been stewarding these lands,” he said. “The grazing allotments are transferable and usually attached to a certain piece of property, and so it’s really quite important to many of these families. Including these kinds of land in a sale is a point of concern for us, because these… ranchers have been so important in stewarding these landscapes. So we’d like to see those kinds of voices be more involved in the stewardship of federal lands, ultimately for the benefit of all Americans.”

He also said that though one of the stated goals of the bill is to reduce the federal deficit, this could actually hurt the government’s ability to make money off of federal public lands, and identified economic prosperity and energy abundance as conservative values.

“You could also see sales of lands that are really useful for mineral development or energy development that are really beneficial for the American public,” he said. “That could hamper our ability to use those resources, and… also hamper the ability of the federal government to gain revenue from those resources.”

Montana is the only Western state excluded from the proposal. Montana Republicans have previously been opposed to the sale of federal public lands, which could potentially hamper Republicans’ ability to guide any budget across the finish line. Both chambers of Congress are closely divided.

In a post on X, formerly known as Twitter, Zinke said he was still against the sale of public lands.

Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah), who chairs the Senate Energy & Natural Resources Committee, has not responded to requests for comment, but has been actively posting in defense of the public lands sale on X.

Lee posted repeatedly on both his official Senate account and his personal account @BasedMikeLee in defense of the proposal.

Lee also went on conservative talk show host Glenn Beck’s radio show on June 19 to defend the proposal.

“This is not the crown jewel land,” he said. “This is garden-variety land that's just sitting there vacant where people can, do, and should live.”

During his approximately 12 minutes on the show, Lee also said that there would be further limitations on what land would be eligible for sale.

“(We’re) working on changes to further limit eligible lands, to those Forest Service-owned lands within two miles of a population center, and lands managed by the Bureau of Land Management within five miles of a population center,” he told Beck. “So this deals with land that is only in or near a place where people live, and it doesn't authorize the sale, it authorizes a process.”

Lee’s office has not responded to requests for that information, nor when those updated limitations would be released.",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/528b19c/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5184x2722+0+367/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fa3%2F7e%2Fa2fcc5da427f866c7dff926d9195%2Fimg-0554.JPG,N,,2025-06-21 13:09:30.901453

The EPA’s rapid deployment was crucial from day one.

Under the Trump administration’s second term, the EPA is confronted with budget cuts of up to 55% and massive layoffs that will impact research, enforcement and emergency response.

Environmental disasters can strike anywhere, and the stakes are deadly serious. So a well-funded and well-equipped Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) isn’t just a policy nicety—it’s a lifeline for the health, safety and well-being of every single Ohioan, every single American. We can’t afford to be unprepared.

I learned this firsthand. On a frigid Friday night in February 2023, my hometown of East Palestine became the epicenter of a national crisis when a Norfolk Southern train derailed, becoming engulfed in flames and ultimately releasing a cocktail of toxic substances, including 1.1 million pounds of vinyl chloride. This chemical is a known carcinogen linked to brain, liver, lung and blood cancer, among others.

Emergency responders, including those from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), swiftly mobilized to assess and mitigate the damage. While its response was not perfect, the EPA’s rapid deployment was crucial from day one, with many personnel spending more time stationed in East Palestine during the first year of cleanup than with their own families.

The EPA helped guarantee that Norfolk Southern was accountable for its actions, ensuring the polluter followed federal remediation regulations. The agency directed extensive clean-up efforts, removing over 224,000 tons of contaminated soil and 74 million gallons of wastewater, and collecting over 115 million air monitoring data points.

The agency also leveraged every enforcement tool available under its purview, with the Justice Department and EPA reaching a $310 million settlement with Norfolk Southern, including $25 million for a 20-year community health program to monitor and provide services for affected individuals. Several experienced immediate symptoms such as headaches, nosebleeds, skin rashes and breathing problems, and others are now identifying long-term ailments like asthma, PTSD and cancers.

The EPA also coordinated with federal, state and local partners to help restore my community, shared information on its dedicated webpage, organized a cross-functional community group that provided regular updates, and served more than 1,200 visitors at its Community Welcome Center.

The East Palestine incident underscores the broader role of the EPA in managing environmental and human health disasters, from hurricanes and floods to chemical spills and oil leaks. In 2022, the EPA supported local response efforts after 20 major storms, demonstrating its commitment to disaster management across the country. With petrochemical incidents occurring every three days, the agency responds to an average of 1,000 chemical spills annually. Since the 1970s, the EPA has been involved in more than 50,000 oil spill cleanups, playing a critical role in protecting waterways and ecosystems from long-term damage.

These statistics paint a picture of an agency consistently on the front lines, providing essential expertise and resources.

The increasing frequency and complexity of these disasters pose significant challenges. Yet under the Trump administration’s second term, the EPA is confronted with budget cuts of up to 55% and massive layoffs that will impact research, enforcement and emergency response. Funding cuts will severely hamper the agency’s ability to respond to crises, maintain its regulatory oversight and support local communities in their recovery efforts.

Effective disaster response needs rapid action and robust funding to address modern environmental crises. Adequate funding ensures rapid mobilization of teams, equipment and expertise, reducing immediate health and environmental risks.

Tight budgets, however, compromise advanced monitoring, assessments and enforcement, leading to delayed and inadequate responses with dire consequences.

Stable funding is also vital for post-disaster community health. The emotional and psychological toll on families is immense, and full funding allows the EPA to provide essential support, ensuring access to clean water, air, and recovery resources. It also enables ongoing research, improving response strategies and preparing the agency for future challenges, making the agency more effective.

The United States spares no expense in defending its citizens from external threats. We should apply the same level of commitment to defending against domestic tragedies like the toxic chemical spills in East Palestine and other environmental disasters.

To do so, we must ensure that the EPA remains a vital part of our nation’s safety net, ready to act when and where it is needed.

Under the Senate bill, the tax credits for clean energy and home energy efficiency would still be phased out, but less quickly than under the House bill.
The Senate bill doesn’t include such a provision.
The Senate bill excludes the proposed fees.","WASHINGTON (AP) — House and Senate Republicans are taking slightly different approaches when it comes to the tax cuts that lawmakers are looking to include in their massive tax and spending cuts bill.

Republicans in the two chambers don’t agree on the size of a deduction for state and local taxes. And they are at odds on such things as allowing people to use their health savings accounts to help pay for their gym membership, or whether electric vehicle and hybrid owners should have to pay an annual fee.

The House passed its version shortly before Memorial Day. Now the Senate is looking to pass its version.

While the two bills are similar on the major tax provisions, how they work out their differences in the coming weeks will determine how quickly they can get a final product over the finish line. President Donald Trump is pushing to have the legislation on his desk by July 4th.

Here’s a look at some of the key differences between the two bills:

Tax break for families

The child tax credit currently stands at $2,000 per child.

The House bill temporarily boosts the child tax credit to $2,500 for the 2025 through 2028 tax years, roughly the length of President Donald Trump’s second term. It also indexes the credit amount for inflation beginning in 2027.

The Senate bill provides a smaller, initial bump-up to $2,200, but the bump is permanent, with the credit amount indexed for inflation beginning next year.

Trump campaign promises

Trump promised on the campaign trail that he would seek to end income taxes on tips, overtime and Social Security benefits. Also, he would give car buyers a new tax break by allowing them to deduct the interest paid on auto loans.

The House and Senate bills incorporate those promises with temporary deductions lasting from the 2025 through 2028 tax years, but with some differences.

The House bill creates a deduction on tips for those working in jobs that have customarily received tips. The House also provides for a deduction for overtime that’s equal to the amount of OT a worker has earned.

The Senate bill comes with more restrictions. The deduction for tips is limited to $25,000 per taxpayer and the deduction for overtime is limited to $12,500 per taxpayer.

The House and Senate bills both provide a deduction of up to $10,000 for interest paid on loans for vehicles made in the United States.

And on Social Security, the bills don’t directly touch the program. Instead, they grant a larger tax deduction for Americans age 65 and older. The House sets the deduction at $4,000. The Senate sets it at $6,000.

Both chambers include income limits over which the new deductions begin to phase out.

More SALT

The caps on state and local tax deductions, known in Washington as the SALT cap, now stand at $10,000.

The House bill, in a bid to win over Republicans from New York, California and New Jersey, lifts the cap to $40,000 per household with incomes of less than $500,000. The credit phases down for households earning more than $500,000.

The Senate bill keeps the cap at $10,000. That’s a non-starter in the House, but Republicans in the two chambers will look to negotiate a final number over the coming weeks that both sides can accept.

Medicaid providers

The House bill prohibits states from establishing new provider taxes or increasing existing taxes. These are taxes that Medicaid providers, such as hospitals, pay to help states finance their share of Medicaid costs. In turn, the taxes allow states to receive increased federal matching funds while generally holding providers harmless through higher reimbursements that offset the taxes paid.

Such taxes now are effectively capped at 6%. The Senate looks to gradually lower that threshold for states that have expanded their Medicaid populations under the Affordable Care Act, or “Obamacare,” until it reaches 3.5% in 2031, with exceptions for nursing homes and intermediate care facilities.

Industry groups have warned that limiting the ability of states to tax providers may lead to some states making significant cuts to their Medicaid programs as they make up for the lost revenue in other ways. The Medicaid provision could be a flashpoint in the coming House and Senate negotiations. Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., was highly critical of the proposed Senate changes.

“This needs a lot of work. It’s really concerning and I’m really surprised by it,” he said. “Rural hospitals are going to be in bad shape.”

Tax breaks for business

The House bill would allow companies for five years to fully deduct equipment purchases and domestic research and development expenses. The Senate bill includes no sunset, making the tax breaks permanent, which was a key priority of powerful trade groups such as the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.

Clean energy tax credits

Republicans in both chambers are looking to scale back the clean energy tax credits enacted through then-President Joe Biden’s climate law. It aimed to boost the nation’s transition away from planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions toward renewable energy such as wind and solar power.

Under the Senate bill, the tax credits for clean energy and home energy efficiency would still be phased out, but less quickly than under the House bill. Still, advocacy groups fear that the final measure will threaten hundreds of thousands of jobs and drive up household energy costs.

Odds and ends

The House bill would allow millions of Americans to use their health savings accounts to pay for gym memberships, with a cap of $500 for single taxpayers and $1,000 for joint filers. The Senate bill doesn’t include such a provision.

The House reinstates a charitable deduction for non-itemizers of $150 per taxpayer. The Senate bill increases that deduction for donations to $1,000 per taxpayer.

Republicans in the House bill included a new annual fee of $250 for EV owners and $100 for hybrid owners that would be collected by state motor vehicle departments. The Senate bill excludes the proposed fees.

Fairfield County is home to the top two towns for EV ownership — Weston and Westport — with 10.1% and 10.4% percent of registered vehicles classified as EVs.

Teslas account for 35.4% of all EVs registered in Connecticut as of Dec. 31, 2024, according to EV Connecticut. Other manufacturers don’t even come close; Toyota takes second but accounts for only 9.5% of all registered EVs statewide.

As the state continues to encourage residents in the market for a car to buy electric, President Donald Trump’s proposed spending bill could cut federal EV tax credits completely. The bill proposes annual federal registration fees on electric and hybrid vehicles to go towards highway and road maintenance.

The state offers credit on qualifying EVs under the Connecticut Hydrogen and Electric Automobile Purchase Rebate, falling somewhere between $750 to $1,500, depending on the type of vehicle. This program is part of the state’s commitment to clean air goals, and for “creating cleaner, healthier, and more sustainable communities,” according to the EV Connecticut dashboard.

And to make EV purchases more equitable, the state offers an additional credit program called Rebate+. Qualification for the program is determined by either income level, participation in federal assistance programs or location of residence.

So with Rebate+ and CHEAPR, those in the market for an EV who qualify can receive up to $4,500 from the state.

The cheapest model from Tesla, the most popular EV manufacturer in both the state and the nation, costs over $40,000.

Electricity prices are rising quickly for U.S. households, even as overall inflation has cooled.

Electricity prices rose 4.5% in the past year, according to the consumer price index for May 2025 — nearly double the inflation rate for all goods and services.

The U.S. Energy Information Administration estimated in May that retail electricity prices would outpace inflation through 2026. Prices have already risen faster than the broad inflation rate since 2022, it said.

""It's a pretty simple story: It's a story of supply and demand,"" said David Hill, executive vice president of energy at the Bipartisan Policy Center and former general counsel at the U.S. Energy Department.

There are many contributing factors, economists and energy experts said.

At a high level, the growth in electricity demand and deactivation of power-generating facilities are outstripping the pace at which new electricity generation is being added to the electric grid, Hill said.

Prices are regional

U.S. consumers spent an average of about $1,760 on electricity in 2023, according to the EIA, which cited federal data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics.

Of course, cost can vary widely based on where consumers live and their electricity consumption. The average U.S. household paid about 17 cents per kilowatt-hour of electricity in March 2025 — but ranged from a low of about 11 cents per kWh in North Dakota to about 41 cents per kWh in Hawaii, according to EIA data.

Households in certain geographies will see their electric bills rise faster than those in others, experts said.

Residential electricity prices in the Pacific, Middle Atlantic and New England regions — areas where consumers already pay much more per kilowatt-hour for electricity — could increase more than the national average, according to the EIA.

""Electricity prices are regionally determined, not globally determined like oil prices,"" said Joe Seydl, a senior markets economist at J.P. Morgan Private Bank.

The EIA expects average retail electricity prices to increase 13% from 2022 through 2025.

That means the average household's annual electricity bill could rise about $219 in 2025 relative to 2022, to about $1,902 from $1,683, according to a CNBC analysis of federal data. That assumes their usage is unchanged.

But prices for Pacific area households will rise 26% over that period, to more than 21 cents per kilowatt-hour, EIA estimates. Meanwhile, households in the West North Central region will see prices increase 8% in that period, to almost 11 cents per kWh.

However, certain electricity trends are happening nationwide, not just regionally, experts said.

Data centers are 'energy hungry'

Elijah Nouvelage | Bloomberg | Getty Images

Electricity demand growth was ""minimal"" in recent decades due to increases in energy efficiency, according to Jennifer Curran, senior vice president of planning and operations at Midcontinent Independent System Operator, who testified at a House energy hearing in March. (MISO, a regional electric-grid operator, serves 45 million people across 15 states.)

Meanwhile, U.S. ""electrification"" swelled via use of electronic devices, smart-home products and electric vehicles, Curran said.

Now, demand is poised to surge in coming years, and data centers are a major contributor, experts said.

Data centers are vast warehouses of computer servers and other IT equipment that power cloud computing, artificial intelligence and other tech applications.

Data center electricity use tripled to 176 Terawatt-hours in the decade through 2023, according to the U.S. Energy Department. Use is projected to double or triple by 2028, the agency said.

Data centers are expected to consume up to 12% of total U.S. electricity by 2028, up from 4.4% in 2023, the Energy Department said.

They're ""energy hungry,"" Curran said. Demand growth has been ""unexpected"" and largely due to support for artificial intelligence, she said.

The U.S. economy is set to consume more electricity in 2030 for processing data than for manufacturing all energy-intensive goods combined, including aluminum, steel, cement and chemicals, according to the International Energy Agency.

Continued electrification among businesses and households is expected to raise electricity demand, too, experts said.

The U.S. has moved away from fossil fuels like coal, oil and natural gas to reduce planet-warming greenhouse-gas emissions.

For example, more households may use electric vehicles rather than gasoline-powered cars or electric heat pumps versus a gas furnace — which are more efficient technologies but raise overall demand on the electric grid, experts said.

Population growth and cryptocurrency mining, another power-intensive activity, are also contributors, said BPC's Hill.

'All about infrastructure'

Thianchai Sitthikongsak | Moment | Getty Images

As electricity demand is rising, the U.S. is also having problems relative to transmission and distribution of power, said Seydl of J.P. Morgan.

Rising electricity prices are ""all about infrastructure at this point,"" he said. ""The grid is aged.""

For example, transmission line growth is ""stuck in a rut"" and ""way below"" Energy Department targets for 2030 and 2035, Michael Cembalest, chairman of market and investment Strategy for J.P. Morgan Asset & Wealth Management, wrote in a March energy report.

Shortages of transformer equipment — which step voltages up and down across the U.S. grid — pose another obstacle, Cembalest wrote. Delivery times are about two to three years, up from about four to six weeks in 2019, he wrote.

""Half of all US transformers are near the end of their useful lives and will need replacing, along with replacements in areas affected by hurricanes, floods and wildfires,"" Cembalest wrote.

Transformers and other transmission equipment have experienced the second highest inflation rate among all wholesale goods in the US since 2018, he wrote.

Meanwhile, certain facilities like old fossil-fuel powered plants have been decommissioned and new energy capacity to replace it has been relatively slow to come online, said BPC's Hill. There has also been inflation in prices for equipment and labor, so it costs more to build facilities, he said.",https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/108160044-1750103665589-gettyimages-1418634136-9x3a1548.jpeg?v=1750103715&w=1920&h=1080,N,,2025-06-21 07:01:57.336587

Further greenhouse gas reductions may instead have to come from paper companies deciding to invest in clean technologies and reduce pollution.","Two of Maine’s largest paper mills are among the dirtiest in the country, according to a new study on U.S. pulp and paper plants, putting their emissions on par with some oil refineries.

The May report from the Environmental Integrity Project, a non-profit advocacy group, calls attention to the industry’s overreliance on dirty fuels and the old, inefficient technologies they use to burn them.

“In Maine, there are several plants that are still burning coal and… tires,” said Courtney Bernhardt, EIP’s director of research who co-authored the report. “We wanted to raise awareness about that.”

The group analyzed greenhouse gas emissions from 185 paper plants across the country, which Bernhardt says are undercounted by federal estimates because of a loophole in the reporting process: the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency doesn’t include greenhouse gas emissions from “biogenic” fuel sources like biomass or black liquor, a wood byproduct of the chemical papermaking process, both of which mills burn to power their operations and can be dirtier than coal.

The agency’s rationale for excluding those sources from total emissions estimates in its Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program, according to EIP, is “because trees can grow back in the future” and offset the carbon emissions from biomass fuels.

Until the EPA accurately reports and regulates all facility emissions, mill owners will have less of a reason to pursue energy efficiency upgrades that can both cut back reliance on dirty fuels and maintain profits, the report claims.

The study’s recommendations for tightening limits on the paper industry’s emissions come as the Trump administration eyes drastic rollbacks of federal rules curtailing greenhouse gases and hazardous air pollutants released by American power plants, according to reporting from The New York Times.

Maine is home to two of the last remaining paper plants in the country that burn tires as fuel. As other mills move away from so-called “tire-derived fuels,” Maine plants have increased their use in recent years, adding to their output of harmful pollutants.

The combination of coal, tires and other fuels burned by ND Paper’s plant in Rumford made it the second-largest emitter of mercury out of the 185 facilities included in EIP’s analysis of 2023 EPA data. The Sappi Somerset mill in Skowhegan, which also burns tires, was a top-20 emitter of hazardous air pollutants in 2020.

Both plants’ emissions have local and global effects. Common mill byproducts like nitrogen oxides, sulfur dioxide and fine particulate matter all harm the respiratory system and can linger in the atmosphere, where nitrogen oxide creates acid rain.

When biogenic fuel is taken into account, mill greenhouse gas emissions are almost as high as the dirtiest U.S. oil refineries, according to EIP. Sappi Somerset mill’s total greenhouse gas emissions balloon from 316,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide to nearly 1.6 million when including biogenic fuel sources — a 400 percent increase.

Nationwide, EIP found that paper mills’ greenhouse gas emissions were 350 percent higher than public-facing EPA estimates.

At the state level, these emissions are counted. Maine ditched the EPA’s model and began including biogenic sources of carbon dioxide in a 2022 update on its climate change goals.

Maine lawmakers recently codified a new 2040 deadline to reach net zero carbon emissions, and one effective way to do so nationwide, according to Bernhardt, is upgrading the inefficient boilers that many mills have relied on for decades to power operations.

The EIP report estimates that 40 percent of all analyzed pulp and paper mills have a boiler that is at least a half century old, including the power boiler that Woodland Pulp’s Washington County mill still uses 54 years after it was installed.

A representative for Woodland Pulp said that the company’s Baileyville mill has reduced its emissions over the past two decades by switching from fuel oil to natural gas. Mill energy needs are also supported by on-site hydropower.

Although many boilers are upgraded and retrofitted to add pollution controls — including the one used by Woodland Pulp — EIP recommends replacing them with zero-emission industrial heat technologies where possible, reducing overall emissions and the amount of heat lost by inefficient boilers during the papermaking process.

Sappi has pursued similar efficiency updates at its Somerset mill in recent years, according to Sappi communications manager April Jones. The company no longer burns coal and has reduced reliance on other dirty fuels, setting a 2030 deadline to reduce the mill’s 2019 greenhouse gas emissions by 41.5 percent per ton of product.

Sappi and Woodland Pulp also disputed EIP’s claims that their total mill greenhouse gas emissions are underreported. Despite EPA’s reporting framework, both companies stated that they still publish their mills’ biogenic emissions. (ND Paper did not respond to requests for comment).

The paper industry hasn’t yet been targeted by rollbacks on hazardous air pollution limits the same way power plants have, according to Bernhardt, but broad changes in emissions regulations could impact industries across the board. Further greenhouse gas reductions may instead have to come from paper companies deciding to invest in clean technologies and reduce pollution.

“There’s a real role for paper to play in a more sustainable economy,” Bernhardt said. “It really comes down to dollars. Can companies afford it?”",https://themainemonitor.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/ND-Paper-Mill-Rumford.jpg,N,,2025-06-21 07:02:00.666680

These solar projects could equal 15 percent of the solar that’s already been built globally and help triple renewables before the end of the decade.

“Constructing solar on upheaved lands isn’t just land reclamation—it’s a chance to align land restoration, clean energy goals, and local job creation,” Global Energy Monitor (GEM) said in a briefing.

This first-time analysis shows that “coal-to-solar transition offers a rare chance to repair the environmental hazards and eyesores of open pits and generate an estimated 259,700 permanent jobs in the solar industry,” according to GEM.

Some coal-to-solar projects are underway in China. With a 90 operational coal mine-to-solar conversions, there is currently a capacity of 14 GW in construction and another 46 future projects at 9 GW in planning, GEM reported.

“And that’s just the beginning of possibility,” GEM said in a briefing. “While recent closures are the likeliest candidates for new development, plenty of other closed mines may still be in suitable condition. The world has closed over 6,000 coal mines since 2010, most of them in China during the coal industry’s restructuring and in the U.S. where economic headwinds forced operators to slash their 1 billion tonne industry in half.

Since most abandoned coal mines are in close proximity to existing grid infrastructure, they are known as grid-ready sites near substations and transmission lines. According to the report, “96 percent of recently abandoned mines are less than 10 km from the grid and 91 percent are within 10 km of a grid connection point.”

The electric vehicle (EV) giant’s first set of cars have arrived in the country – Model Y rear-wheel drive SUVs shipped from Tesla’s China factory, according to the sources, who asked not to be identified as the information is private, as well as documents seen by Bloomberg News. The Model Y is the world’s largest-selling electric car.

Tesla is set to open its first showroom in Mumbai as early as mid-July, which will be followed by one in New Delhi, according to the sources. It has also imported Supercharger components, car accessories, merchandise and spares from the US, China and the Netherlands, the documents show.

The debut will end a years-long on-again, off-again saga over Tesla’s entry into India – a market Musk has long eyed but held back from entering due to disagreements over tariffs and local manufacturing. The breakthrough in bringing Tesla to India comes after Musk met Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi in the US in February.

Bloomberg News reported in February that Tesla was set to ship a few thousand cars to a port near Mumbai.

Tesla spokespersons did not immediately respond to an e-mail seeking comment on the opening of the India showrooms and the preparations underway.

Premium price

Five Model Y vehicles have already arrived in Mumbai from Tesla’s Shanghai factory, according to documents reviewed by Bloomberg News. The cars were declared at 2.8 million rupees (S$41,558) and attracted more than 2.1 million rupees in import duties – a levy that’s consistent with India’s 70 per cent tariff on fully-built imported cars under US$40,000 plus surcharges, the documents show.

The model is expected to go on sale for more than US$56,000 before taxes and insurance, though Tesla will determine the final sticker price based on its margin and positioning strategy, according to sources familiar with the plans.

That compares with an ex-showroom price of US$44,990 for the same model in the US, which sells for US$37,490 once tax credits are applied.

The premium price tag will likely be a major hurdle to Tesla’s plans as the automaker will need to convince value-driven consumers to open their wallets. EVs account for just over 5 per cent of new passenger vehicle sales in India, but premium cars still represent less than 2 per cent of the market, data with the Indian government’s vehicle registration portal shows.

Beefing up

The company has not appointed a new country head following the departure of Prashanth Menon, but is beefing up hiring across charging, retail and policy teams, according to sources familiar with the matter.

The Model Y imports represent an initial foray into the market and Tesla plans to expand its presence, including offering more models.

It’s leasing warehouse space in Karnataka, in India’s south, and is adding more in Gurugram, outside New Delhi, the sources said.

Tesla executives from other countries are making weekly visits, the sources said, to the Mumbai and New Delhi showrooms, which are in high-profile, luxury business precincts in an effort to attract affluent shoppers.

Apartments in Chapel Hill to allow the developer to run air conditioning units to prevent mold and mildew from taking hold. Triple-digit temperatures and high humidity are forecast for next week, which would create ideal conditions for mold and mildew growth.

The energy company had previously refused to run power to the apartments for low-income residents, citing the developer’s decision to use a single meter for billing purposes, according to a consumer complaint the developer, EMPOWERment Inc., filed with the North Carolina Utilities Commission.

EMPOWERment Inc. Executive Director Delores Bailey had expressed concern about the potential damage mold and mildew could cause to the 10-unit affordable housing complex while Duke Energy and the nonprofit work out differences about the meter.

On Friday, Bailey was hopeful that Duke and her organization will soon reach a permanent settlement about the single meter so that tenants can begin moving in August or September at the latest. EMPOWERment Inc., decided to use one meter for the entire apartment complex to accommodate rooftop solar panels and to reduce energy costs for low-income residents who would rent the apartments.

“Duke has set up the power on a single meter, which is what we asked in the complaint,” Bailey said.

Now that the power has been turned on, Bailey said EMPOWERment Inc.’s contractor, Focus Design Builders, can put the finishing touches on the project, which is more than 85% complete.

The remaining work consists mostly of “punch list” items such as making sure appliances are working and water is running properly, Bailey said. Outside, there is some landscaping and grading left to do, she added.

“They’ve (contractors) have got to come back and do a cleanup of the units and make them livable construction-wise,” Bailey said.

The disagreement between Duke and EMPOWERment Inc., stemmed from differing interpretations of a state law prohibiting master meters for electric and natural gas service in new residential buildings. One section of the law outlines an exception to the prohibition if the tenant and landlord agree in the lease that the cost of the electric service or natural gas service, or both, will be included in rental payments. North Carolina has generally required individual meters and service in tenants’ names for each unit in new residential building constructed on or after Sept. 1, 1977.

Bailey previously told NC Newsline that electric bills would be paid by tenants in monthly rent payments under lease agreements between the nonprofit and tenants. The amount charged would depend on the number of bedrooms in the apartment, she said.

Duke Energy told NC Newsline last week that it cannot comment on specific customers’ accounts. But did provide a statement in an email from spokesman Jeff Brooks:

“Duke Energy service regulations, in compliance with North Carolina law, require residential units to have individual meters, no one master meter covering the entire building. These guidelines are in place to promote consistency in the quality and reliability of service to all customers.”

Rewiring the units so that each has a meter would have cost the nonprofit about $86,000, Bailey said. “We don’t have that,” she said last week. It would take three-to-six months to receive the parts needed to rewire the apartments if the nonprofit decided to go that route, she said.

The Southern Environmental Law Center filed the complaint on behalf of the nonprofit.

The decision is seen as a step towards rebalancing federal regulations and enhancing American energy capabilities.

NAM President and CEO Jay Timmons commented on the development, stating, ""The EPA’s decision to repeal the unworkable power plant rule for existing coal-fired and new natural gas-fired power plants is a critical and welcome step toward rebalanced regulations and American energy dominance. This change will strengthen grid reliability and support manufacturing growth in the United States.""

Timmons emphasized that NAM had consistently warned about the potential negative impacts of the rule. He explained that the rule's requirements were unrealistic, particularly regarding timelines for adopting emerging technologies at a commercial scale. According to Timmons, this would have threatened America's energy security and hindered leadership in advanced technologies such as artificial intelligence.

He further noted that existing natural gas plants are vital for providing affordable and reliable energy necessary for manufacturing operations in the U.S. The now-repealed rule was perceived as an additional burden on an already strained electric grid, risking energy security.

During his first term, Trump revoked an Obama-era version of the California waiver, but in 2022, President Joe Biden reinstated it.
During his presidential campaign last year, Trump promised to “rip up” the California waiver as part of his broader battle to destroy policies intended to combat climate change.
The California waiver can be used to rein in toxic, smog-causing pollutants including soot, nitrogen dioxide and ozone that lead to asthma and lung disease.","WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court ruled Friday that fuel producers may challenge an unusual federal program that lets California set its own limits on vehicle tailpipe emissions to combat climate change.

The question for the justices was whether the challengers had suffered the sort of injuries that gave them standing to sue. When the Supreme Court agreed to hear the case in December, it said it would not address whether the Environmental Protection Agency program granting California a waiver to set its own standards for greenhouse gas emissions was lawful.

A federal law authorizes the EPA to grant California a waiver even though other states and localities are not free to set their own limits. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, in an unsigned opinion last year, rejected the fuel producers’ lawsuit, ruling that the challengers lacked standing. The appeals court reasoned that the challengers would not be directly harmed by the waiver, since its immediate impacts were only on vehicle manufacturers.

Writing for a seven-member majority Friday, Justice Brett Kavanaugh said fuel producers would suffer harm from the waiver and so had standing to sue.

“Without California’s regulations in effect,” he wrote, “manufacturers would likely make more cars powered by gasoline and other liquid fuels, thereby increasing purchases of those fuels.”

Kavanaugh stressed the limits of the ruling. “This case concerns only standing, not the merits,” he wrote. “EPA and California may or may not prevail on the merits in defending EPA’s approval of the California regulations.”

Created under the 1970 Clean Air Act, the California waiver has for decades served as a tool to allow the state, which has historically had the most polluted air in the nation, to enact tougher state-level clean air standards than those set by the federal government.

During his first term, Trump revoked an Obama-era version of the California waiver, but in 2022, President Joe Biden reinstated it. During his presidential campaign last year, Trump promised to “rip up” the California waiver as part of his broader battle to destroy policies intended to combat climate change.

Justices Sonia Sotomayor and Ketanji Brown Jackson each filed dissents. In hers, Jackson wrote that the court should not have decided the issue, given that Trump was likely to once again rescind the waiver and make the issue moot.

The California waiver can be used to rein in toxic, smog-causing pollutants including soot, nitrogen dioxide and ozone that lead to asthma and lung disease. But in the 21st century, California rulemakers have used the waiver to curb emissions including carbon dioxide, the invisible greenhouse gas emitted by burning coal and oil that is the chief cause of global warming.

Because the tailpipes of gasoline-powered cars are the nation’s largest source of carbon dioxide pollution, California’s use of the waiver to address that pollution soon grew into one of the nation’s, and then the world’s, most transformative and ambitious programs to fight climate change by transitioning to electric vehicles.

Vickie Patton, general counsel of the Environmental Defense Fund, emphasized the limits of the Supreme Court’s ruling.

“While the Supreme Court has now clarified who has grounds to bring a challenge to court,” she said in a statement, “the decision does not affect California’s bedrock legal authority to adopt pollution safeguards, nor does alter the lifesaving, affordable, clean cars program itself.”

Rob Bonta, California’s attorney general, said in a statement that the ruling was a disappointment. “The fight for clean air,” he said, “is far from over.”",https://images.seattletimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/06202025_CalTraffic-tzrJune20_tzr_141439.jpg?d=1200x630,N,,2025-06-21 12:16:44.027802

The conservative Supreme Court has repeatedly sided against the EPA and environmental groups in past cases.","The Supreme Court on Friday revived a lawsuit from fuel producers challenging California’s strict vehicle emission rules, allowing the companies to fight an on-again, off-again climate policy that President Donald Trump has previously opposed.

Justice Brett Kavanaugh wrote the opinion for a 7-2 majority. Liberal Justices Sonia Sotomayor and Ketanji Brown Jackson dissented.

“The government generally may not target a business or industry through stringent and allegedly unlawful regulation, and then evade the resulting lawsuits by claiming that the targets of its regulation should be locked out of court as unaffected bystanders,” Kavanaugh wrote.

While the federal government generally sets vehicle emission standards, the Environmental Protection Agency has at times granted a waiver to California – because of its longstanding air-quality problems – to set tougher standards. Given the state’s size, automakers have long hewed to its tighter emissions controls even for cars sold in other states.

That waiver was challenged by Diamond Alternative Energy, a subsidiary of Valero Energy Corporation, and several other companies and groups that advocate on behalf of fuel manufacturers.

Although the fuel producers challenged the waiver itself, the Supreme Court specifically declined to review that question, denying an appeal in December that raised that issue. Instead, the only issue before the justices was whether the companies and trade associations had standing to sue.

California leaders said the ruling was unfortunate, but not a fatal setback for their environmental rules.

“While we are disappointed by the Supreme Court’s decision to allow this case to go forward in the lower court, we will continue to vigorously defend California’s authority under the Clean Air Act,” said California Attorney General Bonta. “Congress intended for California to be able to regulate emissions from new vehicles sold in our state, and we remain firmly committed to advancing and implementing strong standards that safeguard public health and reduce climate pollution. The fight for clean air is far from over.”

A federal appeals court in Washington, DC, concluded that market forces are driving the national push toward electric vehicles far more than California’s tough regulations. Given that, the court ruled that the fuel makers could not proceed with the case.

One of the factors a party must demonstrate to establish standing is redressability, which essentially means that the court’s order can actually fix the problem the plaintiffs have raised. California said that even if courts eliminate the waiver, it wouldn’t help the fuel producers because consumer demand was motivating people to buy electric vehicles on their own.

During oral arguments both conservative and liberal justices seemed to be skeptical of that position, noting that the EPA had pointed to a reduce reliance on fossil fuels as part of the justification for the waiver.

Perhaps sensing a win in their case, the fuel producers advocated for a categorical rule that would have made it easier for companies challenging the federal government to sue over similar decisions in the future.

It’s not clear how much practical impact the court’s decision will have. President Donald Trump seems almost certain to withdraw the waiver, just as he did during his first administration. The waiver was later reinstated by President Joe Biden.

The conservative Supreme Court has repeatedly sided against the EPA and environmental groups in past cases. Last year, the court upended a Biden administration effort to reduce smog and air pollution wafting across state lines. In 2023, the justices cut back on the EPA’s ability to regulate wetlands under the Clean Water Act.

NRG AS A POTENTIAL SITE The NRG power plant has been idle since 2016.","Next month, some experts will be meeting with select Chautauqua County lawmakers regarding the possibility of using the former NRG plant as a micro-nuclear energy site.

To prepare for that meeting, the county’s Department of Planning has developed a resource guide regarding nuclear energy.

This week, the county legislature’s Planning and Economic Development Committee received an eight-page “Nuclear Energy Resource Guide” from the Department of Planning. Each page, when viewed electronically, is linked to numerous sources, giving background.

Some the topics the guide addresses include: defining nuclear energy, the need for next generation alternative renewable energy sources, status of microreactor nuclear technology development, the regulatory environment, projects currently in development around the world, pros and cons of small modular reactors and microreactors as power sources, and the status of repurposing/repowering the NRG Dunkirk station.

The section on the status of repurposing/repowering NRG has a link to Phase I NRG Power Plant Feasibility Study and Alternatives Analysis. That was originally published in June, 2021.

A Phase II and a “white paper” which will offer a realistic approach to the reuse of NRG site by repowering with Small Modular Reactors with natural gas as a bridge, are in process but currently incomplete.

County Planning and Economic Development Director Mark Geise said both the “white paper” and Phase II documents should be available soon. The New York State Energy Research and Development Authority has some final comments before the Phase II document will be available for review.

Geise said in July a professor from the University at Buffalo, who is an expert in nuclear energy, will be at the legislature’s Planning and Economic Development Committee meeting, along with a representative from Phillips Lytle.

WHAT ARE SMALL MODULAR REACTORS

Small modular reactors (SMRs) are advanced nuclear reactors that have a power capacity of up to 300 MWe per unit. This is about one-third of the generating capacity of traditional nuclear power reactors.

SMRs, which can produce a large amount of low-carbon electricity, are:

– Small – physically a fraction of the size of a conventional nuclear power reactor.

– Modular – making it possible for systems and components to be factory-assembled and transported as a unit to a location for installation.

– Reactors – harnessing nuclear fission to generate heat to produce energy.

The International Atomic Energy Agency, one of the sources cited in the county’s Nuclear Energy Resource Guide, notes that given their smaller footprint, SMRs can be sited on locations not suitable for larger nuclear power plants. Prefabricated units of SMRs can be manufactured and then shipped and installed on site, making them more affordable to build than large power reactors, which are often custom designed for a particular location, sometimes leading to construction delays. SMRs offer savings in cost and construction time, and they can be deployed incrementally to match increasing energy demand.

According to the Atomic Energy Agency, in comparison to existing reactors, proposed SMR designs are generally simpler, and the safety concept for SMRs often relies more on passive systems and inherent safety characteristics of the reactor, such as low power and operating pressure. This means that in such cases no human intervention or external power or force is required to shut down systems, because passive systems rely on physical phenomena, such as natural circulation, convection, gravity and self-pressurization. These increased safety margins, in some cases, eliminate or significantly lower the potential for unsafe releases of radioactivity to the environment and the public in case of an accident.

WHAT IS A MICROREACTOR

Microreactors are not defined by their fuel form or coolant. Instead they have three main features: factory fabricated, transportable, and self-adjusting. While microreactor designs vary, most would be able to produce 1-20 MWe of thermal energy that could be used directly as heat or converted to electric power.

The U.S. Department of Energy, which is also one of the resources cited in the county’s Nuclear Energy Resource Guide, states that microreactor designs vary, but most would be able to produce 1-20 megawatts of thermal energy that could be used directly as heat or converted to electric power. They can be used to generate clean and reliable electricity for commercial use or for non-electric applications such as district heating, water desalination and hydrogen fuel production.

The Department of Energy notes that a handful of microreactor designs are under development in the United States, and could be ready to roll out within the next decade.

These compact reactors will be small enough to transport by truck and could help solve energy challenges in a number of areas, ranging from remote commercial or residential locations to military bases.

NRG AS A POTENTIAL SITE

The NRG power plant has been idle since 2016.

At the Planning and Economic Development Committee meeting, Legislator Fred Larson, D-Jamestown, asked Geise that, following next month’s discussion, would it be worthwhile for the legislature to pass a resolution for NYSERDA to consider the former NRG plant in Dunkirk as a small modular nuclear site.

Geise said he hadn’t thought a lot about the value of a resolution, but added, “It probably makes sense.”

In March During Chautauqua County Executive PJ Wendel’s State of the County address he announced that he would be launching a committee that would explore nuclear opportunities, saying, “I strongly feel that micro-nuclear energy could make Chautauqua County a major electricity producer that would not only meet our community’s energy needs but those in the entire region across New York state.”",http://d14e0irai0gcaa.cloudfront.net/www.observertoday.com/images/2017/01/31094407/fb.jpg,N,,2025-06-21 06:01:16.028913

Most clean energy jobs created since the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act have been in Republican districts.","Proposed federal legislation threatens Kansas's booming wind energy industry, which generates over 40% of the state's electricity.

The bill's tight deadlines and restrictions on foreign-made components could halt future wind projects.

While some Senate provisions offer flexibility, the overall impact could stifle clean energy growth and related jobs in Kansas.

Kansas is a national leader in renewable energy. Over 40% of our electricity is generated by wind. This has created thousands of jobs, over $11 billion in capital investment, and tens of millions of dollars in revenue to Kansas communities.

A new federal tax and spending measure in Congress, though, threatens to stifle this success.

The bill, supported by the Trump administration and referred to by some as the “big beautiful bill,” proposes severe cuts to clean energy tax credits that have propelled Kansas to a leadership position in wind energy.

Presented as a way to cut expenses and encourage conventional energies, the legislation risks undermining the very industry that has brought economic development and energy independence to our state.

The House bill includes unrealistic timelines. Developers would have just 60 days after enactment to start construction, and projects must be completed by the end of 2028 to qualify for tax credits. For large wind farms that take years to plan and finance, this is simply unworkable.

These provisions would effectively exclude nearly all future solar and wind projects from federal assistance.

The bill also imposes strict supply chain rules. Beginning in 2026, projects using major components made in China or Russia would be ineligible for tax credits. While meant to reduce dependence on foreign adversaries, the rules ignore reality. Most critical materials are no longer made in the U.S., and substitute supply chains are note yet available. This could stall or stop Kansas wind projects entirely.

It also threatens Kansas' clean energy supply chain. Tax credits for wind factories would expire in 2028, endangering thousands of local jobs. The bill would also end leasing incentives for small-scale solar, making it harder for families and small businesses to access clean energy.

The Senate version tempers some of the House’s provisions but still poses major risks. It keeps restrictions on foreign materials but adds flexibility for publicly traded firms using Chinese-sourced materials. Notably, it allows projects to qualify for credits based on when construction begins, not when they finish.

Still, it phases out wind and solar tax credits through 2028 while ramping up support for nuclear, hydropower, and geothermal.

Resistance to renewable energy is not purely ideological. Concerns about land use, aesthetics, and community effects draw skepticism across the partisan divide. In Kansas, where windmills sweep the prairie, opponents have raised objections about visual impact, noise, and land use.

But Kansas is not a left outlier on clean energy. Most clean energy jobs created since the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act have been in Republican districts. Kansas has benefitted from this boom. These are jobs that can’t be outsourced. They can energize our economy and communities.

This bill threatens to roll back that progress. Instead of locking in a clean, affordable, and jobs-rich energy future, it ties Kansas' renewable energy economy up in red tape and uncertainty.

In 1915, Kansas City Power & Light convinced regulators that stringing copper wires across the prairie would bring “abundant, cheap light for every home”. Today, a data center developer requesting 300 MW for a new facility is instructed to join a five-year interconnection queue. While the physical infrastructure has expanded and loads have become smarter, the core regulatory framework—cost-of-service regulation (COSR)—remains stuck in an era defined by rotary telephones.

This institutional mismatch is not mere trivia. Global data center electricity demand, fueled primarily by artificial intelligence workloads, is projected to nearly double to 945 terawatt-hours (TWh) by 2030, more than Japan’s current annual consumption. Simultaneously, the U.S. anticipates adding 217 gigawatts (GW) of distributed energy resources (DERs) by 2028, accounting for 70% of new generation capacity. Advanced transmission technologies capable of doubling line capacity remain underutilized, leaving 118,821 miles of existing wires untouched. As technology accelerates forward, regulation lags conspicuously behind.

Of course, thoughtful deliberation is justified. Major investments affecting ratepayers over decades deserve rigorous review, and public participation is a fundamental civic virtue of democracy. Yet technological evolution increasingly challenges how and when regulation should be applied to serve the public interest effectively.

Why traditional regulation is technology-contingent

Early 20th-century regulation was built for a capital-intensive, centralized grid designed for universal service and exploiting economies of scale and scope. Three outdated regulatory assumptions now hinder innovation:

Embedded Asset Bias: Utilities profit from tangible infrastructure rather than digital solutions. A transformer can enter the rate base easily; software enabling EV charging flexibility struggles for recognition.

Rate-Case Latency: Multi-year rate-case cycles clash with rapidly evolving technology, such as weekly software updates orchestrating virtual power plants.

Static Customer Classes: Traditional residential, commercial, and industrial categories fail to accommodate modern organizational realities—hyperscale data centers running microgrids or widespread adoption of EVs and solar+storage.

These inherent characteristics render cost-of-service regulation technology-contingent. When the tech stack changes, these rules become brittle constraints rather than flexible safeguards.

The pacing problem and the concept of opportunity cost

Institutional scholars call this lag the pacing problem: law and regulation evolve incrementally while innovation leaps. The cost of that lag is not only higher bills: it is the opportunity cost of foregone futures.

Opportunity cost isn’t static. As society, technology, and economics evolve, the alternatives we give up through stasis gain greater value. Economist Frédéric Bastiat cautioned that policy debates fixate on “the seen” and neglect “the unseen”. Today’s visible benefits—reliable power and stable rates—are increasingly strained. The unseencost is the innovation and value lost by maintaining traditional regulation in a digital, bidirectional future grid.

Mapping the unseen losses

Consider these illustrative examples highlighting how the opportunity cost of traditional regulation materializes:

Dynamic tariffs and transactive energy: Time-differentiated pricing and automated price response remain uncommon, though millions of EVs could arbitrage wholesale price swings and coordinated PV-EV charging would shrink duck curves.

Grid-enhancing technologies: Upgrading half the untouched transmission lines mentioned above could avoid gigawatts of new generation, reducing land use and resource intensity while also accommodating increasing demand from data centers.

DER market innovation: Scaling virtual power plants (VPPs) could save billions annually, yet regulatory frameworks limit market entry; DOE estimates increasing virtual power plant (VPP) capacity from today’s 30-60 GW to 80-160 GW could save $10 billion/year.

Regional economic growth: Delays force data-center firms to contract directly with generators or build their own power plants (make or buy), limiting local economic benefits in less flexible areas.

Capital efficiency: Regulatory incentives promote investment in physical infrastructure while neglecting digital solutions that could reduce system costs significantly.

A rough back-of-the-envelope calculation suggests the opportunity cost’s potential magnitude: If utilities rolled out Conservation Voltage Reduction (CVR) on just half of U.S. distribution feeders, the program would touch roughly 1,930 TWh of the 3,861 TWh that Americans purchased in 2023. Field research finds that CVR trims energy use by 1–4 percent; using a conservative 3 percent estimate delivers an annual savings of about 58 TWh, equivalent to the output of seven large nuclear reactors. Valued at a conservative $40 per MWh, that reduction translates into roughly $2.3 billion each year of savings, achieved through nothing more than smarter set-points on voltage regulators: no new wires, no new permits. This thought experiment in opportunity cost, in the seen and the unseen, suggests that the status quo institutional framework is an invisible tax.

Low-friction, high-return regulatory fixes

Closing the gap need not upend every statute overnight, nor need it abandon the foundational regulatory principles of public interest and consumer protection. A phased approach can chip away at these opportunity costs while preserving regulatory principles. Again, some illustrative examples:

Process tweaks: Enforce a 90-day DER interconnection timeline and mandate open data standards (IEEE 2030.5, Green Button), dramatically reducing queue bottlenecks and empowering third-party solutions. Interconnection queues rather than hardware costs are now the dominant bottleneck for rooftop solar, community storage and flexible EV chargers. DOE’s i2X Roadmap frames the national goal as “cut median study time to months, not years” by 2035. Flexible demand, real-time VPP dispatch and fintech energy tools all depend on machine-readable telemetry and usage data. IEEE 2030.5 provides a secure DER control protocol. California Rule 21 already requires it for smart inverters, and adoption is spreading to Australia and Canada. Green Button Connect My Data (CMD)standardizes interval-billing data sharing; roughly 36 million U.S. customer accounts are now covered.

Incentive realignment: Implement earnings-adjustment mechanisms (EAMs) tied to performance metrics, rewarding utilities for system efficiency and innovation rather than mere capital investment. National Grid’s New York EAMs pay up to $5.9 million for beating DER-utilization and peak-reduction targets; the utility hit the DER metric and collected the full incentive in 2024. This approach requires establishing benchmarks against which to calculate reductions, which is still administrative and artificial but at least aligns utility incentives to reduce total system costs. Hawaii’s performance-based rate plan, implemented in 2021, is a multi-year plan indexing revenue and layering on performance incentives plus an expedited pilot cost-tracker. [At some point I’m going to write a whole post on performance-based regulation, but today is not that day.]

Market access: Enable distribution-level transactive tariffs and fully implement FERC Order 2222, monetizing DER contributions and scaling flexible resources. Time-varying and locational retail prices give DER owners a cash signal that matches local grid stress, converting appliances and EVs into grid assets. DOE’s December 2024 paper, Sourcing DERs for Distribution Grid Services, catalogues jurisdictions shifting from static TOU to dynamic, distribution-targeted rates and local flexibility markets. [I will write a post about transactive energy!] With respect to FERC 2222 on integrating retail aggregators into wholesale markets, wholesale markets cannot mobilize flexible load if aggregators are blocked at the distribution interface.

Structural pilots: Explore independent Distribution System Operators (i-DSOs) and time-boxed regulatory sandboxes, facilitating continuous innovation within controlled, low-risk environments. The Camus Energy DSO framework of “local grid management” is an emerging model to consider. Sandboxes lower entry barriers for novel business models while protecting consumers through scale and duration limits, and protect new ideas from “utility death by pilot”. The State of Utah has implemented a regulatory sandbox that “allows businesses to experiment with products, production methods, or services by temporarily waiving state law and allowing entrepreneurs to determine if customers value products that don’t fit within the state’s current regulatory framework”. In Canada, Ontario’s OEB Innovation Sandbox has issued guidance to dozens of pilots since 2019.

Each example incrementally reduces the unseen opportunity cost, turning potential benefits into tangible economic and societal value. These levers share a common DNA: they price optionality, they bring data to the surface, and they shift utility profit from volume to value creation. None requires a wholesale dismantling of public-utility regulation; each can nest inside existing authority and rate-case calendars. Yet together they chip away at unseen welfare loss: the invisible tax of institutional drag.

Making the invisible visible

Opportunity cost seldom appears explicitly in regulatory deliberations, but it shapes electricity economics significantly. Maintaining yesterday’s regulatory frameworks imposes costs far beyond monetary expenses; it curtails the innovation essential for a resilient, abundant, and low-carbon future. Regulators, legislators, and utilities need not predict every future scenario; they must simply recognize that institutional inertia’s unseen cost accumulates, steadily.

The clock is ticking for Wisconsin homeowners who want to take advantage of tax credits for clean energy and home energy efficiency as Republicans in Congress seek to phase out those incentives.

The most recent federal data shows more than 73,000 families in Wisconsin have taken advantage of the tax credits. However, those incentives would disappear as soon as the end of this year under the House budget bill and six months after a bill is passed in the Senate version introduced this week.

Republicans have taken aim at the expanded tax credits under the Inflation Reduction Act, which were intended to combat climate change, as they seek to pay for President Donald Trump’s $4.5 trillion tax cuts.

Kevin Kane, chief economist with Green Homeowners United, said the repeal will make it more difficult for middle- and low-income families to make home upgrades or install rooftop solar.

“I think there’s going to be a mad dash for people to try to use it,” Kane said.

Tax credits provide a dollar-for-dollar reduction on what people owe in federal taxes. Residents can claim 30 percent of the cost for heat pumps up to $2,000 each year and up to $1,200 each year for insulation, air sealing and ventilation. They can also claim 30 percent of the cost to install geothermal heating, solar panels and battery storage.

In Wisconsin, families claimed an average of more than $5,100 on clean energy investments like rooftop solar, according to the most recent federal data. On home improvements, they claimed an average of $761 on things like heat pumps, air conditioners and windows.

Angie Kochanski, director of business development at Arch Solar, said they’re expecting that the elimination of tax credits will dramatically shrink the market for residential solar installations.

“We’ll adjust. It’s going to be a new era, and there’s going to be a smaller market of buyers, and we’re all going to have to work a little bit harder,” Kochanski said.

Solar companies have already been facing a dip in residential solar installations, which declined 31 percent last year due in part to higher interest rates.

Arch Solar installed solar on about 240 homes in southeastern Wisconsin last year, and the company anticipates that number could grow to 300 homes this year as homeowners try to act before tax credits disappear.

Rooftop solar installations could drop by half next year

Cory Neeley, executive director of SolarShare Wisconsin Cooperative, said the repeal is a huge slap in the face for businesses that have been scaling up their operations.

“These companies are going to have a hard time planning for any additional work. They’re also just going to see a huge glut of solar panels on the market,” Neeley said. “Because this market existed, and then all of a sudden, there’s no demand for it.”

Under ideal circumstances, Kochanski added, contractors need around six to 10 weeks to obtain permits or approval from utilities to connect with the grid.

Energy data firm Ohm Analytics estimates residential solar installations could fall by half next year. Wisconsin labor and clean energy advocates have said repealing the tax credits could jeopardize thousands of jobs.

Kathy Kuntz, director of the Dane County Office of Energy and Climate Change, said it’s not the time to sit on the fence if residents and businesses are thinking about home energy upgrades.

She said installation of solar and energy efficient appliances helps reduce costs for homeowners and demand on the grid at a time when the nation has seen increased electricity demand from data centers.

“I’m just concerned that it’s the wrong moment to slow down the consumer and business investment in clean energy given what else is going on with the grid,” Kuntz said.

All Wisconsin Republicans in the U.S. House voted for the budget bill and its provisions to repeal tax credits. In a social media post Tuesday, Republican Rep. Tom Tiffany urged people to tell their senators not to “water down” the House bill.

“We must terminate the IRA and stop wasting taxpayer dollars on wind and solar subsidies,” Tiffany said.

In Green Bay, the city’s sustainability commission unanimously passed a resolution Thursday to support the retention of clean energy funding and tax credits. Ahead of the vote, the commission’s chair Christa Kananen said the city’s clean energy plan relies heavily on leveraging tax credits to reach its goal to become carbon-neutral by 2050.

“The loss of that federal spending would significantly impact the plan that’s already been outlined and is in progress,” Kananen said. “It would, at a minimum, slow it down significantly.”

As tax breaks seem likely to fade away, Kuntz noted Wisconsin residents can still take advantage of home rebates under the Home Efficiency Rebate, or HOMES, program for installing insulation and energy efficient heating and cooling systems.

Wisconsin received $149 million to administer home rebates under the program and the Home Electrification and Appliance Rebate, or HEAR, program for households installing heat pumps and other electrical appliances. That funding is not in jeopardy, and it’s expected to last another two to three years.

Such strategic repositioning occurs amidst a downturn in the battery recycling market, precipitated by reduced EV demand and declining prices of battery components like nickel, lithium, and manganese.
Consequently, SungEel HiTech, one of the few battery recycling firms on the Kosdaq index, reports decreasing profits and cash flow for two consecutive years.
A projected recycling venture between SungEel HiTech and SK Innovation, publicized in 2022, is now deferred indefinitely.
Analysts emphasize the necessity of engaging in recycling to maintain industry competitiveness, as regulatory demands for recycled materials intensify worldwide.","South Korea's top industrial leaders are actively expanding their roles in the electric vehicle (EV) battery recycling industry as the market, though sluggish now, is expected to become critical in the future. On June 20, the Korea Herald reported that LG Energy Solution, the country's premier battery maker, has initiated joint ventures in Europe and the United States. They are partnering with France's Derichebourg and Toyota Tsusho Co., respectively.

This development signifies LG's inaugural direct entry into the recycling sector within these pivotal markets. Similarly, SK Ecoplant, part of the SK Group, is broadening its European operations in the Netherlands. In particular, the facility is set to enhance its annual processing capacity by 25,000 metric tons of black mass, with plans to complete the expansion by 2025, as disclosed by a South Korean English-language publication.

In a separate move, Posco-GS Eco Materials, a joint venture established by Posco Holdings and GS Energy, has secured complete ownership of its recycling entity Posco HY Clean Metal after buying China's Huayou Cobalt's 35 percent stake. Such strategic repositioning occurs amidst a downturn in the battery recycling market, precipitated by reduced EV demand and declining prices of battery components like nickel, lithium, and manganese.

Prices of lithium carbonate have dramatically declined from 450 Chinese yuan per kilogram earlier in 2023 to roughly 50 yuan, while nickel's price has dropped from over USD 31,000 per ton to about USD 20,000. Consequently, SungEel HiTech, one of the few battery recycling firms on the Kosdaq index, reports decreasing profits and cash flow for two consecutive years.

A projected recycling venture between SungEel HiTech and SK Innovation, publicized in 2022, is now deferred indefinitely. Additionally, SK Ecoplant's planned expansions in Gyeongju, North Gyeongsang Province, and Kentucky have shown minimal advancement recently. Industry experts in Korea predict a sharp uptick in end-of-life EV batteries, often around a decade post initial use, coinciding with the global sales boom of EVs in the 2010s.

EVs' rising market penetration hints at the battery recycling sector's potential growth, valued at USD 8 billion in 2022, and anticipated to surge to USD 53.57 billion by 2030, according to SNE Research. Analysts emphasize the necessity of engaging in recycling to maintain industry competitiveness, as regulatory demands for recycled materials intensify worldwide.

The European Union mandates by 2031 that EV batteries must include minimum recycled metal percentages: 16 percent cobalt, 85 percent lead, 6 percent lithium, and nickel. These figures will rise by 2036. On the other hand, the U.S. Inflation Reduction Act restricts EV tax credits for batteries sourced from ""foreign entities of concern,"" urging manufacturers to primarily use domestic, recycled materials.

""This program will help deliver clean, affordable electricity to families and businesses across Sri Lanka,"" said David Sislen, World Bank Division Director for the Maldives, Nepal and Sri Lanka.
A core feature of the initiative includes $40 million in World Bank Group guarantees in the first phase.
“Sri Lanka’s energy transition is an opportunity to expand clean energy, improve energy access, and build long-term resilience,” said Imad N Fakhoury, IFC's Regional Director for South Asia.
By using the full breadth of the World Bank Group's tools - financing, knowledge, and private sector partnerships - the World Bank Group is helping Sri Lanka expand energy access, attract private investment, and lay the foundation to power Sri Lanka’s long-term economic growth.","WASHINGTON, June 20, 2025—The World Bank Group today approved a new $150 million program to support Sri Lanka’s move toward clean, reliable, and affordable energy. The program—Secure, Affordable, and Sustainable Energy for Sri Lanka—will support the country reduce its reliance on expensive fossil fuel imports and accelerate its shift toward solar and wind.

""This program will help deliver clean, affordable electricity to families and businesses across Sri Lanka,"" said David Sislen, World Bank Division Director for the Maldives, Nepal and Sri Lanka. “We are excited to work with both the government and private sector to make this shared vision a reality.”

The program will support new solar and wind energy projects that will add 1 gigawatt of clean electricity to the grid – bringing Sri Lanka closer to its goal of generating 70 percent of its electricity from renewable sources by 2030. The program is also expected to mobilize more than $800 million in private investment, helping to lower electricity costs and improve reliability for families and businesses.

A core feature of the initiative includes $40 million in World Bank Group guarantees in the first phase. This will help reduce risks for private investors and energy producers. It is targeted to derisk payment obligations from Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB), thus improving investors’ confidence and attract financing on more favorable terms. The World Bank Group’s private sector arms - the International Finance Corporation (IFC) and the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA) – will provide complementary support through direct investments and political risk insurance.

“Sri Lanka’s energy transition is an opportunity to expand clean energy, improve energy access, and build long-term resilience,” said Imad N Fakhoury, IFC's Regional Director for South Asia. “Achieving this requires close collaboration and investment from both public and private sectors. As one World Bank Group, we are uniquely positioned to enable and mobilize private capital and foster partnerships that deliver affordable, reliable electricity while driving sustainable growth and creating jobs that strengthen Sri Lanka’s economy and expand opportunities for its people.”

MIGA will support the program by offering political risk insurance to help reduce uncertainty for international investors.

“Investors need confidence to take bold steps in new markets,” said Muhamet Fall, Director of Operation with MIGA. “Our guarantees will help de-risk projects and attract the private capital needed to scale up clean energy in Sri Lanka.”

The program also supports the upgrades to Sri Lanka’s electricity grid, enabling it to better handle renewable energy and reduce power outages. This modernization will help stabilize electricity prices and improve energy access for households and businesses across the country.

In addition, the initiative will provide technical assistance to the CEB to strengthen planning, procurement, and operations, and supports government-led reforms to improve competitiveness, utility management, and regulatory oversight.

Now as secretary of energy, Wright will be responsible for overseeing solar energy research and development, solar energy tax credits, and the Energy Department’s clean energy loan program, which has included solar projects.
A 1991 paper he copublished with other researchers focused on electrical engineering, but it made no mention of applications for solar energy.
In July 2022, Liberty Energy invested $10 million in Fervo Energy, a geothermal energy company.
This marked Liberty Energy’s first-ever foray into solar energy, according to Tom Curran, a senior securities analyst who covers Liberty Energy at Seaport Research Partners.","During Chris Wright’s January 2025 confirmation hearing as secretary of energy, his home state senator, John Hickenlooper (D-CO), expressed concern about the pace of climate change. Wright agreed that climate change was a serious issue, citing his twenty-year career in diverse energy sectors, including renewables.

“The solution to climate change is to evolve our energy system,” he told Hickenlooper. “I’ve worked on that most — all of my career, again in nuclear and solar, and geothermal and new battery storage technology now.”

This is far from the first time Wright has noted he’s worked in solar. Wright — the former founder, chief executive, and chair of Colorado-based Liberty Energy, one of the country’s top fracking companies — has claimed in public appearances, organizational biographies, on his LinkedIn profile, and even formal testimony before Congress that he spent parts of his career working in solar energy.

But despite such claims, there’s no evidence that Wright ever studied, invested in, or worked in solar energy, according to a Lever investigation of Wright’s school records, corporate disclosures, and several close followers of his career and companies.

In fact, the entire notion that Wright has ever worked in solar energy exclusively stems from vague public claims he’s made on the matter. The one time he elaborated on this notion, he submitted a résumé with what appears to be false information about his solar experience to Congress, the Lever found.

In response to requests for comment from Wright and the Department of Energy, an agency spokesperson noted in an email, “During his decades-long career working in the energy sector, Wright worked with and advised on a variety of different energy sources and technologies, including oil, natural gas, nuclear (including [small modular reactors]), solar, and geothermal.”

The spokesperson did not respond to repeated follow-up requests for evidence supporting Wright’s claims that he studied and worked in solar energy.

One expert says Wright’s allegedly false claims about his experience in solar energy suggest an insincere interest in using the Energy Department to support, or even treat fairly, the country’s $70.3 billion solar energy industry.

Now as secretary of energy, Wright will be responsible for overseeing solar energy research and development, solar energy tax credits, and the Energy Department’s clean energy loan program, which has included solar projects. All of these programs are under threat from Wright and the Trump administration’s vague and far-reaching emergency powers, as well as Congress’ proposed “Big Beautiful Budget” bill.

These developments come as scientists urge the United States to quickly transition its energy system away from fossil fuels and toward renewables like solar — or else face existential, ecological threats.

“Wind and solar are seen as being primarily promoted by Democrats and entities that support Democrats, and Trump is attacking all policies that he perceives as supporting his political opponents,” said Tyson Slocum, energy program director at consumer advocacy group Public Citizen. “This is just crass politics.”

Nothing but Hot Air?

Wright studied undergraduate mechanical engineering at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology from 1981 to 1985, according to the school. He enrolled at MIT as an undergraduate student “specifically to work on [nuclear] fusion energy,” Wright testified before the Democrat-led House Select Committee on the Climate Crisis in 2019.

His undergraduate thesis focused on the use of semiviscous materials to dampen vibrations of stiff, constrained materials. This work could have applications in spacecraft, Wright argued in the thesis. After he graduated, Wright pivoted to study electrical engineering at the University of California, Berkeley, school records state.

“As a graduate student at UC Berkeley, Chris Wright developed regulating charging circuits to connect batteries to solar in order to power remote instruments,” a Department of Energy spokesperson told the Lever over email, but failed to provide evidence supporting the claim.

In fall 1985, Wright enrolled for just one semester at Berkeley. Berkeley did not maintain records of Wright’s academic coursework, research, or the classes he taught; the school could only confirm he was employed as a teaching assistant that semester in the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science. Like any electrical engineering student, Wright could have spent a week learning about solar or teaching it in a single class, but absent hard evidence, there is no way to be sure.

In February 1986, Wright returned to MIT, where he would remain until January 1988 before dropping out, the school confirmed. A 1991 paper he copublished with other researchers focused on electrical engineering, but it made no mention of applications for solar energy.

More than forty academics who were enrolled in or taught graduate school at either Berkeley or MIT in those years either did not respond or denied recalling Wright, much less what classes he took or what he researched.

According to a 2019 résumé Wright submitted to Congress, he published fifty-seven research articles between 1989 and 2019, most of which were presented at fossil fuel industry conferences, symposia, and meetings. Besides his first two articles on spacecraft and power converters, all other research has been directly related to fossil fuel extraction.

According to his 2019 résumé, from 1985 to 1989, Wright worked at Hunter Geophysics, a company based in California’s Bay Area, while he was still enrolled at MIT for graduate work on the other side of the country. It is unclear, and a spokesperson for the Energy Department declined to comment on, how Wright accomplished both decades before the remote-work era.

On the Case

Wright’s known career consists entirely of working in or leading fracking companies. The few recent investments that he or his companies have made in alternative energy sources like advanced nuclear, geothermal, and battery power have been widely publicized, but none of them are related to solar energy.

In August 2019, Wright suggested otherwise when he appeared before a now-dismantled House Select Committee on the Climate Crisis in a hearing focused on renewable energy solutions in Colorado. At the hearing, he submitted a résumé claiming that immediately after ending his graduate work at Berkeley, he joined Hunter Geophysics. At that firm, Wright claimed that he “designed charging circuits for solar panels to remotely and continuously power electronic monitoring equipment.”

But Hunter Geophysics never did any work related to solar energy, according to Bruce Braden, the now-defunct company’s chief financial officer. Instead, the Mountain View, California–based company was an early pioneer in fracking technology.

Not every congressional hearing is under oath, but Wright filled out a standard “Truth in Testimony” disclosure before his appearance asking about any potential conflict of interest (he didn’t list any). Even if congressional witnesses aren’t under oath, “they are supposed to be truthful when they give comments, because that could be considered lying to Congress,” noted a staffer for the now-defunct climate committee’s chair, Rep. Kathy Castor (D-FL). It is unclear whether Wright was under oath during that 2019 hearing, and the staffer did not respond to additional questions.

Wright and Braden would go on to cofound two fracking companies together, Pinnacle Technologies and Stroud Energy, Braden said. Both were sold in 2006. Braden isn’t aware of any solar energy work that Wright has ever done.

In 2010, Wright started Denver-based Liberty Resources, and in 2011, he started Denver-based Liberty Oilfield Services. Both are types of fracking companies; Liberty Resources, like ExxonMobil or Chevron, is an exploration and drilling company, while Liberty Oilfield Services, like Halliburton, fracks, pumps, and transports the oil and gas. Other companies Wright worked for or helmed — Resources Engineering Systems and Liberty Midstream Solutions — were also fracking companies with no involvement in solar.

Liberty Oilfield Services went public in 2018, and in 2022, the company changed its name to Liberty Energy.

In July 2022, Liberty Energy invested $10 million in Fervo Energy, a geothermal energy company. In September 2022, the company invested in Natron Energy, a sodium-ion battery manufacturer. In January 2024, Liberty announced an investment in Oklo, an alternative nuclear-fission company that until recently had Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, as its chairman.

Wright joined Oklo’s board and bought company shares in July 2024 before becoming energy secretary. Wright has not submitted a Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) disclosure noting he has sold those shares, even as his office recently maintained a $575 million loan in the small modular nuclear reactor industry while cutting loans to other carbon-cutting sectors.

Prior to joining the government, Wright also owned shares in EMX Royalties, which acquires mineral mining royalties, including for precious, battery, and base minerals, according to his executive branch ethics disclosure form. Wright was also a director of Urban Solution Group, a private company that creates physical barriers, processes permitting, and provides public relations help for oil and gas drilling companies seeking to work near residential areas, according to his executive branch financial disclosures. Neither of these companies work in the solar energy industry.

On his executive branch disclosure, Wright also listed many nonprofits, foundations, and trade groups for which he serves as a board member, including fossil fuel advocacy organizations like Western Energy Alliance and the Domestic Energy Producers Alliance as well as dark money-funded free-market think tanks like Property and Environmental Research Center and the Pacific Research Institute. None of these organizations are involved in solar energy.

In January 2024, Wright’s fracking company Liberty Energy announced the creation of the Bettering Human Lives Foundation with a $1 million seed donation, which lists Wright as its principal officer and Anne Hyre, Wright’s sister-in-law, as its executive director and sole employee. So far, the new and small nonprofit exclusively “supports” liquid petroleum gas nonprofits and “social enterprise” companies in Ghana and Kenya.

Wright also serves as the managing member of four holding companies, his executive branch disclosure stated. Three are used as holding companies for his shares in other endeavors: an oil and gas production company called Urban Solutions Group, and an IPO shell company. But it is unclear what the fourth shell company, Sol 2 LLC, is for. Wright has held “one unreportable asset” in the LLC since May 2021 and is a comanaging member of the Cherry Hills, Colorado, company. Does “Sol” stand for solar? The Energy Department spokesperson would not say.

On the now-scrubbed corporate biographies of Wright at Liberty Energy and EMX Royalty Corporation, both publicly traded companies, Wright’s biographies do not mention him working in solar energy. Public companies that state false information could be liable for securities fraud.

Three entities affiliated with Wright — the Domestic Energy Producers Alliance, Liberty Energy, and Nomad Proppant, LLC — are party to a battle-royale federal lawsuit to kill a Biden-era rule requiring publicly traded companies to disclose some of their climate risks and greenhouse gas emissions. The rule would make greenwashing or other false statements about climate change a securities law violation. The rule and the litigation have both been paused but not thrown out — even as the Trump SEC has exited the litigation — because blue-state attorneys general intervened, asking the court to reject arguments that the rule exceeded SEC authority.

Why Lie?

Wright has been a pioneer in fracking technology. He has worked in oil and gas as far back as 1985, started over half a dozen fracking companies, and has authored dozens of papers and presentations on oil and gas industry research. However, the solar endeavor he described to Congress in 2019, Hunter Geophysics, appears to be a fabrication.

Even if he took a class on solar at Berkeley, or Sol 2 LLC represents a minimal investment in solar, for him to at times give such circumstances equal billing as his four decades of investment in oil and gas is, at a minimum, deeply misleading.

Why would a fossil fuel mogul like Wright fabricate experience in solar? Possibly because Wright likes to fashion himself as not just another fossil fuel executive. According to his LinkedIn bio, Wright is a “tech nerd turned entrepreneur,” a black turtleneck on an oil rig. Chris Wright doesn’t mention solar when he needs to green wash his career; he mentions it when he needs to green wash himself.

“Secretary Wright has been sharply critical of renewable energy and solar, specifically that it is unreliable and that it is not an advantageous energy source in comparison to fossil fuels,” said Slocum at Public Citizen. None of these criticisms are factual, Slocum added.

Solar energy’s benefits are myriad, according to the Department of Energy’s own website: In addition to lowering energy bills, solar energy is plentiful, clean, raises home values, and reduces water usage and greenhouse gas emissions. It can also serve as a useful way to get energy to remote communities and places with expensive electric grids, the agency has asserted.

The Department of Energy currently oversees an energy loan portfolio that includes eleven solar energy projects with issued loans worth $10 billion and one conditional commitment worth $62 million, according to its website. Five of the project loans total over $1 billion.

On climate and energy policy, Wright’s approach is no different from any past Republican Secretary of Energy, said Slocum: manipulate all possible regulatory authority to artificially prop up fossil fuels.

Wright, for example, has reportedly lobbied Congress to extend Inflation Reduction Act clean energy tax credits for nuclear and geothermal, but not for wind and solar.

Wright’s greenwashing of his own career appears to have paid political dividends: The Senate confirmed Wright, 59-38. No Republican voted against him, and seven Democrats and one Democratic-affiliated independent voted for him, including both of Colorado’s Democratic senators, John Hickenlooper and Michael Bennet.

Neither Hickenlooper nor Bennet responded to multiple requests for comment.

Wright left Liberty Energy on February 3, 2025, so he could become the secretary of energy. A month after Wright left, on March 5, 2025, Liberty Energy acquired IMG Energy Solutions, a diverse energy company that provides “microgrids,” which are on-site, modular natural gas plants accompanied by grids of solar arrays. The Pittsburgh International Airport is currently powered by an IMG hybrid gas/solar grid.

This marked Liberty Energy’s first-ever foray into solar energy, according to Tom Curran, a senior securities analyst who covers Liberty Energy at Seaport Research Partners. Two days later, Wright sold the last of his shares in Liberty Energy.",https://images.jacobinmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/20144902/GettyImages-2209243919.jpg,N,,2025-06-21 13:09:42.824136

The Ontario government has green-lit Ontario Power Generation to build the first of four Small Modular Reactors (SMRs) at the Darlington New Nuclear Project site.
All four SMRS are to be located next to the Darlington nuclear power plant east of Toronto and are expected to be running by 2035.","Ontario has always been a clean-energy giant, deriving half of its electricity from nuclear power and 25 percent from hydroelectricity.

Now, the central Canadian province is preparing to expand its nuclear energy capacity to meet rising electricity demand.

Under a strategy released June 12 called ‘Energy for Generations’, ""nuclear power will continue to serve as the backbone of the province's electricity system providing the 24/7 baseload power the province's economy requires.”

Electricity demand is expected to rise by 75 percent by 2050. The framework aligns with previously announced nuclear spending, including CAD$20.9 billion for small modular reactors (SMRs), and could total 10,000 megawatts of additional nuclear capacity costing more than $150 billion.

According to World Nuclear News, Energy for Generations builds on a 2024 vision paper setting out a comprehensive assessment of the challenges facing the province's energy system, including the need to meet rapidly growing demand, electrify key sectors, and maintain reliability, all while keeping energy rates down.

“With this blueprint, Ontario has the opportunity to lead the world in both small and large nuclear development,” the publication quotes Ontario Power Generation’s president and CEO Nicolle Butcher. ""Coupled with our expanding hydroelectric portfolio and other low-carbon technologies, the growth of a reliable provincial grid will also boost economies and strengthen our energy security.”

To accomplish its goal, the province plans to refurbish existing nuclear power plants. Bruce units 1 and 2 have already been refurbished and were returned to service more than a decade ago. A second refurbishment of those units “remains an available option that can be explored under the existing contract between Bruce Power and the IESO,” Ontario's Independent Electricity System Operator, the plan said.

Ontario is also looking at new large-scale nuclear generation. World Nuclear News states: Pre-development work has already begun to site the first large-scale nuclear build in Ontario since 1993 at the existing Bruce nuclear site; OPG is advancing early-stage planning for new large-scale nuclear generation at Wesleyville, Port Hope.

The Ontario government has green-lit Ontario Power Generation to build the first of four Small Modular Reactors (SMRs) at the Darlington New Nuclear Project site.

OPG says it will be the first commercial grid-scale SMR in North America, with an in-service target date of 2030, and the first new nuclear build in Ontario in more than three decades.

Ontario government support for the CAD$20.9 billion project came after OPG received a Licence to Construct in April from the Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission. The first SMR would cost $7.7 billion. All four SMRS are to be located next to the Darlington nuclear power plant east of Toronto and are expected to be running by 2035.

SMRs are constructed with prefabricated modules and can be transported by truck or by rail — making them ideal for remote locations where a conventional reactor would not be feasible. Another important advantage is they are less likely to overheat, because their small cores produce less heat than those of large reactors. They also have fewer moving parts, including coolant pumps, which reduces the likelihood of failures that could cause an accident. The fuel, steam and generator are all in one vessel.

Their small size and lower cost compared to large nuclear reactors makes Small Modular Reactors more versatile, meaning significantly more utilities will be able to use them.

Meanwhile, Ontario wants to expand power transmission to supply major mining developments including critical minerals projects in the remote Ring of Fire region. Industrial demand for electricity is forecast to rise 50 percent in the next five years.

With provincial trade barriers poised to fall — a goal of the new federal government elected in April — The Northern Miner reports Ontario could source uranium from Saskatchewan’s Athabasca Basin, a global hotspot for uranium production.

Ontario’s plan also proposes building new east-west transmission corridors to support energy security and critical minerals development.

Analysts suggest the nuclear expansion could sustain long-term uranium demand, despite challenges, including Ontario’s lack of uranium enrichment facilities, reliance on foreign suppliers, and the risk of cost overruns and delays that have affected other SMR projects.

The Senate bill provides a smaller, initial bump-up to $2,200, but the bump is permanent, with the credit amount indexed for inflation beginning next year.
The Senate bill includes no sunset, making the tax breaks permanent, which was a key priority of powerful trade groups such as the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.
Under the Senate bill, the tax credits for clean energy and home energy efficiency would still be phased out, but less quickly than under the House bill.
The Senate bill excludes the proposed fees.","WASHINGTON (AP) — House and Senate Republicans are taking slightly different approaches when it comes to the tax cuts that lawmakers are looking to include in their massive tax and spending cuts bill.

Republicans in the two chambers don't agree on the size of a deduction for state and local taxes. And they are at odds on such things as allowing people to use their health savings accounts to help pay for their gym membership, or whether electric vehicle and hybrid owners should have to pay an annual fee.

The House passed its version shortly before Memorial Day. Now the Senate is looking to pass its version.

While the two bills are similar on the major tax provisions, how they work out their differences in the coming weeks will determine how quickly they can get a final product over the finish line. President Donald Trump is pushing to have the legislation on his desk by July 4th.

Here’s a look at some of the key differences between the two bills:

The child tax credit currently stands at $2,000 per child.

The House bill temporarily boosts the child tax credit to $2,500 for the 2025 through 2028 tax years, roughly the length of President Donald Trump's second term. It also indexes the credit amount for inflation beginning in 2027.

The Senate bill provides a smaller, initial bump-up to $2,200, but the bump is permanent, with the credit amount indexed for inflation beginning next year.

Trump promised on the campaign trail that he would seek to end income taxes on tips, overtime and Social Security benefits. Also, he would give car buyers a new tax break by allowing them to deduct the interest paid on auto loans.

The House and Senate bills incorporate those promises with temporary deductions lasting from the 2025 through 2028 tax years, but with some differences.

The House bill creates a deduction on tips for those working in jobs that have customarily received tips. The House also provides for a deduction for overtime that’s equal to the amount of OT a worker has earned.

The Senate bill comes with more restrictions. The deduction for tips is limited to $25,000 per taxpayer and the deduction for overtime is limited to $12,500 per taxpayer.

The House and Senate bills both provide a deduction of up to $10,000 for interest paid on loans for vehicles made in the United States.

And on Social Security, the bills don't directly touch the program. Instead, they grant a larger tax deduction for Americans age 65 and older. The House sets the deduction at $4,000. The Senate sets it at $6,000.

Both chambers include income limits over which the new deductions begin to phase out.

The caps on state and local tax deductions, known in Washington as the SALT cap, now stand at $10,000.

The House bill, in a bid to win over Republicans from New York, California and New Jersey, lifts the cap to $40,000 per household with incomes of less than $500,000. The credit phases down for households earning more than $500,000.

The Senate bill keeps the cap at $10,000. That's a non-starter in the House, but Republicans in the two chambers will look to negotiate a final number over the coming weeks that both sides can accept.

The House bill prohibits states from establishing new provider taxes or increasing existing taxes. These are taxes that Medicaid providers, such as hospitals, pay to help states finance their share of Medicaid costs. In turn, the taxes allow states to receive increased federal matching funds while generally holding providers harmless through higher reimbursements that offset the taxes paid.

Such taxes now are effectively capped at 6%. The Senate looks to gradually lower that threshold for states that have expanded their Medicaid populations under the Affordable Care Act, or “Obamacare,” until it reaches 3.5% in 2031, with exceptions for nursing homes and intermediate care facilities.

Industry groups have warned that limiting the ability of states to tax providers may lead to some states making significant cuts to their Medicaid programs as they make up for the lost revenue in other ways. The Medicaid provision could be a flashpoint in the coming House and Senate negotiations. Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., was highly critical of the proposed Senate changes.

“This needs a lot of work. It’s really concerning and I’m really surprised by it,” he said. “Rural hospitals are going to be in bad shape.”

The House bill would allow companies for five years to fully deduct equipment purchases and domestic research and development expenses. The Senate bill includes no sunset, making the tax breaks permanent, which was a key priority of powerful trade groups such as the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.

Republicans in both chambers are looking to scale back the clean energy tax credits enacted through then-President Joe Biden's climate law. It aimed to boost the nation’s transition away from planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions toward renewable energy such as wind and solar power.

Under the Senate bill, the tax credits for clean energy and home energy efficiency would still be phased out, but less quickly than under the House bill. Still, advocacy groups fear that the final measure will threaten hundreds of thousands of jobs and drive up household energy costs.

The House bill would allow millions of Americans to use their health savings accounts to pay for gym memberships, with a cap of $500 for single taxpayers and $1,000 for joint filers. The Senate bill doesn't include such a provision.

The House reinstates a charitable deduction for non-itemizers of $150 per taxpayer. The Senate bill increases that deduction for donations to $1,000 per taxpayer.

Republicans in the House bill included a new annual fee of $250 for EV owners and $100 for hybrid owners that would be collected by state motor vehicle departments. The Senate bill excludes the proposed fees.

The company has entered into a five-year agreement to purchase Green-e’s certified renewable energy certificates (REC), which are expected to offset 100% of its electricity consumption in North America.
By sourcing Green-e’s RECs, Yokogawa ensures its energy use is matched by electricity generated from renewable sources such as wind and solar.
The REC initiative is one of several sustainability measures Yokogawa is implementing to meet its long-term, environmental, social and governance (ESG) objectives.
“Our renewable energy purchase is a critical part of our sustainability roadmap,” says Bhavin Patel, EVP of Yokogawa’s North American operations.","Yokogawa Corp. of America reported May 22 that it’s launching a long-term, renewable energy initiative as part of its sustainability strategy.

The contract took effect on Apr. 1 and runs through Mar. 31, 2030. It will offset approximately 6,000 megawatt-hours (MWh) of electricity use per year. This is equivalent to Yokogawa’s total annual energy consumption at its North American operations.

By sourcing Green-e’s RECs, Yokogawa ensures its energy use is matched by electricity generated from renewable sources such as wind and solar. This move underscores the company’s commitment to environmental responsibility, and aligns with broader corporate goals to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and support the transition to a low-carbon economy.

Environmental Justice in Regulatory Actions The EPA proposed a suite of regulatory actions in 2024, several with Environmental Justice implications.
Environmental Justice in the ABA In 2021 the ABA House of Delegates adopted Resolution 513, which committed the ABA to advancing environmental justice principles and considerations in its programs, policies, and activities, with the ABA Board of Governors concurrently establishing the “Environmental Justice Task Force” (EJTF) to lead implementation efforts.","I. Environmental Justice Executive Orders

In 2024 the Biden-Harris Administration, expanded on the supporting frameworks of Executive Order 14008 - Tackling the Climate Crisis at Home and Abroad (2021) and Executive Order 14096 - Revitalizing our Nation’s Commitment to Environmental Justice for All (2023), establishing tools and strategies to address inequities experienced in environmental justice communities and communities throughout the country.

In late 2023 and throughout 2024, many federal agencies held virtual community engagement listening sessions, as departments accepted public comments and input in drafting their environmental justice strategic plans. The Department of Justice (DOJ), Department of Interior(DOI), Department of Agriculture (USDA), Department of Energy (DOE), the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), and the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) each released updated Environmental Justice Strategic Plans in 2024. In May 2024, President Biden announced twelve additional members to the White House Environmental Justice Advisory Council, created by E.O. 14008.

In May 2024, the White House Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) issued the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) Implementing Regulations Revisions Phase 2 rule. The Phase 2 rule directs agencies to consider “disproportionate and adverse effects on communities with environmental justice concerns” when determining the appropriate level of NEPA review, considering alternatives, and analyzing the proposed action’s environmental impacts. Soon thereafter, twenty states filed a lawsuit against the White House CEQ attempting to block the rulemaking. On November 12, 2024, in Marin Audubon Society v. FAA, a divided panel of D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals rejected the rules as “ultra vires” and are non-binding on federal agencies.

II. Environmental Justice Screening Tools

On April 23, 2024, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) released their Environmental Justice Clearinghouse website providing an online collection of environmental justice resources to assist stakeholders. In July, the Biden Administration updated the Environmental Justice Scorecard to Phase Two. The Environmental Justice Scorecard is a government-wide assessment of Federal agencies’ efforts to advance environmental justice, providing transparency and accountability to the federal government’s efforts to secure environmental justice for all. Additionally in July, EPA updated the EJScreen tool to EJSCREEN 2.3, adding data on nitrogen dioxide levels, drinking water non-compliance, Superfund sites boundaries, extreme heat, private drinking wells, air toxics cancer risk, and EJ grants from EPA’s Office of Environmental Justice and External Civil Rights (OEJECR).

III. Environmental Justice in Environmental Enforcement

In 2024, approximately 50% of EPA inspections and enforcement cases addressed facilities in overburdened and underserved communities. In fiscal year (FY) 2024, the EPA concluded forty-nine enforcement cases, including agreements to perform voluntary Supplemental Environmental Projects (SEPs), collectively generating more than $9.5 million. Some notable enforcement cases include: The County of Hawai’i and the Guam Waterworks Authority Clean Water Act wastewater treatment cases, including more than $1 billion of injunctive relief; a $1.4 million settlement with Sasol Chemicals over violations of the chemical accident prevention provisions of the Clean Air Act at the company’s facility in Westlake, Louisiana, near the historic Mossville community; and the Heritage Crystal-Clean, LLC settlement for violations of hazardous waste and used oil waste management requirements in communities overburdened by pollution, including Indianapolis, IN; Shreveport, LA; Atlanta, GA; Fairless Hills, PA; and Denver, CO.

DOJ, in conjunction with the EPA, concluded significant environmental enforcement cases resulting in notable impacts for environmental justice communities, such as a Hilcorp Energy Company settlement resolving Clean Air Act violations at the company’s oil and gas production operations in New Mexico resulting in the reduction of more than 113,000 tons’ of CO2; the Lima Refining Company settlement enforcing a civil penalty of $19 million and implementation of an estimated $150 million in capital investments, for unlawfully exposing the surrounding community in Ohio to toxic benzene emissions and other hazardous pollutants; and the $310 million settlement reached with Norfolk Southern to address harms caused by the East Palestine Train Derailment. Information about other significant enforcement actions is found in the Department of Justice Comprehensive Environmental Justice Enforcement Strategy Second Annual Report, December 2024.

IV. Environmental Justice in Regulatory Actions

The EPA proposed a suite of regulatory actions in 2024, several with Environmental Justice implications. In late March - early April, the EPA released multiple rules targeting the reduction of hazardous air pollutants ethylene oxide and chloroprene, including fenceline monitoring. In June 2024, the EPA released its Climate Adaptation Plan promoting efforts to prepare for climate impacts, build resilience, and support climate-smart solutions and investments that work for communities across the country. In October, EPA finalized strengthened standards for identifying and cleaning up lead paint dust in pre-1978 homes and childcare facilities and finalized a rule to Protect Farmworkers, Families and Communities from Pesticide Exposures. In November 2024, the EPA proposed New Source Performance Standards on Stationary and Combustion Turbines - to help limit harmful nitrogen oxide pollutants.

One of the most monumental regulatory actions by the Biden-Harris Administration was the issuance of a final rule requiring drinking water systems across the country to identify and replace lead pipes within ten years, paired with the investment of $2.6 billion in newly available drinking water infrastructure funding through the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. Finally, in late 2024, the EPA released a draft of the Interim Framework for Advancing Consideration of Cumulative Impacts,providing agency programs and regional offices with tools and principles to consider cumulative impacts in their work.

V. Environmental Justice and Title VI

Under Administrator Michael Regan, EPA has accepted for investigation an unprecedented number of civil rights complaints filed under Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as part of an agency-wide commitment to enforce civil rights and advance environmental justice. Title VI prohibits recipients of federal financial assistance from discrimination based on race, color, or national origin with the potential to provide a remedy for decades of discriminatory decisions that have shaped access to clean air, water, soil, and now protection from extreme weather. EPA recently published a transparent, searchable database of the agency’s civil rights docket, joined DOJ in issuing a 2024 Joint Interagency Statement of Shared Commitment to Ensure Compliance with Civil Rights Laws and Advance Environmental Justice and issued Civil Rights Guidance on Procedural Safeguards: Requirements and Best Practices.

A. Title VI Resolution Agreements

In February 2024, EPA entered an Informal Resolution Agreement with the Illinois Environmental Protection Agency, committing Illinois EPA to address civil rights and environmental justice in construction air permitting for major sources. The agreement resolved a Title VI complaint filed by a coalition of two Chicago-based environmental justice organizations regarding the proposed relocation of the General Iron metal shredding operation from a predominantly wealthy white area to Chicago’s Southeast Side, a neighborhood with significant populations of residents of color and non-English speakers and already overburdened by polluting facilities. The resolution agreement requires Illinois EPA to screen permit applications for potential disparate impacts and, in such cases, consider past compliance history, cumulative impacts, and potential mitigation through increased agency resources or permit conditions for disproportionate and adverse impacts identified through the analysis. The agreement follows a May 2023 agreement resulting from findings of noncompliance relating to the same proposed General Iron relocation by HUD. The HUD negotiations spurred the issuance of Chicago’s Executive Order to Advance Environmental Justice and a baseline Cumulative Impacts Assessment co-designed by the City and community representatives, environmental leaders, and local partners. The City met many of its obligations under that agreement in 2023, however, progress on others stalled in 2024.

Resolving a civil rights complaint filed through a State of Michigan grievance procedure, Michigan’s Department of Environment, Great Lakes, and Energy (EGLE) entered into an agreement on August 29, 2024, with members of Detroit’s Eastside community regarding the renewal of a hazardous waste facility license. The agreement commits EGLE to conduct environmental justice analyses and cumulative impact reviews before issuing or renewing a license to a hazardous waste facility and must deny such a license if it will cause unlawful impacts to the environment or human health.

B. Challenges to Enforcement of Title VI

On August 22, 2024, Judge James D. Cain, Jr. of the Western District of Louisiana issued a permanent injunction against EPA and DOJ, blocking them from enforcing their disparate impact regulations under Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The ruling came in the Louisiana v. EPA case filed in 2023.

The suit responded to EPA’s investigation and a subsequent Letter of Concern issued in response to three civil rights complaints filed by residents of St. John the Baptist and St. James Parishes in Louisiana’s Cancer Alley. These complaints alleged racial discrimination under Title VI in the permitting of industrial facilities in communities long facing some of the nation’s highest cancer risks from toxic air pollution. The EPA Letter of Concern outlined the “substantially disproportionate” cancer risk borne by Black residents living nearest to sources of harmful emissions and identified a possible “causal link” between state agency action and “the adverse and disproportionate distribution of the cancer and toxicity risks” for Black residents.

The permanent injunction followed a preliminary injunction issued in early 2024, prohibiting both agencies from enforcing the decades-old disparate impact provisions of their Title VI regulations against the state of Louisiana or any Louisiana state agency, and expanded its reach to any entity receiving federal funds. In dicta, Judge Cain wrote he “agrees that the unlawful disparate-impact regulations are illegal anywhere in the United States.” On September 19, 2024, Louisiana filed a Motion to Amend the Judgment requesting that the court vacate EPA’s and DOJ’s disparate impact regulations “without any geographic limitations.”

On April 16, 2024, prior to the Louisiana v. EPA ruling, Florida Attorney General Ashley Moody filed a petition for rulemaking on behalf of a twenty-three state coalition requesting EPA rescind its disparate impact regulations. The petition has garnered responses from advocacy groups and a coalition of attorneys general. To date, Judge Cain has not ruled on the Motion to Amend, nor EPA on the petition for rulemaking.

VI. Environmental Justice and Federal Funding

On December 12, 2024, the Biden-Harris Administration announced nearly $1.6 billion in Environmental and Climate Justice Community Change Grants to 105 applicants. EPA cited the Community Change Grants Program as “the single largest investment in environmental and climate justice in history.” The grant program dedicates $600 million to Target Investment Areas intended to benefit disadvantaged communities with unique circumstances, geography, and needs, including approximately $150 million for Alaska Native communities and organizations.

In December 2023, EPA awarded $600 million to eleven Grantmakers in each of EPA’s regions through the Environmental Justice Thriving Communities Grantmaking program. These funds are intended as sub-grants to community-based nonprofits and other eligible subrecipients to alleviate much of the burden that the federal grants process places on small, resource-constrained community-based organizations supporting underserved communities and marginalized populations. Grantmakers in most regions began accepting applications in 2024.

VII. Environmental Justice at the State Level

A. Legislative

1. New York

2024 saw New York adopt or institute several EJ-related measures. On December 21, 2024, Governor Hochul signed into lawS.8357/A.8866, which expands the state’s ban on hydraulic fracturing by prohibiting the use of carbon dioxide in the process, in part to advance EJ. On December 26, 2024, the Governor signed into lawS.2129-B/A.3351-B, which establishes a “Climate Superfund,” making large fossil fuel companies responsible for climate change adaptation projects in the state. Lastly, on December 30, 2024, Section 70-0118 of the Environmental Conservation Law went into effect, which prohibits state agencies from issuing permits that would impose a “disproportionate pollution burden” on an EJ community.

2. Massachusetts

Massachusetts Governor Maura Healey and Lt. Governor Kim Driscoll released the first-ever Environmental Justice Strategy on February 15, 2024. The strategy aims to integrate environmental justice principles into state policies and programs, ensuring equitable environmental protections for all residents. The plan includes meaningful community engagement, analysis of project benefits and burdens, staff training, and progress tracking, as well as each agency’s plan to incorporate environmental justice initiatives into their work.

3. Maryland

On October 1, 2024 Maryland enacted HB 233. This bill updates the Chesapeake and Atlantic Coastal Bays Critical Area Protection Program to require equity in the distribution of burdens and benefits associated with development, restoration, conservation, and adaptation efforts, including public access to water, shorelines, and other natural areas, particularly for underserved or overburdened communities.

VIII. Environmental Justice in the Courts

A. Montana

On December 18, 2024, the Montana Supreme Court upheld a lower court’s decision that the state’s constitutional right to a clean and healthful environment includes a right to a stable climate system. The court found that the state’s prohibition on consideration of greenhouse gas emissions during environmental reviews harmed the youth plaintiffs.

B. New Jersey

On October 29, 2024, a New Jersey appellate court affirmed the trial court’s denial of leave to amend the complaint to include substantive due process claims, finding that a fundamental right to a stable environment is not explicitly stated in the New Jersey Constitution and is not “objectively and deeply rooted in the traditions, history, and conscience of the people of [New Jersey].”

C. Louisiana

In January 2024, a state trial court held that Louisiana’s public trust doctrine “requires consideration of ‘economic, social, and other factors’ broad enough to constitute an analysis of environmental justice, as defined by EPA.” The court nonethelessdecided that LDEQ’s EJ analysis was sufficient. The Louisiana Supreme Court declined to review the decision.

D. North Carolina

In September 2024, North Carolina’s Environmental Justice Community Action Network agreed to a proposed consent decree with the owners of North Carolina’s largest landfill following two notices of intents to sue. The agreement mandates the elimination of PFAS discharges, the implementation of air monitoring systems, and other protections for the rural, predominantly Black and Latino neighborhood of Snow Hill in Roseboro, North Carolina.

On December 4, 2024, the Town of Carrboro, North Carolina brought suit against Duke Energy Corporation on behalf of underserved and marginalized communities, alleging that the company engaged in a deception campaign regarding the dangers of fossil fuel that contributed to the climate crisis. The lawsuit includes claims for negligence, public nuisance, and private nuisance.

IX. Environmental Justice in the ABA

In 2021 the ABA House of Delegates adopted Resolution 513, which committed the ABA to advancing environmental justice principles and considerations in its programs, policies, and activities, with the ABA Board of Governors concurrently establishing the “Environmental Justice Task Force” (EJTF) to lead implementation efforts.

The EJTF and Section co-sponsored a spate of EJ programs in 2024. On October 30, 2024, they co-hosted a webinar, “Environmental Justice: Where are We Now and Where are We Headed.” This was a pre-symposium webinar to explore the legal strategies, challenges, and future of environmental justice, including recent legal actions against the EPA and shifts in policy.

On November 14, 2024, they co-sponsored an Environmental Justice Day of Service. Section members and other program partners visited classrooms in three Washington, D.C. schools to discuss the history and current practice of environmental protection and justice in the United States, offering insight into the role of environmental law in addressing daily issues and shaping equity.

On November 15, 2024, they co-sponsored an Environmental Justice Symposium, ""Legal Strategies & Solutions for Putting Equity into Action,"" at Howard University School of Law. The symposium was preceded by a career roundtable and reception geared toward students and early-career professionals in environmental law and policy, pairing senior mentors from the Section and other program partners with mentees to discuss the diverse ways in which legal practice incorporates environmental justice.",https://www.americanbar.org/content/dam/aba/images/aba-stock/16x9/16x9-kids-123318225.jpg,N,,2025-06-21 07:02:46.699326

(DTN) -- A federal court ruled on Friday that the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency arbitrarily used old data in analyzing the potential effects of the first Renewable Fuels Standard set rule finalized by the Biden administration and remanded it back to the agency.

In a lawsuit brought against the EPA by the Center for Biological Diversity last November, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit found that the agency failed to adequately explain its climate change analysis of the RFS rule that set volumes for 2023, 2024 and 2025.

June 20, 2025

Canada is the world’s third-largest exporter of oil, fourth-largest producer, and top source of imports to the United States. Much of Canada’s oil wealth is concentrated in the oil sands in northern Alberta, which hosts 99 percent of the country’s enormous oil endowment: about 160 billion barrels of proven reserves, of a total resource of approximately 1.8 trillion barrels. This is the major source of oil to the United States refinery complex, a large part of which is optimized for the oil sands’ heavy oil.

Reliability of energy supply has remerged as a major geopolitical issue. Canadian oil and gas is an essential component of North American energy security. Yet a proposed cap on emissions from the sectors promises to cut Canadian production and exports in the years ahead. It would be hard to provide less environmental benefit for a higher economic and security cost. There are far better ways to reduce emissions while maintaining North America’s security of energy supply.

The high cost of the cap

In 1994 a Liberal federal government, Alberta provincial conservative government and representatives from the oil and gas industry, working together through the national oil sands task force, developed A New Energy Vision for Canada. Their efforts turned what was then a middling resource into a trillion dollar nation-building project. Production has increased tenfold since the report came out.

The task force acknowledged the need for industry to “put its best efforts toward … reducing greenhouse gas emissions.” However, it also expected governments to “understand” that there “is no benefit to Canada or to the environment to have production and value-added processing done outside of the country in less efficient jurisdictions … policies set by regulator must not result in discouraging oil sands production.”

As part of its efforts to meet its climate goals under the Paris Accord, the Canadian government proposed a regulatory framework for an emissions cap on the oil and gas sector in December 2023. It set a legally binding limit on greenhouse gas emissions, targeting a 35 to 38 percent reduction from 2019 levels by 2030 for upstream operations, through regulations to be made under the Canadian Environmental Protection Act, 1999 (CEPA).

The federal government has not yet finalized its proposed regulations. However, industry experts and economists have criticized the current iteration as logistically unworkable, overly expensive, and likely to be challenged as unconstitutional. In effect, this policy layers a cap-and-trade system for just one sector (oil and gas) on top of a competing carbon pricing mechanism (the large-emitter trading systems, often referred to as the industrial carbon price), a discriminatory practice that also undermines the entire economic rationale of a carbon pricing system.

While the Canadian government has maintained that it is focused on reducing emissions rather than production – the latter of which would put it at odds with provincial jurisdiction over non-renewable resources – a series of third party analyses as well as the Parliamentary Budget Office’s own impact assessment find it would indeed constrain Canadian oil and gas production. The economic cost of the emissions cap far exceeds any corresponding benefit in reduced emissions.

How much will the emissions cap cost in terms of dollar per tonne of carbon in avoided emissions, both domestically and globally? Based solely on the cost to the Canadian economy, we estimate the emission cap is equivalent to a C$2,887/tonne carbon price by 2032.

Assuming no impact on global demand and full substitution by non-Canadian crudes, it finds that the cost of each tonne of carbon displaced globally is between C$96,000 to C$289,000 for oil sands bitumen production. For displaced Canadian conventional and natural gas, the cost is infinite, i.e. global emissions would actually be higher for every barrel or unit of Canadian oil and gas displaced with competitor products as a result of the emissions cap.

Canadian oil and gas emissions reduction efforts

The oil and gas sector is the highest emitting economic sector in Canada. However, it has made substantial efforts to reduce emissions over the past two decades and is succeeding. Absolute emissions in the sector peaked in 2014, despite production growing by over a million barrels of oil equivalent since (see Figure 1).

Much of this success can be attributed to methane capture, particularly in the natural gas and conventional oil sectors, where absolute emissions peaked in 2007 and 2014 respectively.

Since 2014, the oil sands have dramatically increased production by over a million barrels per day, but at the same time have reduced the emissions per barrel every year, leaving the absolute emissions of the oil and gas sector relatively flat. The oil sands are performing well vis-à-vis their international peers, seeing their emissions per barrel decline by 30 percent since 2013, compared to 21 percent for global majors and 34 percent for US E&Ps (exploration and production companies) (see Figure 2).

On an emissions intensity absolute basis, the oil sands have significantly outperformed their peers, shaving off 25kg/barrel of emissions since 2013 (see Figure 3) and more than 65kg/barrel since the oil sands task force wrote their report in 1994.

As emissions improvements from methane reductions plateau, the oil sands are likely to outperform their conventional peers in emissions per barrel reductions going forward. The sector is working on strategies such as solvent extraction and carbon capture and storage that, if implemented, would reduce the life-cycle emissions per barrel of oil sands to levels at or below the global crude average.

The high cost of the cap

Several parties have analyzed the proposed emissions cap to determine its economic and production impact. The results of the assessments vary widely. For the purposes of this commentary we rely on the federal Office of the Parliamentary Budget Officer (PBO), which published its analysis of the proposed emissions cap in March 2025. Helpfully, the PBO provided a table summarizing the main findings of the various analyses (see Table 1).

The PBO found that the required reduction in upstream oil and gas sector production levels under an emissions cap would lower real gross domestic product (GDP) in Canada by 0.33 percent in 2030 and 0.39 percent in 2032, and reduce nominal GDP by C$20.5 billion by 2032. The PBO further estimated that achieving the legal upper bound would reduce economy-wide employment in Canada by 40,300 jobs and full-time equivalents by 54,400 in 2032.

However, the PBO does not estimate the carbon price per tonne of emissions reduced. This is a useful metric as Canadians have become broadly familiar with the real-world impacts of a price on carbon. The federal government quashed the consumer carbon price at $80/tonne in March 2025, ahead of the federal election, due to its unpopularity and perceived impacts on affordability. The federal carbon pricing benchmark is scheduled to hit C$170 in 2030. ECCC has quantified the damages of a tonne of carbon dioxide – referred to as the “Social Cost of Carbon” – as C$294/tonne.

Based on PBO assumptions that the emissions cap will reduce emissions by 7.1MT and reduce GDP by $20.5 billion in 2032, the implied carbon price is C$2,887/tonne.

Emissions cap impact in a global context

Even this eye-popping figure does not tell the full story. The Canadian oil and gas production that must be withdrawn to meet the requirements of the emissions cap will be replaced in global markets from other producers; there is no reason to assume the emissions cap will affect global demand.

Based on life-cycle GHG emissions of the sample of crudes used in the US refinery complex, Canadian oil sands produce only 1 to 3 percent higher emissions than a global average[1] (see Figure 4), with some facilities producing lower emissions than the average barrel.

As such, the emissions cap, if applied just to oil sands production, would only displace global emissions of 71,000 to 213,000 tonnes (1 to 3 percent of 7.1MT). At a cost of C$20.5 billion for those global emissions reductions, the price of carbon is equivalent to C$96,000 to C$289,000 per tonne (see Figure 5).

For any displaced conventional Canadian crude oil or natural gas, the situation becomes absurd. Because Canadian conventional oil and natural gas have a lower emissions intensity than global averages, global product substitutions resulting from the emissions cap would actually serve to increase global emissions, resulting in an infinite price per tonne of carbon.

The C$100k/tonne carbon price estimate is probably low

We believe our assessment of the effective carbon price of the emissions cap at C$96,000+/tonne to be conservative for the following reasons.

First, it assumes Canadian heavy oil will be displaced in global markets by an average, archetypal crude. In fact, it would be displaced by other heavy crudes from places like Venezuela, Mexico, and Iraq (see Figure 4), which have higher average emissions per barrel than Canadian oil sands crudes. In such a circumstance, global emissions would actually rise and the price per carbon tonne from an emissions cap on oil sands production would also effectively be infinite.

Secondly, emissions cap impact assumptions by the PBO are likely conservative. Those by ECCC, based on a particular scenario outlook, are already outdated. ECCC assumed a production loss of only 0.7 percent by 2030, with oil sands production hitting approximately 3.7 million barrels (MMbbls) per day of bitumen production in 2030. According to S&P Global analysis, that level is likely to be hit this year.[2]

S&P further forecasts oil sands production to reach 4.0 MMbbls by 2030, or about 300,000 barrels more than it produces today. This would represent a far lower production growth rate than the oil sands have experienced in the past five years. But assuming the S&P forecast is correct, production would need to decline in the oil sands by 8 percent to meet the emissions cap requirements. PBO assumed only a 5.4 percent overall oil and gas production loss and ECCC assumed only 0.7 percent, while Conference Board of Canada assumed an 11.1 percent loss and Deloitte assumed 11.5 percent (see Table 1). Production numbers to date more closely align with Conference Board of Canada and Deloitte projections.

Let’s make the Canadian oil and gas sector better, not smaller

The Canadian oil and gas sector, and in particular the oil sands, has a responsibility to do their part to reduce emissions while maintaining competitive businesses that can support good Canadian jobs, provide government revenues and diversify exports. The oil sands sector has re-invested for decades in continuous improvements to drive down production costs while improving its emissions per barrel.

It is hard to conceive of a more expensive and divisive way to reduce emissions from the sector and from the Canadian economy than the proposed emissions cap. Other expensive programs, such as Norway’s EV subsidies, the United Kingdom’s offshore wind contracts-for-difference, Germany’s Energiewende feed-in-tariffs and surcharges, and US Inflation Reduction Act investment tax credits, don’t come close to the high costs of the emissions cap on a price-per-tonne of carbon abated basis.

The emissions cap, as currently proposed, will make Canada’s oil and gas sector significantly less competitive, harm investment, and undermine Canada’s vision to be an energy superpower. This policy will also reduce the oil and gas sector’s capacity to invest in technologies that drive additional emission reductions, such as solvents and carbon capture, especially in our current lower price environment. As such it is more likely to undermine climate action than support it.

The federal and provincial governments have come together to advance a vision for Canadian energy in the past. In this moment, they have the opportunity once again to find real solutions to the climate challenge while harnessing the energy sector to advance Canada’s economic well-being, productivity, and global energy security.

The clean energy jobs boom is also happening in the communities that need it most: 81% of investment in clean energy industries since the IRA passed has flowed into counties with below-average weekly wages.
In March, Administrator Zeldin notified National Clean Investment Fund and Clean Communities Investment Accelerator recipients of the termination of their grant agreements under the Biden-Harris Administration’s $20 billion ‘gold bar’ scheme.
“To unlock the full potential of rooftop and community solar, we need private capital at the table.
“As federal support for crucial climate projects becomes uncertain, the leadership of local governments, paired with private capital, is essential to fill the gap,” Dollaride CEO Su Sanni said.","The Trump administration’s economic policies have been summarized by most major financial institutions under the industry’s greatest pejorative: uncertainty. It’s bad enough when applied to yo-yo-ing tariffs that can send the economy teetering toward recession. And perhaps even worse when playing with the future of the planet: $27 billion in funding for companies and funds addressing the climate crisis that, if unabated, the World Economic Forum has estimated costing society as much as $75 trillion by 2050. Why was this funding frozen, and what can private investors do about it?

GGRF Funds in Limbo

Over the past 100+ days, there has been a bitter battle over the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund (GGRF), a $27 billion vehicle approved during the Biden administration designed to “finance clean technology deployment nationally, finance clean technology deployment in low-income and disadvantaged communities while simultaneously building the capacity of community lenders that serve those communities, and spur adoption of clean distributed solar energy that lowers energy bills for millions of Americans in low-income and disadvantaged communities.”

One of the goals of this fund was to more effectively de-politicize what has too often been a hot potato industry in Washington: renewable energy, by focusing on the concrete, economic benefits that climate change mitigation and technological development can bring to communities. As noted in Forbes, clean energy jobs have historically grown at twice the national rate, and are more accessible to the average American: “Clean energy jobs create economic mobility, with 21% higher wages than average, increasing access to unions, and expanding accessibility – 75% of expected jobs from IRA [Inflation Reduction Act]

investments won’t require a four-year degree. The clean energy jobs boom is also happening in the communities that need it most: 81% of investment in clean energy industries since the IRA passed has flowed into counties with below-average weekly wages. From wind turbine technician being the fastest-growing job in America to auto manufacturing jobs hitting a 34-year peak – all signs point to clean energy as the path to building a stronger U.S. economy.”

And yet, despite this strong economic data, on March 11, The EPA ordered Citibank to freeze the fund, in a move Senator Schumer, Markey, Warren, Whitehouse, Van Hollen and Merkley referred to as “ jeopardiz[ing] private investment, job creation, and economic opportunity in communities across the country” in a subsequent letter to Citibank.

Citibank, very much stuck in the middle, first received a judge’s order saying they should proceed with funding, with presiding Judge Tanya Chutkan ruling that the EPA “acted arbitrarily and capriciously when it failed to explain its reasoning and acted contrary to its regulations in suspending and terminating Plaintiffs’ grants.” The very next day, however, an appellate court granted a stay to the EPA that refroze the funds until the courts can arrive at a long-term solution.

An EPA spokesperson responded to a request for comment via email, stating: “Unlike the Biden-Har[r]is administration, this EPA is committed to being an exceptional steward of taxpayer dollars. In March, Administrator Zeldin notified National Clean Investment Fund and Clean Communities Investment Accelerator recipients of the termination of their grant agreements under the Biden-Harris Administration’s $20 billion ‘gold bar’ scheme. This termination is based on substantial concerns regarding the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund (GGRF) program integrity, the award process, and programmatic waste and abuse, which collectively undermine the fundamental goals and statutory objectives of the award.”

Private Investment Steps Up

Caught in the middle are companies across the country in the business of getting clean energy into communities, or in the case of many Native Americans who live off-grid, like 30% of the Navajo Nation, any source of energy at all. Many entrepreneurs who were either approved or in the process to receive GGRF funds refuse to sit on their hands waiting to see what the courts decide and are forging a path with the support of private investors—a process I know well, given my firm Candide Group launched Afterglow, a climate justice debt fund, in 2024. The stories of these organizations not only exemplify the value potentially being destroyed by the delay of the GGRF, but also, represent opportunities for private capital to step in.

Solar Holler (West Virginia)

Solar Holler is a West Virginia-based solar developer and installer serving Appalachia, including Virginia, Kentucky and Ohio. Working with households, churches, schools and other non-profit organizations, Solar Holler has sought to build on the region’s history as an energy producer, without the staggering long-term threats to public health generated by coal. This month, it completed five of seventeen intended solar projects installed on the roofs of West Virginia public schools.

Their CEO, Dan Conant, commented on LinkedIn, “It's these sorts of projects that get me out of bed in the morning—the kind that cram as much good into one place as possible. The kind that provide educational opportunities for West Virginian kids to stay home. The kind that support American manufacturing and union labor. The kind that lower bills for organizations doing God's work.”

He added, “every panel we put up means more money for teachers and supplies, and…actual education. The electricity generated by the solar is 20% cheaper than what the out-of-state monopoly utility is charging.”

Allume (National)

Allume Energy unlocks rooftop solar potential for multifamily buildings with its SolShare technology, expanding access to clean and affordable energy for apartment residents.

“Allume’s mission is to bring rooftop solar to the more than 110 million people living in multifamily housing, many of whom are low-income,” Aliya Bagewadi, Alume’s Director of US Strategic Partnerships, said in an email. “Our SolShare technology allows solar energy to be shared across multiple units in the same building, enabling apartment tenants to directly consume solar and reduce their electricity bills by an average of 40 percent. Without the federal Investment Tax Credit, affordable housing providers won’t be able to reduce financial strain or strengthen housing resilience in the communities they serve. The rollback would halt projects that deliver immediate and lasting savings to the families who need it most.”

Georgia Bright (Georgia)

Georgia BRIGHT is a program of the Capital Good Fund (CGF), a Rhode Island-based nonprofit social finance organization grappling with poverty and environmental injustice in America. Capital Good Fund offers solar leases, low-interest loans, and one-on-one financial coaching for lower-income residents of Georgia, Rhode Island, Texas, Illinois, Florida, Delaware, Massachusetts, New Jersey, Connecticut, Pennsylvania, and Colorado.

This federally funded solar power program makes solar leasing more accessible for homeowners and nonprofits. In addition to helping low- and moderate-income communities save money, this work also enhances grid stability — increasingly essential as climate change strains grids.

“$156 million in Solar for All funding is an amazing start, but if we are going to serve 16,000+ Georgia families over the next four years, we can't rely on public investment alone,” Alicia Brown, Georgia BRIGHT Director said. “To unlock the full potential of rooftop and community solar, we need private capital at the table. The Georgia BRIGHT initiative isn’t just about clean energy—it’s about saving families money as utility bills rise, boosting Georgia's economy, and strengthening our grid that is straining under the weight of rapid load growth.”

Dollaride (New York)

Dollaride is a New York-based company electrifying fleet vehicles in transit deserts, starting with New York City’s locally essential “dollar vans.” Roughly 1.4 million people in NYC live with limited access to public transit, which hinders economic mobility. Dollar vans provide an informal transit network that serves more than 100,000 riders daily in the outer boroughs of Queens and Brooklyn.

“As federal support for crucial climate projects becomes uncertain, the leadership of local governments, paired with private capital, is essential to fill the gap,” Dollaride CEO Su Sanni said. “Ultimately, this ensures that disadvantaged communities retain access to essential transportation and breathe cleaner air. This is the kind of high-impact, scalable model that private capital can and should be amplifying nationwide.”

Companies like these who are developing climate projects in low-income communities — which are already feeling the substantial strain of climate change —may struggle if GGRF funds ultimately can’t reach their intended recipients. This may lead to political ramifications in red and blue states alike.

The good news is that renewable energy not only has the potential to save money for consumers, according to the Department of Energy, but also make money for investors, with an International Energy Agency report finding clean energy outperformed fossil fuels for both 5 and 10 year periods.

Chevron Corporation CVX has reportedly begun the sale process for its 50% stake in Singapore Refining Company (“SRC”), inviting non-binding bids from potential buyers. Among those approached is PetroChina, which already owns the remaining 50% through its Singapore Petroleum Co Ltd unit and holds the first right of refusal.

The move is part of the U.S. oil giant’s broader efforts of global restructuring and streamlining operations. Chevron has been optimizing its global portfolio by prioritizing core growth assets, aiming to cut costs and enhance profitability. Earlier this year, Chevron announced plans to lay off 15-20% of its employees to restructure operations.

Global Restructuring in Singapore and Beyond

Last month, Chevron divested its interest in Chevron Phillips Singapore Chemicals to Aster Chemicals and Energy, a joint venture between Chandra Asri and Glencore. The potential sale of the refinery would mark the second recent departure by a global energy major from Singapore’s refining sector, which faces higher operating costs due to a carbon tax that has impacted its competitiveness compared with other regions.

The company’s restructuring is not limited to Singapore. Chevron is also assessing the market for other assets in Asia, including terminal and fuel storage facilities in Australia and the Philippines. Morgan Stanley has been appointed to oversee the sale process for these assets, including the SRC refinery.

Taking a Look at Singapore Refining Company

Singapore Refining Company is a 50/50 joint venture between Chevron and China’s state-owned oil and gas major, PetroChina. With a crude processing capacity of 290,000 barrels per day, it is the smallest refinery in Singapore. The facility features seven shipping berths capable of accommodating very large crude carriers. Its fuel products are traded regionally and internationally, supported by a well-established distribution network across Singapore and Jurong Island.

Growing Interest, High Valuations

Global trading house Glencore is among the entities reportedly invited to assess the refinery stake. Estimates suggest Chevron’s share in SRC could be valued between $300 million and $500 million. The sale process, with offers expected in July, comes at a time when energy majors are sharpening their focus on profitability and efficiency in a volatile market.

Bloomberg News reviewed official import documents that confirm the arrival of at least five Model Y vehicles at the Mumbai port. These units were declared at ₹27.69 lakh (approx. $31,988), with over ₹21 lakh levied in import duties, reflecting India’s high tariffs on completely built units.

The Model Y, recognized globally as the best-selling electric car, is expected to be priced above $56,000 in India before taxes and insurance. That’s significantly higher than its U.S. price of $44,990, and even more when U.S. tax credits bring the price down to $37,490. This substantial price gap highlights one of Tesla's main challenges in India—convincing price-sensitive consumers to invest in a premium electric vehicle.

Despite EVs making up just over 5 per cent of new passenger vehicle sales in India, the premium segment still remains under 2 per cent of the market. This presents a tough landscape for Tesla, which must carefully balance pricing, product positioning, and consumer appeal.

Tesla's India strategy has gained momentum following a meeting between CEO Elon Musk and Prime Minister Narendra Modi earlier this year. While the company has yet to appoint a new country head following the departure of Prashanth Menon, it is actively hiring for roles in retail, charging infrastructure, and public policy.

To support its operations, Tesla is also securing warehousing space in Karnataka and Gurugram. Furthermore, executives from international teams have been making regular visits to oversee preparations in the luxury business districts of Mumbai and New Delhi, where the first showrooms are being established.

As Tesla makes its long-awaited Indian debut, the company is banking on its global brand appeal and premium technology to carve out space in a rapidly evolving but price-conscious market.

It’s not just about turning on the lights or plugging in a phone, it’s about staying warm through the long, dark winters. It’s about making sure a remote community hundreds of miles from the road system has access to affordable, reliable power. And it’s about keeping the cost of living from climbing even higher.

That’s why Alaskans can be thankful to our senators for standing up for something that may sound technical — federal clean energy tax credits — but in reality, makes a world of difference to real people, right here in our state. Both our senators should keep up the good work.

Clean energy tax credits like the ones passed as part of the Inflation Reduction Act have enabled Alaskan households, businesses and communities to strengthen their energy efficiency while getting major clean energy projects off the ground in Alaska, creating and protecting good union jobs in the process. Without these energy tax credits, we risk seeing economy-growing projects stalled or canceled, jobs lost and energy costs pushed even higher for Alaskan families already feeling the pinch.

The Alaska AFL-CIO represents 50,000 workers in 50 local affiliates across the state. These are hardworking men and women who build and maintain the critical infrastructure that keeps Alaska running. These are the skilled electricians, laborers, teamsters and tradespeople who have powered our oil and gas industry, and who are now also ready and trained to build the next generation of energy, including wind, solar, hydropower and more. They take pride in what they do, and they deserve the chance to keep working, supporting their families and strengthening their communities.

Many Alaska workers have spent months out on remote job sites, away from their families, helping install wind turbines or repair transmission lines. They are not just doing a job, they’re building a future for their children and for Alaska. And they know, like I do, that the sooner we get more local, affordable energy online, the better it will be for everyone — whether you live in Anchorage or Aniak.

But these projects don’t just happen on their own. They take time. They take investment. And in Alaska, where the terrain is tough and the permitting process can stretch for years, they take strong policy support. The Inflation Reduction Act’s federal renewable energy tax credits have been critical for getting projects to the finish line. Take them away, and we’re back to square one with projects delayed, jobs lost and energy bills creeping up.

Sen. Lisa Murkowski said it well in her letter to Senate leadership earlier this year: Eliminating these credits would disrupt progress and hurt American workers. She’s absolutely right. Here in Alaska, it’s not just about policy, it’s about people. And our people are ready to work. Our unions have already trained workers to build these projects. They’re just waiting on the green light to get going.

We may not always agree with our elected leaders on every issue, but when it comes to energy, we share common ground: We all want a future that’s affordable, reliable and built right here at home. That’s what these tax credits help make possible.

The Alaska AFL-CIO is proud to support an “all of the above” energy approach that includes oil, gas and clean energy resources. We believe in building it all, as long as it creates good union jobs and keeps Alaskans warm, working and thriving.

Let’s keep moving forward. Let’s keep building. And let’s make sure the next generation of energy in Alaska is one we can all be proud of — union-built, Alaskan-made, and here to stay. Sens.

They say the interim goal still holds an aspirational purpose and was something that Duke Energy had agreed in 2021 to meet.
Bill support came from the North Carolina Chamber and a manufacturers’ group, in addition to Duke Energy.","By GARY D. ROBERTSON | Associated Press

RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) — North Carolina legislators finalized a bill Thursday that would eliminate an interim greenhouse gas reduction mandate set in a landmark 2021 law, while still directing regulators to aim to cancel out power plant carbon emissions in the state within the next 25 years.

With some bipartisan support, the state Senate voted to accept the House version that would repeal the 2021 law’s requirement that electric regulators take “all reasonable steps to achieve” reducing carbon dioxide output 70% from 2005 levels by 2030. The law’s directive to take similar steps to meet a carbon neutrality standard by 2050 would remain in place.

The bill’s Republican supporters pushing the new measure say getting rid of the interim goal benefits ratepayers asked to pay for future electric-production construction and is more efficient for Duke Energy, the state’s dominant electric utility.

The bill now goes to Democratic Gov. Josh Stein, who can veto the measure, sign it or let it become law without his signature. Stein previously expressed concerns about the Senate version of the measure, worried that it could hurt electricity users and threaten the state’s clean-energy economy. His office didn’t immediately provide comment after Thursday’s vote.

With over a dozen House and Senate Democrats voting for the final version, the chances that any Stein veto could be overridden are higher. Republicans in charge of the General Assembly are only one House seat shy of a veto-proof majority.

The bill also contains language that would help Duke Energy seek higher electric rates to cover financing costs to build nuclear or gas-powered plants incrementally, rather than wait until the project’s end.

The 2021 greenhouse gas law marked a rare agreement on environmental issues by then-Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper and Republican lawmakers.

At least 17 other states — most controlled by Democrats — have laws setting similar net-zero power plant emissions or 100% renewable energy targets, according to the Natural Resources Defense Council. North Carolina and Virginia are the only ones from the Southeast.

The legislation came about as President Donald Trump’s administration has proposed rolling back federal environmental and climate change policies, which critics say could boost pollution and threaten human health. Republicans are promoting them as ways to reduce the cost of living and boost the economy.

The state Utilities Commission, which regulates rates and services for public utilities, already has pushed back the 2030 deadline — as the 2021 law allows — by at least four years. The panel acknowledged last year it was “no longer reasonable or executable” for Duke Energy to meet the reduction standard by 2030.

Bill supporters say to meet the goal would require expensive types of alternate energy immediately. If the interim standard can be bypassed, GOP bill authors say, Duke Energy can assemble less expensive power sources now and moderate electricity rate increases necessary to reach the 2050 standard.

“Our residents shouldn’t be saddled with higher power bills to satisfy arbitrary targets,” Republican Senate leader Phil Berger said in a news release after the vote.

Citing an analysis performed by a state agency that represents consumers before the commission, GOP lawmakers say removing the interim goal would reduce by at least $13 billion what Duke Energy would have to spend — and pass on to customers — in the next 25 years.

Bill opponents question the savings figure given uncertainty in plant fuel prices, energy demand and construction costs. They say the interim goal still holds an aspirational purpose and was something that Duke Energy had agreed in 2021 to meet.

Provisions in the measure related to recouping plant construction expenses over time would reduce accumulated borrowing interest.

Environmental groups argue the financing option would benefit Duke Energy’s bottom line on expensive projects even if they’re never completed, and the bill broadly would prevent cleaner energy sources from coming online sooner. They also contend another bill section would shift costs to residential customers.

“This bill is bad for all North Carolinians, whether they’re Duke Energy customers or simply people who want to breathe clean air,” North Carolina Sierra Club director Chris Herndon said after the vote while urging Stein to veto the measure.

Bill support came from the North Carolina Chamber and a manufacturers’ group, in addition to Duke Energy.

“We appreciate bipartisan efforts by policymakers to keep costs as low as possible for customers and enable the always-on energy resources our communities need,” the company said this week.",https://www.power-eng.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/AP25170680520513-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-06-21 02:59:57.959756

The Senate bill includes no sunset, making the tax breaks permanent, which was a key priority of powerful trade groups such as the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.
Under the Senate bill, the tax credits for clean energy and home energy efficiency would still be phased out, but less quickly than under the House bill.
The Senate bill excludes the proposed fees.","WASHINGTON — (AP) — House and Senate Republicans are taking slightly different approaches when it comes to the tax cuts that lawmakers are looking to include in their massive tax and spending cuts bill.

Republicans in the two chambers don't agree on the size of a deduction for state and local taxes. And they are at odds on such things as allowing people to use their health savings accounts to help pay for their gym membership, or whether electric vehicle and hybrid owners should have to pay an annual fee.

The House passed its version shortly before Memorial Day. Now the Senate is looking to pass its version.

While the two bills are similar on the major tax provisions, how they work out their differences in the coming weeks will determine how quickly they can get a final product over the finish line. President Donald Trump is pushing to have the legislation on his desk by July 4th.

Here’s a look at some of the key differences between the two bills:

The child tax credit currently stands at $2,000 per child.

The House bill temporarily boosts the child tax credit to $2,500 for the 2025 through 2028 tax years, roughly the length of President Donald Trump's second term. It also indexes the credit amount for inflation beginning in 2027.

The Senate bill provides a smaller, initial bump-up to $2,200, but the bump is permanent, with the credit amount indexed for inflation beginning next year.

Trump promised on the campaign trail that he would seek to end income taxes on tips, overtime and Social Security benefits. Also, he would give car buyers a new tax break by allowing them to deduct the interest paid on auto loans.

The House and Senate bills incorporate those promises with temporary deductions lasting from the 2025 through 2028 tax years, but with some differences.

The House bill creates a deduction on tips for those working in jobs that have customarily received tips. The House also provides for a deduction for overtime that’s equal to the amount of OT a worker has earned.

The Senate bill comes with more restrictions. The deduction for tips is limited to $25,000 per taxpayer and the deduction for overtime is limited to $12,500 per taxpayer.

The House and Senate bills both provide a deduction of up to $10,000 for interest paid on loans for vehicles made in the United States.

And on Social Security, the bills don't directly touch the program. Instead, they grant a larger tax deduction for Americans age 65 and older. The House sets the deduction at $4,000. The Senate sets it at $6,000.

Both chambers include income limits over which the new deductions begin to phase out.

The caps on state and local tax deductions, known in Washington as the SALT cap, now stand at $10,000.

The House bill, in a bid to win over Republicans from New York, California and New Jersey, lifts the cap to $40,000 per household with incomes of less than $500,000. The credit phases down for households earning more than $500,000.

The Senate bill keeps the cap at $10,000. That's a non-starter in the House, but Republicans in the two chambers will look to negotiate a final number over the coming weeks that both sides can accept.

The House bill prohibits states from establishing new provider taxes or increasing existing taxes. These are taxes that Medicaid providers, such as hospitals, pay to help states finance their share of Medicaid costs. In turn, the taxes allow states to receive increased federal matching funds while generally holding providers harmless through higher reimbursements that offset the taxes paid.

Such taxes now are effectively capped at 6%. The Senate looks to gradually lower that threshold for states that have expanded their Medicaid populations under the Affordable Care Act, or “Obamacare,” until it reaches 3.5% in 2031, with exceptions for nursing homes and intermediate care facilities.

Industry groups have warned that limiting the ability of states to tax providers may lead to some states making significant cuts to their Medicaid programs as they make up for the lost revenue in other ways. The Medicaid provision could be a flashpoint in the coming House and Senate negotiations. Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., was highly critical of the proposed Senate changes.

“This needs a lot of work. It’s really concerning and I’m really surprised by it,” he said. “Rural hospitals are going to be in bad shape.”

The House bill would allow companies for five years to fully deduct equipment purchases and domestic research and development expenses. The Senate bill includes no sunset, making the tax breaks permanent, which was a key priority of powerful trade groups such as the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.

Republicans in both chambers are looking to scale back the clean energy tax credits enacted through then-President Joe Biden's climate law. It aimed to boost the nation's transition away from planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions toward renewable energy such as wind and solar power.

Under the Senate bill, the tax credits for clean energy and home energy efficiency would still be phased out, but less quickly than under the House bill. Still, advocacy groups fear that the final measure will threaten hundreds of thousands of jobs and drive up household energy costs.

The House bill would allow millions of Americans to use their health savings accounts to pay for gym memberships, with a cap of $500 for single taxpayers and $1,000 for joint filers. The Senate bill doesn't include such a provision.

The House reinstates a charitable deduction for non-itemizers of $150 per taxpayer. The Senate bill increases that deduction for donations to $1,000 per taxpayer.

Republicans in the House bill included a new annual fee of $250 for EV owners and $100 for hybrid owners that would be collected by state motor vehicle departments. The Senate bill excludes the proposed fees.

That is particularly so when the government regulation itself may be skewing the market at issue.
So courts should exercise caution before denying standing because of a claimed lack of redressability rooted in questionable economic speculation.
I see no need to expound on the law of standing in a case where the sole dispute is a factual one not addressed below.
Barring that, we should have simply vacated and remanded for the D. C. Circuit to reconsider its ruling on a clarified factual record.…","Producers of gasoline and ethanol fuels have Article III standing to challenge the Environmental Protection Agency‘s approval of California regulations requiring automakers to limit average greenhouse-gas emissions across their vehicle fleets and manufacture a certain percentage of electric vehicles, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled 7-2 in reversing a decision from the D.C. Circuit.

Click here to read the full text of the June 20 decision in Diamond Alternative Energy v. Environmental Protection Agency.

BULLET POINTS: “To deny standing based on a theory that invalidating an important regulation would actually have zero impact on a dynamic and heavily regulated market requires a degree of economic and political clairvoyance that is difficult for a court to maintain. That is particularly so when the government regulation itself may be skewing the market at issue. So courts should exercise caution before denying standing because of a claimed lack of redressability rooted in questionable economic speculation. …

“In sum, this case does not present the unusual scenario where invalidating a challenged government restriction on businesses in a competitive market is not likely to have any effect. Here, it may not be certain, but it is at least ‘predictable’ that invalidating the California regulations would likely result in the fuel producers ultimately selling more gasoline and other liquid fuels.”

— Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh, opinion of the court

“Having granted certiorari, the Court relegates to a footnote the actual basis for the D.C. Circuit’s decision [which was based on an apparent misunderstanding about when the California fleet-wide emissions standards expire]. A version of that footnote should have been the Court’s entire opinion in this case. For reasons unknown, the majority instead conjures up a ‘heightened “proof of redressability” requirement’ that the D. C. Circuit did not adopt and that no party advanced, and then laboriously ‘decline[s] to adopt’ that requirement. I see no need to expound on the law of standing in a case where the sole dispute is a factual one not addressed below. Indeed, as JUSTICE JACKSON explains, this case is unlikely to present a live controversy for much longer regardless of petitioners’ standing, as the administration is likely to withdraw the challenged rules. I would simply have vacated the case and remanded it to the D.C. Circuit to reconsider its redressability analysis, keeping in mind the now corrected timeline for the challenged vehicle-emissions programs.”

— Justice Sonia Sotomayor, dissenting

“In my view, we should have either denied certiorari outright or held this matter in abeyance pending EPA‘s reconsideration of its waiver grant. Barring that, we should have simply vacated and remanded for the D. C. Circuit to reconsider its ruling on a clarified factual record.…",https://rilawyersweekly.com/files/2022/03/image_2022_03_25T10_21_29_846Z.png,N,,2025-06-21 13:10:44.115856

Published by Canary Media, Renewable Energy World Floodlight is a nonprofit newsroom that investigates the powers stalling climate action.","Republicans and Democrats alike are less likely to support renewable energy than they were five years ago, according to a survey released June 5 by the Pew Research Center. Floodlight examines the survey results, which mirror growing pockets of opposition to solar farms, reignited political support for coal plants and moves by President Donald Trump and congressional Republicans to kill federally funded clean energy projects.

This shift in opinion dates back to when Democratic President Joe Biden took office, said Brian Kennedy, Pew senior researcher and one of the study’s authors. “This isn’t a new trend,” he said.

Still, Kenneth Gillingham, professor of environmental and energy economics at the Yale School of the Environment, was surprised.

“I see this shift … as a successful effort to link climate change and renewable energy to broader culture war issues,” Gillingham said. He added that in the past, “prominent” Republicans supported renewables and sought solutions to climate change, but those stances could now be seen as “disloyal” to Trump.

Pew Research Center

The survey of 5,085 U.S. adults taken April 28 to May 4 revealed that while 79% of Americans favored expanding wind and solar production in 2020, that number has dropped to 60%. And 39% of Americans today support expansion of oil, coal and natural gas — almost double the 20% that supported it in 2020.

Combustion of fossil fuels — in transportation, energy generation and industrial production — is the No. 1 cause of climate change.

Much of the change in opinion is driven by Republicans, whose support of oil and gas grew from 35% in 2020 to 67% today. But Democrats also indicated less support for renewable energy and more for fossil fuels than five years ago.

While many results reflect Trump's policies opposing most renewables and boosting fossil fuels, Pew found a few notable exceptions: 69% of all respondents favor offshore wind — a technology Trump has specifically targeted.

Both Democrats and Republicans indicated stronger support for nuclear power, with Republicans' favorable opinions increasing from 53% in 2020 to 69% in 2025. Democrats' support rose from 37% to 52%. The Trump administration has signaled support for a nuclear renaissance, despite its high cost.

There were wide partisan splits on several topics. In March, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency announced it would scale back environmental regulations. Pew asked whether it was possible to do that and still protect air and water quality: 77% of Republicans said yes and 67% of Democrats said no.

Pew didn’t ask the respondents why their attitudes have shifted. But Kennedy said in Pew’s past surveys, Republicans have expressed concern about the economic impacts of climate change policies and transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy sources.

Mike Murphy, a Republican consultant and electric vehicle backer, said when the environmental benefits of clean technologies are touted, it polarizes Republicans. Instead, Murphy said messages should be about pocketbook issues — like lower fuel costs — and jobs.

“It's hard for pro-climate people to understand,” said Murphy, who has advised dozens of state and national GOP campaigns including John McCain’s 2008 presidential bid. “(They think) we just need to shout louder and hit people over the head about climate, climate, climate. The key is you want to talk about jobs and national security and other events that naturally resonate a lot more with right-of-center people.”

That's what Murphy's groups, the EV Politics Project and the American EV Jobs Alliance, are trying to do to depoliticize electric vehicles. ""Whenever electric cars are seen through a climate lens,"" Murphy said, ""their appeal narrows.""

It's a strategy also being used by the Electrification Coalition, a left-of-center pro-EV group. Ben Prochazka, the coalition's executive director, echoed Murphy's strategy, adding that EVs have ""become overly politicized and caught in the culture wars, impacting markets and ultimately hurting our ability to realize their many benefits for all Americans.""

Prochazka noted that once introduced to EVs, consumers support them: ""EV drivers love their vehicles, with more than eight out of ten reporting that their next car will also be electric.""

Pew Research Center

Perhaps those practical messages are getting through. In the Pew survey, electric vehicles were the one item that saw an uptick in support — 4 percentage points in the past year.

But popular support might not be enough to stop Congress from killing a $7,500 electric vehicle credit, which Murphy said would be “policy disaster.”

Republicans, he said, are in a “real squeeze,” because “they don’t have enough money for the tax cuts the president has promised.”

Murphy said: “It’s easier for Republicans to cut Biden electric cars … than it is for them to cut more Medicaid.”

Gillingham is still optimistic that solar, wind and other greenhouse gas-reducing technologies will move forward — because they are the cheapest.

“The continued decline in the price of renewable energy and battery technologies, as well as other new technologies, is a reason to continue to have hope that the worst impacts of climate change can be addressed,” he said.
